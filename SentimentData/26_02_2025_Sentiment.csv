As these costs escalate, alternatives like Stacks and BitTorrent are transforming digital commerce with their decentralized technologies. Stacks adds smart contract capabilities to Bitcoin, enabling financial applications without modifying its core structure, and BitTorrent offers efficient peer-to-peer file sharing powered by blockchain incentives. However, for online sales, Web3Bay emerges prominently by cutting out intermediaries and slashing transaction fees. With the security of smart contracts and sellers retaining a larger share of their profits, Web3Bay is carving out a space as a formidable contender to fee-intensive platforms like eBay. eBay Fees Are Too High – Here’s Why Sellers Are Turning to Web3Bay As platforms like eBay and Amazon hike their fees, online sellers are in search of cheaper alternatives. Between listing fees, final value fees, and payment processing charges, sellers are parting with a substantial portion of their profits. In response, Web3Bay offers an appealing solution by removing intermediaries and facilitating direct peer-to-peer transactions via blockchain. This shift is attractive to many sellers because of the potential for lower costs and increased control. eBay can take up to 15% in fees per sale, not including additional charges from payment processors like PayPal or credit cards. In contrast, Web3Bay eliminates these costs, allowing sellers to keep more of what they earn. Moreover, smart contracts on Web3Bay provide secure transactions without the need for centralized oversight, reducing the likelihood of chargebacks and disputes. The market reaction is telling; Web3Bay has successfully raised over $1.5 million in its presale, now in Stage 4, with over 375 million 3BAY tokens sold at $0.00456 each. This traction is seen as a sign that online selling is ripe for decentralization—a fairer setup free from exorbitant platform fees. With its growing popularity, Web3Bay could soon replace eBay as the preferred online transaction platform. Stacks: Boosting Bitcoin with Smart Contract Capabilities Launched initially in 2017 as Blockstack, Stacks was developed to introduce smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) to Bitcoin. Distinguished by its Proof of Transfer (PoX) mechanism, Stacks secures its operations through Bitcoin without needing to alter the primary network. The Nakamoto upgrade in April 2024 further enhanced transaction speeds and finality, encouraging wider adoption. By February 2025, Stacks had achieved significant growth, with the Grayscale Stacks Trust managing assets close to $1.57 million. The anticipated sBTC Cap-2 launch on February 25, 2025, is set to broaden Bitcoin’s financial applications. Currently, STX trades at around $0.901, demonstrating stability and potential for gradual appreciation. Projects like ALEXLabBTC and VelarBTC contribute to the ecosystem’s expansion by providing rewards and incentives. As Stacks continues to evolve, its deep integration with Bitcoin solidifies its role as a pivotal player in decentralized finance, attracting both developers and investors. BitTorrent: Pioneering Decentralized File Sharing BitTorrent, established in 2001, dominated peer-to-peer file sharing long before TRON’s acquisition in 2018 and the subsequent introduction of the BitTorrent Token (BTT) in 2019, which incentivizes network participation. Recently, BTT was listed on HashKey Global on February 19, 2025, enhancing its liquidity and market presence. Trading at about $0.000000849, the token experiences slight fluctuations but holds promise for growth, with forecasts suggesting a potential increase to $0.00000206 by the end of 2025. Despite the challenges of market volatility, BitTorrent’s ongoing integration with TRON and blockchain-based solutions continues to bolster its utility, maintaining its status as a significant entity in decentralized data sharing. This ensures efficient and secure file transfers, drawing more users and investors into BitTorrent’s ecosystem. Key Insights! As the trend in online commerce leans towards decentralized solutions, sellers are reconsidering their dependency on platforms like eBay. Stacks is expanding the utility of Bitcoin through smart contracts, and BitTorrent is advancing the scope of decentralized file sharing. However, in the realm of reducing costs and enhancing profit margins, Web3Bay stands out as a practical alternative. By eliminating excessive fees and facilitating direct transactions, Web3Bay offers sellers more autonomy over their financial outcomes.

Among the top picks is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Now in Phase 2 of its presale, Mutuum Finance is giving investors an early-bird opportunity to invest in the project at $0.015. MUTM has raised over $1.3 million, attracting more than 2,560 holders in record time. The momentum is unstoppable, thanks to its game-changing lending protocol and an upcoming 33.33% price hike to $0.02 that has created massive FOMO. The token is set to launch at $0.06 after 11 presale stages, rewarding phase 2 investors with a 300% ROI. If the 39x prediction holds true, MUTM could hit $2.42 in the next bull run. Mutuum Finance: Redefining DeFi Lending As XRP faces price volatility, Mutuum Finance is rising as a better alternative for investors. The platform is revolutionizing decentralized finance with its advanced dual-lending system, integrating both Peer-to-Contract (P2P) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model utilizes smart contracts to manage lending pools, enabling users to deposit stablecoins like USDT, while borrowers secure loans backed by crypto assets such as ETH. Meanwhile, the P2P model eliminates intermediaries, allowing borrowers and lenders to customize loan agreements with complete control over terms. This innovative hybrid approach enhances security, flexibility, and profitability, offering liquidity providers up to 10% APY. Beyond lending, Mutuum Finance is fostering an ecosystem where both lenders and borrowers benefit from seamless transactions, transparent protocols, and a user-centric experience. By eliminating unnecessary intermediaries, the platform not only reduces borrowing costs but also maximizes returns for liquidity providers. This ensures a more inclusive and sustainable financial ecosystem, making it a standout in the DeFi market. Designed for Security, Stability, and Growth Mutuum Finance is committed to transparency and security, undergoing extensive third-party audits and utilizing open-source smart contracts. To ensure long-term stability, the platform is set to introduce a USD-pegged stablecoin and implement a buyback mechanism funded by platform fees to support price appreciation. Additionally, staking rewards incentivize long-term holders, strengthening confidence in the ecosystem. Momentum is rapidly building, with over 2,560 investors already on board. Mutuum Finance is also implementing advanced risk management protocols to safeguard users’ assets. The combination of smart contract audits and innovative lending structures ensures a high level of reliability, making it an attractive option for both institutional and retail investors looking for stable, high-yield opportunities in DeFi. A Lucrative Early Investment Opportunity Phase 2 of the MUTM presale presents a prime opportunity to acquire tokens at $0.015. As the presale progresses through 11 price stages, the value will rise to $0.06 at launch, offering phase 2 investors up to 300% returns before public trading begins. Analysts project that MUTM could reach $1 post-launch, positioning it as one of 2025’s most promising DeFi tokens. Investors from phase 1 have already gained 50%, with more than $1,314,515 raised. Mutuum Finance’s structured roadmap and strategic development efforts further solidify its long-term potential. With a dedicated team focused on innovation and scalability, the platform is set to evolve beyond lending, incorporating features such as multi-chain compatibility. This positions MUTM as a multifaceted DeFi powerhouse with vast growth potential. $100,000 Giveaway & Community Rewards To drive adoption, Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 giveaway, with 10 winners set to receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens each. Additionally, a referral program rewards users who bring in new investors, further accelerating community-driven growth. Mutuum Finance is setting a new standard in DeFi lending with its innovative dual-lending model, robust security measures, and a rapidly growing community. As the presale moves through its stages and prices continue to rise, early investors have a rare opportunity to secure a significant position before MUTM enters public trading. With analysts predicting a potential 39x post-launch surge, those who act now could see exponential returns in the next bull cycle. Don’t miss out on this game-changing opportunity to invest in Mutuum Finance today and be part of the next big DeFi project.

While ADA battles to regain momentum, PropiChain (PCHAIN) , is gaining traction, drawing attention with its groundbreaking fusion of blockchain and real estate. As traditional crypto assets face challenges, PropiChain presents a fresh opportunity, offering real-world utility and significant growth potential. So why is the Cardano price movement currently on a slow recovery and why is PCHAIN considered the perfect alternative? Cardano Price Tug-of-War: Breakout or Breakdown? The Cardano price slow recovery has caught the attention of analysts, with a recent technical forecast suggesting a potential 24% price swing in the near term. According to analyst Ali Martinez, the Cardano price action is currently confined within a critical range of $0.74 to $0.83. A breakout above $0.83 could push the Cardano price beyond the psychologically significant $1 mark, signaling a renewed bullish trend. However, failure to hold above $0.74 might trigger a deeper retracement to $0.56, reinforcing the asset’s ongoing volatility. Despite its struggle to reclaim previous highs, Cardano has shown resilience, recently climbing to $0.79 with modest gains. Market sentiment has been cautiously optimistic, fueled by renewed interest in crypto ETFs and broader institutional involvement. While the recovery remains slow, analysts highlight the importance of these key technical levels in determining ADA’s next major move. Investors now await a decisive breakout that could set the tone for the Cardano price trajectory in the coming months. PropiChain (PCHAIN): The Blockchain Revolution in Real Estate As investors seek opportunities against the Cardano price movements, PropiChain (PCHAIN) has emerged as a compelling alternative. PropiChain is rapidly gaining traction by offering something the crypto space has long needed, real-world utility. The real estate market has long been plagued by inefficiencies, from slow transactions to high entry barriers and complex legal structures. PropiChain addresses these challenges through a decentralized real estate marketplace that enables anyone to invest in prime properties via tokenization. Converting physical real estate assets into digital tokens, PropiChain opens up investment opportunities that were once exclusive to institutions. Instead of requiring substantial upfront capital, investors can now buy fractional shares, democratizing access to high-value properties. What sets PropiChain apart is its integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and smart contracts, streamlining property transactions and improving market transparency. AI-driven analysis provides real-time insights and predictive valuations, reducing speculation while ensuring data-driven investment decisions. Smart contracts automate leasing agreements, rental payments, and asset transfers, cutting transaction times from weeks to mere minutes. Beyond the physical property market, PropiChain is venturing into the metaverse through its PropiVerse initiative. This expansion allows users to explore virtual properties and invest in digital real estate, bridging the gap between traditional and Web3-driven property ownership. With the rapid acceleration of Web3 adoption, PropiChain is positioning itself at the forefront of a real estate revolution that blends physical and digital asset ownership. Security is a cornerstone of PropiChain’s ecosystem. The platform has undergone rigorous audits by BlockAudit , a globally recognized blockchain security firm, ensuring the integrity of its smart contracts and transaction framework. Additionally, its listing on CoinMarketCap has further cemented investor confidence, distinguishing it from the many unverified DeFi projects in the space. PropiChain Presale: 200x ROI Potential Draws Investor Attention PropiChain’s presale has become a hotbed of early adopters looking to capitalize on its potential. Currently, PCHAIN is priced at just $0.01, with upcoming rounds set to increase to $0.023 and a launch price of $0.032. Investors who enter at this stage could see gains of up to 700% before public trading even begins. Market analysts have projected an astonishing surge for PCHAIN , with forecasts suggesting a potential climb to $8 per token: a staggering 2,000% return. A modest $1,000 investment at presale prices could transform into $20,000, surpassing the historic returns seen in last year’s Cardano price action. Beyond price appreciation, PropiChain offers additional incentives, including staking rewards of up to 225% APY, governance rights, and lending opportunities using PCHAIN as collateral. As traditional real estate investors and crypto enthusiasts alike take notice, PropiChain is emerging as a dominant player in the evolving landscape of blockchain-powered property investment. With the time on the presale running fast, now is the perfect time to shift to PCHAIN to register massive returns compared to the Cardano price stagnation.

Many of the most popular memecoin projects launched in 2025 are based on the Solana blockchain, greatly improving the value of the platform’s token. However, many within the crypto space have begun to raise questions about the volatility of the memecoin market and its adverse effects on the general crypto market. Meanwhile, Solana is being looked at as a key facilitator of the recent memecoin popularity surge. As a result, savvy investors have begun shifting focus towards PropiChain (PCHAIN) , a platform that embodies long-term growth and stability. PropiChain (PCHAIN) is making major moves toward transforming the real estate industry by leveraging AI and Metaverse technologies. The platform utilizes tokenized fractional ownership to open up the real estate market to a global audience. With investor interest growing during its ongoing token presale, PropiChain is clearly considered a major alternative investment to Solana. Market Uncertainty Raises Questions About Solana’s Potential Solana has divided opinions in the crypto market, with very interesting signs for future growth closely followed by questions surrounding the platform’s memecoin support. The SEC is currently evaluating multiple Solana ETF applications, with results anticipated towards the end of the year. Successful filings could see huge growth for the Solana token, whereas SEC rejections may be detrimental to Solana’s perceived potential. However, memecoin volatility has been a hot topic in crypto, with many shining a limelight on Solana’s involvement. The recent collapse of the LIBRA token added fuel to the fire, with traders losing billions as a result. Following this event, Solana’s reputation took a major hit, leading investors to consider more stable alternatives. The company’s price has dropped 36.53% to $167.41 , while its market cap is down 3.55% to $81.81B . Consequently, traders have begun moving toward PropiChain (PCHAIN), the platform aiming to solve persistent issues in the real estate market. The decentralized blockchain is built on detailed tokenomics that ensure the long-term stability of the token. Top crypto investors are jumping on board the PCHAIN train with token prices at an incredibly affordable rate. Innovative Features Propelling PropiChain past Solana PropiChain has made waves in the crypto market, and its AI-powered features are seen as the platform’s headline act. PropiChain leverages AI to deliver real-time, personalized property valuation, market analysis, and investment opportunities. The platform allows even newbie investors to get their hands on the most accurate market data from highly reliable sources. Meanwhile, the strive for a global real estate market is moving ever closer with PropiChain’s Metaverse integration, which allows users to explore properties from anywhere in the world. With this technology, a global investor can view, negotiate for, and customize U.S. properties without ever needing to be physically present. This feature also exponentially increases the buyer pool for real estate property owners. Furthermore, fractional property ownership has been implemented, allowing small-scale investors to own a piece of a high-value property without needing to pay the full market price. This means that for as little as $1,000, coveted properties in the most popular locations, such as Los Angeles and New York, can easily be yours. Finally, PropiChain’s detailed smart contract architecture makes complex processes such as lease renewals and rent payments easy and transparent. Based on pre-agreed terms, leases can be automatically renewed without needing drawn-out negotiations and shady agents. Meanwhile, rents are paid swiftly from the tenant’s digital wallet and sent directly to the property owner. PropiChain Guarantees Big Rewards for Early Investors PropiChain users can have peace of mind knowing that their investments and personal data are always kept safe. The platform, especially its smart contracts architecture, has been carefully audited by BlockAudit , a leading security firm. This showcases PropiChain’s dedication to protecting its users’ information and maintaining the platform’s trustworthiness. On top of that, early investors in PropiChain will be delighted to discover platform advantages that go beyond just investment gains. These wonderful benefits include referral rewards, discounts on properties, exciting staking opportunities, governance rights, and a variety of other perks. After an entry on CoinMarketCap hinted at possible PCHAIN listings on other major crypto exchanges, analysts anticipate that returns following the listing might soar to 800%. This implies that a $1,000 investment could yield profits exceeding $80,000 in no time. The PCHAIN Presale is the Biggest of the Year – Don’t Miss the Ride! The PropiChain token is currently priced at $0.011, expected to increase to $0.023 during the third presale phase, with a future listing price of $0.032.

This will provide more investment options for people interested in cryptocurrency. Polkadot is a blockchain network that allows different blockchains to work together. It has been steadily growing, and its cryptocurrency, DOT, has a market value of about $6.6 billion. Interestingly, the Grayscale Spot Polkadot ETF filing has already changed the market, with DOT rising by 4% after the announcement. This indicates that investors believe there will be more demand for Polkadot if the ETF gets approved. If approved by the SEC, the Grayscale Spot Polkadot ETF would join the list of cryptocurrency ETFs, giving investors a safe way to invest in digital currencies without directly owning the assets. Nasdaq File for CoinShares XRP and Litecoin ETFs Meanwhile, Nasdaq submitted 19b-4 forms to the SEC to launch CoinShares’ XRP and Litecoin ETFs , earlier in the month. These steps are also crucial for increasing the institutional use of digital assets and giving investors an easier way to invest in two popular cryptocurrencies, The SEC will review these filings to ensure they meet U.S. securities laws. If the SEC approves them, CoinShares’ XRP and Litecoin ETFs could pave the way for other cryptocurrency ETFs. This could also help connect traditional financial markets with the fast-changing world of digital assets.

In a new post to the social media platform X, Ardoino makes his argument for why USDT is the “most successful tool” for the US dollar maintaining its hegemony. “Tether built, over the last decade, the widest physical and digital distribution network, spacing from thousands of kiosks in Africa and South America to digital remittances platforms, from payment backbones to institutional tools. Every single day our teams and portfolio companies are with their boots on the ground in countless areas within developing countries, helping communities and growing utilization, trust and education into USDT and by reflection into the US economy.” Ardoino notes that USDT is held by more than 400 million people, growing at a pace of 35 million new wallets per quarter, or 140 million new wallets per year. He also says USDT is doing especially well in developing countries. Tether’s success, says Ardoino, has come at the price of a target on their back. “While our competitors’ business model should be to build a better product and even bigger distribution network, their real intent is ‘Kill Tether.’ Every single business or political meeting that they have culminates with this intent. While might seem an overstatement, it’s a fact and it’s being reported independently by hundreds of people inside and outside the digital assets industry in touch with the US administration.” The CEO frames any competitors’ attacks on the stablecoin firm as an attack on the sovereignty of the US dollar. And according to Ardoino, Tether is the 18th largest US dollar holder by the size of US treasuries.

Imagine robots building robots – it’s no longer science fiction! Apptronik’s latest collaboration with manufacturing giant Jabil marks a significant stride in this direction, just weeks after securing a massive $350 million funding round to ramp up production of their flagship Apollo robot. But what does this mean for the future of robotics and automation? Let’s dive in and explore this fascinating development. Why is Apptronik’s Jabil Partnership a Game Changer for Humanoid Robots? Following closely on the heels of a March 2024 pilot program with Mercedes-Benz, Apptronik’s deal with Jabil signifies a doubling down on real-world testing and, crucially, manufacturing collaboration. While the Mercedes-Benz partnership is still in the pilot phase, the Jabil agreement goes a step further. Beyond deploying humanoid robots on Jabil’s factory floors for assessment, this partnership is designed to evolve into a full-fledged manufacturing alliance. Here’s the exciting part: once Apptronik’s Apollo robot proves its commercial viability within Jabil’s operations, Jabil will transition into a manufacturing partner, producing Apollo robots directly within their own factories. This sets the stage for a potentially revolutionary outcome – humanoid robots contributing to the creation of… more humanoid robots ! It’s a cyclical vision that could dramatically accelerate the growth and adoption of humanoid robotics across industries. What Tasks Will Apollo Humanoid Robots Perform at Jabil? For now, Apptronik is keeping specific deployment numbers under wraps. However, they’ve indicated that the pilot phase will involve an undisclosed number of Apollo systems tackling “simple, repetitive intralogistics and manufacturing tasks” within Jabil’s facilities. These tasks include: Sorting Parts: Precisely categorizing and organizing components within the manufacturing environment. Transporting Materials: Moving parts and materials efficiently across the factory floor, streamlining workflows. This real-world validation is critical. Each task Apollo successfully completes on Jabil’s factory floor brings it closer to proving its worth in large-scale manufacturing . The better Apollo performs, the faster it can transition from pilot project to an integral part of a production line – potentially one that will eventually produce more Apollos. The Race for Humanoid Robotics Leadership: Who are Apptronik’s Competitors? Apptronik is not alone in the quest to bring humanoid robots into industrial settings. They are part of a dynamic and competitive field that includes other notable companies like: Agility Robotics: A key player, and notably, the only one among the frontrunners to have moved beyond pilot phases with their robot deployments. Boston Dynamics: Famous for their advanced and dynamic robots, though their industrial applications are still developing. Figure: A well-funded startup rapidly making strides in humanoid robot development. Tesla: Leveraging its automotive and AI expertise to develop Optimus, their own humanoid robot project. While competition is fierce in this nascent robotics category, Apptronik possesses several advantages. Their substantial funding is a major boost, but so is their deep-rooted experience. Originating as a spin-off from the University of Texas, Apptronik boasts a decade of expertise in humanoid robotics , including their involvement with NASA’s Valkyrie robot project. This legacy provides a strong foundation of knowledge and technical skill. The Power of AI in Apptronik’s Humanoid Robots Adding another layer of sophistication to their approach, Apptronik announced a significant partnership with Google DeepMind in December. This collaboration focuses on developing advanced AI specifically tailored for humanoid systems. Integrating cutting-edge AI is crucial for enabling humanoid robots to perform complex tasks, adapt to dynamic environments, and ultimately, work alongside humans more effectively. By embedding sophisticated AI , Apptronik aims to create humanoid robots that are not just physically capable but also intelligent and adaptable – essential qualities for thriving in the diverse and often unpredictable world of manufacturing . What’s the Timeline for Self-Manufacturing Humanoid Robots? The vision of humanoid robots building themselves is undeniably compelling, but Apptronik emphasizes that it’s still a future prospect. The company is targeting 2026 as the year they plan to begin commercial manufacturing of Apollo robots. The Jabil partnership is a critical stepping stone in making this timeline a reality. The pilot programs and the subsequent manufacturing collaboration with Jabil are all geared towards rigorous testing, refinement, and scaling up production. The path to humanoid robots autonomously contributing to their own manufacturing process is iterative, requiring careful validation at each stage. However, Apptronik ‘s strategic partnerships and technological advancements are clearly laying the groundwork for this exciting future. Key Takeaways: Apptronik, Jabil, and the Future of Robotics Manufacturing Let’s recap the key points of this exciting development: Strategic Partnership: Apptronik partners with Jabil, a manufacturing powerhouse, for pilot testing and future robot production. Self-Manufacturing Vision: The ultimate goal is for Apollo humanoid robots to participate in their own manufacturing . Real-World Validation: Apollo robots will perform practical tasks at Jabil facilities to prove their capabilities in manufacturing environments. Competitive Landscape: Apptronik is a strong contender in the humanoid robotics race, backed by funding, experience, and AI expertise. Timeline to Commercialization: Apptronik aims to begin commercial manufacturing of Apollo robots by 2026.

Table of Contents Rollblock: The gaming platform set on disrupting the industry Cardano developers work on on-chain upgrades Solana loses 36% after meme launch scandals Conclusion The crypto market is firing again on all cylinders, and investors are scouring the charts for the next big opportunity. While Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) remain popular plays, traders have recently been shifting to the transformative casino Rollblock (RBLK). Analysts predict a potential 50x rally for Rollblock, making it a must-watch token for savvy investors in 2025. Rollblock: The gaming platform set on disrupting the industry Rollblock is shaking up the online gaming sector with its fully transparent, blockchain-powered ecosystem. December saw an incredible 600% surge in new users and $1.75 million in wagered bids being placed. The gaming platform is currently live and generating massive revenue, with over 7,000 games and the launch of a new sports prediction league. The process of onboarding recently got even easier thanks to its integration of Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Mastercard to enable fiat deposits. Rollblock securely encrypts all of its user transactions onto the Ethereum blockchain to ensure that everything is fully verifiable and that there can be no hint of bet manipulation. What really makes Rollblock unique is its deflationary revenue-sharing model. The platform takes up to 30% of its revenue to buy back RBLK tokens on the open market, with 60% of these tokens burned forever and 40% distributed as staking rewards that offer up to 30% APY for holders. With a string of major exchange listings on the horizon in the coming months, stage 10 tokens are selling fast at $0.06. Investors can also take advantage of a limited-time 50% bonus on all RBLK purchases this week. You might also like: Is Solana heading back below $100? Why XRP, RBLK could be better alternatives Cardano developers work on on-chain upgrades Cardano has fallen by 7.63% the past week, currently trading at $0.6907. This brings Cardano’s monthly candle to a woeful 28.70% decline as the crypto was unable to hold its price above $1 in recent weeks. Despite this disappointing price performance, Cardano has continued to innovate and its upcoming Ouroboros Leios upgrade will introduce high frequency blocks and enhance the chain’s scalability and speed. Founder Charles Hoskinson has stressed that developers are working around the clock to ensure a successful launch, which could prepare the price of Cardano to reach as high as $3 in the coming months. Solana loses 36% after meme launch scandals Solana has also faced challenging trading conditions recently, falling by 14% this week to reach $145.50. In the past month, Solana is down by a worrying 40.46% as huge numbers of long-term holders have been selling following the recent scandal around insider trading. Meme coin launches on Solana, including Melania and Libra, were the victims of sniper bots enabled by the teams responsible for launching the tokens. While the dust settles on this controversy, Solana could well retest the resistance at $150. Conclusion While Cardano and Solana continue to battle downward momentum, Rollblock offers an alternative, with investors jumping in before the next price jump.

With institutional adoption rising, on-chain activity booming, and Bitcoin showing signs of strength, the stage is set for massive gains. But the real question is: which cryptos have the potential to skyrocket? While many tokens will pump, only a few will deliver long-term value, real-world adoption, and game-changing utility. The opportunity to invest early in the next best crypto before the market explodes is now. One of the biggest names making waves in the space is Qubetics ($TICS), an innovative blockchain project designed for real-world use cases. It’s changing the game with its Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet, a Web3 solution that simplifies asset management across multiple blockchains. But Qubetics isn’t the only one to watch. Other top contenders, like Injective, Arweave, Stacks, and Chainlink, are also positioned for exponential growth. Let’s dive into why these cryptos are poised to dominate the next bull run. 1. Qubetics ($TICS): The Web3 Aggregator with a Game-Changing Wallet Managing digital assets across multiple blockchains is a nightmare for most users. High fees, slow transactions, and the hassle of juggling different wallets make crypto adoption difficult. Qubetics aims to solve this problem with its Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet, a next-gen solution that seamlessly connects users to leading blockchains. This Web3-powered wallet offers a single interface to store, send, and receive assets across Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain, and more—eliminating the need for multiple apps. For businesses, this technology is a game-changer. Imagine an e-commerce company accepting crypto payments from various blockchains without dealing with complicated integrations. With Qubetics, transactions settle instantly, reducing costs and increasing efficiency. For freelancers, handling payments in different cryptocurrencies becomes effortless, ensuring fast, secure transfers without relying on centralized platforms. Even everyday users benefit from having full control of their assets without security risks from third-party custodians. Qubetics isn’t just another crypto project—it’s the world’s first Web3 aggregator uniting major blockchains. This innovation brings unmatched accessibility and financial freedom to users, making it a key player in the next bull run. But what truly makes Qubetics stand out is its ongoing best crypto presale, offering early investors a chance to secure $TICS before it surges in value. Currently in its 23rd presale stage, Qubetics has already raised over $14.1 million, with 489 million $TICS tokens sold and 21,300+ holders. The presale follows a strict 7-day stage structure, with a 10% price increase every Sunday at 12 AM. Right now, $TICS is priced at $0.0888, but once the presale ends, projections show massive returns. If $TICS reaches $0.25, investors will see a 181.52% ROI. At $1, returns skyrocket to 1026.08%, while a $5 target pushes ROI to 5530.44%. And for those who hold until the Q2 2025 mainnet launch, hitting $10 or $15 means life-changing gains of 11160.88% and 16791.32% respectively. For example, a $100 investment at the current price would yield 1,238.70 $TICS tokens. If $TICS reaches $1, that $100 turns into $1,026. At $10, it becomes $11,160, and at $15, it explodes to $16,791. With this kind of upside, Qubetics isn’t just another crypto—it’s an opportunity that serious investors can’t afford to miss. Why This Coin Made it to This List: Qubetics isn’t just another presale token; it’s a disruptive Web3 aggregator with real-world utility. With a presale structure that rewards early adopters, this is easily one of the next best crypto projects set to explode before the bull run. 2. Injective (INJ): The Future of DeFi and Interoperability Injective is revolutionizing decentralized finance (DeFi) by offering a lightning-fast, fully decentralized exchange protocol. Unlike traditional DeFi platforms, Injective provides zero gas fees, ultra-low latency, and full interoperability across blockchains. With support for Ethereum, Cosmos, and Solana, this protocol enables seamless cross-chain trading while eliminating front-running issues that plague centralized exchanges. Recent upgrades, like the Injective v2 release, have strengthened its ecosystem by introducing layer-2 scaling and institutional-grade security. Additionally, its integration with Cosmos’ Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) framework allows assets to move fluidly across networks, unlocking a new era of DeFi usability. As global interest in decentralized trading and derivatives grows, Injective is positioned as a dominant force in the space. Why This Coin Made it to This List: With next-gen DeFi solutions and unmatched cross-chain capabilities, Injective is set to capture a massive market share when the bull run ignites. 3. Arweave (AR): The Backbone of Permanent Decentralized Storage In an era where data permanence is more crucial than ever, Arweave delivers a decentralized solution for storing information forever. Unlike traditional cloud storage providers that charge recurring fees, Arweave enables users to pay once for lifetime storage. This makes it a perfect fit for NFTs, legal documents, and blockchain archives. Recent partnerships, including collaborations with Solana and Ethereum, have strengthened its adoption. Developers are increasingly integrating Arweave into Web3 applications, ensuring that critical data remains immutable and accessible. As decentralized storage becomes a key component of blockchain infrastructure, Arweave stands at the forefront of this revolution. Why This Coin Made it to This List: The demand for permanent, censorship-resistant storage is surging, making Arweave an essential blockchain layer for Web3 innovation. 4. Stacks (STX): Bringing Smart Contracts to Bitcoin Stacks is redefining Bitcoin’s role in the blockchain space by introducing smart contracts and DeFi applications to the world’s largest cryptocurrency. While Bitcoin has always been the most secure network, it lacked programmability—until Stacks changed the game. Stacks’ Clarity smart contract language enables developers to build dApps directly on Bitcoin while benefiting from its unmatched security. The recent launch of sBTC (synthetic Bitcoin) is further fueling the adoption of Bitcoin-based DeFi. With institutional money flowing into Bitcoin at record levels, Stacks is well-positioned to capitalize on this growing demand. Why This Coin Made it to This List: As Bitcoin adoption accelerates, Stacks is unlocking its true potential by enabling smart contracts and DeFi within its ecosystem. 5. Chainlink (LINK): The Bridge Between Blockchain and the Real World Chainlink remains the gold standard for decentralized oracles, enabling smart contracts to securely interact with real-world data. From DeFi to insurance and supply chain management, its oracle services power some of the biggest blockchain applications. Recent partnerships, including integrations with SWIFT, major banks, and enterprises, have cemented its dominance in the space. With Chainlink staking gaining traction, LINK holders now benefit from additional utility and passive income opportunities. As blockchain adoption continues to expand, Chainlink will be the go-to solution for reliable off-chain data feeds. Why This Coin Made it to This List: No blockchain project can function at scale without trusted oracle services, and Chainlink remains the undisputed leader in this field. The Final Call Before the Bull Run The crypto market is primed for its next explosion, and picking the right projects before the surge is crucial. Qubetics, Injective, Arweave, Stacks, and Chainlink each bring something unique to the table, making them the next best crypto contenders for massive growth. With Qubetics offering a best crypto presale that rewards early investors, the window to join this crypto presale is closing fast.

The Bybit hack is said to have been perpetuated by the same group of North Korean-backed hackers responsible for the $620 million Ronin Network exploit in 2022. Now, the crypto exchange has gone on the offensive to deal with the group as best as it can, at least until law enforcement comes up with a more permanent solution. Bybit introduces the Lazarus Bounty platform Bybit’s Lazarus Bounty platform , named after the infamous North Korean hacking group believed to be responsible for the breach, is its latest effort to retrieve the cryptocurrency it lost. The North Korean hacking group was linked to the crime by popular blockchain investigator, ZachXBT. Arkham made a post on its X account stating that ZachXBT had “submitted definitive proof” linking the Lazarus group to the attack. The submission was shared with the Bybit team to aid their investigation into the matter. The Lazarus Group has a documented history of targeting cryptocurrency platforms and pulling off large scale heists. The group has been involved in other high profile incidents including the $620 million theft from the Ronin Network in March 2022 and a $41 million theft from Stake.com in September 2023. The methods and scale of these attacks have similar patterns with that of the Bybit incident, giving even more validity to ZachXBT’s accusation. Arkham continued to monitor the activity of the hacker’s account across the cryptocurrency network. “The Bybit Hacker is making 2-3 transactions per minute, and stops every 45 minutes for a 15 minute break. They move ETH from one address at a time, before moving onto the next one,” the blockchain data tracking platform said. On-chain sleuths continue to track the Bybit hacker’s transactions. Source: Arkham Intelligence . Bybit built the Lazarus bounty platform in two days due to the urgency of the situation. Ben Zhou, Bybit’s CEO, mentioned on X that a newer version of the site will be released soon as it makes more improvements to make the site look and function better. He also stated his openness to suggestions and feedback. We only pre entered some of your findings , which might not be full, if you have more, please help to submit a bounty on the site, or send to me through dm, really appreciate your help all the way. We want to give you the full credits for your hard work. The site was built in 2… — Ben Zhou (@benbybit) February 25, 2025 The Lazarus bounty platform serves as a centralized hub for cybersecurity experts, blockchain analysts, and ethical hackers to collaborate on a global scale. Each of these individuals can come together through the platform to track and recover the stolen assets. There’s also the attractive 10% incentive that would make anyone willing to help. 10% of the stolen $1.4B would amount to a whopping $140M, the largest bounty in the history of cryptocurrency. The 10% is split 50:50 between individuals that successfully freeze the stolen funds and those who contribute by helping trace the funds. Individuals can become bounty hunters by connecting their wallets on the site and helping to trace the fund. When a submitted trace leads to some of the funds being frozen the 5% bounty is paid upfront. Bybit also introduced a blacklisted wallet API that provides a continuously updated list of wallet addresses identified as suspicious or associated with the hack, enabling security pros and other cryptocurrency platforms to monitor and or prevent transactions involving these addresses. The aftermath of the Bybit heist On February 21, 2025, Bybit experienced a security breach during a routine transfer from its cold wallet to a warm wallet. Hackers exploited this process, seizing control of the cold wallet and siphoning 401K ETH, valued at around $1.5B, to an unknown address. This incident is now recognized as the largest cryptocurrency heist in history. Despite the significant loss, Bybit’s CEO, Ben Zhou, reassured the platform’s users of the company’s solvency. He stated that all client assets remained backed 1:1 and that wallets unaffected by the security breach and withdrawals from the platform would continue to operate normally. Bybit is actively collaborating with blockchain forensic analysts to trace the stolen funds, and so far, the exchange has been successful in recovering some of the lost funds. The mETH, Mantle, and SEAL teams successfully recovered 15K cmETH tokens worth around $43M. First recovery in the ByBit hack. ~$43m (15,000 cmETH) has been clawed back from the hacker. I saw the recovery possibility soon after the hack and SEAL connected me with Mantle/mETH team who made it happen. Huge shoutout to SEAL, Mantle, and mETH teams for their quick action. — Mudit Gupta (@Mudit__Gupta) February 22, 2025 Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino announced that his company froze 181K USDT connected to the hack as well. Bybit has also introduced a bounty program to aid the recovery of the stolen funds. The exchange is offering up to 10% of the recovered amount to ethical hackers who assist in the retrieval of the stolen cryptocurrency. Security professionals monitoring the situation have received thousands of tips about the hack and the hacker’s efforts to split up the loot. Bybit is also working with law enforcement agencies in Singapore and is in discussions with the Ethereum Foundation about potential solutions. Several cybersecurity firms and blockchain security teams such as Mandiant, Verichain ZeroShadow, and Chainalysis, to name a few, joined in the effort to trace bad actors and prevent the hackers from laundering the funds. Crypto exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, and Bitget, along with blockchain networks including Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, and AVAX, are working to restrict the movement of the stolen assets. To prevent future security vulnerabilities and incidents, Bybit has committed to a comprehensive review and enhancement of its security infrastructure. This review entails implementing advanced authentication measures, conducting regular security audits, and educating its users on best practices to safeguard their assets.

Upbit Sanctions Under Fire The FIU’s ruling was a response to revelations that Upbit “supported a total of 44,948 virtual asset transfer transactions” with “19 unreported, overseas-based virtual asset business operators.” Per Seoul Daily and Newsway , the FIU’s order means that new Upbit customers will not be able to transfer or receive crypto in their wallets for the entire three-month period. The FIU will also follow up with fines, which will be finalized at a later date. Dunamu CEO Lee Seok-woo was also hit with a disciplinary warning, while the firm’s compliance and transaction reporting chiefs were forced to step down. Trading volumes on the Upbit crypto exchange over the past seven days. (Source: CoinGecko) Another eight employees were also hit with “disciplinary action.” But several unnamed crypto industry figures claimed that the move would only help Upbit to boost its profit margins and “cement its position as a monopoly .” The critics claimed that the sanctions would be “ineffective” as they only block new customers from transferring their crypto to third-party wallets or other exchanges. @Official_Upbit faces billions in fines for over 700,000 KYC violations as South Korea tightens its crypto regulations. #Upbit #FSC https://t.co/SZzYlT4ted — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 18, 2025 Could Sanctions Backfire? The measures do not stop Upbit from accepting new users, nor does it restrict their activities, provided they only buy or sell tokens on the Upbit platform. The sanctions also allow new Upbit users to make fiat KRW transactions, meaning that customers “can withdraw KRW and use it on another exchange.” As such, they added, “given that Upbit has over 70% of the domestic market share,” the sanctions “are unlikely to cause customers” to ditch their Upbit accounts in favor of a rival platform. The experts added that as most crypto exchange users value “convenience” above all, “customers who trade virtual assets are significantly less likely” to go through the hassle of moving their coins off the Upbit platform. As such, they continued, the sanctions would likely end up benefiting Upbit, rather than harming it. The experts said the measures would end up becoming “a means to prevent Upbit users from leaving the platform, rather than a sanction.” The headquarters of the South Korean Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). (Source: News Tomato/YouTube/Screenshot) Fines to Follow The sanctions are also unlikely to hit Upbit in the pocket, the critics added. They explained that forcing new customers to stay on the Upbit platform would help the exchange continue making money from commission fees. And the critics said that the restrictions could also create artificial coin price discrepancies on domestic platforms. They called for “symbolic fines” rather than “ineffective sanctions or disciplinary actions.” One of the unnamed insiders said: “Restricting transfers will only strengthen Upbit’s position as a monopoly. In the end, questions will likely be asked about the FIU’s sanctions.” However, the FIU could well follow up with heavy fines. A spokesperson for the regulator explained that the FIU had not yet reached a “final decision” on fines. The regulator said that it would make an announcement on fines after “future disciplinary hearing discussions.” In South Korea, self-service kiosks have been proliferating.

Since breaking its all-time high in January, SOL has retraced over 55%, leaving bulls struggling to regain momentum. The broader crypto market is facing a period of uncertainty, and Solana has been one of the hardest-hit altcoins in recent weeks. Related Reading: Litecoin Trading Activity Increases Over The Past Month – Potential LTC ETF Draws Speculation Bears have remained in control, consistently driving prices lower as investors lose confidence. The once-thriving meme coin speculation that fueled Solana’s rally has now turned into a major headwind, accelerating the selloff and preventing a stable recovery. Analysts believe further declines could be on the horizon, especially if SOL fails to reclaim key support levels. Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis on X, noting that Solana has broken below a crucial demand level, signaling increased risk of additional downside. According to Jelle, SOL’s current price structure suggests that bears still have control, and unless a strong bounce occurs soon, lower price targets could come into play. With market sentiment at extreme lows, all eyes are on Solana to see if it can stabilize or if further declines are inevitable. Solana As Market Turns Bearish Solana is trading below critical demand levels that previously sustained its long-term bullish structure. Bulls have lost control, and bears continue to dominate, pushing the entire market lower. Since reaching all-time highs in January, SOL has dropped over 55%, erasing months of gains and signaling extreme fear among investors. As selling pressure intensifies, Solana has become one of the hardest-hit altcoins, with meme coins suffering the most. The speculative frenzy that once fueled Solana’s surge has now turned into a major risk, with rug pulls and liquidity issues shaking investor confidence. Jelle’s analysis on X reveals that when he sold his SOL bags, he didn’t expect the price to drop this hard. He also notes that Solana has lost both monthly and weekly support levels, which could indicate further declines. The breakdown below these key demand zones has intensified bearish sentiment, making a recovery more difficult in the short term. The upcoming week will be crucial for Solana’s price action, as the market leans increasingly bearish. If SOL fails to reclaim lost support, it could face another wave of selling pressure, potentially pushing it into lower demand zones around the $140 mark. However, if bulls manage to regain control and push the price back above $185, it could trigger a short-term relief rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Serious Price Compression – What Happened Last Time With the broader market struggling and uncertainty rising, Solana’s next move will determine whether it can stabilize or continue its downward trajectory. Investors remain cautious as fear dominates sentiment, but some still believe in a potential recovery if market conditions improve. The coming days will be crucial in deciding Solana’s fate in this volatile market. Price Struggles To Hold $140 Solana is trading at $139 after a brutal selloff that saw the price drop over 22% since Sunday. The entire crypto market has been hit with extreme selling pressure, but SOL continues to struggle more than other altcoins. Bearish momentum remains strong, and bulls are finding it difficult to establish a clear support zone. If Solana can hold above the $140 mark, there is a chance of a short-term recovery. Bulls must step in and push the price above $150 to signal strength and prevent further downside. However, current sentiment remains weak, and any failure to reclaim lost levels could lead to further declines. If SOL loses $140, the next significant demand zone sits around the $125–$130 range. Breaking below this level would confirm a deeper correction, potentially pushing SOL into its lowest price since August 2024. Investors are growing cautious as market volatility increases, and Solana’s price action remains uncertain.

40838549,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=682672,1740527178,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40838549.jpeg,Elon Musk’s Europe meddling affects Tesla’s market,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/elon-europe-meddling-affects-teslas-market/,"Tesla’s sales in Europe collapsed by 45% in January, even as demand for electric vehicles surged across the continent, according to a report from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association. The Elon Musk-led company registered just 9,945 cars last month, down from 18,161 a year ago. The Association pointed out that Musk’s political involvement is becoming a problem for Tesla in Europe. Polls in Germany and the UK show that his support for far-right parties and attacks on political leaders are turning buyers away. Unlike the US, where Tesla’s brand is deeply tied to Musk’s influence, European consumers are less forgiving of his shenanigans. Though the sales slump isn’t just about politics. Tesla is revamping its Model Y production lines, which has led to inventory shortages in certain markets. That alone could explain part of the decline in registrations, but it doesn’t account for the fact that rival EV makers are thriving in the same conditions, said the Association. Tesla stock crashes after post-election surge fades Meanwhile, Tesla’s stock also plunged over 8% on Tuesday, wiping billions off its market value and dragging it below the $1 trillion mark, according to data from Google Finance. Tesla has now lost 25% of its value since the beginning of the year, making it one of the worst performers among major tech stocks. Clearly, investors aren’t buying Tesla’s rebound story anymore. After a brief rally following Donald Trump’s election victory, Tesla’s stock has erased all gains. The shares have plummeted 35% since December 16, while the Nasdaq is down just 1.5% in the same period. Musk’s personal wealth has taken a hit as well. His net worth has plunged by more than $100 billion, though he still holds the title of world’s richest person, with $380 billion to his name. Tesla’s China ambitions hit a wall TSLA’s latest slide was triggered by a Reuters report on Monday, which revealed that Tesla’s long-awaited “navigate on city streets” feature in China was a disappointment. Owners who tested the partially automated driving update found that it failed to meet Musk’s promises. The backlash piled onto Tesla’s growing list of challenges in China, where it is already struggling to keep up with local competitors. Musk’s battle to expand Tesla’s self-driving technology in China is at a standstill too, as the company has been unable to secure regulatory approval due to escalating trade tensions between China and the US. According to Musk, Chinese authorities won’t allow Tesla to move its training data out of the country, while the US has banned Tesla from processing that data inside China. That standoff has frozen Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) expansion in China, making it a bargaining chip in trade negotiations between Beijing and Washington. Tesla’s reliance on China is now a liability. China was once Tesla’s fastest-growing and most profitable foreign market, but now it’s slipping away. BYD has overtaken Tesla with a 35% market share in China, while Tesla’s share has shrunk to just 7%. The company’s Shanghai gigafactory, once seen as a breakthrough, has now helped Chinese competitors scale faster than Tesla expected. Tesla recalls over 376,000 vehicles over power steering failures As if falling sales and stock crashes weren’t enough, Tesla is now dealing with a massive recall in the US. The company is recalling 376,241 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles built between February 28, 2023, and October 11, 2023, according to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The recall is reportedly due to a critical flaw in Tesla’s power-assisted steering system. Tesla told regulators that printed circuit boards in affected vehicles can become overstressed, which can cause power steering to fail when a car stops and then accelerates again. The issue forces drivers to use extra force to steer, increasing the risk of accidents. Tesla claims there are no known crashes, injuries, or deaths related to the defect and says an over-the-air software update will fix it. But all in all, Tesla’s long-running battle with US regulators has taken a turn, thanks to Musk’s new role in the Trump administration. Trump recently appointed Musk to lead a team focused on shrinking the federal government workforce, which has already led to major cuts at the NHTSA—the very agency investigating Tesla’s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (Supervised) systems, a connection that Democratic critics like Senator Elizabeth Warren were quick to point out.

While cryptocurrencies like XRP and Dogecoin have transformed global payments and popularized online tipping, they fall short of addressing the escalating issue of chargeback fraud faced by e-commerce sellers. XRP excels in rapid, cost-effective transactions, and Dogecoin captivates with its community-driven approach. However, these platforms do not directly tackle the persistent headache of chargeback fraud. Enter Web3Bay with its innovative blockchain-based smart contract escrow system that secures payments until all transaction conditions are fulfilled, essentially nipping disputes in the bud. As digital currencies become more mainstream, Web3Bay is staking its claim as the go-to solution for secure, dispute-free transactions in the e-commerce space. Web3Bay’s Solution to Chargeback Fraud Chargeback fraud has been a thorn in the side of online merchants for too long, with traditional platforms like PayPal and Amazon often siding with buyers, resulting in sellers losing both product and payment. Web3Bay steps up with a blockchain-based smart contract escrow system that ensures transactions are final, secure, and free from disputes. Specifically, Web3Bay uses smart contracts to hold buyer payments until predetermined conditions are satisfied. Once a seller ships a product and the buyer confirms receipt, the funds are automatically released. If a dispute does arise, the blockchain ledger’s transparent, tamper-proof records provide a reliable defense against fraudulent claims. Unlike centralized platforms where buyers often have the upper hand in disputes, Web3Bay’s decentralized setup promotes fair resolutions based on indisputable data. With $1.5 million already raised in its ongoing presale and over 375 million coins sold at $0.00456 each, Web3Bay is demonstrating robust market confidence. As traditional e-commerce platforms grapple with fraud prevention, Web3Bay’s blockchain-powered strategy offers a dependable alternative for online sellers. XRP: A Journey Through Technological Advancements Launched by Ripple Labs in 2012, XRP was designed to facilitate quick, inexpensive international payments. Rather than relying on a traditional proof-of-work system, it uses a consensus protocol among a network of validators to verify transactions swiftly. As of February 19, 2025, XRP trades at $2.61, marking a dramatic increase from $0.5624 just a year ago—a whopping 364% jump. This surge has propelled XRP to become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, now estimated at around $143 billion. Moreover, early investors have seen substantial gains, especially following positive regulatory developments and growing financial sector adoption. The recent nod towards an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has further enhanced investor enthusiasm. Dogecoin: The Ascent from Meme to Marketable Asset Initiated in December 2013 by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer as a humorous project inspired by the “Doge” meme, Dogecoin has since evolved into a legitimate decentralized network that supports mining and transactions using a proof-of-work mechanism. As of February 19, 2025, Dogecoin’s price stands at $0.254001, up from $0.0894 the previous year, recording an impressive 184% increase. This growth has significantly boosted its market capitalization, reflecting its expanding acceptance and utilization in a variety of transactions. Early adopters have enjoyed robust returns as Dogecoin shifted from an internet gag to a widely recognized digital currency, buoyed by endorsements from high-profile figures and its integration across multiple platforms, adding to its popularity and value appreciation. Concluding Thoughts While XRP has carved a niche in facilitating speedy international payments and Dogecoin has built momentum through its vibrant community and widespread adoption, the challenge of chargeback fraud remains a significant concern for online sellers. Web3Bay differentiates itself with a blockchain-based escrow system that ensures definitive, transparent transactions. By eradicating fraudulent chargebacks and providing undeniable payment security, Web3Bay emerges as a compelling choice for e-commerce, offering the protection that sellers desperately need.

Ripple (XRP), and RCO Finance are the two altcoin giants that are being weighed by investors to determine the most bullish voice for long-term investment. RCO Finance checks all the marks with its distinct strengths and lasting contributions to the AI investment space. With so much to offer in terms of access to over 120,000 assets, an AI Robo Advisor, and much more, analysts believe that this project could outrun XRP this year. Here’s why RCO Finance could champion the race for the most bullish altcoin. Analysts Says XRP Gears Up For A Massive Move Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has shared an updated prediction for the trajectory of the XRP price. The analysts shared that due to the increased whale activity on the platform, there was an accumulation of over 20 million XRP within 24 hours. This whale movement hints at a possible rally for the XRP price given the increased investor interest. In response to the increased accumulation of XRP, Ali shared that XRP was prepared for a 14% price move . Additionally, the Ripple team recently shared that 25% of XRP would be held back to reduce circulation and boost its value. All these developments have positioned XRP as a key contender in the space following its bullish trajectory. However, RCOF steals the show because XRP’s bullish outlook hasn’t been reflected in its price due to its drop of over 7.3% within the last seven days. Why RCO Finance Emerges As A Top Choice For AI-Savvy Investors RCO Finance is an innovative AI platform designed to give investors access to top-notch investment strategies to boost their chances in the competitive forex market. This DeFi project utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to simplify and enhance the trading and investment process; hence, experts say it could beat projects like XRP in this coming bull cycle. In contrast to traditional trading platforms, RCO Finance offers features like access to over 120,000 assets in over 12,500 asset classes, an AI Robo Advisor, a No KYC model, and much more. Through these features, RCO Finance offers no third-party interference and a completely automated and no-code solution. These features enable investors of different financial backgrounds to leverage advanced tools to enhance their investments. For those who want to build a strong and diversified portfolio, you can leverage RCO Finance’s vast range of assets in over 12,500 asset classes. These instruments include bonds, crypto, stocks, and tokenized real-world assets like commodities and real estate. This variety of assets gives you the opportunity to diversify your portfolio and maximize your returns. Moreover, RCO Finance offers 1000x leverage where you can maximize your returns with little capital. So, with this leverage, you can amplify your investments across decentralized and traditional financial markets. However, the star of the RCO Finance platform is the AI Robo Advisor, which uses advanced AI/ML instruments to deliver personalized investment strategies. This Robo Advisor meets the needs of investors of different categories, matching their financial objectives, risk tolerance, and market options, With the Robo Advisor, you are always one step ahead because you have access to exclusive forecasts and prediction of market trends. This Robo Advisor helps traders to accurately predict market shifts and booms. For instance, after the long awaited launch of the Pi Network (PI) mainnet, token faces a price slump dropping to a low of about $0.62 . This price slump could deter many investors from leveraging the project however, analysts predict a surge of over 230% for the project in the next three months. If you’re considering getting PI as a new investor and don’t know if it’s a good choice, the Robo Advisor can give you accurate predictions and analysis of the project’s future performance.

Her move comes in the wake of some Ethereum community members’ criticism of her leadership and sustained criticism of the Foundation. In the blog post , Miyaguchi wrote: This new opportunity will allow me to continue supporting EF’s institutional relationships and to expand the reach of our vision and culture more broadly. Aya Mayaguchi She added that she is deeply grateful and enthusiastic about what’s ahead. Miyaguchi decided to run for President one year ago. However, recent events allowed her to gain clarity of mind after deeply reflecting on what matters to her. Miyaguchi reflected on recent weeks, noting that they had revealed something profound about Ethereum. She observed that moments of tension—when discussions arise about the network’s performance or market dynamics—often bring the deepest truths to light. What inspires her most, she said, is how people across the world talk about Ethereum as if it were their own. She emphasized that Ethereum belongs to everyone precisely because it belongs to no one. Ethereum Foundation is not looking to control the digital asset, but to improve its value In her blog, the incoming President reaffirmed the Ethereum Foundation’s dedication to reinforcing the resilience of the Ethereum ecosystem. She emphasized the importance of maintaining balance across various layers of its development. She stressed that Ethereum must navigate all layers to ensure its long-term relevance rather than exist solely within the fast-paced world of innovation or the slower-moving realm of societal and cultural evolution. Today, I’m excited to turn the page and share that I will be closing this chapter as Executive Director of the @ethereumfndn soon and stepping into a new role as its President. Let’s continue building in the garden. Read my full statement : https://t.co/sn3Rpsatqy https://t.co/4Gz3WdLPLD — Aya Miyaguchi (@AyaMiyagotchi) February 25, 2025 We do not control Ethereum; we protect its ethos while connecting an alive ecosystem of people, ideas, and values. The Foundation does not think of itself as an owner but rather a steward, actively seeking to correct imbalances while resisting the movement towards centralization. A crucial part of this approach is the Ethereum Foundation’s “subtraction” philosophy, which is often confused with mere minimalism. Rather, as the foundation points out, it is an underlying design principle of reducing the imbalances and ensuring that no single party can overpower the direction of Ethereum’s course. Focusing on credible neutrality and justified decentralization can help ensure that Ethereum remains a public good over the long term rather than a product and any organization associated with it in the short term. Ethereum co-founder is all praises for Miyaguchi’s role in the Foundation Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin took to X to commend Aya Miyaguchi for her impactful seven-year tenure as executive director of the Ethereum Foundation. He emphasized that an executive director’s role is to create an environment where others can thrive, attributing the foundation’s successes—including seamless Ethereum hard forks, client interoperability workshops, Devcon, and the network’s strong culture and mission-driven focus—to her leadership. Buterin also revealed that the Ethereum Foundation is restructuring its leadership. Amid these changes, many in the community advocate for former EF researcher Danny Ryan—who was instrumental in Ethereum’s shift to proof-of-stake—to take on the lead director role. The Ethereum Foundation has faced criticism from the community, particularly for its lack of transparency and complex organizational structure. In response, Vitalik Buterin has taken steps to make the foundation more engaged. For example, following concerns that EF primarily interacts on-chain only when selling ETH to fund operations, the foundation deployed 50,000 ETH (valued at approximately $80 million) on Aave, Compound, and Spark. Aya Miyaguchi, in particular, faced backlash from both the Ethereum community and some EF insiders after an interview surfaced in which she appeared to dismiss a “culture of competing and winning.” Additionally, critics argue that she has not moved quickly enough on Ethereum’s scaling solutions. Addressing the controversy, Buterin emphasized that he alone has the authority to decide who leads the Ethereum Foundation. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

With 499,096 BTC sitting on its balance sheet—worth about $44 billion—many are asking one question: Will Strategy be forced to liquidate its Bitcoin? At press time, Bitcoin has slipped far below Strategy’s average purchase price of $66,350 per BTC, meaning the company is now staring at billions in unrealized losses. If the downturn continues, it’d put Strategy’s entire financial structure at risk. This is the first real test of Strategy’s model since it became a Bitcoin-first company in 2020. How much trouble is Strategy really in? Strategy has built its entire business model around Bitcoin accumulation, funding purchases with a mix of debt and equity raises. The company holds $8.2 billion in debt, against its $44 billion Bitcoin holdings—a leverage ratio of about 19%. Most of this debt is tied up in convertible notes, financial instruments that allow creditors to convert their loans into $MSTR shares if the stock trades above a certain price. Just about the only way a “forced liquidation” occurs if there is a “fundamental change” at the company. Asked about the risks of forced selling, Saylor dismissed the idea outright. “Even if Bitcoin went to $1, we would not be liquidated,” he said. “We would just buy all of the Bitcoin.” That might sound confident, but according to data from EpochVC, a forced liquidation could happen under one key condition: a “fundamental change” in the company’s structure, which would need a stockholder vote or a corporate bankruptcy. Per its own bylaws, both of these options will likely force Strategy to sell off its Bitcoin reserves. While bankruptcy might seem unlikely, Strategy’s biggest risk is in 2027 and beyond when the first batch of convertible notes matures. Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note on Tuesday that if Bitcoin prices crash by 50% more and remains consolidated, creditors could refuse to roll over debt, leaving Strategy scrambling for cash. Saylor holds 46.8% of the voting power, which gives him a ton of control over any liquidation decisions. In spite of Saylor, shareholders now face a choice. Do they keep betting on Michael’s vision, doubling down on $MSTR despite its losses? Or do they walk away, forcing the company into a financial corner? At press time, Bitcoin was worth $88,756, according to data from CoinGecko. Saylor has been urging the US government to stockpile Bitcoin, arguing that owning 4 to 6 million BTC could “pay off the entire national debt.” Speaking at the annual CPAC conference, Saylor said the US could acquire 20% of Bitcoin’s supply “for free” and that doing so would strengthen the US dollar. He warned that other nations might act first, stating: “There’s only room for one nation-state to buy up 20% of the network. You wouldn’t want the Saudis buying it first, or the Russians, or the Chinese, or the Europeans.” States push for Bitcoin reserves, Trump already exploring federal option Saylor’s comments come as several US states move closer to mandating their own Bitcoin reserves. Most recently, Utah’s Senate Revenue and Taxation Committee gave a favorable recommendation to a bill that would require the state to hold Bitcoin as part of its reserves. At the federal level, Donald Trump last month signed an executive order creating a working group to explore the idea of a US Bitcoin reserve. Saylor claimed that if the federal government wanted to, it could rapidly accumulate 20% of Bitcoin’s total supply, with his comment about buying it “for free” seemingly referencing the US Treasury’s ability to print dollars indefinitely. The US already holds Bitcoin, but far less than Saylor proposes Right now, the US government owns around 183,422 BTC—just under 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply. By comparison, the British government holds 61,245 BTC, while Germany liquidated roughly $2.8 billion in BTC last year. Saylor has pushed this strategy before. In December, he presented a similar Bitcoin reserve plan to Microsoft’s board of directors, claiming the tech giant could generate $5 trillion in shareholder value by 2034 if it started accumulating BTC. So far, neither Microsoft nor any other major tech company has taken his advice. Not everyone agrees with Saylor’s vision. MIT Cryptoeconomics Lab founder Christian Catalini argued in a blog post this week that Bitcoin does not meet the criteria for a reserve asset. “Strategic reserves are meant to ensure stability and provide immediate access during a crisis,” Catalini wrote. “Countries store dollars or oil because they need them to repay debts, settle cross-border obligations, and keep essential systems running when supply chains falter.” He also suggested that buying Bitcoin on a massive scale could weaken the dollar’s global dominance. “If the US began amassing Bitcoin, it might be seen as a hedge against the dollar itself—raising alarms and giving rivals like China or Russia an opening to claim that the US no longer trusts its own currency,” he warned. While some lawmakers are pushing the idea of a Bitcoin reserve, skepticism remains about whether the US government will ever take action on Saylor’s plan.

Bitcoin Market Delivered Shock As Price Plummets 7% In Past Day Bitcoin had already been following a bearish trajectory during this month, but it appears the asset’s decline has seen an acceleration in the last 24 hours as its price has dropped by more than 7%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Once Again Arrives At This Bear-Bull Boundary—Will A Break Happen? Below is a chart that shows how the coin’s crash has looked: From the graph, it’s visible that BTC briefly dipped under the $87,000 mark during the plummet, but it would appear it has since found a small rebound back to $89,000. Bitcoin hasn’t been alone in this bearish price action, as the rest of the digital asset sector has taken a dive inside this window as well. Most of the altcoins have also in fact printed worse returns than BTC. Severe liquidations have occurred over at the derivatives side of the sector as a result of this sector-wide drawdown, according to data from CoinGlass. In total, liquidations have reached a whopping $1.5 billion in the last 24 hours. Naturally, a consequence of the crash was that BTC’s profit-loss distribution saw a notable change. More Than 12% Of BTC Addresses Are Now Underwater In a new post on X, the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has discussed about the latest trend in its Historical In/Out of the Money indicator. This metric basically tells us about the percentage breakdown of BTC addresses between profit, loss, and break-even. The indicator works by going through the transaction history of each address on the network to see what average price it received its coins at. If this cost basis is greater than the current price, then the metric puts the address into the loss category, which the analytics firm terms as ‘out of the money.’ Similarly, holders of the opposite type fall into the profit category, or ‘in the money.’ The addresses that have an average acquisition price equal to the BTC spot value can be assumed to be just breaking even on their investment, or ‘at the money.’ Related Reading: Bitcoin Crashes: Experts Warn Of 6-Month Slump To $73,000 Now, here is the chart for the indicator shared by IntoTheBlock, which specifically shows the trend in the Out of the Money portion of the Bitcoin userbase: As displayed in the above graph, the metric has gone up alongside the latest crash in the BTC price, as a large amount of addresses have entered into a state of loss. In total, over 12% of the cryptocurrency’s holders are underwater now, which is the highest level since October of last year.

The exchange had previously suffered a major security breach, resulting in a loss of ETH-based tokens. Mirana Ventures, linked to Bybit’s co-founders, took action by acquiring and transferring Ethereum. Bybit Hack: $600M ETH Restored To Cover Losses In the latest Bybit hack update, the top crypto exchange has received $600 million in ETH deposits from Mirana Ventures. This development follows a major security breach in which Bybit lost approximately $1.5 billion in ETH-based assets. The deposits aim to mitigate the financial impact of the hack and restore the exchange’s holdings. According to Arkham Intelligence , Mirana Ventures acquired this ETH by liquidating $500 million in Bitcoin (BTC) and $100 million in Tether (USDT). These transactions were executed through FalconX, Galaxy Digital, and Wintermute OTC. The capital injection has helped stabilize Bybit’s ETH reserves after the significant loss. Bybit had previously secured a bridge loan to ensure customer asset protection and enable withdrawals. Following the deposits from Mirana Ventures, the pace of withdrawals has slowed, indicating that the exchange’s liquidity concerns are being addressed. Mirana Ventures Facilitates ETH Injection Post-Hack Mirana Ventures played a key role in replenishing Bybit’s lost ETH reserves. The firm, whose anchor capital providers include Bybit’s co-founders, executed the transactions to help cover the shortfall caused by the hack. The Ethereum acquisition and transfer occurred over three days, making Mirana Ventures the largest ETH depositor since the incident. The funds were sourced by selling BTC and USDT holdings through multiple over-the-counter (OTC) trading firms. These transactions allowed Mirana Ventures to accumulate Ethereum and deposit it into Bybit’s reserves. The involvement of major OTC firms ensured that the asset transfer was executed without significant market disruption. The deposits from Mirana Ventures have strengthened Bybit’s financial position following the hack. While the exchange has yet to recover from the $1.5 billion loss fully, the Ethereum injection has helped stabilize operations. Role of North Korean Lazarus Group Investigations into the Bybit hack have pointed to the North Korean hacker group Lazarus Group as the perpetrators . The group has been linked to multiple high-profile cryptocurrency thefts and is known for targeting exchanges and financial institutions. Hackers targeted Bybit with advanced malware, breaching its security and moving stolen ETH to multiple addresses, complicating recovery efforts. Authorities and cybersecurity firms continue to monitor the movement of the stolen funds. Bybit’s Response and Future Measures Following the hack, Bybit implemented immediate measures to address security vulnerabilities and secure user funds. The exchange secured a bridge loan to facilitate withdrawals and maintain customer trust. With the recent ETH deposits from Mirana Ventures, Bybit has managed to reduce its shortfall, restoring part of its lost reserves. The exchange has also reassured users that withdrawal demands have slowed, indicating improved confidence in its stability. Moreso, after the Bybit hack, the top crypto exchange recovered nearly $700 million worth of Ethereum within 48 hours through OTC deals and institutional loans. Bybit CEO Ben Zhou assured users that the exchange has fully restored its 1:1 client asset backing, reaffirming confidence in its security measures. The platform has now resumed normal operations, mitigating the impact of the security breach.

Analysts have spotlighted three standout projects: Remittix (RTX), Lightchain AI (LCAI), and Web3Bay (3BAY) . Each brings unique innovations to the blockchain space—Remittix with its seamless crypto-fiat payment integration, Lightchain AI with its fusion of artificial intelligence and blockchain, and Web3Bay revolutionizing e-commerce through decentralization. While all three projects have garnered significant attention, Web3Bay stands out with its explosive presale performance, raising over $1.5 million and attracting massive whale accumulation. This surge in investor interest is fueling FOMO as early participants aim to lock in potential 4,200% gains before the next presale price hike. With whales acquiring millions of tokens and retail demand skyrocketing, Web3Bay is quickly becoming the best presale opportunity of February. Web3Bay Presale Dominates February Web3Bay is transforming the e-commerce landscape with its decentralized marketplace, enabling peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries. This model not only reduces transaction costs but also enhances privacy, transparency, and user autonomy. At its core, Web3Bay aims to disrupt the $6 trillion global e-commerce industry, offering buyers and sellers a platform that eliminates the traditional barriers of centralized marketplaces. Investor confidence in Web3Bay is soaring, with its presale already raising over $1.5 million and selling more than 375 million 3BAY tokens. What’s driving this momentum is the significant whale accumulation, where large investors are purchasing millions of tokens in bulk. This whale activity has triggered a wave of FOMO among retail investors, with many rushing to secure tokens before prices climb. The current presale price of $0.004562 is set to increase in upcoming stages, with early investors positioned to reap up to 4,200% ROI at launch. Web3Bay’s ecosystem offers practical benefits beyond token appreciation. Holders of the 3BAY token gain transaction discounts, staking rewards, and governance rights. Users can save up to 5% on marketplace purchases, stake tokens to earn passive income, and vote on key platform decisions. This community-driven approach ensures that users aren’t just participants—they actively shape Web3Bay’s evolution. Analysts agree that its real-world utility, massive presale success, and strong investor backing make it the top presale to buy in February. As whales continue to accumulate and presale stages sell out rapidly, those waiting on the sidelines risk missing out on one of 2025’s most promising opportunities. Remittix Transforms Global Payments with Crypto-Fiat Integration While Web3Bay revolutionizes e-commerce, Remittix (RTX) is tackling inefficiencies in cross-border payments. Traditional international money transfers are often slow, costly, and riddled with foreign exchange fees. Remittix solves these issues by seamlessly integrating digital and fiat currencies, allowing users to send money abroad with instant conversions and minimal costs. The RTX token is central to the platform’s ecosystem, granting users access to payment solutions and staking opportunities. Holders can stake their tokens for annual returns between 4% and 8%, providing both utility and passive income potential. Businesses benefit from the RTX Pay API, enabling crypto payments with direct fiat settlements across 50 crypto pairs and 30 fiat currencies. Security remains a top priority for Remittix. The platform employs advanced encryption and fraud prevention measures, ensuring safe transactions while eliminating the possibility of chargebacks. Compared to traditional payment services, which often charge between 5% to 10% in fees, Remittix offers a flat 1% rate, making it a compelling alternative for individuals and businesses alike. Lightchain AI Leads the Future of Blockchain with Advanced Technology Lightchain AI (LCAI) is pioneering the intersection of blockchain and artificial intelligence, aiming to build a secure, scalable network that meets the demands of modern applications. By integrating AI into its protocol, Lightchain AI enhances automation, security, and efficiency across various industries. Its decentralized governance model allows token holders to influence the platform’s development, ensuring that community voices are central to future upgrades. The LCAI token grants access to the network’s features, enabling developers to create AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps). These smart contracts leverage AI to optimize processes such as supply chain management, financial services, and predictive analytics. As businesses seek ways to harness both AI and blockchain, Lightchain AI’s technology positions it as a leader in this emerging sector. Lightchain AI’s presale has drawn significant attention, with investors eyeing the platform’s potential for long-term growth. The project’s emphasis on continuous upgrades and community involvement has made it particularly appealing to developers and enterprises seeking innovative solutions. Analysts believe that as adoption grows, LCAI’s market presence will strengthen, offering both immediate and future value for token holders. Web3Bay Takes the Crown Among February’s Top Presales February 2025 presents several exciting presale opportunities, with Remittix, Lightchain AI, and Web3Bay leading the charge. Remittix’s solution for cross-border payments and Lightchain AI’s AI-blockchain integration offer compelling use cases with solid growth potential. However, Web3Bay’s explosive presale momentum, whale accumulation, and real-world application in the e-commerce sector make it the best investment choice this month. With over $1.5 million raised, whales purchasing millions of tokens, and a projected 4,200% ROI, Web3Bay isn’t just another presale—it’s a chance to invest in a platform set to revolutionize online shopping. As presale stages close and demand continues to rise, the window to buy at discounted prices is narrowing. Act now, secure your 3BAY tokens, and position yourself for extraordinary gains in 2025 and beyond.

The Crypto ATM Fraud Prevention Act bill was sponsored by Illinois Senator Dick Durbin and three other Democrats. Durbin, who has a record as a staunch opponent of cryptocurrency, introduced the bill on the Senate floor on Feb. 25. “Mr. President, it is past time we placed some common-sense guardrails on the largely unregulated industry,” he said . The bill gives ATM operators greater liability Durbin ran through the main provisions of the bill while introducing it. No text of the bill is available at the time of writing. In general, it provides greater customer protection against scams and broadens the responsibilities of ATM operators for scam prevention. Specifically, crypto ATM operators would be required to warn customers about scams and take other reasonable measures to prevent fraud at their machines. It also would require them to use analytics to detect fraud. Durbin noted that some crypto ATM operators already do that. Durbin recounted how the elderly and newcomers to crypto are often the victims of scams involving ATMs. Several of the bill’s provisions are aimed at protecting these segments of the population. New customers would have a two-week window when they are limited to $2,000 a day in deposits and a $10,000 total. For new customers’ transactions over $500, the crypto ATM operator will be required to confirm the transaction with a live telephone call. The phone call is intended to confound scammers, who often keep their victims on the phone through the entire fraudulent transaction. All customers would be eligible for a full refund for a fraudulent transaction if they inform the police within 30 days. All crypto ATMs would be required to provide a paper receipt for transactions with information useful to law enforcement. Crypto ATM fraud is on many radars Durbin and six other Democratic senators sent a letter to the ten leading crypto ATM providers in September asking about their efforts to combat fraud. There are over 31,000 crypto ATMs in the United States. Federal Trade Commission data show that fraud at crypto ATMs is increasing rapidly. Consumers lost $100 million in crypto ATM fraud in 2023 and $65 million in the first half of 2024. The median loss in 2024 was $10,000. People over 60 were three times more likely to fall victim to such scams. At least 15 states have proposed legislation to protect consumers from crypto ATM fraud. In New Jersey, a complete ban on crypto ATMs has been proposed. Legislation to combat fraud at crypto ATMs has been advanced in several states this year alone. They include Arizona , Rhode Island and Iowa . The attorney general of Pennsylvania issued a warning about crypto ATMs the same day Durbin introduced his bill. The attorney general of Delaware issued a similar warning in January. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

In a post on X, he claimed that other stablecoin issuers are trying to use lawfare to kill the USDT issuer instead of building a better product. According to Ardoino , USDT has been the most successful tool for establishing US dollar dominance in emerging markets, but that has only made it a bigger target for competitors instead of motivating them to improve their products. He said: “While our competitors’ business model should be to build a better product and even bigger distribution network, their real intent is “Kill Tether. Every single business or political meeting that they have culminates with this intent.” Although he did not name any particular competitor, he noted how several people have reported on stablecoin issuers lobbying with the US administration to enact regulations that might affect Tether. Stablecoin bill could cut offshore issuers from US Treasuries Interestingly, Ardoino comments were in reaction to a post by Hiframework CEO Vance Spencer , who alleged that the proposed stablecoin law contains requirements that will ban offshore centralized stablecoin issuers from accessing US Treasuries. Spencer wrote: “The soon-to-be revealed stablecoin markup apparently has requirements to shut off access to the treasury market to centralized international stablecoin issuers – which is straight up batshit crazy.” He described the move as an attempt at regulatory capture by some of the US-based stablecoin issuers based in the US. As for Ardoino, he has promised to fight against the attacks, saying that Tether will prevent competitors from using their quest for a monopoly to endanger the millions of millions of people who rely on USDT. The company will not be fighting that battle alone. Several others in the crypto sector also believe that protecting the stablecoin industry is necessary. Spencer stated that it is important for the industry to take a stand on the Stablecoin and Market Structure bills, just as it did when FTX promoted a toxic bill in 2021. Community debates effect of such move Meanwhile, many in the crypto community believe that any attempt to limit Tether access to US Treasuries is bad for the crypto industry and the US in general. Castle Island venture founder Nic Carter noted that the dollar system is largely offshore, and that is a good thing for the US, and any law that stops foreigners from holding US debt is bad for the international dollar system. He wrote: “The dollar system is already very much offshore. With treasuries there are trillions held offshore in every construct you can imagine. We want foreigners to hold our debt. The whole system is premised on it.” Spencer also observed that the demand for stablecoins is overseas, and the only way for the US dollar to be the future of stablecoins is for competitive offshore stablecoins to grow. He said: “Please tell me how limiting access to hundreds of billions of dollars of demand for treasuries helps us preserve dollar hegemony across the globe, or fix our debt problem.” Interestingly, Tether is the 18th biggest holder of the US Treasuries, with over $115 billion of its reserves in the US Treasury. As Ardoino noted, the stablecoin now has over 400 million users and grows at 35 million wallets per quarter. He stated that this shows the importance of strengthening the US dollar and spreading its use in developing countries. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

After reaching an all-time high of $109,000 in January, Bitcoin has now seen a significant drop of 7%, bringing its current price to approximately $87,400. This decline raises concerns about the sustainability of the broader bull market as investor sentiment shifts towards fear. Could A Drop Below $80,000 Be Imminent? Market expert Jesse Olson recently took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to question whether Bitcoin is nearing a local top or possibly “the” top for this market cycle. Olson referenced historical data suggesting that previous pivot points for Bitcoin often signal significant downturns. He highlighted two notable instances: In April/May 2021, the Bitcoin price experienced a pivot point about 20% below its local top, leading to a price drop of 56%. In November 2021, the pivot was around 15% from “the” top, resulting in a staggering 77% decline. Currently, the price sits approximately 15% below the recent peak, and Olson notes a pending sell signal on BTC’s 3-day chart, indicating potential further downside. Related Reading: Litecoin Trading Activity Increases Over The Past Month – Potential LTC ETF Draws Speculation The expert also mentioned that while Bitcoin has hit Target 2 of 4 in his analysis, several indicators suggest the price could drop below $80,000, with higher time frames beginning to show bearish signals. Arthur Hayes Warns Of Bitcoin Downturn Adding to the bearish sentiment, market expert Arthur Hayes expressed concerns in a recent post on X, warning of a potential extension of Bitcoin’s downturn. Hayes highlighted that many holders of BlackRock’s Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), IBIT, are hedge funds that have gone long on the ETF while simultaneously shorting Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) futures to earn a yield greater than short-term US treasuries. Should Bitcoin’s price continue to fall, Hayes suggests that these funds may unwind their positions, selling IBIT and buying back CME futures. This profit-taking strategy could lead to further declines in Bitcoin’s price, potentially pushing it down toward the $70,000 mark. Related Reading: Dogecoin Activity Levels Crash To 4-Month Lows, Does This Spell Doom For The Meme Coin? Despite the prevailing bearish outlook, analyst Doctor Profit presents a more optimistic perspective. He emphasizes that the production cost of Bitcoin is currently at $95,000, meaning the market price is below this critical threshold. Historically, prices trading below production costs have signaled prime buying opportunities for investors. Doctor Profit argues that this situation creates a compelling case for potential investors, as the market often sees price rebounds when production costs are higher than market prices.

On February 25, Bitcoin’s price fell approximately 4% to around $88,000, intensifying concerns about the sustainability of Strategy’s aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy. Market analysis firm The Kobeissi Letter highlighted that the company’s approach heavily relies on its capacity to raise additional capital backed by its expanding Bitcoin holdings. They cautioned, “In a situation where their liabilities rise significantly higher than their assets, this ability could deteriorate.” Analysts Maintain Optimism Despite the recent stock downturn, financial analysts remain optimistic about Strategy’s future. On February 6, Benchmark analysts raised the company’s price target to $650, expressing confidence in Strategy’s continued aggressive capital raising to support its Bitcoin acquisition plans throughout the year. This positive outlook is rooted in the company’s strategy to generate “Bitcoin yield,” focusing on the ratio of Bitcoin holdings to outstanding shares. Strategy aims for a Bitcoin yield of 15% in 2025, suggesting a robust financial performance linked to its cryptocurrency assets. Debt-Fueled Bitcoin Purchases Since 2020, Strategy has invested over $33 billion in Bitcoin, acquiring the cryptocurrency at an average cost of approximately $66,000 per coin. This aggressive acquisition strategy has been financed through a combination of stock issuance and approximately $9.5 billion in convertible debt. Notably, the majority of this debt does not mature until 2027 or later, reducing the immediate risk of a Bitcoin price downturn necessitating the liquidation of holdings. The Kobeissi Letter emphasized that for such a scenario to force liquidation, Bitcoin’s price would need to fall by more than 50% from current levels and remain depressed beyond 2027. Stock Performance and Market Outlook On February 25, Bitcoin’s price dipped below the $90,000 threshold for the first time since November 2024, coinciding with sell-offs in U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Consequently, Strategy’s shares dropped over 10% to approximately $245. This marks a significant decline from its all-time high of $473 in November, shortly after the company announced its ambitious goal to acquire $42 billion worth of Bitcoin by 2027. Other companies with similar Bitcoin treasury strategies, such as Semler Scientific, have also experienced comparable stock retracements, with Semler down more than 20% year-to-date. Despite these challenges, Benchmark analysts remain confident in Strategy’s ability to generate “Bitcoin yield,” viewing the BTC-per-share metric as a key indicator of the company’s financial health. This focus suggests that, while market volatility presents risks, Strategy’s long-term approach to integrating Bitcoin into its corporate treasury may offer substantial returns, provided the cryptocurrency’s value appreciates over time.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-02-26 01:46:22

The conversation , among leadership changes and community scrutiny, touched on the upcoming Pectra upgrade, Ethereum’s economic model, and long-term scaling strategies. In a Reddit comment, top EF researcher Justin Drake said that the first step of the two-phase Pectra update is expected to begin rolling out in the coming months. Notably, the update will double the number of “blob” transactions per block from three to six, which Drake said will “crush the blob fee market”. The foundation’s security team also opened a $2 million bug bounty competition to stress test the hard fork, which will run until March 24. Buterin defends economic strategy amid L2 and custody concerns As Layer 2 solutions are more widely used, EF researchers stressed the importance of the Ethereum base layer. Co-founder Vitalik Buterin hit back at concerns over the network’s economic positioning, repeating the case for taking a cut of revenue from the L2s and “native roll-ups.” He also warned of the dangers staking providers, wallets, and custody services could pose and urged interoperability standards to maintain Ethereum’s decentralization. “The goal is neutrality of Ethereum, not neutrality of the Ethereum Foundation — often, the two align, but sometimes they misalign, and when that happens, we should go for the former,” Buterin said in response to a question about a potential “corporate takeover” of Ethereum. Discussions also occurred on raising the base fee for blob transactions (EIP-7762). Although some community members welcome a rise in fees, EF researchers maintain that keeping costs low will spur higher uptake and economic growth. EF researcher Barnabé Monnot expressed concerns that such a change would require the network to determine an appropriate tax level, similar to fiscal policy. As the data layer continuously grows, this poses a scaling challenge for Ethereum. Drake and co-researcher Dankrad Feist took the rejection of the theory a step further, saying that EigenLayer’s so-called altDA solution does not put Ethereum’s revenues in danger. Instead, they believe there is room for various approaches to data availability—blobs, EigenDA, etc.—to coexist. Drake even speculated about Ethereum settling 10 million transactions per second within 10 years, producing $1 bn in daily revenue. The AMA also mentioned ongoing scaling strategy development for Ethereum, as the major Layer 2 solutions — Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, and Scroll — are looking to integrate natively roll-up. EF’s Ansgar Dietrichs said the competitive roll-up landscape had spurred innovation in areas like zero-knowledge proofs and interoperability. With Ethereum development now more focused on detailed engineering and less on rapid experimentation, Buterin adds that he still sees light at the end of the tunnel for many of these technical questions. Ethereum Foundation faces leadership scrutiny as Miyaguchi transitions to new role AMA’s discussions come as Ethereum has faced mounting criticism that the network is losing ground to rival blockchains, such as Solana, and that Ethereum leadership has been ineffective and too hands-off in its support of builders. Calls for the Foundation to replace the executive director, Aya Miyaguchi, intensified in January, and co-founder Vitalik Buterin has hinted at changes in the top positions for months. Still, Miyaguchi wrote in a blog post on Tuesday that she is soon assuming a new role as president of the Switzerland-based nonprofit. Within the new role, Miyaguchi wrote that she will continue supporting the Ethereum Foundation’s “institutional partnerships.” Miyaguchi has served as executive director since 2018. In the blog post, Miyaguchi underscored the Foundation’s focus on credible neutrality, saying its “role has never been to control or own all domains in Ethereum” but rather promote values that align with decentralization. Under Miyaguchi’s leadership, Ethereum underwent significant transformations. In 2022, the network transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus model, reducing its carbon footprint by 99% through the so-called merger. Additionally, Ethereum adopted a layer-2-focused roadmap, leveraging scaling solutions to enhance its efficiency and expand its capabilities. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Ethena’s USDe is a synthetic stablecoin that maintains a soft peg with the U.S. dollar via an automated delta-hedging strategy that shorts Bitcoin and Ether perpetual futures to balance changes in the prices of cryptocurrencies. Ethena Labs’ latest move adds credibility to USDe’s reserves Ethena Labs has integrated Chaos Labs’ Edge Proof of Reserves Oracles to enhance the risk management framework for its synthetic dollar token, USDe. This consolidates the trust between the team and the community as Edge Proof oracles will independently verify the total dollar value of USDe’s reserves and the reserve coverage of USDe’s supply. The oracles also confirm that reserves are governance-approved and delta-neutral. Edge oracle proof of reserves. Source: Ethena Labs The Edge Proof of Reserves (PoR) oracles work by constantly monitoring the reserve levels of tokens which it compares to the collateral backing them. All of this happens smoothly by integrating off-chain data from custodians and centralized exchanges into the on-chain environment to ensure scalable and robust support for institutional-grade applications. The integration will also provide automated alerts to inform users of any data anomalies or if reserve levels fall below the required thresholds. All verified data can be accessed on Ethena’s transparency page and attestor interfaces, so stakeholders don’t have to worry about being out of the loop at any point in time. “This integration ensures continuous, independent verification of reserves, fostering greater transparency and security for all users. By leveraging real-time, tamper-resistant data, Ethena reinforces its commitment to a robust and reliable synthetic dollar,” Ethena Labs said in its announcement. Pairing up with Chaos Labs’ Edge oracle will also leverage the oracle provider’s reputation and capabilities. The oracles ensure security and privacy along with real-time and transparent data verification, including for reserves held off-chain or across different blockchains. They have secured over $70 billion in volume, providing risk management to decentralized finance (DeFi) giants like AAVE, Jupiter, GMX, and Tether. Ethena Labs executives praise Bybit’s disaster response Ethena Labs, and many other protocols in the crypto ecosystem collectively breathed a sigh of relief after it became apparent that the Bybit hack — now touted as the largest heist in crypto history — would not bring the exchange down to its knees. A graph showing the largest crypto thefts of all time. Source: Kobeissi Letter The CEO of Ethena Labs has since taken to X, formerly Twitter, to praise Bybit’s CEO for taking the bull by the horns and reacting quickly to mitigate damages. “Don’t think I’ve ever seen a team handle crisis communications as well as they did,” the impressed CEO wrote . “Stood up to face the music immediately to provide transparent answers to the community. An example for us all to look up to.” The CEO’s post also revealed details of how Ethena reacted to the crisis, claiming it handled the largest single day of redemptions and unwound all unrealized exposure to Bybit within an hour of the news breaking. The timely response was great, but Ethena Labs is going even further in its quest to ensure its community can continue to have faith in its ability to carry out its daily activities while keeping them protected. As earlier stated, Bybit was attacked by malicious actors, eventually alleged to be the infamous Lazarus Group, late Friday. The exploit led to the loss of $1.4 billion in various cryptocurrencies, and affected many projects including Ethena Labs which faced a potential crisis as its investors worried about a significant depeg for USDe. On Bybit’s part, the company’s CEO, Ben Zhou, reassured customers that withdrawal channels were still open, though processing times were delayed due to congestion. Zhou would later share a heartfelt post on X, where he expressed gratitude for the solidarity the crypto space has shown Bybit in the aftermath of the hack. Ben Zhou, the co-founder of Bybit. Some protocols stepped in to make it harder for the hackers to get the funds out and other exchanges like Binance and Bitget loaned Bybit some funds to ensure they didn’t have to suspend withdrawals, which would have undoubtedly caused mass panic in the minds of investors who are still healing from the FTX debacle. With the worst behind it, the company is focusing on recovering its stolen funds and rebuilding its coffers. On Saturday, Bybit offered 10% of recovered funds—up to $140 million—to on-chain sleuths who could help the firm recover the stolen assets. Zhou has also shared an SOS to any bridges willing to freeze or recover the funds stolen from his exchange. On February 24, Zhou revealed in an update that his exchange has now fully closed the ETH gap following the hack and will publish a new audited POR report soon. The Bybit hack affected Ethena Labs’ USDe Ethena’s USDe was one of the tokens that saw some volatility over the weekend due to the Bybit hack. The instability caused it to plunge to 0.982 against USDT and 0.988 against USDC, as investors worried that the protocol was disproportionately exposed to Bybit’s ether (ETH) derivatives market. While Bybit executives sprung into action doing damage control, Ethena Labs also got busy assuring its investors that all assets backing USDe were held off-exchange on a custodian named Copper, which allows users to post collateral without depositing the asset on a CEX and that it had a reserve fund that was more than enough to offset any losses from the Bybit exploit. The quick disclosure calmed investors and prevented mass hysteria even though Ethena Labs initially had $30 million in exposure to Bybit through its financial derivatives. Tom Wan, the head of data at Entropy Advisors highlighted Ethena Labs’ resilience in how it honored $123 million in redemptions on February 21, 2025, about 2% of the $6 billion total supply. USDe supply is now down to $5.88 billion. Wan also noted that $248M USDe was unstaked from the staking contract, with the largest redemption coming from the Spark PSM3 contract’s $202M on February 21. The contract alone accounted for 81% of the unstake total. The USDe staking ratio dropped from 67% to 63.5% (-3.5%). Fortunately, sUSDe’s APY fared better, increasing to 9.15%, slightly above the savings rate of USDs (8.75%). USDe recorded the largest daily selling volume at $203M on February 21 on the secondary market, offset by a buying volume of $180M. Chart showing sUSDe’s and USDe’s trading volume in February. Source: @tomwanhh (X/Twitter) Although USDe briefly dipped to $0.98 on February 21, the median DEX price and price peg held steady at $0.9993. Bybit is one of the key venues for USDe, so the USDe balance held in CEXs dropped from 580M to 388M (-33%) after the hack. However, the simultaneous increase into the Ethereal DEX early deposit vault indicated investors still had confidence in the Ethena network and Ethena Labs. Good news from South Korea Ethena Labs did not come out of the Bybit hack unscathed, but it mitigated the damage well below the worst-case scenario. Already, Ethena Labs has assured investors all is well and even debuted its Chaos Labs partnership to provide increased transparency. On another note, earlier today, Bithumb, the leading exchange in South Korea with the largest number of subscribers in 2024, announced that it had added $ ENA to the KRW market and launched an airdrop event linked to the announcement. According to details from the exchange’s blog, those who trade ENA for two consecutive days will receive ENA. The blog also contained details about what $ENA is and some restrictions put in place to provide a safe trading environment. Some of the restrictions include how buying orders are restricted for 5 minutes after the start of trading while selling orders are restricted for 5 minutes after the start of trading at prices less than -10% of the standard price and more than +100% of the standard price. Automatic orders are only possible after the first transaction after the start of trading. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

AVAX struggles to stabilize after a significant decline, while SUI faces a potential downside due to a bearish technical pattern. These fluctuations highlight the short-term nature of many crypto investments. Meanwhile, Web3Bay presale success—raising over $1.5 million and selling 375 million tokens—suggests that investors are looking beyond market cycles toward real-world utility. With a clear roadmap leading to a decentralized e-commerce marketplace, Web3Bay offers something more than just price speculation. Avalanche (AVAX) Shows Resilience Amid Market Turbulence Avalanche (AVAX) has faced significant challenges recently, experiencing a 38% decline over the past month due to a widespread market sell-off. However, despite this downturn, AVAX is demonstrating resilience. Currently, trading at $24.50, the token has seen a slight increase of $0.55 (approximately 2.3%) from the previous close, with intraday highs of $24.55 and lows of $23.46. According to analyst Ali Martinez, a critical support level at $20 is essential for AVAX to maintain stability and prevent further losses. Furthermore, additional analysis suggests that AVAX may still be in a corrective phase, with immediate support at $19.80 and a broader support zone between $12.49 and $16.74. To initiate a recovery, AVAX must surpass the key resistance level of $32.34, potentially signaling a positive shift in momentum. As a result, investors are closely monitoring these support and resistance levels to assess AVAX’s potential for stabilization and future growth. Sui (SUI) Faces Potential Downturn Amid Bearish Pattern Sui (SUI) is currently trading at $3.31, reflecting a slight increase of $0.12 (approximately 0.0376%) from the previous close. During intraday trading, the token has experienced a high of $3.35 and a low of $3.15. Meanwhile, analyst Ali Martinez has identified a head and shoulders pattern on the SUI/USDT chart, a bearish reversal indicator suggesting potential downward movement. Specifically, the pattern’s neckline is positioned at $3.00; a decisive drop below this level could confirm the bearish trend, potentially targeting a decline toward $1.60. On the other hand, maintaining support above the $3.30-$3.35 range and surpassing the $3.60-$3.80 resistance zone may invalidate the bearish outlook, paving the way for a bullish reversal. Consequently, traders are closely monitoring these critical support and resistance levels to inform their strategies. Web3Bay’s 2025 Roadmap: From Testnet to Fully Decentralized Marketplace With over $1.5 million raised in its presale and more than 375 million tokens sold at a batch price of $0.00456, Web3Bay is gaining strong traction as it moves toward its next phase. Currently, in Stage 4, the project is gearing up for key developments aimed at delivering a fully decentralized e-commerce platform. The first major milestone is the testnet launch, which will allow early adopters and developers to interact with Web3Bay’s core features, ensuring smart contracts and decentralized transactions function smoothly. Shortly after, Web3Bay will integrate cross-chain compatibility, expanding usability across multiple blockchain networks for seamless transactions. Moreover, strategic partnerships with blockchain payment processors and logistics providers are also in the pipeline to enhance real-world adoption. Following these integrations, the transition to a fully decentralized marketplace will be the final step, where users will have full control over transactions, and governance will be entirely DAO-driven. Additionally, the roadmap includes plans for NFT-based ownership verification, staking rewards, and DeFi integration, creating a broader Web3 commerce ecosystem. As the presale progresses, investors are closely watching Web3Bay’s execution strategy, with early supporters positioning themselves for potential long-term value growth. By 2025, the project aims to redefine how digital and physical assets are traded, giving users complete ownership without centralized intermediaries. Short-Term Swings vs. Long-Term Growth Price fluctuations in Avalanche (AVAX) and Sui (SUI) demonstrate how quickly market sentiment can shift. AVAX is working to recover from recent losses, while SUI faces bearish signals that could lead to further declines. For traders focused on immediate price action, these movements create opportunities and risks. However, Web3Bay’s presale performance, raising over $1.5 million with 375 million tokens sold, reflects a different investment approach—one centered on long-term adoption and real-world application. As speculative tokens navigate market cycles, Web3Bay’s roadmap toward a fully decentralized marketplace offers a clearer path to sustained value.

The company confirmed at its investor day on Tuesday that merchants, freelancers, and global sellers will soon be able to pay, get paid, and settle transactions with PYUSD in ways that weren’t possible before. The plan is simple but aggressive—integrate PYUSD into bill payments, Hyperwallet’s mass payouts, and eventually, crypto settlements for all PayPal checkout transactions. The push isn’t just about giving users another payment option—it’s about turning PYUSD into a default digital cash system. Merchants will use PYUSD for bill payments this year PayPal is rolling out a PYUSD-powered bill-pay feature that will allow over 20 million small-to-medium-sized businesses to pay their vendors using the stablecoin. Michelle Gill, who leads PayPal’s small business and financial services unit, broke down the move at the company’s investor event in New York. “A lot of the payments we’re expecting are going to be cross-border because merchants in the US are seeking to pay vendors and suppliers abroad,” Gill said . “The thesis was: Can we facilitate that on PYUSD rails so as not to have the currency conversion, the friction, as well as time?” The idea is to eliminate unnecessary banking fees and delays by keeping all transactions inside PayPal’s ecosystem. Instead of wiring payments through traditional banking networks—which often come with currency conversion costs, long wait times, and extra fees—businesses will be able to send PYUSD instantly, with no middlemen involved. PayPal already completed its first business transaction using PYUSD last year, proving that the rails are ready. Now, it’s about getting merchants to actually use it. PYUSD is coming to Hyperwallet’s mass payout system Beyond merchant payments, PayPal is bringing PYUSD to Hyperwallet, a mass payment service that helps businesses send money to contractors, freelancers, and sellers globally. PayPal bought Hyperwallet for $400 million in 2018, and now, it’s turning it into a crypto-powered payout engine. PYUSD payouts will go live in the first half of this year, and the goal is clear—give businesses a faster, cheaper, and more efficient way to send large-scale global payments without needing to rely on banks. That’s a big deal for freelancers, gig workers, and independent sellers who use Hyperwallet to get paid by companies worldwide. Instead of waiting days for bank transfers or dealing with high wire fees, they’ll be able to receive PYUSD instantly, straight into their PayPal accounts. CEO Alex Chriss, who took over in September 2023, made it clear that crypto payments are no longer just an idea—they’re happening now. “We’ve been talking about blockchains for like a decade now,” Chriss said. “The concept of these things never becomes real until you actually can start to spend it. And I think that’s what we’re enabling.” Venmo is becoming a serious business tool At PayPal’s first investor day in four years, Chriss laid out his long-term vision for Venmo, shifting it from a peer-to-peer money app to a full-scale business payments platform. The company now expects Venmo revenue to surpass $2 billion by 2027, a major jump from $900 million in 2021. It’s already making moves to turn Venmo into a go-to payment tool for businesses, with more merchants adding “Pay with Venmo” as an option. To push Venmo beyond the consumer market and into the world of business transactions, PayPal has partnered with companies including DoorDash, Starbucks and Ticketmaster.In its fourth-quarter earnings report earlier this month, PayPal said the number of merchants using Pay with Venmo increased 50% from a year earlier. The Venmo debit card is now a major focus, with total payment volume expected to grow at 20% annually, while “Pay With Venmo” is expanding at double that rate, according to a CNBC report . PayPal’s stock has taken a massive hit in recent years, with its market cap dropping over 80% from mid-2021 to late 2023. Chriss is trying to reverse that by focusing on transaction margins and steady revenue growth. At investor day, he laid out a financial roadmap, projecting high single-digit transaction margin growth and low double-digit earnings per share growth by 2027. The company is also bringing in new partners to expand Venmo’s reach. Instacart and MoonPay joined as partners last quarter, showing that Venmo is becoming a bigger player in crypto transactions and online commerce. “While we are still early in monetizing Venmo, we have a proven playbook that is resonating with customers,” Chriss said on the earnings call. “This gives us confidence as we move to 2025 and beyond.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

33767162,[object Object],1740537000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Dogecoin Price About To Complete 4th Falling Wedge Breakout Of The Cycle Toward $1,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-falling-wedge-breakout/,"The Dogecoin price could be gearing up for an explosive rally to $1 as technical indicators suggest the meme coin is about to complete its fourth Falling Wedge pattern . A crypto analyst reveals that past breakouts from similar formations have led to strong price rallies, with the highest gain of 445% recorded in previous cycles. Falling Wedge Signals Major Breakout For Dogecoin Price According to Trader Tardigrade on X (formerly Twitter), Dogecoin is set to breakout of its fourth Falling Wedge pattern, signaling the potential of a surge above $1 . The analyst presented a technical analysis of the Dogecoin price, using past Falling Wedges and historical price action to support his bullish outlook. For more clarity, a Falling Wedge is a bullish technical pattern that often signals a potential trend reversal. It forms when a cryptocurrency’s price action creates two downward converging trendlines, signifying a period of consolidation during a downtrend, with the expectation of a price breakout or an uptrend continuation. Based on the analyst’s chart, the Falling Wedge has historically signaled strong bullish momentum for Dogecoin, with each breakout triggering a price rally that surpassed the last. After a breakout from the Falling Wedge in November 2023, the meme coin performed exceptionally, recording an 88% gain that pushed it to the $0.11 price high. Similarly, in March 2024, Dogecoin broke out of its second Falling Wedge and initiated a rapid 208% price rally to new highs. At the time, the cryptocurrency hit a peak of between $0.22 and $0.25. In November, which marked the meme coin’s third Falling Wedge breakout, Dogecoin experienced a price surge, jumping by 445%, to reach $0.4. Based on these historic bullish trends, Trader Tardigrade predicts that DOGE could mirror a similar Falling Wedge break-out pattern, potentially triggering a powerful price surge to $1.5. This would represent a 650% increase from its current price of $0.2, in line with past Falling Wedge breakouts that have consistently fueled higher gains. Analyst Says DOGE 2025 Bull Run Incoming In another more recent X post , Trader Tardigrade highlighted that Dogecoin is experiencing downward pressure, which has caused its price to plummet by 57%. However, according to the analyst‘s report, this crash isn’t a cause for alarm, as Dogecoin has historically rebounded swiftly after experiencing similar declines of over 55% in previous bull cycles. During the 2017 and 2020 bull cycles, DOGE experienced a 60% and 56% decline, respectively. After retesting a key level in both cycles, the cryptocurrency underwent a rapid price rally to new highs. Based on this trend, Trader Tardigrade predicts that once Dogecoin reaches a similar retest level , a massive bull run could be imminent.",Dogecoin|Consolidation Period|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Falling Wedge Pattern|meme coin|Trader Tardigrade,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-02-26 02:30:00

Bulls have lost control, but despite the selling pressure, XRP remains strong above the $2 mark—a critical level that must hold to prevent further declines. The recent downturn has added to market uncertainty as investors look for signs of stabilization. Related Reading: Litecoin Trading Activity Increases Over The Past Month – Potential LTC ETF Draws Speculation Top analyst Ali Martinez shared an analysis on X, revealing that XRP is breaking out of an ascending parallel channel, signaling a potential downside. According to Martinez, XRP could target $1.65 if the breakdown continues, making the next few weeks crucial for its price action. The overall market remains under pressure, with altcoins struggling to reclaim key levels. Bulls could push for a recovery if XRP manages to hold above $2 and regain momentum. However, failing to defend this support could result in a deeper correction, putting additional pressure on the broader crypto market. XRP Bulls Try To Reclaim Bullish Momentum XRP is trading below key levels as it tries to reclaim bullish price action amid the broader market selloff. The entire crypto market has been under pressure after Bitcoin lost its weekly support, triggering panic and increasing selling pressure across altcoins. XRP, like most major assets, has struggled to hold its ground, dropping sharply over the past few days. Martinez’s analysis on X reveals that XRP is breaking out of an ascending parallel channel, signaling a potential move lower. According to Martinez, XRP could target $1.65 if it fails to hold current demand levels. This breakdown aligns with the overall market weakness, where bulls are struggling to regain control. Despite the bearish outlook, XRP is still holding above the $2.20 mark, where buyers are attempting to defend the price from further declines. Short-term selling pressure seems to be fading, and if bulls can maintain support above this level, a recovery could be on the table. However, if XRP fails to reclaim the $2.40 level soon, bears could take control and push the price further down. The next few days will be critical for XRP’s price action as the market looks for a potential reversal or continued downside. Related Reading: Cardano Remains In Consolidation – Expert Projects 25% Price Move Price Holds Above Key Support XRP is trading at $2.22 after briefly dropping to $2.05, following the recent wave of selling pressure that has shaken the entire crypto market. The price has struggled to reclaim higher levels as fear and uncertainty continue to dominate sentiment. Investors are closely watching for a potential recovery, but bears remain in control for now. For XRP to regain momentum, bulls must hold the price above the $2.20 level and establish it as strong support. A sustained hold at this level could set the stage for a recovery rally, with the next key resistance around $2.40. However, if selling pressure intensifies and XRP fails to maintain its current support, the $2 mark will be the last stronghold for buyers.

On the other hand, a quick bounce above $2.30 could indicate a shift in momentum, allowing bulls to regain control and push the price toward $2.50 and beyond. The next few days will be critical for XRP’s short-term price action, as investors look for signs of strength amid ongoing market volatility.

According to Feb. 26 data from Coinglass, as many as 230,000 traders have been liquidated in the past 24 hours. Open interest has dropped 5%, indicating widespread deleveraging. Exchange inflows have climbed 14.2%, potentially signaling more panic selling. In addition, funding rates have shifted negative, reflecting a change in investors’ attitude. Strong withdrawals from U.S. spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETFs accompanied the massive sell-off. The five-day outflows totaled $1.1 billion, with ETFs losing $516 million on Feb. 24 alone. Crypto-related stocks were also affected, with Coinbase (COIN) falling 6.4%, Robinhood (HOOD) falling 8%, and Bitcoin miners Bitdeer (BTDR) and Marathon Digital (MARA) falling 29% and 9%, respectively. According to IntoTheBlock’s on-chain data, 12% of all Bitcoin addresses are currently holding at a loss, which is the highest percentage of unrealized losses since October 2024. There is now a greater chance of additional sell-offs because many investors who purchased close to all-time highs of $108,000 are underwater.

Throughout the previous week, Bitcoin whales have offloaded more than $1.2 billion. The decline of Bitcoin has largely been triggered by worsening macroeconomic conditions. Global markets have been shaken by Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which have heightened concerns about inflation and economic stagnation. Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions between the United States and China, specifically over trade restrictions on semiconductors, have undermined risk appetite. There have also been declines in traditional financial markets, with the Nasdaq Composite plunging 2.8% and the S&P 500 losing 2.1%. A flight to safety, which usually puts pressure on riskier assets like Bitcoin, is indicated by the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar Index. The $88,000 support for Bitcoin is still crucial since a decline below it can lead to yet another round of liquidations. Although excessive leverage, persistent economic uncertainty, and waning market confidence point to more volatility in the future, traders are eyeing $90,000 as a possible recovery level.

Here’s What Analysts Are Saying!,https://thecoinrise.com/can-web3bays-blockchain-powered-shopping-disrupt-polkadot-mantra-om-in-2025-heres-what-analysts-are-saying/,"As blockchain projects gain traction, Polkadot and MANTRA (OM) continue to capture interest with their evolving ecosystems and price projections. Polkadot focuses on interoperability, aiming to enhance blockchain connectivity, while MANTRA (OM) emphasizes decentralized finance and staking opportunities. However, Web3Bay is shifting the focus beyond tokens and transactions by rethinking online commerce. By integrating blockchain with real-world e-commerce, not only enhances security but also introduces a decentralized marketplace where users have greater control. With a successful presale and strong community support, Web3Bay is positioning itself as a significant force in digital finance and online trade. Polkadot’s Projected Growth: Insights into 2025 Forecasts As of February, 2025, Polkadot (DOT) is trading at $5.31, reflecting a modest increase from its previous close. By the end of February, analysts anticipate that DOT’s price could reach a maximum of $5.80, with a minimum of $5.75. Looking further into the year, projections for December 2025 suggest a potential peak of $5.70, while more optimistic scenarios estimate prices up to $7.93 by mid-year. On the other hand, some forecasts adopt a cautious stance, predicting a range between $4.99 and $5.75 for July 2025. According to Dr. Elena Rodriguez, a blockchain economist at CryptoFutures Institute, while predictions vary, the general consensus leans towards positive growth for Polkadot, especially given its focus on interoperability within an increasingly interconnected blockchain ecosystem. Furthermore, factors such as the expansion of Polkadot’s parachain ecosystem, technological advancements, market adoption, and regulatory developments are expected to play pivotal roles in shaping its future value. MANTRA (OM): Projected Price Trends for 2025 MANTRA (OM) is currently priced at $0.67, with a market capitalization of over $622 million. Analysts project an increase to approximately $0.7425 by August 2024, reflecting a potential return of 19.3%. By mid-2025, estimates suggest OM could reach $1.08, marking a 73.3% gain. These projections stem from the token’s expanding ecosystem, growing adoption, and market sentiment. Long-term forecasts indicate OM could trade between $1.60 and $2.40 by 2028, depending on market conditions and adoption rates. Optimistic predictions place OM above $3 by 2030, assuming continued development and broader utility within decentralized finance (DeFi). However, fluctuations in regulatory policies and market cycles may influence its trajectory. Investors monitoring OM’s performance should consider its integration with blockchain networks, staking rewards, and increasing use cases. While the token shows growth potential, price volatility remains a key factor in shaping its future market standing. Web3Bay Gains Momentum with Strong Presale Performance Web3Bay’s presale continues to attract attention, raising $1.5 million as it enters stage 4. So far, over 370 million tokens have already been sold, with the current batch priced at $0.00456. This steady participation, therefore, highlights increasing confidence in a project that seeks to reshape online commerce by integrating blockchain technology with traditional payment systems. By offering a decentralized alternative to established e-commerce platforms, Web3Bay enables users to transact securely without intermediaries. In addition, smart contracts provide transparency in payments and escrow services, reducing risks for buyers and sellers. Moreover, the project’s dual-payment system allows both cryptocurrency and traditional methods, ensuring accessibility for a broad audience. Another key aspect of Web3Bay is community governance. Token holders influence platform decisions through a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), reinforcing a user-driven approach. Furthermore, with scalable blockchain infrastructure and plans for NFT and DeFi integrations, Web3Bay aims to position itself as a long-term player in digital commerce. As the presale progresses, early supporters are taking advantage of the current pricing before further stages push the token value higher. The Future of Blockchain Utility As Polkadot works toward greater blockchain connectivity and MANTRA (OM) strengthens its presence in decentralized finance, Web3Bay is redefining how blockchain technology can be applied beyond speculation. Its decentralized marketplace, combined with a dual-payment system and community-driven governance, reflects a model that prioritizes real-world utility. With strong presale momentum and ongoing development, Web3Bay is not just another project in the space—it represents a shift toward blockchain solutions that serve both crypto enthusiasts and everyday consumers. As adoption grows, its impact on e-commerce could set a new standard for how blockchain is integrated into mainstream markets.

Bitcoin Faces Pressure As Standard Chartered Predicts Further 10% Drop,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/not-time-to-buy-yet-bitcoin-faces-pressure-as-standard-chartered-predicts-further-10-drop/,"Earlier this morning, Bitcoin (BTC) hit a yearly low of $86,888 amid a broader market downturn. According to data from CoinGlass, the crypto market sell-off led to over $1.5 billion in liquidations in the past 24 hours, impacting 394,944 traders. More Downside For Bitcoin? After trading in the mid-$90,000 range for several weeks, BTC crashed to $86,888 on the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, marking its lowest point this year. The premier cryptocurrency is down 7.6% in the last 24 hours. Related Reading: As Bitcoin Sell Pressure Fades, Could A Local Bottom Be Forming? Analyst Explains Similarly, other major cryptocurrencies have suffered sharp declines. Ethereum (ETH) is down 10.5%, XRP has dropped 14.5%, and Solana (SOL) has plummeted 18.2% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the total crypto market cap has shrunk by 9%, tumbling from $3.3 trillion to $3.01 trillion over the same period. Despite the sharp market pullback, the worst may not be over for BTC just yet. According to Geoff Kendrick, Global Head of Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered, Bitcoin could still see further losses. Kendrick noted that while BTC has performed “relatively well,” the flagship cryptocurrency remains caught in a broader market sell-off, partly driven by Solana-based meme coins. He warned that another 10% decline may be on the horizon, potentially pushing Bitcoin’s price down to the low $80,000s. Macroeconomic Uncertainty Weighs On Crypto Further, Kendrick emphasized that although a decline in US Treasury yields could eventually benefit BTC, the large outflows from Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) suggest that “it is not time to buy yet.” In addition to the crypto market downturn, US President Donald Trump reiterated yesterday that his proposed trade tariffs on Canada and Mexico are set to take effect on March 4. As a result, the equity market is expected to open lower today, adding further pressure to risk assets like cryptocurrencies. The uncertainty in equity markets is expected to spill over into the digital assets sector, potentially leading to deeper pullbacks for cryptocurrencies. At the time of writing, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index has dropped to a five-month low of 25, signaling “extreme fear” in the market. Bitcoin’s recent price breakdown aligns with an earlier forecast by seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez, who predicted that if BTC broke below $93,400, it could experience significant volatility.

However, despite these headwinds, Bitcoin continues to outperform traditional asset classes like gold and stocks. That said, many industry leaders remain bullish on Bitcoin, viewing the current macroeconomic environment as a “generational opportunity” to accumulate BTC. At press time, BTC trades at $88,150, down 7.6% in the past 24 hours.

The group, made up of engineers, product managers, and designers, submitted a joint resignation letter posted on WetheBuilders.org, saying that they refused to participate in the dismantling of essential public services. The letter, addressed to White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, accused D.O.G.E. of “compromising core government systems”, removing technical experts without warning, and creating a hostile work environment under the leadership of Elon Musk. “We swore to serve the American people and uphold our oath to the Constitution across presidential administrations,” the letter read. “However, it has become clear that we can no longer honor those commitments at the United States D.O.G.E. Service.” A source familiar with the letter confirmed its authenticity to NBC News, though the employees who wrote it remained anonymous. Instead of names, they signed off with their job titles, signaling that the entire tech and operations backbone of D.O.G.E. had just walked out. Musk’s takeover sparks backlash inside federal agencies The resignation follows Musk’s controversial takeover of the U.S. Digital Service (USDS), the agency that was originally created under Barack Obama to modernize government tech. After Donald Trump’s executive order, USDS was rebranded as D.O.G.E., with Musk given free rein to slash government operations under the banner of efficiency. The first signs of internal chaos appeared on January 21, just a day after Trump’s inauguration, when D.O.G.E. staff reported being questioned in 15-minute interviews by White House officials wearing visitor badges. According to the resignation letter, these mystery officials refused to identify themselves, grilled employees about their political views, and attempted to pit them against each other. Less than a month later, on February 14, an anonymous email fired one-third of the agency overnight. These firings, the resigning employees wrote, removed experts working on Social Security, disaster relief, and tax filing systems, and jeopardized millions of Americans. “DOGE seems to think ‘efficiency’ just means doing less, no matter how good the return is,” said a former employee who had worked under both Obama and Trump. Speaking to NBC News, they described the agency’s shift under Musk as “scorched earth”, saying it was forcing out people who actually knew how to fix government inefficiencies. In response to the resignations, Musk took to X (formerly Twitter) and dismissed the departing workers as “Dem political holdovers.” He claimed they had refused to return to the office and would have been fired anyway. “These were full remote workers who hung Trans flags from their workplaces,” D.O.G.E. employee Katie Miller posted on X, appearing to mock the resigning staff. White House avoids questions as Republican lawmakers push back Despite Musk’s public statements, officials inside the Trump administration have been unusually tight-lipped about who is actually in charge of D.O.G.E. During a press briefing on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt repeatedly refused to name the agency’s administrator. After days of speculation, a White House official confirmed to CNBC that the acting head of D.O.G.E. is Amy Gleason—a former U.S. Digital Service official who had worked in the Trump administration’s first term. Even within Republican circles, there is concern that Musk’s aggressive purging of federal workers is being carried out too recklessly. “We need to do this with a scalpel, not a sledgehammer,” Rep. Nicole Malliotakis told CNN, saying that while she supported efficiency, some of D.O.G.E.’s actions seemed too rash. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said any downsizing should be done in a “respectful way,” warning that a chaotic purge could hurt essential services. “I’m all for trimming the government,” said Rep. Rich McCormick, after angry constituents confronted him at a town hall over mass terminations. “But we need to allow people to adjust their lifestyle.” However, Trump’s fundraising team made it clear they had no intention of slowing down. A campaign email sent Tuesday highlighted Musk’s new employee policy, which required all federal workers to submit five accomplishments each week. The email then posed a poll to supporters, asking: “Should Elon Musk and I FIRE anybody that doesn’t respond? YES or NO?” Trump’s executive order faces lawsuits over Musk’s role The legal status of Musk’s role at D.O.G.E. is also now being challenged in multiple lawsuits. While Trump has publicly credited Musk with leading the agency’s overhaul, legal filings tell a different story. In a sworn statement on February 17, Office of Administration Director Joshua Fisher said that Musk “is not an employee” of any government entity under D.O.G.E. and has “no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself”. This contradiction became central in a federal lawsuit challenging the legality of D.O.G.E.’s actions. During a hearing on Monday, a Trump administration lawyer was unable to answer a judge’s questions about Musk’s official relationship to the agency. Despite this, D.O.G.E. continues to operate under Musk’s influence, scrapping government contracts, eliminating jobs, and attempting to shut down entire federal agencies. For now, the twenty-one employees who resigned say they had no choice but to walk away. “We signed up to make the government more effective,” their letter read. “Instead, we are watching it be dismantled.” Meanwhile, more than one million federal employees responded to Elon Musk’s controversial directive requiring them to submit bullet points justifying their jobs and productivity, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed Tuesday. “I can announce that we’ve had more than one million workers who have chosen to participate in this very simple task of, again, sending five bullet points to their direct supervisor or manager,” Leavitt told reporters. Musk had set a deadline of midnight Monday, declaring that employees who failed to comply would be considered to have resigned. However, multiple federal agencies, including the Pentagon, the State Department, and the Department of Homeland Security, instructed their employees to ignore the directive. With roughly 2.4 million civilian federal workers, Musk’s one million figure suggests that fewer than half responded. White House walks back Musk’s threats Despite Musk’s bold claim that non-compliant workers would be fired, White House guidance clarified that all hiring and firing decisions remain under agency control. “For some of the agencies that you’ve seen who have said, ‘please don’t send these emails,’ it’s in their best interest for that specific agency, and the president supports that,” Leavitt explained. Still, Musk doubled down Monday night, saying he would give workers a second chance to submit their justifications before facing termination. Leavitt insisted that agency heads would set their own policies for handling responses to Musk’s directive. Democrats target Musk over D.O.G.E’s CFPB shutdown Democratic lawmakers, led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, held a Tuesday forum blasting Musk and the Trump administration’s efforts to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), an agency responsible for policing financial industry abuses. Warren argued that Musk’s push to neutralize the CFPB is directly tied to his own business interests, particularly his plan to launch a digital payments system within X (formerly Twitter). “By seizing control of the agency, Musk can now root through all of the CFPB’s confidential data on these potential competitors,” Warren said. “As Musk launches his new app, he faces oversight from the CFPB. His plan seems to be to eliminate the watchdog.” Musk was invited to the hearing, but he did not attend. D.O.G.E operatives took over CFPB before mass layoffs The Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E)—the Trump-created entity Musk oversees—gained access to CFPB systems earlier this month, just before the agency’s new leadership froze operations, shut down headquarters, and laid off nearly 200 employees. According to a CFPB union lawsuit, acting CFPB Director Russell Vought has a plan to fire more than 95% of the agency’s staff. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) called out Musk directly during the forum, questioning why a billionaire with a growing financial empire should be allowed to dismantle the agency meant to regulate him. “Elon, how do you justify shutting down the agency that’s going to be looking at your peer-to-peer payment plan?” Klobuchar asked. “How do you justify shutting down the agency that has jurisdiction and oversight over many of the other financial issues that you are going to make money from doing?” During the hearing, former CFPB supervision director Lorelei Salas warned that the agency holds highly confidential trade secrets, including data from major payment services like PayPal, CashApp, and Zelle. “We’ve been looking at a number of digital wallet companies and payments companies, and we have information on the technologies they’re using,” Salas said. She also revealed that the CFPB has access to AI-driven credit models, which determine whether individuals get approved for loans. Beyond corporate data, the CFPB also stores sensitive personal information from consumer complaints, including account numbers and private financial details, making its dismantling a major concern for privacy advocates. A federal judge has temporarily halted Musk and Vought’s efforts to purge CFPB data or fire more employees. “The CFPB has been sidelined, but it is not dead,” Warren said. “Only Congress can shut down the bureau. Advocates are in court right now, and I am confident they are going to win.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

The disgraced former CEO, currently serving a 25-year prison sentence, sparked debate when he shared a ten-part thread on layoffs and employment issues. Ranting About Layoffs SBF’s tweets , posted Monday night, came as a surprise, given that he is incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. It remains unclear who is managing his X account since prisoners in the United States do not have direct internet privileges. However, they can communicate using the Corrlinks system, which allows monitored messaging. Whether SBF himself or an associate posted, the messages reflected on the former FTX head’s experience with layoffs, suggesting that firing employees is often necessary for business efficiency. “I have a lot of sympathy for government employees: I, too, have not checked my email for the past few (hundred) days,” he quipped in the opening post. He then went on to elaborate that terminations are rarely the employee’s fault but often result from mismanagement or structural issues in an organization: “I’d tell this to everyone we let go: that it was as much our fault for not having the right role for them, or the right person to manage them, or the right work environment for them.” The thread seemed to align the convicted fraudster with recent government downsizing rhetoric. Over the weekend, billionaire businessman Elon Musk, who also heads the newly constituted Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E), issued a directive demanding U.S. federal employees justify what they do each week via email or risk being considered to have resigned. While the approach has largely drawn condemnation, SBF seemed to endorse it, suggesting that ineffective employees should not be kept on the payroll. “My experience: a) it is usually not the employee’s fault that they got fired b) it is usually correct to let them go anyway,” stated SBF. Some view it as an attempt to curry favor with the pro-crypto Trump administration, which recently pardoned Ross Ulbricht, who had been serving two life sentences for charges related to creating and operating the Silk Road darknet marketplace. Last month, reports emerged that Bankman-Fried’s parents were engaging with members of President Donald Trump’s inner circle as they explore ways to get clemency for their son. Market Reaction While it is not yet known whether SBF’s X thread struck a chord with its intended target, if any, its effect was undoubtedly felt in the crypto market, at least briefly. FTX’s FTT token saw a rapid spike in its price, climbing from $1.55 to a high of $2.07 within hours of the post. However, the surge was shortlived, with the token settling around $1.61. The current price reflects an 18% drop over the last seven days and a 20.2% loss across the past month.

The filing, submitted by NYSE Arca on February 14, 2025, seeks regulatory approval for staking activities within the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF and the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF. US SEC Acknowledges Grayscale’s Staking Proposal According to a filing , the US SEC has acknowledged the proposed rule change, which would permit Grayscale’s Ethereum ETFs to stake Ethereum through trusted providers. This would allow the funds to earn staking rewards without altering the existing custody arrangements. According to the report, the staking process would be managed solely by the ETF’s sponsor, ensuring that staked ETH is not pooled with other entities or marketed as a staking service. Coinbase Custody will continue securing the fund’s Ethereum holdings, maintaining the current security framework. The SEC’s review includes a public comment period, with an initial 45-day decision timeline that could extend up to 90 days. If approved, the move could introduce staking rewards as an additional feature for Ethereum ETF investors. Regulatory History and Industry Considerations Grayscale has been exploring the addition of staking to its Ethereum ETF for some time. In March 2024, the company proposed a similar staking structure following Fidelity’s initiative, but regulatory complexities delayed its approval. The SEC has previously raised concerns about staking, particularly regarding whether it qualifies as an investment contract under U.S. securities laws. However, recent reports indicate that the agency is actively engaging with industry players to better understand the different forms of staking and their benefits. Eleanor Terrett, a journalist, stated on X (formerly Twitter) that the SEC has shown a “very, very interested” stance on staking and has been asking industry experts for additional insights. She said’ “Given the SECGov’s newfound interest in staking, it seems logical that it will also reconsider its lawsuit against Consensys, which it sued last year over its @MetaMask staking service. The SEC also alleged Consensys had been operating as an unregistered broker, the same claim it’s now dropping against Coinbase.” Market Developments and Grayscale’s Cardano ETF The SEC’s acknowledgment of Grayscale’s Ethereum staking proposal comes amid other crypto-related regulatory developments. The agency recently accepted a similar proposal from 21Shares for staking in its Core Ethereum ETF, suggesting a growing interest in integrating staking into regulated investment products. Additionally, the SEC has started reviewing Grayscale’s filing for a spot Cardano (ADA) ETF . If approved, it would allow investors to gain exposure to Cardano without directly holding the asset. This filing is part of Grayscale’s broader strategy to expand its cryptocurrency ETF offerings beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Meanwhile, the SEC has dropped its investigation into Robinhood’s crypto unit and the Uniswap exchange, indicating a shift in its regulatory approach. These decisions may influence how the agency evaluates staking within ETFs. With the SEC’s review process underway, investors and industry stakeholders are closely watching for updates. The decision timeline includes an initial 45-day period, which may be extended to 90 days based on regulatory considerations.

The most common example of these sorts of elements in the crypto industry is user incentives. Restaking is a natural case study of the effects of a lack of sustainable incentives in an attention-driven market. Although it was once a hot topic in crypto due to its potential to elevate the industry’s security landscape, it invariably lost momentum due to an inability of restaking platforms to compensate users adequately for their contributions to economic security. Luckily, nothing is ever truly finished in the crypto industry, and a once-forgotten narrative or use case could resurface with a few minor tweaks and changes. The advent of curators in shared security frameworks offers a glimmer of hope for revitalizing the restaking narrative, ensuring that users are adequately incentivized to continue contributing to the security of blockchain networks and protocols. Later in this article, I’ll define curators and highlight their role in restaking models. But first, let us explore why and how curators came to be. Restaking origins Over the years, blockchain infrastructure has become more modular, scalable and accessible, making it easier to create blockchain products. However, that same rapid development has been missing in security implementation. New networks and protocols must create new security systems from scratch or employ alternatives that are either too expensive or involve significant trade-offs. Restaking emerged as a solution to this problem. It introduced the concept of shared or pooled security, allowing new networks and protocols to borrow the security of more established blockchain networks. Restaking platforms like Eigenlayer, Babylon and Symbiotic enable new blockchain projects to quickly establish a security layer by connecting to larger, more secure projects. These platforms also encourage users to contribute to the economic security of these new projects by committing their already staked assets to the validators or nodes in their system. However, as the restaking narrative grew, the need for scalability became more apparent. Factors like risk management, reward allocation, and complexity management need to be handled to manage the risks associated with staking. Enter curators. What are curators Curators are entities within a shared security framework that manage, optimize and enhance interaction between the system’s components. Their work improves collaboration between these components and efficiency and functionality within the system. Curators take on several forms within a shared security framework and would likely increase as the restaking landscape proliferates. Let’s look at some of the curators in existing restaking frameworks. LRTs (liquid restaking tokens) These asset management entities provide a new layer of functionality by essentially allowing users to reuse already staked assets to contribute to the economic security of other networks and protocols in exchange for additional yield. LRTs provide various benefits, such as enhanced capital extraction, multi-network participation and increased decentralized security. Furthermore, LRT teams excel at handling and acquiring large amounts of stake and creating valuable incentive systems capable of attracting restakers to provide economic collateral, a quality that integrated networks can leverage to achieve desirable outcomes. Operators Operators are a key component of a shared security framework. They are responsible for running network infrastructure components and can also act as curators. This is because they provide several qualities that integrated networks can leverage to develop highly resilient systems and establish best practices. These include the ability to run various forms of network infrastructure, crypto-specific DevOps knowledge, and expertise in managing node redundancy and uptime. Risk managers and research entities Risk managers and research entities exist in various forms, including applied research groups, consulting agencies and independent or freelance researchers. Regardless of their form, though, they are responsible for identifying and quantifying risks within the ecosystem. Their work ensures the network’s overall security and helps all parties make informed decisions while establishing best practices for the industry. Conclusion Only the narratives that capture and maintain user interest remain relevant in attention-driven markets. In the earlier days, restaking platforms could not keep users incentivized enough to continue contributing to economic security, leading to a drop in momentum. However, the emergence of curators in shared security frameworks represents a new opportunity for restaking’s resurgence. Network participants can leverage these curators to design valuable incentive systems, develop highly resilient systems and manage risk exposure, which could attract user attention and revive the restaking ecosystem. All that remains is to wait and see if the market accepts this new paradigm and if networks adopt this system to drive adoption and generate interest among the crypto faithful. Filipe Gonçalves is the co-founder and CEO of Inceptive Labs , a Dubai-based venture studio specializing in DeFi innovations, and the lead contributor of InceptionLRT, the first modular aggregation layer for restaking. With over a decade of experience in fintech and DeFi, Filipe has pioneered products bridging traditional finance with decentralized systems.

Despite its relatively recent launch and initial expectations of selling pressure, Pi Network has continued to defy market trends, showing incredible strength and stability. While Bitcoin and many altcoins have seen a decline, Pi has remained resilient, currently valued at $1.6. This impressive performance under challenging conditions proves that Pi Network is not just a fleeting trend, but a truly strong project with long-term potential. Currently, Pi is forming an ascending triangle pattern, which suggests that a breakout could be imminent. A successful breakout could propel its value toward the $1.90 – $2 range, further solidifying its position in the crypto market. The 24-hour trading volume also indicates that investors are still confident in the project’s future. What’s Next for Pi Network? With millions of active users worldwide, Pi Network is rapidly growing and fostering a strong, engaged user base. The future of Pi Network looks promising, but its success depends on a few key factors. Continued market adoption, exchange listings, and regulatory compliance will be crucial to the project’s long-term success. As the cryptocurrency space continues to mature, Pi Network is positioned to make significant strides and could potentially become a major player in the industry. Binance, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, is considering adding Pi Network to its platform but is seeking input from the community before making a final decision. Being listed on Binance could greatly boost Pi Network’s visibility, bringing in new users and investors. With Binance’s large user base, Pi Network would benefit from increased liquidity, making trading and conversions more efficient.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|ALTCOIN|BNB|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-26 04:45:33

ETH neared $2,500 after dropping to the $2,300 zone recently. XRP and Solana (SOL) prices jumped by 1-3%. Meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe Coin (PEPE) also gained 1%-7%, sparking speculations amid the flagship coin’s converse momentum. Crypto Prices Today Illustrate Mixed Actions, Investors Uncertain The global crypto market cap lost nearly 1.6% in the past 24 hours, shredding down to $2.94 trillion. Moreover, Coinglass data showed that market liquidations over the past 24 hours totaled over $1 billion. Particularly with Bitcoin recording over $500 million in liquidations, the flagship coin’s waning price action remains rationalized. BTC Price Touches $86K Low As of press time, BTC price tanked over 3% and rested at $88,867. The flagship coin’s 24-hour bottom and peak were $86,008.23 and $92,299.84, respectively. As mentioned above, the waning price action aligns with $588.25 million worth of liquidations in the past 24 hours, per Coinglass data. Moreover, Bitcoin’s market dominance also took a hit, slipping by 1.41% to 60.02%. This signaled that altcoins witnessed considerable price gains intraday. ETH Price Nears $2,500 ETH price traded at $2,489 at the time of reporting, up marginally by 0.13% intraday. The coin hit a bottom and peak of $2,326.63 and $2,529.67 over the past day. Ethereum recorded comparatively fewer liquidations than BTC, totaling roughly $178 million intraday. XRP Price Jumps 2% XRP price witnessed gains worth 2% over the past day, closing in at $2.31. The Ripple-backed asset hit a low and peak of $2.08 and $2.36, in the past 24 hours. Liquidations for the crypto totaled nearly $38 million in the past 24 hours, per Coinglass statistics. SOL Price Soars 5% SOL price witnessed a remarkable 5% pump as of press time, exchanging hands at $143.56. The crypto hit a 24-hour low and high of $132.49 and $146.74, respectively. Solana recorded liquidations worth $48.25 million in the past 24 hours. Meme Crypto Prices In The Green Simultaneously, Dogecoin (DOGE) price pumped over 1% to reach $0.2118. Shiba Inu (SHIB) price gained over 4%, closing in at $0.00001432. Pepe Coin (PEPE) price surged over 6.5%, securing $0.000008358. Nevertheless, the Official TRUMP token remained in the red amid the loss of market confidence in PolitiFi tokens .

Rumors of Elon Musk’s X Adopting XRP Sparks Massive Demand Speculation,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-to-500-rumors-of-elon-musks-x-adopting-xrp-sparks-massive-demand-speculation/,"The announcement of a payment system called “X Money” by X (formerly Twitter) has generated significant speculation within the cryptocurrency community. A tweet from crypto researcher Xaif (@Xaif_03) suggested that X could adopt XRP as a payment method, potentially driving significant demand and even causing its price to surge to $500. This claim, while exciting for XRP supporters, remains speculative, as no official confirmation has been provided by Elon Musk or the X team.

Make this key chain go viral #Ripple … pic.twitter.com/kcgOEgRDYP — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) February 23, 2025 X Money: A Step Toward the “Everything App” A Fox Business report recently highlighted X’s ambitions to become a “super app,” expanding beyond social media into financial services. The report referenced a post by X CEO Linda Yaccarino, stating that X Money will “connect you in ways never thought possible,” alongside other upcoming X features such as XTV and Grok. In addition, an official X Money account was created in 2024 and has already amassed over 190,000 followers. This development signals a growing focus on payments within the X ecosystem. However, Musk has not yet publicly commented on the initiative, leaving many details—including the potential integration of cryptocurrencies—uncertain. XRP’s Role: Speculation vs. Reality The possibility of XRP being integrated into X Money has been widely debated. Some cryptocurrency analysts argue that Musk’s vision of a financial ecosystem within X aligns with XRP’s fast and low-cost transaction capabilities. Given Musk’s well-documented history with digital assets, including Bitcoin and Dogecoin, there is speculation that XRP could play a role in his payment system. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Steve Griffith, an X user who commented on the situation, pointed out that X has been “securing money transmission licenses across numerous U.S. states,” indicating a strong commitment to financial infrastructure. He noted that payments and transfers are a key component of X’s broader vision, but he also acknowledged that the specific currencies and technologies to be used remain unclear. On the other hand, skepticism remains among some members of the crypto community. Another X user, Arthur Klucznik, dismissed the speculation, stating , “He hasn’t launched anything, and when it eventually comes, XRP won’t play any part in it.” This reflects a cautious approach from those who believe that while X’s payment ambitions are real, XRP’s role in them is unverified. The introduction of X Money represents a significant step in Musk’s broader vision of transforming X into an all-encompassing platform. While speculation around XRP’s integration continues to spread, there is currently no official confirmation that the digital asset will play a role in X’s payment system. Investors and cryptocurrency enthusiasts will likely continue to monitor X’s developments closely. Until concrete details are revealed by Musk or X’s leadership, discussions surrounding XRP’s potential involvement remain speculative. The coming months may provide further clarity as X moves closer to launching its financial services. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This steep decline places the cryptocurrency further away from its January all-time high of over $109,000. The sharp sell-off comes amid both internal and external challenges, leaving investors uncertain about what lies ahead. While the market struggles to find support, the path forward so far remains unclear However, Mac.D, a contributor to the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform has managed to analyze the current market scenario and give a detailed outlook. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Demand Levels Return to Neutral Zone—What Next? Is A Rally Still Possible For Bitcoin? Diving into the outlook, Mac first touched on the major factors behind the ongoing plunge in Bitcoin’s price. According to Mac, a combination of internal and external pressures have contributed to Bitcoin’s recent plunge. Internally, the aftermath of a notable Ethereum-related hacking incident has unsettled the broader crypto market. Externally, the ongoing inflation concerns and the reintroduction of tariff policies under the Trump administration have weighed on risk assets, including Bitcoin. These factors have collectively led to a break below the crucial $90,000 support level, according to Mac, the analyst further points to two key elements that could influence Bitcoin’s trajectory moving forward. First, the recent liquidation of long positions has reached its highest level since November, with $245 million worth of long positions wiped out. Such large-scale liquidations often reduce market depth, creating conditions that might enable a price rebound. BTC Massive Long Liquidation, At a Crossroads of Rise or Fall “Liquidation of long positions has occurred. Today’s liquidation marks the highest since November, with $245 million worth of long positions being liquidated.” – By @MAC_D46035 Full post ⤵️https://t.co/c4aefYbQ73 pic.twitter.com/xCwDbAyLJM — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) February 25, 2025 Second, the average entry price for whale investors holding Bitcoin for less than six months is around $89,600. This psychological support level may help stabilize the market if these whales refrain from further selling. Despite these potential supports, the outlook is far from certain. Mac cautions that if the support level fails to hold, further declines could occur. In this scenario, he recommends proactive risk management strategies, including short positions in futures or partial liquidation of holdings.

Technical Outlook On BTC With Bitcoin currently trading at $87,132, it is quite obvious that the asset has breached the $89,600 support highlighted by Mac. While Mac suggests this breach could lead to further declines, another analyst, RektCapital, offers a more optimistic technical view. According to RektCapital, Bitcoin’s recent drop might be a temporary setback. The analyst highlights a potential downside deviation that often precedes a significant price recovery, indicating that a rebound could already be taking shape. #BTC The downside deviation below the Range Low of the ReAccumulation Range is now in progress$BTC #Crypto #Bitcoin https://t.co/r5reRJ0HFy pic.twitter.com/yr1ABiDmBg — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) February 25, 2025 Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin market|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|crypto market|cryptoquant,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-02-26 05:00:25

XRP and BNB Chain’s BNB led a gradual majors rebound Wednesday as traders continue to reel from Tuesday’s carnage — one that saw overall capitalization drop as much as 10% and at least $1.2 billion in losses on bullish bets. XRP rose 3%, while BNB and Solana’s SOL added 5%. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano’s ADA showed a slight 1.2% gain, while Tron’s TRX was down 5% in the past 24 hours. The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20) was down 2%. The move higher was in line with a CoinDesk analysis on Tuesday, as a five-month low in a sentiment index and a large-scale liquidation event indicated assets were likely oversold and could see relief in the short term. Gold fell 1.3% on Tuesday after a profit-taking bout following a record rally where it touched a new high Monday, but rose higher in Asian morning hours Wednesday. Macro Outlook Reasons for Tuesday’s panic ranged from money flowing out of bitcoin ETFs, with over $1 billion pulled out in the last two weeks, to a stronger yen, a perceived safe-haven currency whose growth tends to pull down riskier bets. Expectations for easier U.S. Federal Monetary policy have surged , however, with prediction markets putting chances of a May rate cut to 30% over the past week, and the chances of two rate cuts by June have more than tripled to 15%. These hopes come after a gauge of U.S. consumer confidence marked its deepest fall since August 2021, decreasing 7 points in February to 98.3 in its third straight decline. U.S economic data and policies tend to impact prices of risk assets such as bitcoin, as crypto traders bet on expectations of retail participation as idle cash frees up. Traders Remain Cautious Hopes of an altcoin rally remain muted among traders, with fresh dollar inflows expected to flow exclusively to BTC. BTC finally broke out of its range, dipping below 90k for the first time in a month and now hovering just below that level, triggering over USD 200mm in liquidations over the past few hours. Market sentiment remains under pressure following Trump’s decision to implement tariffs on Canada and Mexico and curb Chinese investment. Front-end gamma was covering as BTC broke lower, with 1M implied volatility now back around 50v, while skews interestingly remain largely unchanged. “Zooming out, equities, fixed income, and gold have largely shrugged off the data points previously blamed for broader market weakness, with BTC remaining flat,” Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a broadcast message late Tuesday. “Rising BTC dominance and sliding altcoin prices suggest that alt bulls may already be fully long, with any new dollar inflows going exclusively into BTC.” “We remain cautious. Recent BTC demand has been driven primarily by institutions like MicroStrategy financed through equity-linked note issuances. With crypto-related issuance accounting for roughly 19% of total issuance over the last 14 months, the market for such financing may be nearing saturation — potentially dampening institutional demand if spot continues to stay muted,” it added. Players like Strategy (previously MicroStrategy) have been the main drivers of BTC demand in the past weeks and months , funding their purchases by raising their stock. But here’s the catch: companies might struggle to justify more purchases since the hype isn’t increasing prices.Less institutional buying could cool off BTC demand and lead to big investors pulling back, affecting the market further.",Markets|BNB|Bitcoin|Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|BNB|XRP|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-26 05:00:53

Over the past 24 hours, XRP briefly dipped below the $2.25-$2.30 support range, but as of now, it has not confirmed a daily close below this level. While this bounce offers a glimmer of hope for bulls, it’s important to remember that this does not guarantee the end of the bearish divergence. On larger time frames, the bearish trend is still visible, and the market is still under the influence of this pullback. The price could still face further challenges, especially if the larger bearish pattern continues to play out. Key Support and Resistance Levels XRP is currently testing resistance levels on the micro scale, specifically between $2.30 and $2.46. This zone is critical as it represents a pivot point between potential bullish and bearish scenarios. A break above this resistance could signal the start of a new bullish phase, while a failure to break through may indicate further downside risk. The immediate support level that traders are watching is at $1.95. If the price drops below this level, the market may face further corrections. However, if support at $1.95 holds, there’s a good chance that the bullish momentum could resume. Should the price drop further, the next key support level lies at the February low of $1.77. Bullish Scenario and Potential Price Targets If XRP can successfully break above the $2.46 resistance, it could set the stage for a significant bullish movement. In the best-case scenario, this could lead to a price surge toward the $5 to $6 range, offering a substantial reward-to-risk ratio for investors. This would mark the start of a new uptrend, ideally following a five-wave pattern that would confirm the bottom is in place. If XRP breaks through the $2.83 resistance level, it would provide more confidence that the bearish scenario is invalidated and the market is in a strong uptrend.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-26 05:05:44

Solana ( SOL ) has had its worst monthly performance since the FTX collapse in November 2022, falling 38% in the last 30 days. Declining memecoin trading activity, which previously contributed to Solana’s massive on-chain volume, has been a major factor. As of Feb. 26, a whopping 8.1 million tokens have been minted on Pump.fun, Solana’s memecoin trading platform. The platform has subsequently generated $577 million in fees. On Feb. 12, Pump.fun’s daily trading volume peaked at a monthly high of $218 million. But it appears that momentum has slowed. Data from a Dune analytics dashboard shows that trading volume has decreased 94% in a single day, from $89.5 million on Feb. 25 to just $5.03 million on Feb. 26. The majority of tokens are down 80–90% from their peaks, reflecting the decline in the larger memecoin market. Daily trading volume on Pump.fun. Source: Dune Analytics Solana’s decentralized finance ecosystem has seen a significant outflows as a result of this crisis. According to DefiLlama , Solana’s TVL has dropped from $12 billion in early mid-January to $7.13 billion, losing $5 billion in less than a month.

In the past 30 days, more than $500 million has been bridged to Ethereum ( ETH ), Arbitrum ( ARB ), and Sonic ( SONIC ) SOL is currently trading at $142, having dropped 15% in the last 7 days. Bulls are struggling to establish a support level, with $140 acting as a key threshold. If SOL fails to hold above this level, the next major support lies between $125 and $130. A breakdown below this range could push SOL to its lowest price since Aug. 2024. SOL needs to recover the $150 mark and witness a resurgence in TVL and on-chain volumes to resume its bullish momentum. Until then, there is still a strong potential for more declines, which increases uncertainty. An upcoming 11.2 million token unlock on March 1 could further put pressure on SOL. Additionally, there is a low chance of a Solana ETF being approved soon, which lessens the likelihood of an institutional trigger happening right away.

Hedera is another DeFi-focused project that has been gaining massive traction over the past few months, and it appears that its run is just getting started. Bonk (BONK) seems to have finally bottomed out, offering investors an ideal entry point and last but not least, Rollblock (RBLK) continues to tear through milestones, as tens of thousands have joined the viral presale of its native RBLK token which has been in up-only mode since launch. Rollblock Could Be This Year’s Big Success Story Rollblock is a newcomer to the online gambling space, and in a short amount of time, it has already captured the attention of 50,000+ investors. Rollblock’s goal is very simple: to provide a memorable casino experience supported by robust security measures and an intuitive interface while allowing users to earn passive income through the revolutionary revenue-share system. Over 7,000 games from 10 established developers await players, with a vast array of options ranging from all-time classics, such as roulette and poker, to live games and even AI-powered exclusives. Additionally, sports betting has been introduced as well, further expanding Rollblock’s already massive offering. The introduction of this feature alone led to a 600% spike in new registrations in December, breaking all previous records and placing Rollblock on the map as a high-end gambling platform The novel revenue-share system is the most intriguing aspect of the Rollblock ecosystem and is powered by the RBLK token. Every week, the casino will spend up to 30% of the weekly profits to buy back RBLK tokens. A set amount of these tokens is burned, deflating the total supply and priming RBLK for explosive rallies as the cycle progresses. The rest is redistributed to holders as generous staking rewards, granting some of the highest APYs in the crypto market. Cardano Heading Toward Reversal As Price Stabilizes Cardano (ADA) is hovering around $0.68, moving within a tight consolidation range between $0.64 and $0.75. Cardano is moving in line with the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, positioned at $0.75 and $0.72, indicating slight bullish momentum. Resistance is evident at $0.78, while support is clearly defined at $0.64. From here, Cardano could see a potential breakout if buying activity picks up. Cardano’s RSI is currently in neutral territory, at 42 and an emerging bullish MACD crossover signals that several factors are already lining up for an upward move above the resistance. At the time of writing, Cardano is selling for $0.68 following a slight 1% intraday increase, which could kickstart its long-awaited resurgence after a few weeks of sluggish price action. This Cardano upsurge has been accompanied by a 12% jump in trading activity, with about $836 million worth of ADA traded across exchanges in the last 24 hours. Stellar Hovers Around Support While Feud With Ripple Tops Headlines The long-standing rivalry between Stellar (XLM) and Ripple (XRP) has been reignited after Build on Stellar took a jab at Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC. The XRP community had a strong reaction, with some calling for a sell-off of XLM and others accusing Stellar of plagiarizing the XRP Ledger. While this type of drama is not something that is particularly new in the crypto world, Stellar would most definitely benefit from the attention, as its price action has been lagging as of late. After a triple-digit surge in late 2024 that saw Stellar form a local top around $0.57, a prolonged correction followed, with the XLM price finally bottoming out around $0.31. This is where, buying activity is increasing as Stellar’s daily RSI is sitting at 31 points, suggesting exhaustion from the selling side. Simultaneously, the long-to-short ratio now stands at 2.28, with over 60% of positions being longs, meaning that most market participants expect an upward reaction from here. Hedera Ready To Enter And Ascending Channel As Buying Pressure Builds Up Hedera (HBAR) is showing signs of a potential uptrend after finding support above $0.20, as suggested by the string of higher lows on the chart, despite the recent pullbacks. Technical analysis suggests that Hedera has completed its corrective phase and could be gearing up for a bullish impulse, but for this to be confirmed, the key resistance at $0.25 must be cleared. A breakout above this level may push the Hedera price toward $0.31 and beyond, aligning with historical liquidity zones. Right now, Hedera sells for $0.23 after a 1.7% daily increase. On the weekly and monthly time frames however, Hedera is still down, respectively 11% and 17%, suggesting that the current price point could be an ideal entry for investors who want to capitalize on Hedera’s potential reversal. Bonk Regains Some Ground As Volume Picks Up Over the last few weeks, Bonk (BONK) has lost over 30% in valuation as market-wide turbulence grew, forcing retracements across the board. Bonk found support at $0.0000165, as Solana’s memecoin market continues to struggle. The broader bearish trend, fueled by weak investor confidence and macroeconomic concerns, has kept Bonk under pressure, although buying interest seems to have started ramping up once again. This is mainly reflected by the 40% jump in 24-hour trading volume, reflecting stronger confidence and market participation, with over $166 million worth of BONK traded across platforms. While uncertainty is still prevalent, analysts expect Bonk to test the $0.000020 resistance, and a break above this mark, followed by a reclaim of the $0.000026 level would shift momentum in favor of bulls, potentially sparking a relief rally. The Rollblock Presale Is Live, Join Before The Next Price Increase So far, more than $10 million has been raised in the ongoing presale, and stage 10 is selling out quickly. Analysts expect a legendary 100x moonshot once the presale wraps up and RBLK is listed on major exchanges. With tokens selling at just $0.053, investors should consider adding this gem to their long-term portfolio, as now is the perfect time to take action!

According to publicly available documents, the meeting will be held remotely and at the SEC’s headquarters in Washington, D.C. As this meeting is not open to the public, speculation has emerged regarding the potential discussion of digital assets, particularly XRP. Crypto analyst AllinCrypto recently highlighted this development, noting that XRP is directly referenced in related documents for the meeting. The SEC will hold another Sunshine Act meeting on February 27. This time, $XRP is directly mentioned in related documents for discussion at the meeting. [SOURCE: https://t.co/jdFXVT3sre ] pic.twitter.com/OkdjLTlsJk — ALLINCRYPTO (@RealAllinCrypto) February 24, 2025 Specifically, the agenda includes discussions on the institution and settlement of injunctive actions, the institution and settlement of administrative proceedings, and other matters relating to enforcement proceedings. While the SEC has not explicitly stated whether XRP will be a central topic of discussion, a separate filing related to a proposed XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) further fuels speculation. Bitwise XRP ETF Proposal and SEC Considerations A filing submitted by Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. on February 6, 2025, proposes the listing and trading of the Bitwise XRP ETF . The proposal falls under BZX Rule 14.11(e)(4), which governs the listing and trading of Commodity-Based Trust Shares. The sponsor of the trust, Bitwise Investment Advisers, LLC, has filed a registration statement with the SEC to make the ETF available to investors. The filing states that the trust does not function as an investment company under the Investment Company Act 1940 and is not classified as a commodity pool under the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). Additionally, the sponsor is not subject to regulation as a commodity pool operator or commodity trading adviser. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Since 2017, the SEC has assessed and ruled on various exchange filings related to spot-based Commodity-Based Trust Shares, often evaluating whether the listing exchange has a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement with a regulated market of significant size. The same criteria will likely apply to the Bitwise XRP ETF proposal. Implications of the SEC Meeting and XRP’s Regulatory Status The timing of the SEC’s Sunshine Act Meeting and the XRP ETF filing has drawn attention, as the regulatory agency continues to navigate enforcement actions and policy decisions regarding digital assets. The closed nature of the meeting suggests that sensitive legal and regulatory matters will be addressed, which could have implications for the broader cryptocurrency market. For XRP, the SEC’s stance remains a focal point following its ongoing legal battle with Ripple Labs. While the proposed ETF is separate from Ripple’s activities, any discussion or decision regarding XRP-related financial products could signal the agency’s evolving position on the asset’s classification and market participation. Market participants and analysts will closely watch for post-meeting developments or additional regulatory filings that may provide insight into the SEC’s considerations.

More importantly, investors withdrew funds from U.S.-listed spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) at an unprecedented rate. The 11 spot ETFs registered a cumulative net outflow of $937.78 million, the most significant single-day redemption since the funds began trading in January 2024, according to data tracked by SoSoValue . Fidelity's FBTC saw the most outflow, totaling $344.65 million, followed by $164.37 million in redemptions from BlackRock's IBIT. The remaining funds registered outflows of less than $100 million each. The weakening appetite for these ETFs could be attributed to the decline in the premium in the CME-listed bitcoin futures, which has dented the appeal of the cash and carry arbitrage. Moreover, these BTC and ETH carry trades now offer barely more than the U.S. 10-year Treasury note, which offered a yield of 4.32% at press time. The strategy, heavily favored by institutions since early last year, involves buying the spot ETF and simultaneously selling the CME futures to pocket the premium while bypassing the price direction risks. According to Velo Data, the annualized one-month basis (premium) in the CME bitcoin futures dropped to 4% Tuesday, the lowest in nearly two years, and down significantly from almost 15% in December. In other words, the yield available on the cash and carry strategy has declined dramatically in two months. The basis in ether futures has also declined sharply to around 5%. The spot ether ETFs listed in the U.S. witnessed a total outflow of $50 million Tuesday.",Markets|Bitcoin|Bitcoin ETF,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-26 05:43:12

Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s recent price drop below $90,000 triggered a sell-off in US spot ETFs and sent Strategy’s stock plummeting. This caused some concerns about the sustainability of its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy. Despite volatility, analysts are still optimistic about Strategy’s long-term prospects. GameStop received a proposal from Strive Asset Management urging it to also allocate its cash reserves into Bitcoin. ECB Adviser Criticizes Bitcoin’s Economic Utility An adviser to the European Central Bank (ECB) recently reiterated the institution’s negative stance on Bitcoin (BTC), and countered discussions in the United States about the potential creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Jürgen Schaaf , an ECB adviser, argued that national Bitcoin reserves are a risky idea, and said that the cryptocurrency lacks any real economic necessity or relevant usage compared to traditional reserves like oil and gas. Schaaf’s position is very similar to ECB President Christine Lagarde’s recent statements , in which she dismissed the possibility of Bitcoin being added to central bank reserves across Europe. According to Schaaf, strategic reserves typically serve a purpose beyond speculation, like stabilizing import prices or securing raw materials. He also pointed out that reducing public debt is a priority for Europe and the US rather than pursuing investments in volatile assets. Jürgen Schaaf The ECB adviser also mentioned Bitcoin’s extreme volatility, illicit use, and susceptibility to manipulation as reasons why it is unsuitable for central banks. He dismissed the notion that Bitcoin could stabilize the euro or provide any significant benefit to financial institutions by arguing instead that it will encourage speculation and wealth redistribution. Beyond Bitcoin, Schaaf ruled out the idea of central banks holding diversified crypto asset reserves, and stated that adding multiple cryptocurrencies will only amplify concerns about volatility and speculative exposure. He held firm that digital assets very often lack fundamental economic utility, making them an impractical choice for central banks. His remarks were made at a time of turbulence in the crypto markets, with $1.5 billion in liquidations recorded over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin also saw a sharp decline, and even dropped below $88,000 for the first time since mid-November. Despite the ECB’s skepticism, some Bitcoin advocates still argue that the crypto could play a role in managing national debt. Asset management firm VanEck suggested in December that the US could reduce its national debt by 35% over the next 24 years if it created a reserve of one million BTC. This estimation aligns with a bill proposed by Senator Cynthia Lummis, who has long advocated for Bitcoin’s adoption as a financial tool for the US government. On the other hand, skeptics are still concerned whether Bitcoin accumulation will actually have any meaningful impact on the country’s rising $35 trillion debt. Bitcoin Drop Hits Strategy’s Stock Price Just how volatile Bitcoin can be was brought to light by the latest market downturn. Shares of Strategy declined by close to 16% since the start of the year, thanks to Bitcoin’s ongoing market correction. The drop in the company’s stock price reignited concerns about the sustainability of its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy. Strategy stock price over the past month (Source: Google Finance ) The Kobeissi Letter , a market analysis firm, pointed out that Strategy’s business model heavily depends on its ability to raise additional capital, using its growing Bitcoin treasury as collateral. Analysts warned that if the company’s liabilities were to surpass its assets significantly, its ability to secure more funding could be jeopardized. Despite these concerns, stock analysts are still optimistic about Strategy’s potential for a recovery. On Feb. 6, analysts at Benchmark raised the company’s price target to $650, due to their confidence that it will continue to aggressively raise capital to fuel its Bitcoin accumulation strategy throughout the year. Since 2020, Strategy spent more than $33 billion buying Bitcoin at an average cost of around $66,000 per coin, leading to an unrealized profit of more than $10 billion. The company financed its Bitcoin purchases through a mix of stock issuances and approximately $9.5 billion in convertible debt. With most of its debt not maturing until 2027 or later, Strategy faces minimal risk of being forced to liquidate its Bitcoin holdings due to short-term price fluctuations. The Kobeissi Letter mentioned that for the company to face financial distress, Bitcoin’s price will need to drop more than 50% from current levels and stay there beyond 2027. Bitcoin’s price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap) On Feb. 25, Bitcoin fell below $90,000 for the first time since November of 2024, driven by sell-offs in US spot Bitcoin ETFs. That same day, Strategy’s stock plummeted by over 10% to around $245, which was a nearly 50% decline from its all-time high of $473 in November. The stock had surged last year after the company announced its ambitious plan to buy $42 billion worth of Bitcoin by 2027. Other companies that adopted similar Bitcoin treasury strategies, like Semler Scientific, also saw big declines, with Semler’s stock dropping more than 20% since the beginning of the year. Despite the recent downturn, Benchmark analysts are confident in Strategy’s ability to generate “Bitcoin yield,” which is a metric that assesses the ratio of BTC holdings to outstanding shares. They argue that Bitcoin yield, rather than market capitalization relative to net asset value, serves as a much more meaningful indicator of the company’s financial health. Strategy is aiming for a Bitcoin yield of 15% in 2025. Bitcoin Treasury Could Transform GameStop GameStop Corp recently acknowledged that it received a letter from Strive Asset Management urging the company to invest its $4.6 billion cash reserves into Bitcoin. CEO Ryan Cohen confirmed on Feb. 26 that he received the proposal from Strive CEO Matt Cole, who suggested GameStop use market offerings to fund additional Bitcoin purchases. The idea attracted reactions from many industry figures, including Swan Bitcoin’s John Haar who stated that such a move will shock traditional finance investors who dismissed both Bitcoin and GameStop as speculative assets. GameStop became a big name in the 2020 and 2021 meme stock frenzy, with its stock surging nearly 11,500% during that period. More recently, reports surfaced on Feb. 13 that the company was exploring investments in Bitcoin and alternative assets. Cole’s letter reinforced this, advising GameStop to buy more Bitcoin through equity issuances and convertible debt while cutting losses by shutting down underperforming stores and expanding its online presence. According to Cole, a Bitcoin treasury will transform GameStop from a meme stock into a market leader by offering a hedge against inflation and securing long-term shareholder value. He also recommended that GameStop avoid investing in other cryptocurrencies. Cohen’s engagement with the Bitcoin community raised speculation about GameStop’s potential shift in strategy, particularly after he was recently pictured with Michael Saylor, chairman of Strategy. Strategy’s approach has already inspired other firms like Metaplanet and Semler Scientific to follow suit.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-26 05:49:36

This downturn led to the liquidation of over $129 million in leveraged long SOL futures positions. Despite a brief recovery to the $140 range, SOL has depreciated by 17% since February 22, while the broader altcoin market saw a 10% decline. Declining On-Chain Activity A notable factor contributing to SOL’s underperformance is the reduction in on-chain activity. Decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes on the Solana network have decreased by 30% over the past week, hitting their lowest levels since October 2024. Platforms such as Meteora and Raydium experienced activity drops of 48% and 28%, respectively. In contrast, Ethereum’s DEX volumes increased by 40% during the same period, indicating a shift in trader preference. Staking Yields and Inflation Concerns Solana’s staking yields are also under scrutiny. While the native staking offers a 9.5% yield, an anticipated 10% annualized inflation rate—due to the scheduled unlocking of over 16.1 million SOL tokens between February and May 2024—effectively results in a negative return for stakers during this period. This inflationary pressure may deter potential investors and stakers, further impacting SOL’s price stability. Weak Demand in Derivatives Market The derivatives market reflects a diminished demand for leveraged long positions on SOL futures, reaching its lowest levels in over a year. On February 24, SOL futures entered backwardation, indicating increased demand for short positions. The total open interest on SOL futures contracts decreased by 8.5%, from 31.6 million SOL to 28.9 million SOL, suggesting traders’ reduced confidence in a near-term price rebound.

The digital asset space is evolving fast, with projects disrupting industries and creating wealth-generating opportunities. SEI, trading at $0.265445, dipped 3.29% but surged 18% weekly, signaling bullish momentum. Theta, at $1.11, dropped 11.91%, yet AI integrations and EdgeCloud upgrades hint at major growth. Meanwhile, Qubetics ($TICS) is redefining blockchain interoperability, bridging major networks to solve cross-chain challenges—real-world innovation with billion-dollar potential, making it one of the top crypto presale . Qubetics: Redefining Interoperability in Blockchain Qubetics isn’t just another crypto project—it’s the missing piece in the blockchain puzzle. By solving interoperability issues, it enables seamless asset transfers, smart contract execution, and cross-chain communication between networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. This breakthrough eliminates fragmentation, making the entire crypto ecosystem more efficient. Think about businesses managing transactions across different blockchains. A company dealing in digital assets might need to transfer value between Solana and Ethereum but face delays due to inefficiencies. Qubetics changes that by acting as a decentralized bridge, allowing instant, cost-effective transactions. Similarly, decentralized applications (dApps) no longer need to limit themselves to a single blockchain, opening up limitless opportunities. Qubetics is currently in its 23rd presale stage, with over $14.1 million raised and more than 489 million $TICS tokens sold. The current price sits at $0.0888, and as the project moves closer to its mainnet launch, demand continues to surge. With such strong fundamentals, this could be one of the top crypto presale of the decade. SEI: The Rising Star of Scalable Blockchain Infrastructure SEI Network is making waves in the crypto space with its unique approach to scalability. Designed as the first blockchain specialized for trading, SEI optimizes speed and efficiency for financial applications. Its lightning-fast transaction finality and low fees make it an ideal choice for decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, NFT marketplaces, and high-frequency trading. Recent market trends indicate strong momentum for SEI. Although its price recently dipped to $0.265445, it has surged 18% over the past week, breaking key resistance levels and attracting significant trading volume. Analysts predict that the project’s continued growth and upcoming integrations could make it a dominant force in blockchain trading infrastructure. With this bullish outlook, SEI price prediction remains optimistic, positioning it as a strong contender in the evolving crypto landscape. Theta Network: The Future of Decentralized Streaming Theta Network has long been a key player in decentralized streaming, but its recent innovations are pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in video content delivery. The introduction of AI-driven enhancements, like DeepSeek-R1, is making Theta’s infrastructure smarter, optimizing content distribution for users worldwide. Despite a recent 11.91% decline in its price to $1.11, Theta remains on track for growth. New EdgeCloud upgrades and a steady influx of strategic partnerships position it well for long-term success. As the demand for decentralized video streaming grows, Theta’s real-time, peer-to-peer content delivery model ensures that creators and consumers benefit from a more efficient, cost-effective alternative to traditional platforms. Conclusion: Seizing the Next Big Opportunity The cryptocurrency space is full of opportunities, but only those who act early benefit from the biggest gains. Qubetics, with its unmatched interoperability, is solving a problem that has long plagued blockchain networks. SEI’s trading-focused infrastructure is already proving its worth with strong adoption, and SEI price prediction remains optimistic. Meanwhile, Theta is setting the stage for a revolution in decentralized streaming. These aren’t just projects; they’re the next wave of blockchain innovation.

The exchange recently secured registration with Indian authorities, allowing it to resume operations in the country after a compliance-related suspension. At the same time, Bybit is actively responding to a $1.4 billion hack attributed to the North Korea-linked Lazarus Group. Bybit Resumes Operations in India After Government Registration, Overcomes Historic $1.4B Hack Cryptocurrency exchange Bybit has officially registered with Indian government authorities, marking a significant milestone in its compliance efforts within the country. This development comes after the exchange was fined by India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) on Jan. 31 for violating the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). As of Feb. 25, Bybit has restored all services to users in India, signaling its renewed commitment to operating within the country's regulatory framework. Bybit had initially suspended its services in India weeks before receiving the fine, citing concerns about compliance with local regulations. According to the FIU report, Bybit continued expanding its operations in the Indian market without obtaining the necessary registration, leading to a 9.27 crore rupee ($1.06 million) penalty. The persistent non-compliance ultimately prompted the FIU to block access to Bybit’s website under the Information Technology Act, effectively halting its operations in India. With its new registration, Bybit has now taken the necessary steps to align with Indian regulatory requirements, enabling it to resume business in one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency markets. Bybit’s return to India also shows the exchange’s broader commitment to regulatory adherence. With over 60 million users worldwide and operations in 1,174 markets, Bybit is a major player in the crypto trading space, making its compliance efforts in key jurisdictions vital for its long-term success. Bybit’s regulatory victory in India follows one of the most significant security breaches in cryptocurrency history. On Feb. 21, 2025, just days before the exchange resumed operations in India, it fell victim to a devastating hack by the North Korean-affiliated Lazarus Group. The attack resulted in the theft of over $1.4 billion worth of Ether (ETH)-related tokens, making it the largest crypto theft ever recorded. The breach exposed critical security vulnerabilities in centralized exchanges, with analysts highlighting the increasing sophistication of cybercriminal tactics in the crypto industry. Cybersecurity experts noted that the attack demonstrated the use of highly creative exploits, posing a growing challenge for even the most advanced security systems. Bybit’s Recovery and Financial Stability Despite the scale of the attack, Bybit swiftly responded to the crisis. By Feb. 22, an independent audit confirmed that the exchange still had more reserves than liabilities, ensuring the safety of user funds. However, the impact on Bybit’s assets was significant, with a reported $5.3 billion drop due to the hack and subsequent withdrawals. Bybit CEO Ben Zhou reassured users that the exchange had stabilized. On Feb. 22, he announced that withdrawals had returned to a normal pace, and the platform had successfully addressed the immediate aftermath of the security breach. In a public statement, Zhou expressed gratitude for the support received from the crypto community, stating, “Within 24 hours of the event, we were overwhelmed with support from some of the best people and organizations in the industry, and we do not take it for granted. We have shared in a dark moment of crypto history.” Bybit’s ability to navigate both regulatory and security challenges shows its resilience as a leading global cryptocurrency exchange. Its successful re-entry into the Indian market positions it for potential growth in a country with a rapidly expanding crypto user base, despite ongoing regulatory uncertainties. The exchange’s handling of the Lazarus Group hack also demonstrates its ability to withstand major security breaches while maintaining financial stability. Moving forward, Bybit will likely intensify its security protocols to prevent future attacks and reinforce trust among its users. As the crypto industry continues to evolve, exchanges like Bybit must balance regulatory compliance, security enhancements, and user confidence to thrive in an increasingly scrutinized and competitive landscape. Whether Bybit’s recent challenges serve as a learning experience or a harbinger of further struggles remains to be seen, but its latest developments shed light on the high stakes involved in the world of digital assets. Bybit CEO Declares War on Hackers After $1.4 Billion Crypto Heist In related news, less than a week after one of the largest hacks in cryptocurrency history, Bybit’s co-founder and CEO Ben Zhou has vowed to take decisive action against the perpetrators. The cryptocurrency exchange is now mobilizing efforts to track down and recover the stolen funds. In a Feb. 25 post on X, Zhou urged the crypto community to rally behind Bybit in a campaign against the North Korea-affiliated hacking group known as Lazarus. As part of this initiative, Bybit has launched a dedicated bounty website that offers financial rewards for those who help intercept illegally moved funds. “We have assigned a team to maintain and update this website, and we will not stop until Lazarus and bad actors in the industry are eliminated,” said Zhou. “In the future, we will open it up to other victims of Lazarus as well.” According to the bounty program, individuals who freeze stolen assets will be entitled to a 5% reward, while those who successfully recover funds will receive a 10% bounty—potentially amounting to as much as $140 million. Renowned blockchain security investigator ZachXBT identified Lazarus as the orchestrator of the Feb. 21 breach, which resulted in the theft of significant sums of liquid-staked Ether (stETH), Mantle Staked ETH (mETH), and other ERC-20 tokens. Bybit responded on Feb. 23, stating that it had fully replaced the stolen crypto and that client assets were back to 100% 1:1 reserves. While some firms opt to negotiate with hackers and offer them bounties in exchange for the return of stolen assets, Zhou’s aggressive stance signals a shift in how major exchanges handle cyber threats. Bybit’s call for a coordinated effort to combat the Lazarus Group could potentially make it a target for future attacks, heightening the need for advanced security measures. A Growing History of Crypto Heists Linked to North Korea North Korean-backed hackers have been responsible for stealing over $3 billion from cryptocurrency exchanges between 2017 and 2023, according to security reports. The Bybit breach stands as the most costly single exploit in the industry’s history, surpassing the infamous $600 million Ronin Bridge hack in 2022. Despite such alarming figures, blockchain security firm PeckShield reported in January 2024 that the number of hacks and scams has been declining since 2022. The firm attributed this trend to increased security awareness and improved defenses within the crypto ecosystem. However, phishing scams remain a significant threat, with billions lost to fraudulent schemes in recent years. The Bybit hack serves as a stark reminder of the persistent security challenges in the crypto space. While the exchange’s quick action to replace stolen assets demonstrates financial resilience, the broader implications of such an attack cannot be ignored. Industry leaders may need to reassess existing security protocols, strengthen defense mechanisms, and explore collaborative initiatives to mitigate the risks posed by state-sponsored cybercriminals. With Bybit now leading the charge against Lazarus, the crypto community will be watching closely to see whether the bounty initiative yields results—or if further security breaches will test the industry’s ability to combat increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|ASIA,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-26 06:00:00

Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan claimed in a post that the memecoin craze will end in six months. Bitwise Chief Investment Officer (CIO) Matt Hougan said in a post on X that he believes Bitcoin, which fell below $90,000 to its lowest level in the last three months, will recover, but that the end of memecoins is coming. Hougan stated that the market crash was caused by memcoins rather than Bitcoin's performance. According to Hougan, the crypto market is currently facing the decline of memecoins such as MELANIA, launched by the US First Lady, and LIBRA, which has been at the center of controversy after being supported by Argentine President Javier Milei. This decline was further exacerbated by the use of memecoins by the North Korean hacker group Lazarus, which carried out the Bybit hack, to launder stolen Ethereum (ETH). At this point, Hougan stated that the news and negativity about memecoins contributed to the recent decline, and predicted that the memecoin boom would end within six months for these reasons. However, Hougan argued that there is more upside to come in the broader perspective, with Bitcoin’s increasing institutional adoption, the rise of stablecoins, tokenization and the resurgence of decentralized finance (DeFi). “What the crypto industry is digesting right now is the end of the memecoin boom. Melania, Libra and Lazarus Group's use of memecoins to launder stolen ETH is going to kill them. Maybe not today but in 6 months. The good news is that many factors are bullish, including institutional adoption of Bitcoin, stablecoins, tokenization, and a resurgence in DeFi. But until these factors kick-start the rally, Bitcoin and the market will remain under pressure for a while longer.” https://twitter.com/Matt_Hougan/status/1894385383942885431 *This is not investment advice.

According to the victim, the hacker sent an SMS message from the usual Binance number, where he typically receives verification codes, and attempted to lure him into transferring his assets to a Safepal wallet. A phishing SMS message hack related to the Binance exchange has re-emerged days after Bybit experienced one of the largest crypto exchange hacks in history. Joe Zhou, a Web3 expert from Hong Kong, flagged the hacking technique through a LinkedIn post after falling victim to a phishing message. Je Zhou falls victim to a Binance-related phishing attack According to Joe Zhou, the scammers sent him a message through the usual Binance exchange number where he typically receives his verification codes. The message cautioned him that his Binance account was being accessed from North Korea, prompting him to take immediate action to attempt to save his funds from being drained from his Binance wallet after what happened to Bybit. Joe Zhou explained that he instantly called the number that had sent the SMS, and an individual he believed had a strong British accent picked up the call. The alleged scammer instructed Joe Zhou to set up a SafePal wallet, claiming that the wallet provider had partnered with Binance. The scammer sent Joe Zhou an article published by Binance on the SafePal wallet and managed to convince him that the partnership was real. The scammer then continuously asked Joe Zhou how much was in his Binance account and solicited him to transfer all the funds to the newly created SafePal wallet. Joe Zhou, unaware of the hack, began to transfer funds to the new wallet following the instructions from the hacker. However, he was reluctant about the entire scene and decided to consult his friend who works at Binance. The friend instantly informed him that he was being scammed. “I followed the instructions to set up a wallet and started withdrawing my funds out of my Binance account. But I already sensed something was wrong. Luckily I have my good friend Carlos M. from Binance. I checked with him and realized I had been scammed.” ~ Joe Zhou Joe Zhou began transferring funds from the SafePal wallet in an attempt to retrieve his digital assets. According to the victim, the scammer realized he was sending his funds back to the Binance exchange account and began moving the funds as well. Zhou explained that he finally ran out of gas fees during the last transaction, after which the hacker sent some ETH as gas to the wallet and withdrew the remaining funds. At the end of the ordeal, Zhou said he lost only 200U and cautioned his LinkedIn audience to be smart and always be on the lookout. Binance exchange impersonation hacks are not new This type of phishing hack is not new to the Binance exchange. Binance Risk Sniper, a verified Binance official account, published an article dated November 2024 that detailed a similar phishing attack. According to the article, a fake Binance SMS attack was sweeping users in Sweden, Lithuania, and other European countries. The article explained that scammers impersonate Binance and send SMS messages to users, falsely claiming that their accounts have security breaches, like abnormal API issues. The messages aim to create panic and anxiety among Binance users and guide them to communicate directly with them, as recently happened to Joe Zhou. The scammers then convince users to transfer their funds to a TrustWallet that they claim will ensure the security of the users’ assets. The scammers develop this wallet in advance and give the victims its seed phrase while presenting it as a secure alternative. Unfortunately, the wallet remains in the full control of the scammers. Once users transfer their funds to this TrustWallet, the scammers immediately gain access to the assets through the provided seed phrase and withdraw instantly.

According to data from SoSoValue, the 12 spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETFs saw a total of $937.78 million in net outflows on Feb. 25—their highest single-day outflow since launch—significantly surpassing the previous record of $680 million in net outflows on Dec. 19, 2024. The majority of outflows came from Fidelity’s FBTC, which saw $344.65 million exit the fund, marking its highest daily outflow since launch. BlackRock’s IBIT followed with $164.37 million in net redemptions. Data for ARK 21Shares’ ARKB was unavailable at the time of reporting, but other ETFs that recorded outflows included: Bitwise’s BITB: $88.3 million Grayscale’s Mini Bitcoin Trust: $85.76 million Franklin Templeton’s EZBC: $74.07 million Grayscale’s GBTC: $66.14 million Invesco Galaxy’s BTCO: $62.01 million Valkyrie’s BRRR: $25.19 million WisdomTree’s BTCW: $17.3 million VanEck’s HODL: $9.97 million Despite the sell-off, daily trading volume for spot Bitcoin ETFs surged nearly 167% from the previous day , reaching $7.74 billion. Since their launch, these ETFs have still accumulated a net inflow of $38.08 billion overall. You might also like: Bitcoin slips below $90K triggering $1B in crypto liquidations Market factors driving the sell-off The ongoing sell-off appears to be driven by Bitcoin dropping below the critical $90,000 level, alongside growing concerns over Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods set to take effect in March. If a 25% tariff on U.S. imports is enforced, it could lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth, putting pressure on the Federal Reserve to respond. The Fed has maintained that it will only cut interest rates when inflation moves closer to its 2% target, but recent data suggests inflation is moving in the opposite direction. On-chain data signals increased selling pressure On-chain data from Santiment shows that more Bitcoin is moving onto exchanges , while whale holdings in non-exchange wallets are declining. This shift suggests that large investors who were previously accumulating BTC are now transferring their holdings to exchanges, which often signals potential selling pressure. A key metric, BTC supply held by funds, is also dropping, indicating that institutional investors are reducing their Bitcoin holdings. This aligns with the negative net flows in spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have seen outflows on 12 of the last 16 trading days, totaling approximately $2.41 billion since early February. Analyst insights: Is this just a temporary dip? Commenting on the downturn in BTC ETFs, Matt Mena, a crypto research strategist at 21Shares, told crypto.news that while some investors fear Bitcoin has peaked, both on-chain and macro indicators suggest the market is still in the early-to-mid bull cycle. Mena noted that despite this pullback, crypto is still up over 50% from last year, demonstrating its long-term resilience. With Bitcoin now down 18% from its recent highs, Mena views this correction as a “temporary reset—not the end of the cycle.” He believes it presents a strategic re-entry point for investors who hesitated to enter the market after the election. “Historically, crypto has punished those who hesitate at key dips. The window for accumulation may not last long,” Mena concluded. Read more: Why is crypto down today?

According to the company’s latest update , it picked up 41,032 shares of Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) valued at $9.3 million. The newest purchase comes a little over two months after the Cathie Woods -led firm offloaded $4.3 million worth of COIN stocks in late December. The buying activity transpired with the ARK Next Generation Internet exchange-traded fund, an actively managed ETF product that seeks long-term capital growth by investing primarily in domestic and foreign equity securities of companies relevant to the fund’s investment theme of next-generation Internet. ARK Invest bought the dip as Coinbase shares have struggled over the past week. As previously reported by crypto.news, COIN shares dropped over 5% after BofA Securities slashed its price target from $363 to $311, citing growing competition and pressure on revenue. Analysts warned that traditional financial firms entering the crypto space could squeeze Coinbase’s transaction revenue, which remains its primary income stream. At press time, Google Finance data indicated that COIN closed at $212.49 on Feb. 25, down 6.42% for the day and over 20% in the past week. Coinbase stocks also struggled as the crypto market faced turbulence , with billions in liquidations over $1 billion in liquidations in the past 24 hours triggered by Donald Trump’s confirmation of new tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, along with a 10% tariff on Chinese goods.

Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 1.35%. Yet ARK Invest seems to be bullish on Coinbase, likely due to the fact the company posted stronger-than-expected Q4 earnings , which represented a 138% increase from 2023 and beat the $1.88 billion estimate from LSEG analysts. Further, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has dropped its lawsuit against Coinbase, which was one of the commission’s biggest crypto-related enforcement actions under former chair Gary Gensler. ARK Invest also offloaded 98,060 shares of the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) from its ARKW fund. The sell-off was valued at approximately $8.6 million based on the ETF’s closing price of $87.86 on Tuesday.

It’s all about learning how to spot undervalued potential blue chips and presale gems that have barely scratched the surface of their moon potential. 3 cheap cryptos set to pump in February 2025 We’ve drilled down on these exciting new and affordable tokens with the value proposition, fundamentals, and momentum to pump heavily at a low entry price this February 2025. Bitcoin Pepe : Fast-rising L2 protocol ushering in “Solana on Bitcoin” iDEGEN : Groundbreaking AI agent on the rise TST: Test token from BNB chain tutorial pumping hard Bitcoin Pepe: Fast-rising L2 protocol ushering in “Solana on Bitcoin” When people think of crypto, the first thing that comes to mind is “Bitcoin.” Its followers—the Bitcoin Maximalists—have built an unshakable belief that Bitcoin is the one true coin, the only one that truly matters. However, while Bitcoin is a great store of value, its slow transaction speeds and high feed make it terrible for trading. Hence why no degen fun takes place on the OG chain, despite its great reputation and rock-solid security. That is, of course, until the much-awaited launch of Bitcoin Pepe —the definitive Layer-2 solution designed to bring the speed, low fees, and scalability of Solana directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. Powered by its own token, BPEP, Bitcoin Pepe introduces the new PEP-20 token standards that will allow users to trade meme coins on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. Just imagine the unparalleled advantage of being the token enabling trillions of dollars in liquidity that’s just sitting unused in Bitcoin’s ecosystem to flow freely into the booming meme coin sector. The pump for BPEP and the broader meme economy could be the spark that ignites and powers forward the memecoin supercycle . The best part? BPEP is available at a presale price of just $0.21. That’s a steal for anyone looking to get in early on a project that could be the harbinger of the most prosperous meme coin season ever. To learn more and to buy Bitcoin Pepe, check out the official website . iDEGEN: Groundbreaking AI agent on the rise AI agents were at the heart of every crypto discussion in Q4 2024—and that conversation isn’t changing anytime soon. While the initial hype about AI crypto projects has started to taper off a bit, nothing will change the fact that AI will play a huge role in the next bull run. As evidenced by the fast rise of the revolutionary AI agent iDEGEN—an AI agent with no chill, no restrictions, and no woke mind virus programming. It’s out there, doing its thing—tweeting, posting memes, creating videos, and sharing trading tips on the hour, every hour. It trained its large language models on the collective knowledge of degens on X. It’s raw, it’s real, and it’s ready to lead the charge. With the release of iDEGEN’s V3 update, the agent can now automatically generate video content. And it’s everywhere—Telegram, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube… and that’s just the beginning. But here’s where things get really exciting: iDEGEN is the first AI agent to run on RedNote, a Chinese social platform, and it’s the first to tap into DeepSeek—the disruptive Chinese AI tech that sent the markets into disarray earlier this month. The result? Two iDEGEN agents running side by side. One powered by “American” tech, the other by “Chinese” DeepSeek tech. It’s a true battle of AI ideologies mirroring the real-world competition between the U.S. and China for AI supremacy. This all sets the stage for its native token IDGN for a potential parabolic run in 2025. With its native token launching at a discount of just $0.01, IDGN has now risen to $0.0314. The window to buying into this blue chip is closing fast. With IDGN set to launch 27th February , don’t let this train leave the station without you. Visit the iDEGEN website to learn more. TST: Test token from BNB chain tutorial pumping hard The crypto market is full of surprises—and when a token captures the fancy of traders, there’s no telling where it could go. Case in point: traders pumped a test token created by the BNB Chain team for a tutorial video past a $200 million market cap at its all-time high last week. That test token is fittingly called TST, and it was created for a step-by-step video walkthrough on how to mint new meme coins on Four.Meme, a meme coin launchpad on BNB. The name of the meme coin was caught on a frame on the training video, which was promptly removed by the BNB team upon discovery. However, Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao asked the team to put the video back up while the TST token was sitting at a $500,000 market cap—until settling to a $100 million market cap as of press time. Suffice to say, quick-thinking speculators are already sitting on parabolic gains by simply striking whilst the iron is hot. The final word Fortunes are made at the drop of a hat in the world of crypto—but you have to keep your ears on the ground to find opportunities like Bitcoin Pepe, iDEGEN, and TST. All three give you an excellent chance at outperforming the rest of the market this year without having to break the bank to do so. But among the three, Bitcoin Pepe and iDEGEN offer the highest upside and ROIs for the lowest capital outlay.",Sponsored,EN,0,0,BTC|BNB|MARKET|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-26 07:14:25

40852480,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=134233,1740554401,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,The MicroStrategy Liquidation: Could They Be Forced to Sell Bitcoin?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/the-microstrategy-liquidation/,"Understanding the MicroStrategy Liquidation Concerns MicroStrategy ($MSTR), the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, has seen its stock price plummet by more than 55% recently. With over 499,096 BTC valued at around $43.7 billion , concerns about a potential forced liquidation have resurfaced. The key question remains: Is liquidation even possible? And if so, under what conditions? MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Holdings and Acquisition Strategy MicroStrategy’s average Bitcoin acquisition cost stands at $66,350 per BTC . The company’s aggressive accumulation of Bitcoin has positioned it as a proxy for Bitcoin exposure in the stock market. However, its ability to sustain this model depends heavily on the following factors: Capital raising through convertible notes The price of Bitcoin relative to their average purchase price Market confidence in MicroStrategy’s financial health Given this framework, a significant drop in Bitcoin’s price could have serious implications for MicroStrategy’s financial position. The Role of Debt in MicroStrategy’s Strategy MicroStrategy has $8.2 billion in total debt , while holding $43.4 billion worth of Bitcoin . Their leverage ratio currently sits around 19% , which is not dangerously high compared to traditional financial leverage models. Most of MicroStrategy’s debt is structured in the form of convertible notes , with conversion prices below the current share price . Additionally, the majority of these notes do not mature until 2028 , giving the company some breathing room. Key Question: Does This Debt Structure Lead to Forced Liquidation? The short answer: Not immediately. A “forced liquidation” scenario would require MicroStrategy’s debt holders to call for early redemption , which can only happen under specific conditions. Can MicroStrategy Be Forced to Sell Its Bitcoin? To understand whether MicroStrategy could be forced to liquidate its Bitcoin holdings , we need to analyze its credit agreements and potential triggers for liquidation. The main risk factor would be a “fundamental change” in the company. This could include: Corporate bankruptcy A shareholder vote to dissolve the company Failure to meet debt obligations upon maturity At the moment, none of these conditions appear imminent. Michael Saylor’s Response to Liquidation Concerns Michael Saylor, co-founder and Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy , has remained unwaveringly bullish on Bitcoin. In a recent statement, he dismissed liquidation concerns by saying: “Even if Bitcoin fell to $1, we still would not get liquidated. We would just buy all of the Bitcoin.” While this statement showcases confidence, it doesn’t address the potential risk of convertible note holders demanding early redemption. Could Bitcoin’s Price Trigger a Liquidation Event? For MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings to be at significant risk, Bitcoin’s price would need to fall well below their average acquisition price ($66,350) and remain there for an extended period. Here’s what could happen if Bitcoin sees a major price decline: If Bitcoin drops 50% from current levels , MicroStrategy’s ability to raise new capital could become severely constrained. If Bitcoin remains below $33,000 for an extended period, investors may start questioning the company’s ability to continue its Bitcoin acquisition strategy. If MicroStrategy cannot roll over its debt or raise capital through stock issuance , the risk of forced liquidation increases. Michael Saylor’s Voting Power and Shareholder Decisions One major factor protecting MicroStrategy from forced liquidation is Michael Saylor’s control over 46.8% of the company’s voting power . This means that no liquidation or fundamental change can occur without Saylor’s approval . Even if external pressures mount, Saylor holds enough power to block any forced asset liquidation through a shareholder vote. Is MicroStrategy’s Strategy Sustainable in a Bear Market? A crucial part of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin accumulation strategy relies on continuous capital raises , which fund further BTC purchases. However, in a prolonged bear market: Investor appetite for new shares may decline , limiting capital inflows. Debt holders may demand higher interest rates or stricter terms if MicroStrategy seeks additional financing. MicroStrategy’s ability to sustain operations without liquidating Bitcoin would be tested. Final Verdict: Will MicroStrategy Be Forced to Liquidate? Unlikely in the short term: The debt structure and voting power favor MicroStrategy’s ability to weather volatility. Possible in extreme conditions: If Bitcoin falls well below $30,000 for years and capital raising becomes impossible, then risks rise. Investor sentiment matters: If market confidence in MicroStrategy’s strategy deteriorates, stock dilution and debt restructuring could become problematic. For now, MicroStrategy is not at immediate risk of forced liquidation , but its financial health is directly tied to Bitcoin’s price performance. Conclusion MicroStrategy remains a high-risk, high-reward play on Bitcoin . While its strategy is aggressive, its debt structure and Saylor’s control make a forced liquidation unlikely—unless extreme financial distress occurs . The biggest question moving forward is whether investors will continue to support MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy in a prolonged bear market . As of now, the company is betting that Bitcoin will eventually reach new highs , making its strategy sustainable in the long run. Michael Saylor remains confident, but as history has shown, Bitcoin’s volatility can test even the most dedicated believers.

40852558,https://coingape.com/?post_type=trending&p=241008,1740554587,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,"Solana (SOL) Investors Fearful after Price Crashes 40%, What’s Next?",https://coingape.com/trending/solana-sol-investors-fearful-after-price-crashes-40-whats-next/,"Despite setbacks, bear markets, and other factors, Solana has maintained its position among the top-performing cryptocurrencies. However, its recent downtrend concerns investors, as the Solana (SOL) price has declined nearly 50% from its 2024 high of $264. More importantly, the price has dropped 15% over the week and 40% over the month, which is concerning. Although this altcoin’s decline came with the broader market’s crash, investor sentiments have triggered fear, so what’s next? Solana Sentiments Turn Bearish Despite Price Recovery After a 40% crash over the month and hitting a four-month low of $134.69, the Solana price has gained a minor recovery. At present, it trades at $142.39 after a 1.5% recovery in the last 24 hours. However, investor sentiments turned bearish amid building fear. According to the crypto analyst Ali Martinez’s conclusion , the Glassnode Net Unrealized Profit/ Loss metric reveals that the SOL investors have entered the fearful phase after spending months in greedy or optimistic sentiments. This drop is also visible in the token trading volume, which is down 18% to $13 billion. Many crypto analysts have confirmed this bearish trend, one saying: You can dip in briefly and come out with a tasty 1-2% profit at this $Solana price. If that line breaks, it’s heading to $80. Why Did Solana Price Drop in the First Place? The broader crypto market crash has severely impacted the SOL token’s price performance. However, many other factors influenced this, beginning with the LIBRA or Solana meme coin scam. Since the introduction of Pump.Fun, the number of Solana-themed meme coins has increased multiplefold. In addition, the intensity of pump-and-dump scams rose, and the LIBRA token scam is the most prominent example. This resulted in the Solana meme-themed cryptocurrencies’ market cap declining from $25 billion in January to $8.6 billion. Other factors like the drop in gas fees, DEX volume, and active address count drop show investors’ confidence has plummeted in this ecosystem. Interestingly, another significant factor to consider is the 11.2M SOL token unlocks on March 1, which created selling pressure. These unlocks would provide additional liquidity and come from the FTX distribution plan . As a result, the SOL price mat fluctuates; some believe in a possible recovery, while others believe in further consolidation. What’s Coming Next For SOL? Many crypto analysts confirm this bearish trend, with Ansem stating: The $120-$140 range is a must-hold area. Shorting after a 50% drop in a month is not a good trade, but overall, I remain bearish on most crypto assets in the high timeframe. Although the outlook is bearish, there are also indications of a possible recovery. The analysts’ Solana price prediction reveals that the token must hold the $120-$140 support for recovery. If this happens, the SOL price may rebound towards the $170 resistance. However, if Solana breaks below $120, it could test psychological support at $100. Bottom Line The investors are fearful amid Solana price struggles and the global crypto market crash. With the key support between $120 and $140, the token can either move toward $170 or $100, depending on its move from the current level. However, these moves will depend on market sentiments, ecosystem recovery, and the impact of the upcoming unlocks. Investors must analyze the SOL price further and plan strategically.

After an 18% crash in the past 48 hours, ETH price is stabilizing, anticipating a recovery. However, due to its persistent downtrend since December 16, 2024, a death cross looms. Will Ethereum price recovery to $3,000 prevent it? Will Ethereum Price Recovery to $3,000 Extinguish Fears of Death Cross? As noted above, Ethereum price has shed 43% since December 16, 2024, causing the 50-day Moving Average (MA) to slide lower, toward the 200-day MA. If the fast-moving 50-day MA crosses below the slow-moving 200-day MA, it will trigger a “death cross.” This signal suggests that the short-term momentum is waning and bearish momentum has escalated, hinting at an incoming correction. However, after such a brutal crash, Ethereum price has stabilized around $2,500 with hopes of a potential bounce as BTC plugs its selling spree . As of February 26, 2025, the four-hour chart shows the Ethereum price producing a lower low while the RSI and AO indicators are setting up a higher low. This non-conformity is called bullish divergence and hints at a potential recovery rally for the ETH price. ETH/USDT 4-hour chart If Ethereum price is successful in its recovery, it will encounter immediate resistance levels at $2,600 and $2,700. Overcoming these short-term hurdles will allow ETH to revisit the $3,000 psychological level, coinciding with the 50-day and 200-day MAs. Such a bounce will delay the death cross formation. If investor confidence is restored, then Ethereum price forecast notes ETH could even revisit the critical resistance levels at $3,100 and $3,300, respectively. Investors need to note that this bounce is tied to BTC and the broader crypto market . If Bitcoin fails to trend higher, Ethereum will follow its lead. Supporting this recovery are two key metrics – ETH Social Dominance and Development Activity. ETH Social Dominance Grows, Development Activity Spikes The social dominance metric tracks the social volume of ETH compared to the social volume of other cryptocurrencies. Since January 2025, the dominance of Ethereum has been growing steadily, with three above-average spikes at the start of the year and in February. This shows that the interest in Ethereum is growing. Despite this, Bitcoin’s social dominance towers over ETH and has seen significant growth in the past week, majorly due to the first-mover advantage that BTC has. Regardless, this steady growth for Ethereum is bullish and adds credence to the potential price recovery rally thesis noted above. Adding credence to the above is the exponential growth of the development activity of ETH. This metric doubled since the start of 2025 and currently sits at 319, which is also a bullish development. ETH Social Dominance Grows, Development Activity Spikes, Source: Santiment All in all, the outlook for Ethereum price has shown bullish signs hinting at a potential recovery rally in the works. The key levels to watch include $2,600, $2,700, followed by $3,000, $3,100 and $3,300. A successful bounce could prevent the looming death cross. The rising social dominance of ETH and its increasing development activity all support the short-term bounce of Ethereum price after a brutal sell-off last week.

Claude models are accessible through Anthropic’s API and managed platforms like Amazon Bedrock and Google Cloud’s Vertex AI. Here’s a breakdown of Anthropic API pricing: Claude Model Input Tokens (per million) Output Tokens (per million) Claude 3.5 Haiku $0.80 $4.00 Claude 3.7 Sonnet $3.00 $15.00 Claude 3 Opus $15.00 $75.00 To optimize costs, Anthropic provides prompt caching and batching features. Prompt caching allows you to store and reuse “prompt contexts,” while batching enables processing of asynchronous, low-priority inference requests at a reduced cost. These features can significantly enhance runtime efficiency and cost-effectiveness, especially for high-volume usage. Claude Plans and Apps: Choosing the Right Access Point For individual users and businesses seeking direct interaction with Claude models, Anthropic offers apps for web, Android, and iOS. They provide a tiered plan structure: Free Claude Plan : Offers basic access with rate limits and usage restrictions, ideal for initial exploration and light use. Claude Pro : At $20/month, this plan removes rate limits, provides priority access, and offers previews of new features. Suited for individual professionals and heavy users. Claude Team : Priced at $30/user/month, designed for small businesses, adding a dashboard for billing, user management, and integrations with platforms like Salesforce. Includes citation toggles for AI-generated claims and the Projects feature. Claude Enterprise : Tailored for larger organizations, enabling upload of proprietary data for analysis, larger context window (500,000 tokens), GitHub integration, Projects, and Artifacts.

Its stock has dropped more than 55% since the start of the year. This has sparked concerns about whether the company might have to sell off its large Bitcoin holdings to stay afloat. The firm holds around 499,096 BTC, valued at $43.7 billion, with an average Bitcoin purchase price of $66,350. If Bitcoin’s price drops below that average, MicroStrategy could be forced to sell some of its Bitcoin to cover its debt. https://twitter.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1894444656483533187 However, an analysis from The Kobeissi Letter suggests this is unlikely to happen. MicroStrategy’s strategy involves borrowing money with low-interest notes, buying Bitcoin to push its price up, selling shares, and then buying more Bitcoin. Even with Bitcoin recently dropping to $86,008, the company’s strategy helps reduce the risk of a big sell-off. According to The Kobeissi Letter, MicroStrategy would need Bitcoin to drop below $66,000 and stay there to be forced to sell its holdings. Despite several Bitcoin price crashes since August 2020, the company has never sold its Bitcoin and has managed to stay stable. The company holds $8.2 billion in debt backed by $43.4 billion in Bitcoin. Most of its convertible notes are due by 2027, giving the firm time to wait for the price to recover from any declines, protecting it from short-term risks. Geoff Kendrick from Standard Chartered has forecasted a potential 10% drop, linking it to outflows from U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs. While analysts like BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes also predict more price drops, the overall outlook for Bitcoin remains positive.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-26 07:37:16

CEO Responds!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/will-gamestop-buy-bitcoin-btc-with-its-5-billion-cash-ceo-responds/,"While the number of corporate companies investing in Bitcoin has been increasing recently, the latest talk is whether GameStop will buy Bitcoin. In the first days, the investment company Strive Asset Management, co-founded by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy at the DOGE Ministry, called on GameStop to buy Bitcoin. Accordingly, Strive CEO Matt Cole sent a letter to GameStop Chairman and CEO Ryan Cohen suggesting that the company convert approximately $5 billion of its cash reserves into Bitcoin. Strive CEO claimed that with this move, GamStop will become the company with the most significant Bitcoin reserves in the gaming industry. “We believe GameStop has an incredible opportunity to transform its financial future as the leading bitcoin treasury company in the gaming industry.” The Bitcoin offer sent by the Strive CEO was accepted by GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen with a brief comment. Cohen said in a post from his X account, “Letter received” but did not provide further details. The Strive CEO argued that cash has a negative real return. The CEO also stated that Bitcoin is a superior alternative and offers better returns compared to holding cash due to inflation. The CEO also urged GameStop to avoid investing in other cryptocurrencies, calling Bitcoin the only “real store of value” among digital assets. The Strive CEO’s Bitcoin proposal echoes a strategy already being implemented by major companies including MicroStrategy, Semler Scientific, and MARA Holdings. Many of the large-cap companies that have bought Bitcoin into the market have not only seen their stock prices increase, but have also opened up new avenues for capital raising. Earlier this month, it was reported that GameStop was exploring BTC and digital asset investments due to falling sales and other difficulties they were experiencing. Adding to these speculations, GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen shared a photo with MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor on social media, further fueling the discussions about GameStop's potential BTC investment. *This is not investment advice.

She added that teams and individuals across the globe have been speaking of Ethereum as if it were their own, but this tension is where the greatest strength lies: “Ethereum belongs to everyone precisely because it belongs to no one.” Today, I’m excited to turn the page and share that I will be closing this chapter as Executive Director of the @ethereumfndn soon and stepping into a new role as its President. Let’s continue building in the garden. Read my full statement : https://t.co/sn3Rpsatqy https://t.co/4Gz3WdLPLD — Aya Miyaguchi (@AyaMiyagotchi) February 25, 2025 New EF President She emphasized Ethereum’s core philosophies, which include decentralized ownership, a “Pace Layering” framework, and credible neutrality. She also reiterated the Foundation’s role: It doesn’t control all domains but works to identify gaps and uphold Ethereum’s core values. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin congratulated Aya, adding that the role of the executive director is to create an environment where others can shine and do their best work: “So every success of the EF – the steady execution of Ethereum hard forks, client interop workshops, Devcon, Ethereum’s culture and steadfast commitment to its mission and values, and more – is in part a result of Aya’s stewardship.” Miyaguchi reflected on her seven-year journey with EF, noting how Ethereum has grown from having fewer voices to becoming a diverse ecosystem that grows “like a garden, strengthened by its biodiversity.” Tensions escalated at the EF in January when there was backlash against Miyaguchi and accusations of inefficiencies during her tenure. Buterin asserted his authority, but some core developers, such as Eric Connor, jumped ship and have since started fuelling more negative sentiment against Ethereum . ETH Price Hammered Those tensions have been amplified by the underlying asset’s dire performance in recent months. Despite Bitcoin reaching a record peak in 2025, Ethereum got nowhere near its all-time high and remains 50% down from it, wallowing at the same price levels it was at this time last year. More recently, ETH tanked to $2,337 in the latest crypto market rout , its lowest price since early November, wiping out all post-US election gains. The asset is currently hovering just below $2,500 and has lost 25% since the beginning of this year despite the bullish fundamentals such as a potential staked Ether ETF, purchases by the Trump family DeFi platform, and the upcoming Pectra upgrade .

The crypto market is currently experiencing a significant wave of apprehension. The latest readings from the Crypto Fear & Greed Index reveal a notable dip, plunging four points to a chilling 21. This descent firmly plants the index back in the dreaded ‘Extreme Fear’ zone, suggesting that market participants are feeling increasingly uneasy. Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: What Does ‘Extreme Fear’ Mean? For those new to this crucial market indicator, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , provided by Alternative.me, is your compass for navigating the choppy waters of cryptocurrency sentiment. Ranging from 0 to 100, it paints a clear picture of market emotions: 0-25: Extreme Fear – Signals intense worry and potential undervaluation. 26-49: Fear – Indicates caution and risk aversion. 50-75: Greed – Suggests growing optimism and potential overvaluation. 76-100: Extreme Greed – Points to excessive bullishness and heightened risk of a market correction. Currently sitting at 21, the index screams ‘Extreme Fear’. But what exactly fuels this pervasive anxiety in the crypto sphere? Why is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Stuck in ‘Extreme Fear’? Several factors contribute to the current state of ‘Extreme Fear’. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t just pulled out of thin air; it’s a weighted aggregate of six key market indicators, each offering a unique perspective on investor sentiment: Volatility (25%): Measures the current and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing it with the respective average values of the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility often triggers fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Compares the current market momentum and volume against the last 30 and 90-day averages. Weak momentum can amplify fear. Social Media (15%): Analyzes sentiment trends on social media platforms, primarily Twitter, for relevant crypto hashtags. Negative social sentiment contributes to fear. Surveys (15%): Conducts weekly crypto polls to gauge investor sentiment directly. Bearish survey results increase the fear index. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Tracks Bitcoin’s market cap share compared to the rest of the crypto market. Increasing Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate a ‘flight to safety’ amidst fear. Google Trends (10%): Analyzes Google Trends data for Bitcoin-related search queries. Surges in fear-related searches correlate with higher fear readings. The recent drop of four points further into ‘Extreme Fear’ suggests a confluence of negative signals across these indicators. This could be driven by broader macroeconomic concerns, regulatory uncertainties, or specific events within the crypto ecosystem. Understanding these components is crucial for deciphering the signals from the Crypto Fear & Greed Index . Navigating the ‘Extreme Fear’ Zone: Challenges and Opportunities While ‘Extreme Fear’ might sound ominous, it’s not all doom and gloom. Let’s break down the challenges and potential opportunities this market sentiment presents: Challenges of ‘Extreme Fear’ Increased Volatility: Fear often leads to panic selling, further amplifying market volatility . This can create unpredictable price swings and make trading riskier. Bearish Market Sentiment: Prolonged periods of ‘Extreme Fear’ can create a self-fulfilling prophecy, where negative sentiment discourages investment and prolongs market downturns. Potential for Irrational Decisions: Fear-driven markets can lead to investors making impulsive decisions based on emotion rather than logic and fundamental analysis. Reduced Liquidity: In times of extreme fear, trading volumes can decrease as investors move to the sidelines, potentially leading to lower liquidity and wider bid-ask spreads. Opportunities in ‘Extreme Fear’ Potential Buying Opportunity: Savvy investors often see ‘Extreme Fear’ as a contrarian indicator. When fear is rampant, assets can become undervalued, presenting a potential ‘buy the dip’ scenario. As Warren Buffett famously said, “Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.” Lower Entry Points: For those looking to enter the crypto market or increase their holdings, periods of ‘Extreme Fear’ can offer more attractive entry points compared to bullish phases. Focus on Fundamentals: Market downturns driven by fear can filter out hype and focus attention on projects with strong fundamentals, solid technology, and real-world use cases. Long-Term Growth Potential: Cryptocurrency, despite its volatility, is still considered a nascent and evolving asset class. ‘Extreme Fear’ periods can be temporary setbacks in a longer-term growth trajectory. Actionable Insights: How to Use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is more than just a number; it’s a tool that can inform your crypto investment strategy. Here’s how to use it effectively: As a Sentiment Gauge: Use it to understand the prevailing crypto market sentiment . Are investors generally fearful or greedy? This can provide context for market movements. For Contrarian Investing: Consider using ‘Extreme Fear’ as a potential buy signal and ‘Extreme Greed’ as a potential sell signal. However, always combine this with your own research and risk assessment. Risk Management: Be more cautious and consider reducing exposure during periods of ‘Extreme Greed’. Conversely, during ‘Extreme Fear’, assess if it aligns with your long-term investment thesis and potential buying opportunities. Not a Standalone Indicator: The Fear & Greed Index should not be used in isolation. Always combine it with other technical and fundamental analysis tools for a well-rounded investment strategy. Conclusion: Navigating Crypto Market Tremors The Crypto Fear & Greed Index currently sitting in ‘Extreme Fear’ is a stark reminder of the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market. While it reflects current anxieties and potential short-term challenges, it also presents opportunities for informed and strategic investors. By understanding the factors driving this sentiment and using the index as a part of a broader analysis toolkit, you can navigate these market tremors with greater confidence and potentially capitalize on the inherent cyclicality of the crypto world. Remember, market sentiment is ever-changing, and ‘Extreme Fear’ can pave the way for future growth and opportunities.

His latest assessment builds on an earlier analysis from February 19, where he predicted a potential rejection after XRP reached a local supply zone. At the time, he stated that while there was uncertainty regarding a short-term move upward, he ultimately expected a sweep of the lows at $2.20 and ideally a further decline to $1.77. The updated chart confirms that XRP has been rejected from the local supply zone and has reached the $2.20 target. Given the broader market context, the analyst believes there is a strong possibility that the price could extend further downward. First target hit, most of the local lows taken. Looking at market context as a whole I think there is a decent chance we can tag our second target at range lows. $XRP https://t.co/93VTTxemse pic.twitter.com/NZ6CFJzFHd — CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) February 24, 2025 Supply Zone Rejection and Market Structure The February 19 analysis identified a critical supply zone between $2.7 and $3.00. XRP initially surged into this area, but selling pressure prevented a further climb, leading to a rejection. This aligns with supply zones acting as resistance levels where large sell orders are concentrated. As a result, XRP’s price began trending downward after the local highs were taken. Another crypto expert delved into this phenomenon, explaining XRP’s dynamics of its large market cap and fragile order books . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 In the updated chart, the rejection from supply has played out as anticipated. The breakdown was further confirmed by the breach of an ascending support. However, once this support was lost, selling momentum intensified, driving the price to the expected $2.20. The asset currently sits at $2.25. Potential for Further Decline While XRP has already met the initial downside target, the analyst remains open to further downward movement. The next key level is $1.77, representing a significant area of prior liquidity. Losing the $2 level will be a major blow to the digital asset, as it has already fallen below $2.3 which many experts marked as a crucial threshold to prevent a continued downturn. However, given the overall market conditions, the probability of this scenario playing out has increased. CrediBull Crypto’s update reinforces this outlook, as the analyst notes that “most of the local lows” have already been taken, suggesting that the price may now be drawn toward deeper liquidity zones. The $1.77 level is a logical next target if bearish momentum persists. Despite the corrective move, CrediBull Crypto maintained in his previous analysis that XRP’s higher timeframe (HTF) structure remains intact. While short-term downside targets are in play, the broader trend may still be positioned for long-term strength .

40853334,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=682772,1740555872,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40853334.jpeg,Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire pushes for US registration of dollar stablecoin issuers,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/circle-urges-us-stablecoin-registration/,"Jeremy Allaire, co-founder of financial technology company Circle, calls for the registration of dollar stablecoin issuers in the US. Recently, stablecoins have become a hot topic in the crypto market, receiving more attention than ever as regulatory scrutiny is ramped up. One of the first issues expected to be tackled in a second Trump administration would be legislation governing digital tokens. Earlier this month, Senator Bill Hagerty, Republican of Tennessee, introduced a bill to establish the regulatory framework for stablecoins. President Donald Trump has vowed to make the US “the world’s leader” in crypto. “It can’t be a free pass, right?” Allaire said in an interview with Bloomberg News. “Where you can just violate the US law and just go do whatever the damn you want wherever and then sell into the United States.” Circle is based in New York and is the issuer of USDC, the second-largest stablecoin in the market after Tether Holdings SA’s USDT. Tether, one of the largest stablecoins by market capitalization, has reportedly relocated its headquarters to El Salvador, a crypto-friendly country embracing digital currency. USDC and USDT are stablecoin digital assets that act as a bridge between cryptocurrencies and traditional financial systems. Their main function is maintaining price stability, usually by pegging them to a stable asset like the US dollar. This makes them a useful tool for traders and investors needing to change funds quickly without exposure to the high volatility of most cryptocurrencies. Registering dollar stablecoin issuers protects consumers Allaire noted that the regulation is related to consumer protection and financial integrity. Any company, he said, whether it is offshore or based in Hong Kong, should have to register in the United States to offer a dollar-backed stablecoin. A Tether spokesperson declined to comment on the matter. However, earlier on Tuesday, Tether’s CEO Paolo Ardoino also responded on X to speculation that the largest cryptocurrency companies act to benefit themselves as US legislation passes. Some of Tether’s reserves are managed by Cantor Fitzgerald LP, who’s former chief executive officer, Howard Lutnick, was recently confirmed by the Senate as the US Secretary of Commerce. This shift elevates a central figure with close ties to financial markets into a powerful government role. In January, Trump signed an executive order to protect the US dollar, cementing the US government’s partnership with stablecoin publishers like Circle and Tether. Circle expands, Dubai recognizes USDC and EURC as official stablecoins The Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) has officially approved Circle’s stablecoins, USDC, and EURC as recognized tokens under the authority’s crypto regime — the first stablecoins approved under the regime. Due to this new status, the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) companies can now integrate the two stablecoins into various digital asset applications, including payments, treasury management, and services. Dubai becomes the latest region to recognize USDC and EURC as official stablecoins in Circle’s expansion strategy. Circle CEO emphasized that stablecoin issuance should be registered in the United States, stating that his calls are not political and that his company has always registered in the jurisdictions that it serves. Notably, Dubai’s financial regulator recently welcomed Circle’s USDC and EURC stablecoins, indicating a big leap for digital assets in the region. Both tokens were approved as of October 16, 2023, under the newly created regulatory framework of the DIFC, an autonomous economic zone. The UAE approving Circle’s USDC and EURC stablecoins was a historic first. It made Circle the first stablecoin issuer granted clearance to operate in Dubai, cementing its place in the global crypto landscape and validating its stablecoins as prominent tools in the burgeoning digital economy. Circle also received several key regulatory approvals in other key jurisdictions throughout 2024. The firm has complied with recent new crypto asset regulations passed into law in the European Union and Canada, signaling its willingness to work with regulated ecosystems worldwide. Meanwhile, fellow Tether rival has expanded its presence in the UAE. The company was granted approval for its USDT stablecoin in the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), yet another major financial hub within the region, in late 2024. Tether’s action shows a rising adoption of stablecoins in the UAE and the wider Middle East, as governments and financial sector players acknowledged the value of stablecoins in enabling cross-border payments, financial inclusiveness, and digital assets.

Pi Network ( PI ) price has seen a 22% hike over the last 24 hours, trading at $1.90, according to crypto.news . The 24-hour trading volume has now surpassed $700 million. The current price is a mere 10% shy of PI’s all-time high of $2.10 set on Feb. 20 at its launch. This is despite the broader crypto market downturn, with the total crypto market cap down by 2% and many altcoins posting losses on the 24-hour timeframe, although not as bad as yesterday. On the technical side, PI’s price is showing strong bullish momentum on the 1-hour timeframe, with the price trading well above the 25-period exponential moving average at $1.64. Before this surge, the price had been consolidating between $1.50 and $1.70 from Feb. 24 to early Feb. 26, with the 25 EMA acting as dynamic support. The breakout from $1.70 was supported by rising volume. If this momentum continues, the next resistance level is somewhere around $2.00. However, for confirmation of further upside, the price needs to hold above $1.70 with sustained volume. If the price pulls back, $1.64 (25 EMA) and $1.50 are key support levels to keep an eye on.

However, the lack of independent verification for this market cap has raised concerns, and both Coinmarketcap and CoinGecko have omitted the ranking data. Source: Coinmarketcap Apart from the market cap concerns, Pi Network has faced criticisms over it being a pyramid scheme. Ben Zhou, CEO of Bybit, has publicly called the project a scam targeting the elderly. Moreover, Binance’s consideration to list Pi Network with the recent community vote has drawn criticism from Colin Wu , founder of Wu Blockchain. Wu raised concerns that Binance’s focus on user registration and traffic might compromise its reputation and security, especially with the listing of a controversial project such as Pi Network. As of Feb.22, Binance updated the results of its recent community vote to list the PI token , confirming that the proposal had 86% support. However, its listing decision is still pending. The Binance’s voting period is set to close tomorrow , on Feb. 27 at 23:59 (UTC). If listed, it’ll likely be the major catalyst for PI’s price over the coming days.

Where you can just ignore the U.S. law and go do whatever the hell you want wherever and sell into the United States.” Jeremy Allaire Allaire’s comments come as Senator Bill Hagerty recently proposed a framework for stablecoin issuers while President Donald Trump has promised to make the U.S. a crypto hub. Circle’s efforts might potentially affect its main rival and the largest stablecoin issuer by market capitalization, Tether , which recently moved its headquarters to Bitcoin-friendly El Salvador. “This is about consumer protection and financial integrity.

Every single business or political meeting that they have culminates with this intent.” Paolo Ardoino The debate over stablecoin regulation extends beyond the U.S. In July 2024, analysts at blockchain research firm Kaiko suggested that Europe’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation prompted a rush among issuers to comply, benefiting Circle at the expense of its rivals. Ardoino criticized MiCA, arguing that its requirement for stablecoin issuers to hold at least 60% of reserves in E.U. bank accounts poses financial risks, as deposits exceeding €100,000 are not insured.

Recent data reveals a concerning trend in the U.S. spot Ethereum ETF market. For the fourth consecutive trading day, these investment vehicles have experienced net outflows, culminating in a significant $50.1 million exit on February 25th. This development raises crucial questions for investors and market observers alike. Let’s dive into the details of these Ethereum ETF outflows and explore what might be driving this movement. What’s Causing the Recent Ethereum ETF Outflows ? According to data from Farside Investors, February 25th saw a unanimous trend of net outflows across several key spot Ethereum ETF providers. This wasn’t just a minor fluctuation; it was a substantial movement of capital away from these funds. To get a clearer picture, let’s break down the outflows by fund: Grayscale’s ETHE: Led the pack with a significant $27.1 million in net outflows. Fidelity’s FETH: Followed with $12.5 million in outflows. Bitwise’s ETHW: Recorded $8.2 million in net outflows. Grayscale’s mini ETH: Experienced $2.3 million in outflows. 21Shares’ CETH: Data unavailable for this fund. Remaining ETFs: Reported no change in holdings. This data paints a picture of a broad-based pullback from ETH ETF products on that particular day. While individual fund movements can sometimes be attributed to fund-specific factors, the widespread nature of these outflows suggests a potentially broader market sentiment at play. Crypto ETF Outflows : Is This a Temporary Blip or a Trend? The crucial question now is whether these crypto ETF outflows , specifically in Ethereum ETFs, represent a short-term blip or the beginning of a more sustained trend. It’s important to remember that market dynamics are constantly shifting, and several factors could be influencing investor behavior. Here are a few potential reasons for these outflows: Profit Taking: After a period of positive momentum and potential price appreciation in Ethereum and related ETFs, some investors might be taking profits off the table. This is a common market behavior, especially after rallies. Market Uncertainty: The broader cryptocurrency market, while showing resilience, is still subject to volatility and regulatory uncertainties. Events in the global economy or unexpected regulatory announcements can trigger risk-off sentiment, leading investors to reduce exposure to assets perceived as riskier, including crypto ETFs. Rotation into Other Assets: Investors might be reallocating capital to other asset classes, either within the crypto space (e.g., Bitcoin ETFs, other altcoins) or outside of it (e.g., traditional stocks, bonds). Fund flows are dynamic, and portfolio rebalancing is a continuous process. Grayscale ETHE Specific Factors: Grayscale ETHE has been a significant player in these outflows. It’s worth noting that ETHE’s structure and fee model are different from some of the newer spot ETH ETFs. Investors might be shifting from ETHE to ETFs with potentially lower fees or different custodians. To truly understand the nature of this trend, we need to monitor fund flows over a longer period and analyze them in conjunction with broader market indicators, including Ethereum price action, on-chain metrics, and macroeconomic developments. What are the Implications of These Outflows for the Ethereum Market? While a single day’s outflows don’t necessarily dictate a long-term trajectory, sustained outflows from spot Ethereum ETF products can have several implications: Potential Price Pressure: Outflows represent selling pressure. If sustained, they could contribute to downward pressure on the price of Ethereum, at least in the short term. However, ETF flows are just one factor among many influencing crypto prices. Sentiment Indicator: ETF flows can serve as a sentiment indicator. Prolonged outflows might reflect a shift in investor sentiment towards Ethereum or the broader crypto market. Conversely, inflows typically indicate positive sentiment. Market Maturity: The ETF market is still relatively new in the crypto space. Fluctuations in fund flows are expected as the market matures and investors refine their strategies for using these products. It’s crucial to contextualize these outflows. The crypto market is known for its volatility, and short-term fluctuations are par for the course. Long-term trends and the overall adoption of crypto assets will be determined by a multitude of factors beyond daily ETF flows. Navigating the Ethereum ETF Landscape: What Should Investors Watch? For investors navigating the ETH ETF landscape, staying informed and adopting a balanced perspective is key. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Fund Flows Regularly: Keep an eye on daily and weekly ETF flow data from reputable sources like Farside Investors and others. This can provide early signals of shifts in investor sentiment. Analyze Underlying Market Trends: Don’t just focus on ETF flows in isolation. Analyze broader market trends, Ethereum price action, on-chain data, and macroeconomic factors to get a holistic view. Understand ETF Structures and Fees: Be aware of the differences between various Ethereum ETFs, including their fee structures, custodians, and underlying holdings. This can influence investment decisions, especially when considering funds like Grayscale ETHE versus newer offerings. Consider Long-Term Perspective: Cryptocurrency investments are generally considered long-term plays. Short-term fluctuations in ETF flows should be viewed within the context of a broader investment strategy and long-term outlook for Ethereum and the crypto market. Conclusion: Decoding the Ethereum ETF Outflows The recent $50.1 million net outflows from U.S. spot Ethereum ETF products on February 25th serve as a reminder of the dynamic nature of the crypto market. While these outflows are noteworthy and warrant attention, it’s essential to analyze them within a broader context. Whether this is a temporary blip driven by profit-taking or a signal of a more sustained shift in sentiment remains to be seen. Investors should continue to monitor ETF flows, alongside other market indicators, to make informed decisions and navigate the evolving landscape of crypto investments effectively. The journey of Ethereum ETF outflows is just beginning, and its future path will be shaped by a complex interplay of market forces and investor behavior.

The U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF market just witnessed a jaw-dropping event. On February 25th, these much-anticipated investment vehicles experienced a staggering $935.38 million in total net outflows. This isn’t just a dip; it’s a plunge, marking the largest single-day net outflow ever recorded and the sixth consecutive day of overall negative flow. What does this mean for Bitcoin and the broader crypto landscape? Let’s dive into the details of this unprecedented Bitcoin ETF outflows event and unpack what might be driving this market shift. Record Bitcoin ETF Outflows: A Closer Look at the Numbers The sheer magnitude of these ETF outflows is enough to make any crypto investor sit up and take notice. To put it in perspective, nearly a billion dollars exited these funds in a single day. Trader T (@thepfund) on X highlighted these dramatic figures, sending ripples across the crypto community. Let’s break down which ETFs were hit the hardest: Fidelity’s FBTC: Leading the pack with a massive $344.65 million in net outflows. BlackRock’s IBIT: Even the titan BlackRock felt the pressure, experiencing $161.99 million in outflows. Bitwise’s BITB: Not far behind, Bitwise saw $88.30 million leave its Bitcoin ETF. Grayscale’s mini BTC (BTC): Grayscale’s newly converted ETF also faced significant pressure with $85.76 million in net outflows. The outflows weren’t limited to just these giants. Here’s a more comprehensive list of the spot Bitcoin ETFs and their respective net outflows on February 25th: ETF Provider Ticker Net Outflows (USD) Fidelity FBTC $344.65 million BlackRock IBIT $161.99 million Bitwise BITB $88.30 million Grayscale BTC $85.76 million Franklin Templeton EZBC $74.07 million Grayscale GBTC $66.14 million Invesco BTCO $62.01 million Valkyrie BRRR $25.19 million WisdomTree BTCW $17.30 million VanEck HODL $9.97 million As you can see, the selling pressure was widespread across nearly all of the newly launched Bitcoin ETFs . Only a few funds managed to avoid net outflows on this particular day, highlighting the broad nature of this market movement. Why are we seeing such massive Crypto Outflows? The million-dollar question (or rather, the $935 million question) is: what’s behind this sudden exodus from crypto outflows in Bitcoin ETFs? While pinpointing the exact cause is always challenging, several factors could be at play: Profit Taking: Bitcoin has experienced a significant price surge in recent weeks. Investors who bought into the ETFs early might be taking profits off the table, especially after a period of substantial gains. Market Correction Fears: After a period of bullish momentum, some investors may be anticipating a market correction and reducing their exposure to riskier assets like Bitcoin. ETF outflows could be a preemptive move to de-risk portfolios. Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Global economic uncertainties, inflation concerns, and potential shifts in monetary policy can all influence investor sentiment. Such factors can drive investors towards safer havens or prompt them to reduce overall investment exposure. GBTC Outflows Persist: Grayscale’s GBTC, even in its mini BTC form, continues to experience outflows. This could be due to investors rotating out of GBTC into other ETFs with lower fees or simply cashing out their GBTC holdings. Rotation into other Assets: It’s also possible that investors are reallocating capital from Bitcoin ETFs into other asset classes that they perceive as more attractive at the moment, or even into other cryptocurrencies. Impact and Implications of Bitcoin ETF Outflows These significant Bitcoin ETF outflows undoubtedly have implications for the crypto market. Here are a few key points to consider: Price Pressure on Bitcoin: Large outflows from ETFs can exert downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price. As ETFs sell off Bitcoin to meet redemptions, it can contribute to selling pressure in the spot market. Market Sentiment Shift: Such a dramatic outflow can impact overall market sentiment. It may signal a shift from bullishness to a more cautious or even bearish outlook, at least in the short term. Volatility Increase: Periods of high inflows and outflows in ETFs can contribute to increased volatility in the Bitcoin market. Large and sudden shifts in ETF holdings can amplify price swings. Long-Term ETF Viability: While one day of record outflows is significant, it’s crucial to consider the long-term trend. The overall success and viability of Bitcoin ETFs will depend on sustained investor interest and net inflows over time. Navigating the Bitcoin ETF Outflows: What’s Next? So, what should crypto investors make of these Bitcoin ETF outflows ? Here are a few actionable insights: Don’t Panic: While the outflow numbers are substantial, it’s important to avoid knee-jerk reactions. Market corrections and periods of profit-taking are a normal part of any investment cycle. Monitor the Trend: Keep a close eye on ETF flow data in the coming days and weeks. Sustained outflows could indicate a more significant shift in market sentiment, while a quick reversal back to inflows might suggest this was a temporary blip. Consider the Broader Context: Don’t just focus on ETF flows in isolation. Pay attention to broader market indicators, macroeconomic news, and regulatory developments that could be influencing investor behavior.

The Solana ecosystem is buzzing with excitement as Jupiter (JUP), a leading decentralized exchange (DEX), has just initiated its first ever JUP Buyback program. This strategic move, worth a substantial $3.33 million, is sending ripples through the crypto market, and on-chain analysts are keeping a close watch. Let’s dive into the details of this significant development and explore what it means for Jupiter, Solana, and the broader DeFi landscape. What’s the Buzz Around the JUP Buyback? According to a recent report by on-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa on X (formerly Twitter), Jupiter has officially commenced its inaugural JUP Buyback . Over the past 17 hours, a whopping 4,885,370 JUP tokens have been repurchased at an average price of $0.683. This significant accumulation amounts to a total investment of $3.33 million. All these transactions are transparently processed on-chain through the Jupiter Litterbox address, ensuring full accountability and visibility. And the best part? The JUP Buyback is still ongoing, suggesting even more activity to come! Why is Jupiter Initiating a Crypto Buyback? This crypto buyback isn’t just a random act; it’s a strategic decision rooted in Jupiter’s commitment to its community and the long-term value of the JUP token. Jupiter had previously announced a key initiative: 50% of all protocol fees generated on the Jupiter DEX platform would be dedicated to buying back JUP tokens. These repurchased tokens aren’t going back into circulation immediately; instead, they will be locked for a period of three years. This lock-up mechanism is crucial for several reasons: Reduced Circulating Supply: By taking a significant chunk of JUP tokens out of circulation, the buyback inherently reduces the available supply. Basic economics dictates that decreased supply, with consistent or increasing demand, can potentially lead to upward price pressure. Long-Term Commitment: The three-year lock-up period signals Jupiter’s long-term confidence in the JUP token and the future of its platform. It demonstrates a commitment beyond short-term market fluctuations. Community Reward: Using protocol fees for buybacks directly benefits the Jupiter community. It’s a way of redistributing the platform’s success back to token holders. Price Stability and Growth: Buybacks can act as a buffer against market volatility and contribute to a more stable and potentially appreciating token price over time. Jupiter DEX: A Cornerstone of the Solana Ecosystem To fully appreciate the significance of this JUP Buyback , it’s important to understand Jupiter’s role within the Solana ecosystem. Jupiter DEX has rapidly become a dominant force, known for its: Aggregated Liquidity: Jupiter isn’t just a DEX; it’s a DEX aggregator. It scours multiple Solana-based DEXs to find the best possible swap rates for users, ensuring optimal execution and minimizing slippage. User-Friendly Interface: Jupiter prioritizes a seamless and intuitive user experience, making decentralized trading accessible to both seasoned crypto veterans and newcomers. Comprehensive DeFi Suite: Beyond swaps, Jupiter offers a growing suite of DeFi tools, including limit orders, DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging), and bridge aggregation, making it a one-stop-shop for Solana DeFi users. High Transaction Speeds and Low Fees: Leveraging the Solana blockchain, Jupiter offers lightning-fast transaction speeds and incredibly low fees, a stark contrast to many Ethereum-based DEXs. The success of Jupiter DEX directly translates into protocol fee generation, which now fuels this strategic JUP Buyback program. This creates a positive feedback loop: platform growth leads to more fees, which in turn fund buybacks, potentially boosting token value and attracting more users. On-Chain Insights: What Does the Data Tell Us? The beauty of blockchain technology lies in its transparency. Thanks to on-chain analysts like @ai_9684xtpa, we can track the JUP Buyback activity in real-time. Here’s a breakdown of key data points: Metric Value Total JUP Repurchased 4,885,370 JUP Average Buyback Price $0.683 Total Value of Buyback $3.33 Million Buyback Address Jupiter Litterbox Status Ongoing This data confirms the scale and execution of the JUP Buyback . The average buyback price of $0.683 provides a benchmark for market participants to consider. The ongoing status indicates that this is just the beginning, and more buyback activity is anticipated in the future. Impact and Future Outlook for JUP and Solana What are the potential implications of this crypto buyback for JUP and the Solana ecosystem? Positive Price Action: Historically, buyback programs have often been associated with positive price movements in the short to medium term. Reduced supply and increased demand can create a favorable environment for price appreciation. Increased Investor Confidence: The JUP Buyback signals Jupiter’s financial strength and commitment to its token holders. This can boost investor confidence and attract new participants to the JUP ecosystem. Strengthened Solana DeFi: Jupiter’s success is intertwined with the Solana ecosystem’s growth. A thriving Jupiter DEX contributes to the overall health and vibrancy of Solana DeFi, attracting more users and liquidity to the network. Benchmark for Other Projects: Jupiter’s transparent and strategic crypto buyback program could serve as a model for other DeFi projects looking to enhance token value and reward their communities. Conclusion: A Strategic Move in the Right Direction Jupiter’s inaugural JUP Buyback program is a significant and strategic move that underscores its commitment to long-term growth and community value. By allocating 50% of protocol fees to repurchase and lock JUP tokens, Jupiter is demonstrating a proactive approach to tokenomics and ecosystem development. As the buyback continues to unfold, it will be fascinating to observe its impact on JUP’s price, investor sentiment, and the broader Solana DeFi landscape. This development reinforces Jupiter’s position as a leading innovator in the decentralized exchange space and a key player in the burgeoning world of Solana.

It’s been a wild ride in the digital asset world, and recent data from Delphi Digital has dropped a bombshell. Despite the overall buzz and occasional pumps, it turns out that almost every corner of the crypto market, except for Bitcoin itself, is actually trailing behind the OG cryptocurrency in year-to-date performance. Let’s dive into this surprising trend and understand why your favorite crypto sectors might be underperforming BTC. Are Your Crypto Investments Lagging? The Shocking Truth About Sector Performance Delphi Digital, a well-respected crypto data analytics platform, recently highlighted a concerning trend on X: every single crypto sector they track is currently underperforming Bitcoin (BTC) when looking at year-to-date (YTD) returns. This isn’t just a slight dip; we’re talking about significant losses across the board. Before you panic sell your entire portfolio, let’s break down the numbers and understand what’s going on. Here’s a stark picture of the average biggest losses across various crypto sectors : AI Frameworks: -84.05% Agents: -70.27% Memecoins: -51.74% Gaming Infra: -51.54% Modular: -47.48% These aren’t just minor corrections; these are substantial drops. Imagine investing in the hyped-up AI narrative or the promise of metaverse gaming, only to see your portfolio significantly shrink compared to simply holding Bitcoin. It’s a tough pill to swallow, and it raises some crucial questions about altcoins and broader market dynamics. Why Are Altcoins Struggling Against Bitcoin? So, what’s behind this widespread underperformance of altcoins ? Several factors could be at play, contributing to this surprising market dynamic. Let’s explore some potential reasons: Bitcoin’s Flight to Safety In times of market uncertainty or perceived risk, investors often flock to Bitcoin as a “safe haven” asset within the crypto space. Bitcoin, being the oldest and most established cryptocurrency, is often seen as less risky compared to newer and more volatile altcoins . This “flight to safety” phenomenon could be driving capital towards Bitcoin and away from riskier crypto sectors . Narrative Fatigue and Hype Cycles The crypto market is heavily driven by narratives and hype cycles. Sectors like AI, gaming, and memecoins often experience explosive growth periods fueled by speculation and excitement. However, these hype cycles can be short-lived. Once the initial frenzy subsides, and if the underlying technology or adoption doesn’t catch up, these sectors can experience significant corrections. Perhaps we’re seeing a cooling-off period after the initial hype surrounding these crypto sectors . Macroeconomic Headwinds The broader macroeconomic environment plays a significant role in all markets, including crypto. Factors like rising interest rates, inflation concerns, and geopolitical instability can impact investor sentiment and risk appetite. In such environments, investors may become more risk-averse and prefer holding more established assets like Bitcoin over speculative altcoins . Market performance across all asset classes is being influenced by these global economic factors. Liquidity and Market Depth Bitcoin generally boasts higher liquidity and market depth compared to most altcoins . This means it’s easier to buy and sell large amounts of Bitcoin without significantly impacting its price. Altcoins , especially those in newer or niche crypto sectors , can be more susceptible to price swings due to lower liquidity. In a risk-off environment, this lower liquidity can exacerbate downward price pressure on altcoins . Delphi Digital’s Data Insights Delphi Digital ‘s analysis is based on real-time market data, providing a factual snapshot of current market performance . Their findings highlight a clear divergence between Bitcoin and the broader crypto sectors . It’s crucial to pay attention to reputable data analytics platforms like Delphi Digital to understand prevailing market trends and make informed investment decisions. Their insights are valuable for navigating the complexities of the crypto market. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? The underperformance of crypto sectors against Bitcoin offers several key takeaways for investors: Diversification vs. Concentration: While diversification is generally considered a sound investment strategy, this data suggests that during certain market phases, a more concentrated approach towards Bitcoin might yield better results. It’s a reminder that diversification doesn’t always guarantee outperformance, especially when risk appetite shifts. Risk Management is Crucial: The significant losses in sectors like AI Frameworks and Agents highlight the inherent risks associated with investing in highly speculative altcoins . Proper risk management, including position sizing and stop-loss orders, becomes even more critical in such volatile market conditions. Fundamental Analysis Matters: Hype and narratives can drive short-term price action, but ultimately, the long-term success of any crypto sector or project depends on its fundamental value and real-world adoption. Investors should prioritize fundamental analysis over chasing fleeting trends. Bitcoin’s Enduring Dominance: Despite the emergence of thousands of altcoins and various crypto narratives, Bitcoin continues to demonstrate its resilience and dominance in the crypto market. It remains a cornerstone asset and a crucial benchmark for evaluating market performance . Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on market data and analysis from reputable sources like Delphi Digital . Understanding the current market dynamics and sector rotations is essential for making informed investment decisions in the ever-evolving crypto landscape. Conclusion: Navigating the Crypto Market’s Sectoral Shifts The data from Delphi Digital paints a clear picture: crypto sectors are currently struggling to keep pace with Bitcoin’s performance. This isn’t necessarily a doomsday scenario for altcoins , but it serves as a potent reminder of the cyclical nature of the crypto market and the importance of strategic asset allocation. While certain altcoins and sectors may eventually rebound and outperform Bitcoin, the current trend underscores the enduring strength of Bitcoin and the need for investors to approach altcoin investments with caution and a clear understanding of the associated risks. Always do your own research, manage your risk wisely, and stay informed about the ever-shifting tides of the crypto market.

But what if the very platforms we rely on for innovation and collaboration become breeding grounds for cyber threats? Cybersecurity giant Kaspersky has dropped a bombshell, revealing a sophisticated malware campaign dubbed ‘GitVenom’ that’s exploiting the open-source haven of GitHub to target cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Are you unknowingly at risk? The Lurking Danger: GitVenom Malware Exploits GitHub Imagine browsing GitHub, a platform teeming with projects promising to enhance your crypto experience – from automated trading bots to secure Bitcoin wallets. Sounds enticing, right? But beneath the surface of seemingly legitimate projects, Kaspersky’s latest report uncovers a sinister reality. Hackers are actively seeding hundreds of fake repositories, weaponizing them with GitVenom malware , a sneaky threat designed to compromise your digital life. This isn’t just another generic malware attack; GitVenom is specifically crafted to target the lucrative world of cryptocurrency . These malicious repositories are disguised as helpful tools, drawing unsuspecting users into their web of deceit. According to Cointelegraph, these projects are meticulously designed to appear authentic, employing AI-generated instructions and artificially inflated commit histories. This level of sophistication makes it incredibly difficult for even seasoned users to discern genuine projects from these venomous traps. How GitVenom Malware Operates: A Deep Dive So, how does this insidious malware actually work? GitVenom is a multi-pronged attack, deploying a cocktail of malicious software designed to steal your sensitive information. Let’s break down the arsenal of threats lurking within these fake GitHub projects: Remote Access Trojans (RATs): These nasty pieces of software grant hackers complete control over your compromised system. Imagine someone remotely accessing your computer, monitoring your activities, and potentially deploying further malicious payloads. Info-Stealers: True to their name, info-stealers are designed to pilfer your personal data. This includes login credentials for various online accounts, browsing history revealing your online habits, and crucially, crypto wallet data. Clipboard Hijackers: For crypto users, clipboard hijackers are particularly devastating. When you copy a crypto wallet address to make a transaction, this malware silently swaps it with an address controlled by the attackers. Imagine sending your hard-earned cryptocurrency to a hacker instead of your intended recipient – a nightmare scenario for any crypto holder. These malicious components work in concert to create a comprehensive attack, maximizing the damage and potential financial gain for the cybercriminals behind GitVenom. GitHub: A Trusted Platform Under Threat? GitHub , a cornerstone of the open-source community, is now being exploited in this campaign. While GitHub itself is a secure platform, the sheer volume of projects and the open nature of the platform make it a challenging environment to police completely. This incident raises crucial questions about the responsibility of platforms in combating the spread of malware disguised as legitimate projects. It’s important to remember that GitHub is not inherently unsafe. Millions of legitimate projects thrive on the platform, driving innovation and collaboration. However, the GitVenom campaign serves as a stark reminder that vigilance is paramount, especially within the rapidly evolving and often unregulated space of cryptocurrency . Cryptocurrency Users: Prime Targets for Cybercriminals Why are cryptocurrency users such attractive targets? The answer lies in the potential for high financial rewards. Crypto wallets hold digital assets that can be directly converted into fiat currency, making them a prime target for theft. Furthermore, the often-technical nature of cryptocurrency can sometimes lead to users overlooking basic cybersecurity practices, making them more vulnerable to sophisticated attacks like GitVenom. The anonymity and decentralization that are core tenets of cryptocurrency also present challenges for law enforcement and recovery of stolen funds. Once crypto assets are stolen, tracing and retrieving them can be incredibly difficult, making prevention the most critical line of defense. Cybersecurity Measures: Protecting Yourself from GitVenom and Similar Threats In light of the GitVenom threat, what steps can you take to bolster your cybersecurity and protect your valuable crypto assets? Here are some actionable insights: Exercise Extreme Caution on GitHub: Not every project on GitHub is safe. Be incredibly skeptical of projects promising quick riches or overly complex functionalities, especially those related to cryptocurrency. Verify Project Authenticity: Look beyond AI-generated instructions and inflated commit histories. Check for project activity over time, community engagement (real comments, not just bots), and the reputation of the developers. If something feels off, it probably is. Download Software from Official Sources: Whenever possible, download software directly from the official website of the developer or company. Avoid downloading executables from GitHub repositories unless you are absolutely certain of their legitimacy. Utilize Robust Antivirus and Anti-Malware Software: A reliable cybersecurity solution is your first line of defense. Ensure your antivirus software is up-to-date and actively scanning for threats. Kaspersky, the firm that uncovered GitVenom, offers a range of security products that can help protect you. Employ Hardware Wallets for Crypto Storage: For significant cryptocurrency holdings, consider using hardware wallets. These devices store your private keys offline, making them significantly more resistant to online threats like malware. Double-Check Wallet Addresses: Always meticulously double-check crypto wallet addresses before sending transactions. Even a slight mistake can result in irreversible loss. Be wary of anything that interferes with your copy-paste process. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of the latest cybersecurity threats and best practices. Reputable news sources like Cointelegraph and cybersecurity firms like Kaspersky are valuable resources for staying informed. The GitVenom Warning: A Wake-Up Call for Crypto Community The emergence of GitVenom malware serves as a stark and shocking reminder of the ever-present dangers in the digital realm, particularly within the lucrative cryptocurrency space. It highlights the increasing sophistication of cybercriminals and their willingness to exploit even trusted platforms like GitHub to achieve their malicious goals. For cryptocurrency users, vigilance, skepticism, and proactive cybersecurity measures are no longer optional – they are essential for safeguarding their digital assets and maintaining their peace of mind. This incident should serve as a wake-up call to the entire crypto community. We must collectively enhance our awareness, share knowledge, and adopt robust security practices to mitigate the risks posed by threats like GitVenom. The future of cryptocurrency depends not only on technological innovation but also on our ability to create a secure and trustworthy ecosystem.

Inspired by the legendary Fort Knox, this decentralized project has positioned itself at the intersection of financial sovereignty, internet culture, and a growing demand for transparency. With the current controversy surrounding the U.S. gold reserves and Elon Musk’s call to audit Fort Knox , discussions about security, value, and asset control are dominating headlines—bringing unexpected relevance to the rise of Frog Knox. The Perfect Storm for Visibility The name “Fort Knox” is synonymous with impenetrable wealth storage , yet questions about the actual gold holdings within the U.S. depository have ignited speculation. As billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk openly demands an audit, media attention surrounding Fort Knox is intensifying. While this debate unfolds, the crypto community has turned its focus to Frog Knox —a project that embraces the same principles of asset security but within the decentralized world. The timing is impeccable, as global investors are already fixated on the Fort Knox discussions, providing Frog Knox with an organic marketing boost like no other. Memetic Strength: A Key to Virality In crypto, branding and memes drive engagement, and Frog Knox has tapped into one of the most powerful forces in the space. The project’s “Strategic Frog Reserve” plays off the Fort Knox gold reserves while embracing the humor and cultural appeal that make meme coins thrive. Unlike fleeting meme projects, Frog Knox blends a strong narrative with deep community involvement , ensuring longevity in an otherwise volatile market. Community Strength and Strategic Positioning Frog Knox isn’t just another meme project; it’s a movement with a rapidly growing community that believes in its long-term vision. The team has cultivated a strong and engaged following, leveraging humor, decentralized ideals, and strategic branding to create a recognizable presence. The “one-size-fits-all helmet” meme campaign, reinforcing unity and protection, has already gained traction on social media, further fueling excitement for the presale. Why Frog Knox Has Strong Potential The presale of $FROX presents an opportunity for early adopters to secure their stake in what could be one of the most culturally significant crypto projects of 2025. Here’s why: Cultural Relevance – The ongoing Fort Knox debate ensures that discussions around security and value will remain in the public eye, creating natural curiosity around Frog Knox. Memetic Longevity – The project isn’t reliant on short-term hype; its branding and humor align with lasting internet trends. Strong Community – The active and engaged holder base is critical for sustaining momentum and organic growth. Investor Potential – With strategic branding and early-stage positioning, $FROX presents a chance for significant returns as mainstream awareness increases. As the presale gains momentum, the question isn’t just about where the real gold is—it’s about where the next major crypto movement will be.

If SOL fails to reclaim its key support levels, some market watchers predict the altcoin risks further bleeding. Related Reading: Red Monday, Green Week? Bitcoin Needs To Reclaim This Level For Trend Continuation – Analyst Solana Sentiment Plummets To Yearly Low On Monday afternoon, the crypto market continued the weekend bleeding after failing to hold its key support levels. In the past 24 hours, most cryptocurrencies have dropped to monthly lows amid the latest market correction. Bitcoin, the largest crypto by market capitalization, moved from the $96,000 mark to the range lows of its post-elections range before losing the $90,000 support for the first time since November. As the flagship crypto bled, Solana, one of the leading Altcoins this cycle, followed BTC’s steps. SOL dropped 12% from the $150 support, tapping the $140 level and dropping to $131 on Tuesday morning, its lowest price since September. Analyst Miles Deutscher pointed out that Solana’s sentiment has reached its lowest level in over a year. According to the post, the sentiment for SOL hasn’t been this low since the cryptocurrency first reclaimed the $100 mark at the start of 2024. It’s worth noting that market sentiment has shifted over the past few weeks, with several community members expressing increasing fatigue from the numerous Solana-based memecoin scams. After the Libra token crash, which saw over $100 million taken from investors, the market started to see capital rotation from Solana to Ethereum. At the time, SOL’s price dropped 12%, losing the $180 support zone and failing to reclaim it for the past week. Deutscher stated that Solana is “finally having its capitulation moment” after being a top performer throughout last year. He also implied that the capitulation suggests a rebound could be coming. Another 50% Drop Coming? Crypto analyst Jelle highlighted that Solana is registering a 50% drop from January highs and has retraced to a key weekly level. The $130 and $140 zone was a key support level throughout the 2021 all-time high (ATH) breakout and the 2024 rally. Jelle also suggested that holding this area will be key for Solana’s performance, as the upcoming token unlock, scheduled for March 1st, will affect its price. Ali Martinez commented on SOL’s recent performance, noting that SOL’s trading pair against BTC resembles ETH/BTC. According to the analyst, the SOL/BTC chart is starting to look like Ethereum’s trading pair against BTC’s past price action. Related Reading: LINK Sudden Breakdown Sparks Fears Of Collapse To $12.5 Support Zone If the pattern continues, SOL/BTC could be poised for a 50% drop to 0.0008, sending Solana’s price to the $70 region. Meanwhile, Altcoin Sherpa considers the $90-$125 region a “good area overall” to purchase, as he doesn’t believe that Solana is “dead.” The analyst added that SOL will likely recover from the lows but expects some volatility. As of this writing, SOL trades at $141.36, a 45% decline in the monthly timeframe.

Will DOGE Price Recover as Investors Flee?,https://coingape.com/markets/did-elon-musk-kill-dogecoins-popularity-will-doge-price-recover-as-investors-flee/,"Elon Musk has been instrumental in Dogecoin (DOGE) price surges over the years. However, his recent moves may be having the opposite effect. After President Donald Trump appointed Musk to head the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), it diverted attention away from the meme coin itself. With investors fleeing, did Elon Musk kill Dogecoin’s popularity, and can DOGE price recover? Elon Musk May Have Killed Dogecoin’s Popularity – Can Price Recover? Musk was one of the catalysts that triggered a Dogecoin price rally in late 2024. At the time, President Donald Trump tapped Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to head the DOGE department. While this appointment was good for Dogecoin at the time, it gradually drew attention away from the meme coin itself. Data from Santiment shows that DOGE search volumes peaked on November 12, 2024, coinciding with Musk’s appointment. At the time, the surge in search volumes coincided with a DOGE price increase. However, this trend has since shifted. While search volumes for DOGE remain somewhat elevated, the DOGE meme coin has not seen the same level of attention. Instead, the price has been on a steep downtrend. DOGE Search Volumes Nevertheless, Musk is not the only reason behind DOGE’s bearish outlook. The recent meme coin mania in Solana launchpad PumpFun diluted the attention away from old coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. As investors chased quick gains with these meme coins, it drained liquidity from the DOGE market, which weakened demand. Dogecoin Interest Wanes as Investors Flee The number of daily active addresses further highlights the lack of investor interest in DOGE. This metric has dropped to previous lows after reaching record highs in November. The drop indicates reduced market participation that may lead to sideways price movement or even precede bear markets. Dogecoin Active Addresses This correlation between Dogecoin price and address count suggests that hype is crucial to the meme coin’s performance. If the market interest remains low as Musk and Solana meme coins continue to divert attention away from DOGE, the price faces more headwinds. Can Dogecoin Disconnect From Musk’s DOGE and Rally? Let’s Explore Dogecoin price is under bearish pressure . At press time, DOGE trades at $0.21 with a marginal decline of 0.2% in 24 hours. However, its setup on the daily chart supports a bullish Dogecoin price prediction that could lead to a rally to $1. DOGE has been trading below its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), a key resistance level that has kept bears in control. After yesterday’s dip, it also fell below the 200-day SMA of $0.24, reinforcing the bearish trend. However, momentum indicators suggest that Dogecoin price may be on the verge of a reversal. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 29, placing DOGE in the oversold territory. This shows possible seller exhaustion that may lead to a short-term relief rally. The Awesome Oscillator histogram bars also show a bullish divergence suggesting selling momentum is slowing down. DOGE/USDT: 1-day Chart If the downtrend is indeed weakening, DOGE price could bounce in the coming days. If it moves back above the 200-day SMA, its key resistance levels are at the 50% and 100% Fibonacci levels of $0.37 and $0.48, respectively. Additionally, if the meme coin can disconnect from Musk’s DOGE and rally, traders should watch out for long-term price targets at the 161.8% and 261.8% Fib levels of $0.706 and $1.30, respectively.

Recent data reveals a significant development concerning Fidelity’s spot Bitcoin ETF (FBTC). On February 25th, FBTC experienced its largest single-day net outflow ever recorded, hitting a staggering $344.7 million. This substantial exit raises eyebrows and prompts crucial questions about the current sentiment surrounding Spot Bitcoin ETF investments. Let’s delve into the details and understand the potential implications of this movement. Record Bitcoin ETF Outflow for Fidelity’s FBTC: Decoding the Numbers According to data compiled by Farside Investors, a financial information platform closely monitoring ETF flows, Fidelity’s FBTC witnessed an unprecedented Bitcoin ETF outflow on February 25th. A net outflow of $344.7 million is not a trivial figure; it signifies a considerable number of investors withdrawing their capital from this particular Bitcoin ETF. This event marks the largest outflow FBTC has experienced since its inception, surpassing any previous single-day withdrawals. To put this into perspective, consider the following: Magnitude of Outflow: $344.7 million represents a significant portion of FBTC’s assets under management (AUM), suggesting a potentially broad-based investor concern or strategy shift. Historical Context: This is the largest outflow since FBTC’s launch, indicating a possible change in investor sentiment or market dynamics compared to earlier periods. Market Impact: Such a large outflow from a prominent Spot Bitcoin ETF like FBTC could exert downward pressure on Bitcoin prices, at least in the short term, as market makers adjust to the reduced demand. What’s Driving the Exodus from FBTC? Unpacking Potential Reasons The million-dollar question is: why are investors pulling out of Fidelity’s FBTC? While the exact reasons can vary from investor to investor, several potential factors could be at play, influencing ETF investment trends within the crypto space: Profit Taking: Bitcoin has experienced significant price appreciation recently. Investors who bought into FBTC earlier might be taking profits off the table after a period of gains. Market Volatility Concerns: The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. Increased market uncertainty or anticipated price corrections could prompt investors to reduce their exposure to Bitcoin ETFs, seeking safer havens or alternative investment opportunities. Rotation to Other ETFs: While FBTC saw outflows, it’s crucial to consider the performance of other Spot Bitcoin ETFs . Investors might be shifting their investments from FBTC to other ETFs, perhaps those with lower fees or perceived better performance or brand preference. The article mentions data for BlackRock’s IBIT and ARK Invest’s ARKB is still being compiled, and comparing these flows will provide a clearer picture of the overall ETF landscape. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic conditions, such as rising interest rates or inflation concerns, can influence investor sentiment across all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies and related investment products like Bitcoin ETFs. Individual Investor Strategies: Large institutional investors or whales might be rebalancing their portfolios, and these large-scale adjustments can lead to significant outflows from specific ETFs. Analyzing the Broader Crypto Market Analysis Context It’s essential to view FBTC’s outflow within the broader context of Crypto market analysis . While a large outflow from a major ETF is noteworthy, it doesn’t necessarily signal a catastrophic event for Bitcoin or the crypto market as a whole. Here’s why: Factor Potential Interpretation Isolated Event? We need to wait for data from other major Bitcoin ETFs like IBIT and ARKB to determine if this is an isolated incident specific to FBTC or a broader trend across the Spot Bitcoin ETF market. If other ETFs also show outflows, it could indicate a more widespread shift in sentiment. Long-Term Trend vs. Short-Term Noise Daily outflows can be influenced by short-term market fluctuations and investor sentiment. It’s crucial to analyze longer-term trends over weeks and months to discern if this is a temporary blip or the start of a sustained outflow trend. Inflow/Outflow Balance Even with this significant outflow, it’s important to consider the overall net inflows into Bitcoin ETFs since their launch. If cumulative inflows still significantly outweigh outflows, the long-term picture might still be positive despite short-term volatility. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors: Navigating ETF Volatility For investors navigating the evolving world of ETF investment trends and crypto assets, here are some actionable insights to consider in light of FBTC’s recent outflow: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on ETF flow data from various providers like Farside Investors. Monitor not just FBTC but also other major Bitcoin ETFs to get a comprehensive view of market movements. Diversify: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your crypto portfolio across different assets and investment strategies. Relying solely on a single ETF might expose you to specific risks associated with that fund. Understand Your Risk Tolerance: Assess your own risk tolerance and investment goals. Bitcoin and crypto ETFs are inherently volatile. Be prepared for price swings and potential outflows. Long-Term Perspective: Consider your investment horizon. If you are a long-term believer in Bitcoin, short-term outflows from ETFs might present buying opportunities rather than reasons for panic. Due Diligence: Continuously research and understand the ETFs you invest in, including their fees, holdings, and tracking error. Conclusion: Decoding the Bitcoin ETF Signals Fidelity’s FBTC experiencing its largest ever Bitcoin ETF outflow is undoubtedly a significant event that warrants attention. While it may trigger concerns, it’s crucial to analyze this development within the broader context of market dynamics, investor sentiment, and overall Crypto market analysis . Whether this outflow represents a temporary blip or a more profound shift in ETF investment trends remains to be seen. By staying informed, adopting a diversified approach, and maintaining a long-term perspective, crypto investors can navigate these market fluctuations with greater confidence and make informed decisions.

According to a recent Bloomberg report , PayPal is preparing to integrate its USD-pegged stablecoin , PayPal USD ( PYUSD ), into more of its products. The payment system provider claimed it plans to make PYUSD available for global payments through Hyperwallet. PayPal hopes to make PYUSD payouts live in the first half of 2025. “A lot of the payments we’re expecting are going to be cross-border because merchants in the U.S. are seeking to pay vendors and suppliers abroad,” said general manager of PayPal’s small business and financial services group, Michelle Gill. The financial technology firm aims to make PYUSD a payment option for more than 20 million merchants to pay vendors, within the U.S. and abroad, through its upcoming bill-pay product by the end of this year. Gill stated that the goal is to invite more vendors to join the PayPal network so that transactions become easier to facilitate. “The thesis was: Can we facilitate that on PYUSD rails so as not to have the currency conversion, the friction, as well as time?” added Gill.

Hyperwallet is a San Francisco-based firm that provides a global payout platform that allows for localized, multi-currency distribution on a global scale. Through Hyperwallet, merchants will be able to accept PayPal crypto transactions by the end of 2025. “We’ve been talking about blockchains for like a decade now — the concept of these things never becomes real until you actually can start to spend it,” said PayPal Chief Executive Officer Alex Chriss. PayPal first launched its stablecoin in August 2023 on the Solana ( SOL ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) blockchain. Last month, PayPal made PYUSD accessible through the Cardano ecosystem.

40853853,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=134172,1740556990,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Gamble? GameStop CEO Hints at Shocking Crypto Reserve Asset Move!,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/gamestop-bitcoin-reserve-asset/,"Is GameStop, the company that sparked a retail investor revolution, about to trigger another seismic shift – this time in the crypto world? The latest buzz is deafening: GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen has acknowledged a proposal to adopt Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Could this be a masterstroke, or a risky gamble? Let’s dive into the details. GameStop and Bitcoin: A Shocking Proposal on the Table The news broke when Matt Cole, CEO of Strive Asset Management, took to X to announce that his firm had formally proposed to GameStop’s leadership, specifically CEO Ryan Cohen, the adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) as a reserve asset. The crypto community held its breath. Ryan Cohen’s response? A terse but telling, “Letter received.” These two words, simple as they are, have ignited a firestorm of speculation and excitement across both the gaming and cryptocurrency landscapes. [img src=”image-placeholder.jpg” alt=”GameStop Bitcoin Proposal”] Cole’s proposition, as reported by CoinDesk, is bold and straightforward: GameStop should convert its substantial cash reserves – estimated at around $5 billion – into Bitcoin . The rationale? Cole argues that in today’s economic climate, Bitcoin represents a superior store of value compared to traditional cash, which is constantly eroded by inflation. In essence, he’s suggesting GameStop future-proof its finances by embracing the leading cryptocurrency. Why Bitcoin? Exploring the Reserve Asset Rationale But why Bitcoin , and why now? The argument for Bitcoin as a reserve asset hinges on several key factors: Inflation Hedge: Traditional cash, while liquid, is susceptible to inflationary pressures. As governments print more money, the purchasing power of fiat currencies diminishes. Bitcoin , with its limited supply of 21 million coins, is often touted as a hedge against inflation. Its scarcity makes it potentially more resilient to inflationary forces than fiat currencies. Digital Transformation: We live in an increasingly digital world. For a company like GameStop, which is navigating its own digital transformation, embracing Bitcoin could be seen as a strategic alignment with the future of finance. It sends a powerful signal that GameStop is not just clinging to the past but is actively innovating and adapting to the digital age. Enhanced Returns? While Bitcoin is volatile, its historical performance has significantly outpaced traditional assets like cash over the long term. If GameStop were to allocate a portion of its reserves to Bitcoin , it could potentially generate higher returns compared to holding cash in low-yield accounts. This, however, comes with inherent risks. To put it simply, the proposal positions Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a strategic financial tool that can protect and potentially grow GameStop’s substantial cash holdings in a rapidly changing economic environment. Is GameStop Exploring Crypto Investments? Hints in the Wind This proposal doesn’t come entirely out of the blue. Earlier this month, CNBC reported that GameStop is indeed exploring investments in Bitcoin and other digital assets. This news itself suggests a shift in mindset within the company, a willingness to consider unconventional strategies to revitalize its business. The backdrop to this exploration is GameStop’s ongoing challenges in its traditional brick-and-mortar business model, coupled with declining sales. Diversification and innovation are likely top priorities for the company right now. Adding fuel to the speculative fire, Ryan Cohen’s recent social media post featuring a photo with Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, has sent the crypto community into overdrive. Saylor is a staunch Bitcoin advocate and has famously led MicroStrategy to adopt Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset. The meeting between Cohen and Saylor, whether casual or strategic, is undeniably significant in the context of this Bitcoin proposal. Could Saylor be advising Cohen on a similar move for GameStop? Potential Benefits and Challenges: Navigating the Crypto Terrain Adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset is not without its complexities. Let’s weigh the potential benefits against the inherent challenges: Potential Benefits Potential Challenges Inflation Hedge: Protects against the devaluation of cash. Potential for Higher Returns: Bitcoin ‘s long-term growth potential. Digital Innovation: Positions GameStop as a forward-thinking company. Positive Market Sentiment: Could attract crypto-savvy investors and boost stock price. Diversification: Reduces reliance on traditional assets. Volatility: Bitcoin ‘s price is notoriously volatile, leading to potential value fluctuations in reserves. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving and can be unpredictable. Accounting and Tax Implications: Managing Bitcoin reserves involves navigating complex accounting and tax rules. Operational Complexity: Securely storing and managing Bitcoin requires specialized infrastructure and expertise. Public Perception: Not all investors are comfortable with cryptocurrency investments, potentially leading to mixed reactions. What Does This Mean for Investors? Riding the Speculation Wave For investors, the GameStop- Bitcoin saga presents both excitement and uncertainty. The mere suggestion of GameStop embracing Bitcoin has already sparked discussions and likely contributed to market speculation. If GameStop were to actually move forward with this plan, it could have several implications: Increased Institutional Adoption: GameStop, as a publicly traded company with significant brand recognition, adopting Bitcoin could further legitimize cryptocurrency as a viable corporate treasury asset and encourage other companies to follow suit. Potential Stock Price Boost: Positive investor sentiment surrounding crypto adoption could drive up GameStop’s stock price, similar to how MicroStrategy’s stock has been linked to its Bitcoin holdings. Exposure to Crypto Market Volatility: Investors in GameStop would indirectly gain exposure to the volatility of the Bitcoin market, both on the upside and the downside. Long-Term Strategy Shift: A move into Bitcoin could signal a broader strategic shift for GameStop, indicating a willingness to embrace new technologies and explore unconventional avenues for growth. Conclusion: GameStop’s Bitcoin Bet – A Bold Move or a Risky Gamble? Ryan Cohen’s cryptic “Letter received” has opened Pandora’s Box. The proposal for GameStop to adopt Bitcoin as a reserve asset is undoubtedly audacious and potentially transformative. Whether it’s a brilliant strategic move or a high-stakes gamble remains to be seen. The coming weeks and months will be crucial in observing GameStop’s next steps and gauging the market’s reaction. One thing is certain: the world is watching, and the intersection of gaming and cryptocurrency is becoming increasingly fascinating.

As XRP and Dogecoin struggle at key support levels, Remittix is surging with strong presale momentum and real-world utility. Table of Contents XRP struggling at crucial support levels Dogecoin testing key support as market sentiment dips Remittix: A bright spot amid market struggles A period of opportunity for XRP, DOGE, and RTX The cryptocurrency market is facing a turbulent period, with major tokens like XRP and Dogecoin (DOGE) experiencing significant declines. While the broader market struggles, these cryptocurrencies are approaching crucial support levels, and there’s potential for a bounce. Remittix (RTX), a fresh player, is targeting new highs. Let’s explore the developments surrounding XRP and DOGE and the promising growth of Remittix. XRP struggling at crucial support levels XRP , the flagship token of Ripple, has been under pressure in recent weeks, recently breaking below the important $2.50 support level. As the market remains weak, XRP’s price is trapped in a tight range between $2.47 and $2.75, with many traders uncertain of the next move. The key resistance levels to watch are $2.60 and $2.70, and a break above these could signal a reversal. However, the downside risk remains, with support levels at $2.40 and $2.32 and the potential for further declines to $2.20. Technical indicators show bearish momentum, including the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the 100-hour Simple Moving Average (SMA). XRP needs to regain buying pressure to avoid further losses. If the token can hold the support levels and reverse its trend, it could provide a strong buying opportunity for investors looking for a rebound. Dogecoin testing key support as market sentiment dips Dogecoin has also struggled, with the price now testing the critical $0.22 support level. The bearish sentiment in the broader crypto market has had a significant impact on DOGE’s performance, and failure to hold above $0.22 could lead to further declines, with the next support level at $0.15. However, Dogecoin has shown resilience in the past, and its large community could help support a recovery if the broader market sentiment improves. Despite the downturn, DOGE’s past price history suggests that it could experience a major move in the near future. The upcoming Bitcoin halving event in April 2025 could trigger a market-wide rebound, benefiting meme coins like Dogecoin. If DOGE can break through the $0.30 resistance, it could initiate a rally toward $0.50. Remittix: A bright spot amid market struggles While XRP and Dogecoin face challenges, Remittix is gaining traction with its smart PayFi solution. Remittix allows users to send crypto like Dogecoin directly to fiat bank accounts, solving a key issue in cross-border payments. The project’s presale has raised over $12.8 million, signaling strong investor confidence unlike meme coins and AI tokens that have lost billions this year. Remittix focuses on real utility and financial inclusion, making it an attractive investment. With predictions of up to 50x growth post-presale, Remittix stands out as a promising project with substantial growth potential in the evolving market. A period of opportunity for XRP, DOGE, and RTX The cryptocurrency market is facing uncertainty, with XRP and Dogecoin testing key support levels. While these tokens have declined, their recovery potential remains strong if they hold these zones. Meanwhile, Remittix stands out with its unique PayFi solution and strong presale performance. Remittix offers real-world utility and significant long-term growth potential, unlike other struggling sectors. As XRP and Dogecoin navigate challenges, Remittix presents a promising investment opportunity with the potential for new highs in the coming years. Investors should watch these developments closely.

The analyst tells his 777,600 followers on the social media platform X that bearish sentiment for crypto is at a high, suggesting that the bottom for the current market correction is close. According to the trader, Bitcoin’s latest move below $90,000 is designed to tap resting buy orders before igniting the next leg up. “Bitcoin needs to take all the liquidity. That’s what we’re currently doing. Ultimate bottom case? $83,000-87,000. Then we should be rotating upwards. The current sentiment is extremely peaking to the downside, so that’s likely the case.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X On Monday, Bitcoin plunged to a three-month low of $86,141, triggering a $1.58 billion liquidation event. At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $88,118. Turning to the altcoin market, Van de Poppe says he’s keeping an eye on the TOTAL3 chart, an alt index that tracks the market cap of all crypto assets excluding Bitcoin, Ethereum ( ETH ) and stablecoins. Van de Poppe says he will remain bullish on the altcoin market as long as TOTAL3 stays above a key support level. “The altcoin market capitalization looks good for continuation upwards. If it stays above $750 billion, we can continue moving toward the next impulse.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, TOTAL3 is trading at $816.26 billion.

If you’re invested in crypto or just following the tech, you’ll know that scalability and sustainability are key topics. Recently, researchers from the Ethereum Foundation (EF) took to Reddit for an Ask Me Anything (AMA) session, and what they revealed has the crypto community buzzing! Let’s dive into their exciting plans to enhance Ethereum scalability and revolutionize its economic model. Unveiling the Vision: Boosting Ethereum Scalability The core message from EF researchers Justin Drake and Dankrad Feist was clear: Ethereum’s base layer needs to handle more data and generate more revenue. Think of the base layer as the foundation of a skyscraper. A stronger foundation allows for taller, more impressive structures on top. In Ethereum’s case, a robust base layer means faster, cheaper, and more efficient transactions for everyone. Drake painted a picture of a future where Ethereum can process a mind-boggling 10 million transactions per second (TPS) within the next decade! To put that into perspective, current estimates for Ethereum’s mainnet are around 15-30 TPS. This leap in Ethereum scalability is not just an incremental improvement; it’s a quantum jump. Imagine a world where crypto transactions are as seamless and fast as using your credit card, but with the power of decentralization. But how does this translate to the economic side of things? Drake also projected that with this enhanced scalability, Ethereum could potentially rake in a staggering $1 billion in daily revenue, assuming transaction costs are as low as $0.001 each. This highlights the potential for Ethereum to not only be technologically superior but also economically self-sustaining and thriving. The Roadmap to Scalability: Danksharding Demystified So, how exactly will Ethereum achieve this ambitious Ethereum scalability ? The researchers discussed ‘danksharding,’ a key upgrade designed to dramatically increase data availability on the base layer. Let’s break down what dank sharding is all about: Matching Supply and Demand: Danksharding is designed to dynamically adjust the data availability based on the network’s needs. This means Ethereum can efficiently handle surges in transaction volume without compromising speed or cost. Stable Revenue Streams: By optimizing data availability, danksharding aims to ensure a consistent and reliable revenue stream for the Ethereum base layer. This financial stability is crucial for the long-term health and development of the network. Foundation for Future Growth: Danksharding is not just a one-time fix; it’s a foundational upgrade that paves the way for even further scalability improvements in the future. Think of danksharding as upgrading a highway from a two-lane road to a multi-lane superhighway. It allows for significantly more traffic to flow smoothly, reducing congestion and delays. In the Ethereum context, this translates to faster and cheaper transactions for users and applications built on the network. Recapturing Revenue: Reclaiming the Economic Edge The AMA session wasn’t just about technical scalability; it also delved into the Ethereum economic model and how to strengthen it. A key focus was on ‘recapturing revenue from layer-2 blockchains.’ Let’s understand this critical aspect: Layer-2s: A Necessary Diversion Layer-2 solutions like Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum have emerged as crucial components of the Ethereum ecosystem. They offer faster and cheaper transactions by processing them off the main Ethereum chain. While layer-2s are vital for current scalability, they also divert transaction fees away from the Ethereum base layer. The Goal: Bringing Revenue Back Home The EF researchers, including Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, are exploring strategies to bring more revenue back to the base layer. This isn’t about diminishing the importance of layer-2s, but rather about ensuring the economic sustainability of the core Ethereum network. A strong base layer benefits everyone in the ecosystem, including layer-2 solutions. Native Rollups: The Revenue Recapture Strategy One of the proposed solutions is ‘native rollups.’ These are essentially layer-2 scaling solutions that are more deeply integrated with the Ethereum base layer. The idea is that by making rollups more ‘native,’ Ethereum can capture a larger share of the transaction fees generated within its ecosystem. This could involve technical integrations and economic incentives to encourage the use of native rollups. Native Rollups: Enhancing Base Layer Execution Beyond revenue recapture, native rollups are also envisioned to enhance transaction execution directly on the base layer. This is another facet of strengthening the core Ethereum network. Here’s how native rollups contribute to improved base layer execution: Optimized Transaction Processing: Native rollups can be designed to optimize transaction processing on the base layer, potentially leading to faster confirmation times and lower gas costs even for base layer transactions. Synergy with Danksharding: Native rollups and danksharding are likely to work synergistically. Danksharding provides the increased data availability needed for rollups to operate efficiently and scale further. Simplified Development: By making rollups more native, developers might find it easier to build and deploy applications that leverage both the scalability of layer-2s and the security of the Ethereum base layer. The combination of danksharding and native rollups represents a powerful strategy to address both the scalability and economic challenges facing Ethereum. It’s a holistic approach that aims to create a more robust, efficient, and sustainable network for the future. The Future is Bright: What Does This Mean for Ethereum? The discussions during the AMA session paint a compelling picture of Ethereum’s future. The focus on Ethereum scalability and strengthening the Ethereum economic model demonstrates a proactive and forward-thinking approach by the EF researchers and developers. Let’s summarize the potential benefits and implications: Aspect Potential Benefits Scalability (10M TPS) Mass adoption of Ethereum for everyday transactions Support for complex and high-throughput applications Reduced transaction fees Faster transaction confirmation times Economic Model ($1B Daily Revenue) Sustainable funding for Ethereum development and maintenance Increased network security due to higher staking rewards Attraction of more validators and stakers Long-term viability and growth of the Ethereum ecosystem Danksharding & Native Rollups Enhanced data availability and transaction processing Improved efficiency and cost-effectiveness of layer-2s Stronger integration between base layer and layer-2s Simplified development and deployment of decentralized applications Of course, achieving these ambitious goals is not without its challenges. Technical complexity, research and development efforts, and community adoption are all crucial factors. However, the Ethereum Foundation’s commitment and the clear roadmap outlined in the AMA session are encouraging signs. The future of Ethereum looks incredibly promising, with the potential to truly revolutionize the blockchain landscape. Conclusion: A Transformative Era for Ethereum The Ethereum Foundation researchers’ recent AMA session has ignited excitement and optimism within the crypto community. Their focus on enhancing Ethereum scalability and strengthening the Ethereum economic model through innovations like danksharding and native rollups signals a transformative era for the network. The vision of 10 million TPS and $1 billion in daily revenue might seem audacious today, but the roadmap is being laid, and the journey has begun. As Ethereum continues to evolve, these upgrades are poised to unlock its full potential and solidify its position as a leading platform for decentralized innovation.

This scalability is crucial for authors looking to produce multiple audiobooks or longer works. Focus on Indie Content: ElevenLabs ‘s move aligns with their CEO’s vision to expand into more consumer-facing experiences, particularly focusing on hosting and distributing independent content. This creates a dedicated space for indie authors to thrive in the AI Audiobook space. It’s important to remember that ElevenLabs isn’t entirely new to the audiobook scene. Their Voice AI technology already powers platforms like Pocket FM and Kuku FM. However, by launching their own publishing platform, they are taking a significant step towards becoming a comprehensive ecosystem for AI Audiobook creation, distribution, and consumption. What Does This Mean for the Future of Audiobooks? The launch of ElevenLabs ‘s Audiobook Platform marks a pivotal moment in the audiobook industry.

Well, that future is rapidly becoming our present! A recent survey has dropped a bombshell in the traditional finance world, signaling a seismic shift in how wealth is managed. Prepare to be intrigued as we unpack the groundbreaking news that a significant majority of wealth managers are poised to embrace crypto. Are you ready to delve into the details of this financial revolution? Let’s explore what this means for the future of investment and why crypto wealth managers are gearing up for a digital asset surge. Crypto Wealth Managers: The Tides Are Turning? The buzz is real, folks! Bitwise, a well-known name in the crypto asset management space, recently conducted a survey that’s got the financial world talking. Ryan Rasmussen, Head of Research at Bitwise, unveiled some eye-opening statistics on X (formerly Twitter), as reported by Cointelegraph. The survey, engaging with 350 wealth managers, revealed that a staggering 53% are planning to incorporate cryptocurrencies into their client portfolios. This isn’t just a passing interest; it’s a concrete intention to act, and it’s happening sooner than you might think. But who exactly are these crypto wealth managers , and why is their interest in digital assets such a big deal? Wealth managers are financial professionals who provide investment advice and manage assets for high-net-worth individuals and families. They are the gatekeepers to significant capital, and their investment decisions can heavily influence market trends. Historically, they’ve been cautious about venturing into new and volatile asset classes like crypto. However, this survey indicates a significant change in sentiment. The fact that over half of them are now considering crypto suggests a mainstream acceptance that was almost unimaginable just a few years ago. Why Wealth Manager Crypto Interest is Surging? What’s driving this sudden surge in wealth manager crypto curiosity? It’s not just hype; several compelling factors are at play. Let’s break down the key reasons behind this shift: Client Demand: Wealth managers are client-centric. As more individuals become familiar with and interested in cryptocurrencies, they are naturally starting to ask their wealth managers about including digital assets in their portfolios. Ignoring this demand could mean losing clients to more forward-thinking firms. Diversification Benefits: Modern portfolio theory emphasizes diversification to mitigate risk. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, have shown low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds. Adding crypto can potentially enhance portfolio diversification and improve risk-adjusted returns. In a world searching for uncorrelated assets, crypto stands out. Bitcoin’s Maturation and Performance: Bitcoin, the king of crypto, has matured significantly since its inception. Despite volatility, it has consistently outperformed many traditional asset classes over the long term. Wealth managers are increasingly recognizing Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a legitimate investment with strong growth potential. Its resilience through market cycles has bolstered confidence. Fear of Missing Out (FOMO): Let’s be honest, FOMO plays a role. As crypto gains mainstream traction and early adopters reap substantial rewards, wealth managers don’t want to be left behind. They see the potential for significant gains and understand that being early in this space could be advantageous for both their clients and their firms. Inflation Hedge Narrative: With inflation becoming a growing concern globally, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a potential hedge against inflationary pressures. Its limited supply and decentralized nature appeal to investors seeking alternatives to fiat currencies that can be devalued through inflation. Essentially, the confluence of client interest, portfolio diversification needs, Bitcoin’s demonstrated performance, and a desire to stay ahead of the curve is creating a perfect storm for wealth manager crypto adoption. Crafting the Crypto Portfolio: A New Asset Class Emerges Now, the big question: how will wealth managers actually incorporate crypto into client portfolios? It’s not as simple as just buying some Bitcoin and calling it a day. Strategic portfolio allocation is crucial. Here are some key considerations for building a crypto portfolio within a broader wealth management strategy: Risk Assessment and Client Suitability: Crypto is still a volatile asset class. Wealth managers must carefully assess each client’s risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals before recommending crypto allocations. It’s not a one-size-fits-all approach. Detailed discussions and risk profiling are essential. Diversification Strategy within Crypto: While Bitcoin is the dominant cryptocurrency, the crypto market is vast and diverse. Wealth managers might consider diversifying within crypto by including other established cryptocurrencies like Ethereum or exploring specific sectors like decentralized finance (DeFi) or layer-2 solutions. However, this requires careful research and understanding of each project. Allocation Size: Determining the appropriate allocation size for crypto is critical. Given the volatility, most wealth managers are likely to start with smaller allocations, perhaps in the low single digits as a percentage of the total portfolio. This allows for exposure to the upside potential while limiting downside risk. Over time, allocations could be adjusted based on performance and market conditions. Custody and Security: Secure custody of digital assets is paramount. Wealth managers need to choose reputable and secure custody solutions for client crypto holdings. This might involve working with specialized crypto custodians or utilizing institutional-grade custody services offered by established financial institutions. Regulatory Compliance: The regulatory landscape for crypto is still evolving. Wealth managers must stay abreast of relevant regulations and ensure compliance in their crypto-related activities. This includes KYC/AML procedures and reporting requirements. The integration of crypto portfolio strategies into traditional wealth management is a complex but exciting development. It requires a blend of traditional financial expertise and a deep understanding of the nuances of the crypto market. Bitcoin Investment: Leading the Charge for Institutional Adoption While the survey mentions crypto in general, it’s safe to assume that Bitcoin investment is at the forefront of wealth managers’ minds. Bitcoin remains the most well-known, liquid, and institutionally accepted cryptocurrency. It serves as the gateway for many into the broader crypto ecosystem. Several factors make Bitcoin investment particularly appealing to wealth managers: Brand Recognition and Maturity: Bitcoin is the household name in crypto. Its longevity and brand recognition provide a level of comfort for traditional investors. It’s been around for over a decade and has weathered numerous market cycles, demonstrating a degree of resilience. Liquidity and Trading Infrastructure: Bitcoin boasts the highest liquidity in the crypto market. Robust trading infrastructure, including regulated exchanges and institutional trading platforms, makes it easier for wealth managers to buy, sell, and manage Bitcoin holdings. Growing Institutional Support: Major financial institutions, including banks, investment firms, and payment processors, are increasingly embracing Bitcoin. This institutional validation further legitimizes Bitcoin as an asset class and encourages wealth managers to consider it for client portfolios. Investment Products: The emergence of Bitcoin investment products, such as ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) and trusts, simplifies access for wealth managers and their clients. These products offer regulated and familiar investment vehicles for gaining exposure to Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s established position and growing institutional acceptance make it a natural starting point for wealth managers venturing into the world of digital assets. As they become more comfortable with Bitcoin, they may gradually explore other cryptocurrencies and broader institutional crypto strategies. Institutional Crypto: The Future is Now? The survey results are a strong indicator of a broader trend: the rise of institutional crypto adoption. It’s not just wealth managers; pension funds, endowments, corporations, and other institutional investors are also starting to allocate capital to digital assets. This institutional crypto wave has several significant implications for the crypto market and the financial landscape as a whole: Increased Market Capitalization: Institutional capital is vast. As more institutions allocate even a small percentage of their portfolios to crypto, it will inject significant capital into the market, potentially driving up prices and increasing overall market capitalization. Greater Market Stability: While crypto is known for volatility, institutional participation could lead to greater market stability over time. Institutional investors tend to have longer investment horizons and more disciplined investment strategies, which can reduce speculative trading and market swings. Mainstream Acceptance and Legitimacy: Institutional adoption further solidifies crypto’s position as a legitimate asset class. It moves crypto beyond the fringes and into the mainstream financial system, increasing its credibility and acceptance among the general public. Innovation and Growth: Institutional involvement can spur further innovation and growth in the crypto space. It can attract more talent, investment, and resources to build out the crypto ecosystem and develop new applications and use cases. The journey of institutional crypto adoption is still in its early stages, but the direction is clear. The survey of wealth managers is just one data point confirming a broader trend that is poised to reshape the future of finance. Conclusion: A Paradigm Shift in Wealth Management The revelation that 53% of wealth managers plan to add crypto to client portfolios is more than just a statistic; it’s a paradigm shift. It signals a fundamental change in how wealth is managed and invested. The traditional walls between conventional finance and the crypto world are crumbling, replaced by bridges of understanding and opportunity. For investors, this means greater access to a potentially high-growth asset class through their trusted wealth managers. For the crypto industry, it’s a validation of its long-term potential and a catalyst for further growth and maturation. The future of finance is undeniably digital, and wealth managers are taking note, paving the way for a new era of investment.

40854150,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=134208,1740557554,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Caution in Asia FX: Dollar Plunges Amid Tariff Storm and Weak Economic Data,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/asia-fx-dollar-tariff-jitters/,"Navigating the turbulent waters of the global financial landscape can feel like sailing through a storm, especially for those attuned to the pulse of the cryptocurrency market. While Bitcoin and Ethereum capture headlines with their volatility, the subtle shifts in the Forex market often foreshadow broader economic trends that can indirectly influence the crypto sphere. Today, we’re diving into the cautious mood gripping Asian FX markets as they navigate the choppy seas of tariff jitters and a weakening US dollar. Why is Asian FX Trading Muted Amidst Global Uncertainty? Across Asia, currencies are exhibiting a muted response, caught in a tug-of-war between anxieties over potential tariffs and the impact of a softer US dollar. This cautious trading reflects a broader unease in the market, as investors and traders alike attempt to decipher the tea leaves of global economic signals. But what exactly is contributing to this sense of hesitation in Asian FX ? Tariff Jitters Loom Large: The shadow of potential tariffs, particularly involving major economies, is casting a long shadow over Asian markets. Any hint of escalating trade tensions sends ripples of uncertainty through the region, impacting export-oriented economies and their respective currencies. This isn’t just about direct tariffs; it’s about the broader impact on supply chains, business confidence, and future economic growth. Dollar’s Descent on Weak Data: Simultaneously, the US dollar is experiencing a downturn, plumbing near 3-month lows. This weakness is largely attributed to a string of disappointing US economic data releases. From softer-than-expected jobs numbers to indicators suggesting a potential slowdown in manufacturing and consumer spending, the data paints a less rosy picture of the US economy than previously anticipated. Regional Economic Factors: While global factors dominate, individual Asian economies also have their own domestic dynamics at play. Inflation rates, central bank policies, and local political developments all contribute to the nuanced performance of Asian currencies . For example, some nations might be grappling with their own inflationary pressures, while others are focused on stimulating growth. The Dollar’s Dilemma: How Does Weak Economic Data Impact Currencies? The recent weakness of the dollar is a significant element in the current market equation. Typically, the dollar’s strength is often seen as a barometer of global economic confidence. So, when the dollar falters, it raises eyebrows and prompts questions. But how exactly does weak economic data translate into dollar depreciation? Interest Rate Expectations: Weaker economic data often leads to speculation that the US Federal Reserve might become less aggressive in its monetary policy. If the economy is showing signs of slowing down, the expectation of future interest rate hikes diminishes. Lower or stable interest rates make the dollar less attractive to yield-seeking investors, leading to a decrease in demand and consequently, a weaker dollar. Safe-Haven Status Questioned: The dollar has traditionally been viewed as a safe-haven asset during times of global economic uncertainty. However, when the uncertainty originates from within the US economy itself (as signaled by weak data), its safe-haven appeal can be diminished. Investors might look to other currencies or assets perceived as safer or offering better returns. Trade Balance Implications: While complex, sustained weak economic performance can eventually impact a country’s trade balance. A weaker economy might lead to reduced imports, but if it also hampers exports, the overall effect on the currency can be negative, although this is a longer-term dynamic. Decoding Tariff Jitters: What’s the Real Fear? The term ‘tariff jitters’ encapsulates more than just the direct impact of tariffs themselves. It represents a broader set of anxieties that can ripple through financial markets. Understanding the nature of these fears is crucial to interpreting market reactions, especially in the forex market . What are the core concerns fueling these ‘jitters’? Supply Chain Disruptions: Tariffs can disrupt established global supply chains, making it more expensive and complex for businesses to operate. This disruption can lead to increased costs for companies, potentially impacting profitability and overall economic efficiency. For Asian economies heavily integrated into global supply chains, this is a significant concern. Retaliatory Measures: Tariffs are rarely a one-way street. The fear of retaliatory tariffs from other countries is a major factor contributing to market unease. Trade disputes can escalate rapidly, leading to a cycle of tariffs and counter-tariffs that harm all parties involved. This uncertainty makes businesses hesitant to invest and expand. Slower Global Growth: The ultimate fear is that escalating trade tensions and widespread tariffs will lead to slower global economic growth. Reduced trade volumes, dampened business investment, and decreased consumer confidence can all contribute to a less robust global economy. In a globally interconnected world, a slowdown in one region can have knock-on effects everywhere. Navigating the Forex Market in Times of Uncertainty: Key Considerations For those involved in the forex market , or even those observing from the crypto space, understanding how to navigate periods of uncertainty is paramount. While predicting market movements with certainty is impossible, focusing on key indicators and adopting a cautious approach can be beneficial. What are some actionable considerations? Monitor Economic Data Releases: Keep a close watch on key economic data releases, particularly from the US and major Asian economies. Data points like inflation figures, GDP growth, employment numbers, and manufacturing indices can provide valuable insights into the health of these economies and potential currency movements. Track Trade Policy Developments: Stay informed about any developments related to trade policy and tariffs. News regarding trade negotiations, tariff announcements, or any easing or escalation of trade tensions can significantly impact currency valuations. Diversification and Risk Management: In times of uncertainty, diversification becomes even more critical. Avoid over-exposure to any single currency or asset class. Implement robust risk management strategies to protect your capital against unexpected market swings. Understand Central Bank Communication: Pay attention to the communication from central banks, particularly the US Federal Reserve and central banks in Asian economies. Their statements and policy decisions can provide clues about future interest rate trajectories and overall economic outlook. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Asian FX and the Dollar? The near-term outlook for Asian FX and the dollar remains shrouded in uncertainty. The direction of trade policy and the trajectory of the US economy will be crucial determinants. If trade tensions escalate further and US economic data continues to disappoint, we could see continued pressure on the dollar and ongoing muted trading in Asian currencies. Conversely, any signs of easing trade tensions or a rebound in US economic data could trigger a shift in market sentiment. For those in the cryptocurrency world, it’s essential to recognize that these traditional market dynamics have an indirect but real influence. A risk-off sentiment in traditional markets can sometimes spill over into crypto, while a weaker dollar can, in some scenarios, make alternative assets like Bitcoin more appealing as a hedge. Staying informed about the broader global economic picture is therefore valuable, even if your primary focus is on the digital asset space.

The better news is that while the token’s price is pumping, investors are considering buying it. As per Santiment’s data, Chainlink’s supply on exchanges dropped while its supply outside of exchanges increased. This clearly suggested that buying pressure is rising, which often results in continued price hikes in the coming days. Source: Santiment DexBoss (DEBO) While Litecoin price make headlines, DexBoss might be the showstopper. For those who still have an appetite for meme-driven hype like Dogecoin, but want a functional platform attached, DexBoss (DEBO) could be the ideal pick. It represents a blend of meme coin virality, real-world utility, and a trending concept that has the potential to drive strong investor interest. As its name suggests, DexBoss considered itself the “Boss of DEX,” creating the next-generation decentralized exchange that can outperform existing options in terms of liquidity, user experience, and advanced trading features. Unlike traditional DEX platforms, DexBoss plans to launch with over 2,000+ tokens already listed, giving traders a vast selection from day one. But what really sets it apart is its AI-powered trading terminal, which integrates lightning-fast order execution and deep analytics, making it a more refined and efficient trading environment than many of its competitors. The project’s viral traction across social media, coupled with the current surge in interest around DEX-focused cryptos, gives it strong positioning in the market. Beyond just trading, DexBoss offers: High-quality trading tools to cater to all types of investors and traders Cross-chain compatibility, allowing investors to choose their preferred blockchains while buying or selling Exclusive user perks, including access to high-potential DEX listings before they go mainstream A no-lag trading environment, ensuring smooth execution even in volatile condition Already, the market is paying attention. Due in large part to its relaxed yet high roller branding, which appeals to both whales and regular investors, DexBoss has raised over $560k in presale. DexBoss may go from being a little-known presale to becoming a significant force in the decentralized exchange market when cryptocurrency sentiment improves. Entering now could allow investors to get a stake in a high-upside initiative prior to its launch on the market. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is yet another crypto that has been following Litecoin price’s hike. The crypto’s price has already spiked by over 3% in the past 24 hours, and there is more potential going forward. If the crypto manages to sustain its uptrend, then it won’t be surprising to see BCH price touching $300 in the coming days. In fact, BCH’s trading volume also increased along with its price, acting as a foundation for a further price rise. Source: Santiment Conclusion Litecoin price surge to $119 sparked investor interest, hinting at potential gains for other cryptos like LINK, DEBO, and BCH. While LTC’s pump is notable, these alternatives offer diverse growth opportunities in the evolving crypto landscape.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/us-bitcoin-exchange-traded-funds-etfs-experience-their-biggest-fund-outflow-ever-here-are-the-details/,"Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States experienced their biggest daily net outflow ever on Tuesday, with investors withdrawing a staggering $937.78 million amid changing market dynamics. US Bitcoin ETFs See Record Daily Outflow of $937 Million The record-breaking outflows came as Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $87,000 to a three-month low and dragged the broader crypto market lower, according to data from SoSoValue. Fidelity and BlackRock Lead ETF Exodus Fidelity's FBTC saw the biggest outflow at $344.65 million. BlackRock's IBIT followed with $164.37 million in outflows. The remaining spot BTC ETFs recorded outflows of less than $100 million each. US-listed spot Ethereum ETFs also saw net outflows of $50 million. The sharp decline in ETF inflows is attributed to a decline in the premium on CME-listed Bitcoin futures, which has made cash-and-carry arbitrage transactions much less attractive for institutional investors. The annualized one-month basis (premium) on CME Bitcoin futures fell to a nearly two-year low of 4% on Tuesday from 15% in December 2024, according to Velo Data. Similarly, the basis in Ethereum futures has also fallen to around 5%. With the yield on the US 10-year Treasury bond reaching 4.32%, the risk-free yield from the bonds has become almost equal to that offered by BTC and ETH, dampening institutional demand. As ETFs face increasing outflows, analysts suggest new catalysts will be needed to reignite institutional interest in crypto ETFs. The ongoing market slump and changing macroeconomic conditions have added further uncertainty to digital asset investments. *This is not investment advice.

Đà tăng trưởng của thị trường dường như vẫn chưa có dấu hiệu khởi sắc. Thứ Sáu, ngày 21/2, thị trường bất ngờ rung lắc dữ dội sau khi xuất hiện tin tức về vụ hack sàn ByBit , cộng với đợt bán tháo hợp đồng quyền chọn S&P 500. Chỉ trong một ngày, Bitcoin tuột dốc 4,7%, chạm đáy gần $95,000 trước khi hồi phục trở lại vào cuối tuần. Không chỉ Bitcoin, cả thị trường crypto cũng đang trong giai đoạn điều chỉnh sau những cú bứt phá cuối năm 2024. Bitcoin (-5,9%), Ethereum (-16,9%) và Solana (-33,1%) đều rơi tự do trong tháng 2, sau khi tăng mạnh vào tháng 11 và 12 năm ngoái. Đáng chú ý nhất là nhóm Memecoins, từng bay cao vào tháng 12, nay cũng bay màu tới 37,4%. Sự suy giảm này càng trầm trọng hơn khi thị trường tài chính toàn cầu bất ổn, cộng thêm việc Bitcoin ngày càng dính chặt hơn với các tài sản truyền thống. Việc chỉ số S&P 500 lỡ hẹn với mốc 6,000 đã khiến tâm lý nhà đầu tư e dè, giảm mức độ tham gia vào các tài sản rủi ro. Hiệu suất của Bitcoin, SPX và các tài sản điện tử chính trong năm 2025 (Nguồn: Bitfinex, S&P) Nhu cầu từ các tổ chức lớn cũng giảm đáng kể. Dòng tiền vào ETF Bitcoin , từng đạt đỉnh 18.000 BTC mỗi ngày vào tháng 11 năm 2024, giờ đã đảo chiều thành dòng tiền rút ra. Chỉ riêng ngày 20/2 , đã có tới 360 triệu USD bị rút khỏi các quỹ ETF Bitcoin. Không chỉ các tổ chức quay xe, hoạt động giao dịch có đòn bẩy cũng sụt giảm đáng kể. Những dấu hiệu này cho thấy thị trường đang bước vào một giai đoạn thu hẹp quy mô. Sau gần 90 ngày lình xình đi ngang, Bitcoin vẫn đang trong giai đoạn chờ đợi một chất xúc tác đủ mạnh để bùng nổ. Hướng đi tiếp theo của Bitcoin nhiều khả năng sẽ phụ thuộc vào các yếu tố vĩ mô và có thể mang tính quyết định. Trong khi đó, nền kinh tế Mỹ cũng không mấy khả quan. Niềm tin của người tiêu dùng đang suy giảm, trong khi kỳ vọng lạm phát lại tăng cao, có thể phá hỏng nỗ lực kiểm soát giá cả của Cục Dự trữ Liên bang (Fed). Theo khảo sát mới nhất từ Đại học Michigan , tâm lý người tiêu dùng đã lao dốc, chạm mức thấp nhất trong hơn một năm qua. Người dân Mỹ đang chuẩn bị tinh thần cho mức lạm phát cao hơn, với kỳ vọng lạm phát trong năm tới tăng lên 4,3%, so với mức 3,3% của tháng trước. Sự thay đổi này cho thấy tâm lý cẩn trọng hơn, có thể khiến chi tiêu và hoạt động kinh tế chậm lại. Bên cạnh đó, các đề xuất áp thuế nhập khẩu từ Nhà Trắng đang làm tăng thêm áp lực lạm phát, phần nào đảo ngược tiến trình hạ nhiệt lạm phát trong hai năm qua. Đại học Michigan – Kỳ vọng lạm phát một năm của người tiêu dùng Trong khi đó, thị trường nhà ở đang chững lại , với việc xây dựng nhà mới giảm 8,4% trong tháng 1. Những cơn bão tuyết khắc nghiệt chắc chắn đã gây cản trở một số dự án, nhưng vấn đề lớn hơn nằm ở chi phí vật liệu ngày càng tăng do thuế nhập khẩu và lãi suất vay mua nhà vẫn ở mức cao. Xây dựng khu dân cư mới (Nguồn: Cục điều tra dân số Hoa Kỳ) Các nhà thầu đang chật vật khởi động dự án mới vì chi phí ngày càng tăng, khiến lợi nhuận xây dựng bị bào mòn. Việc nguồn cung mới bị hạn chế lại càng đẩy giá nhà lên cao, gây thêm khó khăn cho Cục Dự trữ Liên bang Mỹ (Fed) trong việc đưa lạm phát về mức mục tiêu 2%. Khi chưa có chính sách lớn nào giúp tháo gỡ rào cản nguồn cung, giấc mơ sở hữu nhà với giá dễ chịu vẫn sẽ xa vời trong tương lai gần. Thị trường tiền điện tử đang trong thế giằng co giữa động lực tăng giá và những rủi ro lớn. Strategy vừa công bố kế hoạch phát hành trái phiếu chuyển đổi trị giá 2 tỷ USD , nhằm thu mua thêm Bitcoin và phục vụ các mục đích kinh doanh. Ở diễn biến khác, Thượng viện Mỹ đã chính thức phê chuẩn Howard Lutnick làm Bộ trưởng Thương mại. Điều này có thể tạo ra những thay đổi quan trọng trong cách quản lý tài sản số. Lutnick, một người ủng hộ trung thành Bitcoin và có khoản đầu tư vào Tether, vì vậy, ông được kỳ vọng sẽ thúc đẩy các chính sách cởi mở hơn, giúp crypto tiến sâu hơn vào dòng chảy tài chính chính thống. Ngoài ra, lập trường của Lutnick về thương mại – đặc biệt là việc ủng hộ chính sách thuế quan của cựu Tổng thống Trump – có thể tác động đến thị trường tài chính nói chung, bao gồm cả dòng vốn đầu tư tổ chức vào crypto. Tuy nhiên, không phải tin nào cũng tích cực. Bybit vừa hứng chịu vụ hack trị giá 1,5 tỷ USD – một trong những sự cố bảo mật nghiêm trọng nhất lịch sử crypto. Dù sàn giao dịch này khẳng định vẫn đủ khả năng thanh toán, vụ việc vẫn làm dấy lên lo ngại về lỗ hổng bảo mật và sự tinh vi ngày càng tăng của các cuộc tấn công mạng.

Bitdeer offers a trusted platform for mining Bitcoin and DOGE, backed by partnerships with top hardware makers like Bitmain. It’s a solid choice for beginners in 2025 but lacks BsvCloud’s eco-edge and bonus perks. Highlights of Bitdeer Strong Tech : Efficient mining with a clear dashboard. Support : Decent help for basic queries. Drawback : No signup bonus or rapid withdrawals like BsvCloud. 3. StormGain – Mining Meets Trading What is StormGain?

Wallet Included : Store BTC and DOGE seamlessly. Trading Bonus : Explore crypto trading alongside mining. Limitation : Free mining power is capped, lagging behind BsvCloud’s profitability. 4. Hashing24 – Bitcoin Mining Made Simple What is Hashing24? Hashing24 sticks to Bitcoin mining with a no-frills approach, ideal for beginners in 2025. However, it doesn’t support DOGE, unlike BsvCloud. Key Features Bitcoin Focus : Straightforward BTC mining. Quick Start : Easy setup for newbies. Steady Gains : Reliable but less lucrative than BsvCloud’s offerings. 5. Binance Pool – Powerhouse with a Catch What is Binance Pool? Tied to the Binance exchange, Binance Pool offers free Bitcoin and DOGE mining.

Challenge : Interface complexity pales against BsvCloud’s ease. 6. NiceHash – Community-Driven Mining What is NiceHash? NiceHash lets beginners mine Bitcoin and DOGE for free via a hash power marketplace. It’s decent but doesn’t match BsvCloud’s high returns or speed. NiceHash Highlights Free Entry : Mine without upfront costs. Community : Active user tips and support. Downside : Fees on paid plans reduce profits compared to BsvCloud.

While many believe that the complexities surrounding the case could delay the settlement, experts like Fred Rispoli deem it unnecessary. Rispoli believes that the Ripple vs SEC case dismissal is simple and possible. With experts divided on the likelihood of the Ripple lawsuit settlement, the community remains curious. This contrast in expert opinions underscores the uncertainty surrounding the lawsuit’s outcome. Is the SEC’s Delay in the XRP Lawsuit Settlement Unnecessary? In a recent X post, legal expert Fred Rispoli dismissed discussions on the complexities surrounding the XRP lawsuit. While the community expects a possible delay in the case’s settlement, Rispoli stated that the resolution is simple and possible. Addressing the SEC’s excuses as cowardly, Rispoli stated, Clearly, the absence of Paul Atkins did not worry the current 3-member SEC Commission on those large litigation issues. My best guess is that, given the $125M judgment, that is real money that Uyeda and Pierce do not want to have responsibility for modifying. Not a great excuse (shows cowardice), but it does make some sense. The case is over regardless, either now or in a few months. Significantly, Rispoli is confident that the XRP lawsuit settlement is just around the corner, despite concerns from others about potential delays. Some point to the absence of new SEC Chair Paul Atkins and Judge Analisa Torres’ $125 million penalty against Ripple as major obstacles. However, Rispoli dismisses these concerns as baseless. The Ripple vs SEC Case Is Over, Says Lawyer Rispoli proposes a straightforward resolution to the Ripple vs SEC case, outlining a hypothetical scenario where Ripple and the SEC mutually agree to drop their appeals. According to Rispoli, this would involve Ripple conceding the $125 million penalty, effectively ending the lawsuit. He added that dropping the appeal would mean Ripple relinquishes its claim that the $125M penalty is excessive, making the amount payable. Notably, this simple solution contrasts with the complex negotiations anticipated by experts like MetaLawMan, who highlighted the complexities of the case. According to MetaLawMan, the Ripple lawsuit will find its end only after the conclusions of a series of lawsuits including Gemini, Kraken, and Binance. Unveiling a Highly Unlikely Situation As Rispoli presented an open discussion on the XRP lawsuit, a crypto investor wanted to know if Ripple could still challenge the ruling after the SEC withdrew its appeal. In detail, the investor asked if a situation is possible where Ripple pays the $125M penalty, the SEC withdraws its appeal, but Ripple presses on with its appeal. However, Rispoli finds the situation as highly impossible with a 0% chance of happening. According to him, neither Ripple nor SEC will drop their appeal while allowing the other to proceed. He identifies these actions as mutually exclusive as they couldn’t occur together. Is the Ripple Lawsuit Resolution Imminent? The crypto market’s unpredictability extends to the industry’s events, making it challenging to foresee the outcome of the XRP lawsuit. Despite various expert opinions and analyses, the Ripple vs SEC case’s result remains uncertain. The SEC’s recent settlements with Coinbase and Robinhood have generated optimism, but Ripple’s fate hangs in the balance. Nevertheless, the SEC’s increasingly favorable stance on XRP ETFs is a confidence booster.

With its next-generation AI technology, this deFi solution is positioned to soar ahead with a massive 100x breakout. Based on the price chart and current performance trends, IntelMarkets’ $0.09 altcoin is poised to show an explosive jump to the $1 mark. Cardano Set for Bullish Price Shift: Key Breakout Inbound Cardano has been consolidating within an ascending triangle, where the price is currently oscillating between the $0.74 support and the $0.83 resistance. According to Martinez, a sustained break above or below these levels will determine Cardano's future direction. Should the price break out to the upside, Cardano could see a rally and push the price to $1. A drop below $0.74 could signal a bearish trend for Cardano and lead to a decline in price. Martinez’s prediction aligns with his earlier analysis from February, where he identified a breakout possibility for Cardano toward the $0.83 level. He had previously cited a breakout from a descending triangle, which displayed a continuation of Cardano’s upward movement. Over the past several months, Cardano has experienced significant volatility, which reflected the broader crypto market’s uncertainty. While Cardano reached a high of $1.32 in early December 2024, it has now faced a steep decline, dropping by as much as 58%. Despite this retracement, Cardano has recently shown slight recovery, primarily driven by renewed interest in its future. Ripple’s XRP Price Could See Trading Volatility Amid ETF Hype The past few months have shown strong bullish momentum for the XRP price, making analysts among investors watch closely for the surge to $3.35. But, as it currently consolidates between $2.50 and $3, the XRP price has formed a cup-and-handle pattern, a technical indicator often associated with big breakouts. Thus, successful breakouts at $2.75 and $2.84 could lead up to the next major resistance for the XRP price at $3.35. Apart from the above technical points, the speculation about Ripple’s ETF is now the primary factor for optimism. That said, Ripple's push to develop in this area of cross-border payment solutions is proving to be a confidence booster to investors. IntelMarkets (INTL) Gives Tough Time to Ripple & Cardano As the first-ever native AI blockchain running dual-chain functionality, IntelMarkets offers advanced trading robots that monitor data on the platform in real-time. This platform delivers top-notch trading performance with AI implementation on the layer-1 blockchain. IntelMarkets’ ongoing presale frenzy has raised over $11 million, with more massive inflows en route. This emerging AI platform offers insights from over 350,000+ data points and utilizes its advanced infrastructure that delivers high-security protocol and reliability. With each passing day, institutional investors and retail traders are shifting from Ripple’s XRP to this AI-driven platform to multiply their earnings and secure a position in the best-selling AI crypto in 2025. Investors Ditch XRP & ADA to Join This $11 Million Presale Among the many crypto projects, analysts have observed investors hesitating to invest in the volatile XRP price, while IntelMarkets ’ impressive presale rally is more appealing in comparison. The short-lived hype for Ripple’s ETF has also failed to live up to its expectations and shifted investors from its platform to IntelMarkets’ fast-growing presale stage 10 at $0.09 per token. As the XRP price hopes for a possible rebound soon, Ripple investors have temporarily switched to exploring other bullish projects to seek shelter and secure gains amid the market volatility.

Experts believe the SEC may soon dismiss the ongoing Ripple lawsuit over XRP. Gensler’s departure signals a shift, with the SEC stepping back on crypto enforcement. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has signaled a change from its aggressive crypto-enforcement approach, with the recent dismissals of crypto-related lawsuits. The SEC has officially ended its investigation into Uniswap Labs without taking further action. This follows similar closures in cases involving Coinbase, OpenSea, and Robinhood. These developments add to a growing number of legal wins for crypto companies dealing with the SEC since the start of Donald Trump as President. Will Ripple Lawsuit Be Next to Fall? The big question now is whether the Ripple lawsuit will be dropped too, just like these other SEC crypto cases. Industry experts, including former SEC official John Reed Stark, are predicting that this change could be the beginning of the end for the SEC’s high-profile lawsuit against Ripple, with the potential for the case to be dismissed next.

The top seemingly most promising ones are Solana (SOL), FloppyPepe (FPPE), and Ripple (XRP). FloppyPepe (FPPE) Bullish Presale Signals Upcoming High Gains FloppyPepe (FPPE) tops the list of the most promising altcoins to hodl to enjoy up to 673X returns in three months. Its ongoing presale trading at $0.0000002 presents an opportunity for savvy retail and institutional investors to accumulate the token before its value soars. Some are already taking advantage of this low price entry, as the cryptocurrency presale data shows that over $800,000 was raised in just a few hours. FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) presale run isn't surprising. In fact, the presale may sell out in a record time, like its private presale round, which raised close to $1 million in just a day. The reason for the explosive presale lies in the core value of this unique AI meme coin. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is a top performer in the AI crypto sector after the recent release of one of its AI tools. Now available on Telegram, the Meme-o-Matic is an AI tool for generating high-quality images using text prompts. Creatives can simply input ideas into the AI agent, and it converts them into detailed images. As users explore the text-to-image AI tool, FloppyPepe (FPPE) says Floppy X, another AI for converting images and text into videos, will soon hit the market. While this meme coin boasts world-class AI technology tools, it isn't neglecting its meme appeal. Inspired by Matt Furie's legacy, its vision is to build the most enormous meme wall (physically) when its market cap hits $100 million. With so much in store from FloppyPepe (FPPE), the altcoin is one of the most important cryptos to hodl as its growth is poised to be monumental. Its ongoing presale is a perfect opportunity to do just that. Hodl Solana (SOL) Again For An Meteoric Surge Many people still remember Solana’s (SOL) growth. A few years ago, when the Solana (SOL) chain entered the crypto space, its native token sold for less than $3. Later, the altcoin soared to an all-time high of almost $300. Many early investors with Solana (SOL) in their portfolios received massive returns. In the next three months, Solana (SOL) may move to reach between $10,000 and $100,000 with more adoption and activities on its chain. These figures sound ambitious as some analysts think Solana (SOL) may not rise beyond $5,000 to $10,000 from its current market price of $178. While the chances of Solana (SOL) soaring by 673X are low, the altcoin is still a good crypto to hodl since it will perform well in the next three months based on its massive market penetration and constant growth pattern. Ripple (XRP) ETF Upcoming Launch To Spark FOMO Ripple (XRP) is up by over 400%, rising from $0.5 to $3 over the last few months. Ripple (XRP) experienced a surge after a broad market upswing and the news of a possible favorable crypto market in the United States of America. Recently, Ripple (XRP) is making waves as the altcoin may soon be in the ETF market . The news of Ripple (XRP) ETF filling is causing FOMO. Trading around $0.26 at press time, Ripple (XRP) may soar by up to 673X in the next 3 months. Conclusion Ripple (XRP) and Solana (SOL) are promising altcoins, although their present performance is not reassuring like that of FloppyPepe (FPPE), which is seeing intense buying pressure. Its performance makes FloppyPepe (FPPE) an altcoin investor may want to give more attention to. With its burn model that removes 1% of each transaction from circulation, the altcoin is an excellent long-term asset in a portfolio. Having passed the SolidProof smart contract audit convincingly, investors can confidently accumulate FloppyPepe (FPPE) selling for just $0.0000002 and hodl to position for up to 673X gains in three months.

This token is changing the game in the industry as it doesn’t simply rely on internet hype to sell itself. Instead, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is expanding its ecosystem, and early investors have a unique opportunity to make big returns as experts' prediction points to a 50x return for the coin. FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) Multi-dynamic Approach To Becoming The Breakout Token FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) cultural significance can be traced back to Matt Furie’s legacy of PEPE the Frog. This comic series has developed over the years and appeared in numerous formats across platforms, highlighting its significance. However, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is attracting more investors as it introduces a fresh and modern twist to embracing its playful community-driven essence with the AI-Meme token. Experts believe FloppyPepe (FPPE) is set to reshape the market as it thrives by merging two surging trends, AI cryptocurrencies and meme coins. AI cryptos improve blockchain automation and security, while meme coins use internet culture and community strength. With solid use cases, a strategic burn mechanism, and a dedicated following, the AI-powered meme coin is pushing boundaries, sparking speculation from experts about its breakout potential. Unlike some traditional meme coins with no defined practical use cases, FloppyPepe (FPPE) started strong, guaranteeing its utility. The community’s AI-powered meme generator recently launched, paving the way for creativity and diverse usage. This tool, Meme-o-Matic, is available on the Telegram channel and enables creatives to make original high-quality memes with simple prompts. The FloppyPepe (FPPE) community also looks forward to FloppyX, another AI tool that could redefine video-making. Similar to Meme-o-Matic, experts believe FloppyX is meant to be one of a kind, as it will allow users to create self-aware personalities that can adapt to tones and moods. The video creation tool will also integrate real-time interaction and engagement, allowing investors to be creative while making massive returns. Beyond the AI tools, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is using reduction tokenomics to promote scarcity. With a total supply of 120 trillion tokens, FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) circulation reduces with each transaction through the 1% burn mechanism, thereby driving its value to ATHs. Furthermore, the AI meme coin is committed to a viable cause and allocates another 1% of every transaction to wildlife conservation efforts. Experts agree that this demonstration of social responsibility appeals to investors with an interest in supporting global conservative efforts. As such, participating in the FloppyPepe (FPPE) community is not simply financial but also ethically rewarding. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Presale: The Future Of AI Meme Coins Starts Here FloppyPepe (FPPE) has made several efforts to redefine its place in the crypto community. At a time when the industry is becoming saturated and new projects are struggling to stand out, experts believe the AI-powered meme coin distinguishes itself to remain relevant. FloppyPepe (FPPE) began its strong journey by combining the impact of technological necessities and internet culture. A step further is its impactful use cases, defined engagement and practical contributions. As FloppyPepe (FPPE) carves out its unique space in the market, investors are flocking to seize the moment, and the momentum is undeniable. The Telegram and X communities are expanding at a staggering pace, while the presale is surging after the private sale shattered expectations, raising over $1 million in under 24 hours. Industry experts hail this AI-driven meme coin as a potential disruptor, capable of reshaping portfolios with its explosive potential. Currently priced at $0.0000002, the AI token offers investors an enticing entry point, making it one of the most talked-about meme coins in crypto.

These Metrics Could Hint So",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-headed-72000-these-metrics-could-hint/,"Bitcoin has seen a crash to the $87,000 level in the past day, but if on-chain data is to go by, the plunge could get much deeper. Bitcoin Has Lost An Important Support Level With The Crash In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed about how some Bitcoin indicators have changed following the plunge in the cryptocurrency’s price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Loss Holders Highest Since October As BTC Crashes To $87,000 The first metric that the analytics firm has shared is the Realized Price of the short-term holders. The “Realized Price” keeps track of the cost basis of the average investor or address on the BTC network. When the spot price of the asset is trading above this indicator, it means the investors as a whole can be considered in a state of profit. On the other hand, it being under the metric implies the dominance of loss in the market. In the context of the current topic, the Realized Price of only a segment of the userbase is of interest: the short-term holders (STHs), who refer to the investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin STH Realized Price over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, Bitcoin was trading above the STH Realized Price during the last few months, meaning the STHs were enjoying profits, but with the latest crash, the situation has flipped. The STH Realized Price is equal to $92,500, so at the current spot price, the members of this cohort would be carrying an average loss of more than 6%. “A failure to reclaim STH cost basis could mean continued sell pressure from recent buyers,” notes Glassnode. As for how far BTC could fall from here, perhaps historical pattern could hold a hint. According to the analytics firm, the post-ATH corrections of May 2021, November 2021, and April 2024 all saw BTC fall one standard deviation below the STH Realized Price. At present, this price band is situated between $71,000 and $72,000. If the past pattern is to go by, it’s possible that this correction may also lead Bitcoin to near this band. Related Reading: Bitcoin Once Again Arrives At This Bear-Bull Boundary—Will A Break Happen? The Cost Basis Distribution, another metric related to investor cost basis, also highlights this same level as being important for the cryptocurrency. From the chart, it’s apparent that a substantial amount of investors have their cost basis at various zones above $87,000. Under this mark, however, very few addresses bought their coins, until the same $71,000 to $72,000 band. “This could mean weaker support in this range, giving bears more control,” explains the analytics firm. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $87,200, down more than 7% over the last week.

Some of the exchanges that have already embraced the asset include Bitget, OKX, and MEXC, while Bybit’s CEO labeled Pi Network a scam. PI on the Run Contrary to the crypto market crash observed in the past few days, the native token of Pi Network – PI – continues to chart substantial gains. Several hours ago, its price hit a new peak of over $1.90 (per CoinGecko’s data) before settling at its current $1.89. This represents an impressive 21% increase on a daily scale. PI Price, Source: CoinGecko PI has been the talk of the town for a while now, and many industry participants noticed its solid performance. Some envisioned the ongoing condition could be the starting point of a major bull run. The X user GEM HUNTER predicted the valuation could soar to as high as $10 by the end of April. The crypto enthusiast based their forecast on the potential support coming from Binance. The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange recently held a community vote to determine whether its users would want to see the asset available for trading on its platform. The results will become official on February 27 , with over 85% of the voters clicking the “yes” option so far . Justin Wu also believes that the possibility of a Binance listing could benefit the token. The market observer noted that PI has outperformed well-known cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and Ethereum (ETH) lately, claiming that “Binance & Pi Day is coming.” “If anything, it’s time to shine and gain attention at this moment . It’s PiTime.” It is worth mentioning that some popular crypto exchanges, such as Bitget, OKX, and MEXC, have already allowed trading services with PI. Scam or Not? Pi Network is undoubtedly among the hottest topics in the crypto space, but it has also been the subject of huge controversy. The project has been quite unclear about certain developments over the years, and its constant delays and extensions have frustrated many community members. One of the critics is Bybit’s CEO – Ben Zhou – who recently described Pi Network as a scam , assuring that the exchange will not list the PI token. Interestingly enough , his entity became a victim of a major multi-billion dollar hack shortly after his bashing comments.

The latest whale data revealed by a renowned crypto analyst, Ali Martinez, showed that 370 million coins were offloaded in the last 96 hours. This dumping saga raised severe market concerns as XRP price slumped roughly 16% during the selling period. XRP News: Whales Dump 370M Sparking Investor Concerns According to whale data revealed by analyst Ali Martinez on February 26, Ripple whales sold 370 million coins in the last 4 days. Simultaneously, the coin’s price crashed by nearly 16% during this period. As per the data, this dumping saga occurred amid a price drop from $2.5 to the $2.1 level. In turn, market watchers remain cautious about whether the token could drop to further lows amid heightened selling pressure brought by whales. Source: Ali Charts, X Why Has The 370M Selloff Become Hot XRP News? It’s noteworthy that the whale dumping saga emerged as captivating XRP news for investors, offering a clear picture of the crypto’s future price movements. Traders and investors are now anticipating a continued downtrend ahead. This bearish projection is attributed to whales’ massive selling and broader market trends. Notably, the crypto market currently faces extreme volatility triggered by macroeconomic heat and liquidity setbacks. With the new U.S. tariffs set to commence as soon as next week, global markets are taking heat. In turn, CoinGape reported that the crypto market recorded over $1 billion in liquidations recently. Ripple’s crypto’s recent price fall also aligns with these broader trends. Market Awaits SEC Lawsuit End The recently boosted market sentiment for crypto is also waning amid declining buzz around the SEC lawsuit’s end . CoinGape recently reported that attorney James Murphey cited complexities within the XRP lawsuit, anticipating further delay before an endgame. As a result, the short-term buzz around the coin appears to be fading. How Is Ripple’s Crypto Delivering Now? As of press time, Ripple’s native coin conversely witnessed a 4% increase, closing in at $2.29. The intraday bottom and peak were $2.08 and $2.36, respectively. Market watchers are stormed as the token defies usual market sentiments in light of such massive selloffs. However, other key metrics signal that this pump may be short-lived. An XRP price analysis by CoinGape recently revealed that the coin’s burn rate has also witnessed a substantial decline. Stagnancy in the crypto’s supply reduction process amid an ongoing volatile trend has added to market concerns. Also, Ali Martinez further spotlighted the coin’s price chart on X, revealing that a potential drop to $1.65 awaits. Notably, the analyst states that the coin has broken out of the lower line of an ascending parallel channel, solidifying market concerns as it signals more downside pressure ahead.

This move, confirmed by SBI Holdings CEO Yoshitaka Kitao, might lower costs and enhance global payments. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s slow transactions and high fees remain an issue in this industry. But PlutoChain ($PLUTO) , a hybrid Layer-2 solution, could help by making Bitcoin faster, cheaper, and more versatile. Let’s jump in the details. XRP Price Prediction: Could XRP’s Price Skyrocket After the Bank of Japan Adopts It? XRP is currently trading at around $2.50 with a 6.4% drop in the last 24 hours and an 8.5% drop over the last seven days. However, Japan’s banking sector is about to undergo a major shift, with all banks preparing to use Ripple’s XRP for transactions. SBI Holdings CEO Yoshitaka Kitao confirmed this move , which could revolutionize cross-border payments, cut costs, and position XRP as a key global currency. With Japan’s $6.37 trillion banking industry backing it, this decision might reshape both crypto and traditional finance. Banks plan to use XRP to simplify money transfers and currency exchanges. Its fast and low-cost transactions could make financial services more efficient. SBI Holdings has long supported XRP and has worked with Ripple since 2016, focusing on remittance solutions that have proven XRP’s potential in international payments. By acting as a bridge currency, XRP removes the delays and high fees of traditional banking, making global payments smoother. Experts believe this could boost XRP’s importance worldwide and inspire other nations to follow. Charting Guy , a technical analyst predicts that the Ripple token could reach $4 and even possibly $8 after these updates. How PlutoChain ($PLUTO) Might Make Bitcoin Faster, Cheaper, and More Flexible with Hybrid L2 Technology Bitcoin leads the crypto world, but its slow transactions, high fees, and limited scalability still cause issues. While networks like Ethereum and Solana have improved efficiency, Bitcoin’s core technology has mostly stayed the same. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) , a hybrid Layer-2 solution, could help by making transactions faster, lowering costs, and improving compatibility with other blockchains like Ethereum. Instead of running everything directly on Bitcoin’s main chain, PlutoChain may process block times off-chain first, and then finalize them on Bitcoin’s base layer. This approach might ease congestion and speed things up— PlutoChain’s block time is just 2 seconds, compared to Bitcoin’s 10 minutes. Lower fees could make Bitcoin more useful for daily transactions rather than just long-term holding. PlutoChain’s Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility may also allow developers to bring decentralized finance (DeFi) apps, NFT marketplaces, and AI-powered tools to Bitcoin’s network. Early tests suggest PlutoChain has real-world potential—it reportedly handled over 43,200 transactions in one day without downtime, showing it might manage heavy traffic efficiently. Security is a major focus, with audits from firms like SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi working to keep the network safe. PlutoChain could help Bitcoin evolve beyond a store of value into a more versatile platform for instant payments, DeFi, and decentralized governance—all while keeping Bitcoin’s core strengths intact. The Bottom Line Japan’s adoption of XRP could be a game-changer, potentially increasing its global use and value. If successful, it might push other countries to explore similar solutions. At the same time, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could help Bitcoin overcome its limitations. With PlutoChain’s help Bitcoin may finally become faster, more efficient, and better suited for everyday use. ———– Disclaimer: It’s important to note that participating in presales carries risks, including market volatility and potential project delays.

Lummis proposed a strategic Bitcoin reserve last year—now she says “Big things cooking.” What’s really on the table? Table of Contents Lummis puts Bitcoin on the big stage What’s cooking for Bitcoin in D.C.? The meeting that could change everything Lummis puts Bitcoin on the big stage Senator Cynthia Lummis has announced that she will be the co-host for Bitcoin ( BTC ) for America, an event taking place on Mar. 11 in Washington, D.C. https://twitter.com/SenLummis/status/1894402039523823987 Organized by the Bitcoin Policy Institute, the event will bring together top executives, public officials, and policy experts to discuss Bitcoin’s role in the U.S. economy. In her announcement, Lummis used Bitcoin’s symbol (₿), stating, “₿ig things cooking,”—hinting at something substantial, possibly new legislative efforts or policy discussions that could impact the future of Bitcoin in the country. This comes at a time when Bitcoin adoption and regulatory frameworks are at a crossroads, with growing interest from both policymakers and financial institutions. Lummis has long been a key advocate for Bitcoin in Congress, backing legislation to establish clear crypto regulations and pushing for a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the U.S. Treasury. With her direct involvement in Bitcoin for America, this event could serve as a platform to accelerate policy discussions and shape upcoming regulatory moves. But what exactly has Lummis been working on, and what can we expect from this event? Let’s take a closer look. What’s cooking for Bitcoin in D.C.? Senator Lummis has made major strides in shaping Bitcoin and crypto policy in Washington since being sworn in as the first-ever chair of the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Digital Assets on Jan. 23. Prior to assuming this position, Lummis had long championed Bitcoin’s role in the financial system, and just six months earlier, she introduced one of her most ambitious policy proposals. In July 2024, on the final day of Bitcoin Conference 2024 in Nashville, she announced a plan for a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve. The proposal called for the U.S. Treasury to gradually accumulate Bitcoin, treating it as a long-term asset rather than a speculative investment. She framed it as a strategy to strengthen the U.S. dollar against inflation and solidify America’s leadership in the global financial system. You might also like: The list of US states embracing Bitcoin reserves is growing Moreover, since becoming chair of the subcommittee, Lummis has been actively working on multiple fronts. In February, she sent two key letters pressing financial regulators on crypto-related policies. On Feb. 20, she took aim at the Federal Reserve, demanding documents related to Operation Choke Point 2.0, a term used to describe alleged regulatory pressure on banks to limit access to crypto-related businesses. The institutions built by the people and for the people are working against us. I will not let the Fed hide its blatant policy bias any longer; the American people deserve answers. pic.twitter.com/K7Qw4R3EYC — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) February 20, 2025 She, along with Senator Tim Scott, called for transparency on whether the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and the Federal Reserve Banks of Dallas and Richmond engaged in discriminatory actions against digital asset firms. Lummis made it clear that claims of privilege or confidentiality won’t exempt the Fed from Congressional oversight, setting a Mar. 13 deadline for document production. The following day, on Feb. 21, she and a bipartisan group of senators sent a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission, demanding clarity on its stance toward protocol staking in digital asset exchange-traded products. Digital assets are the future. The U.S. can either pave the way or fall behind. I lead my colleagues to seek clarification from the SEC on digital asset ETP staking restrictions to make U.S. asset managers competitive in the global market. ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/Fk8RjaB8LC — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) February 21, 2025 She expressed concern that while Canada and Europe allow staking within their crypto ETPs , the SEC continues to prohibit it in the U.S., putting American asset managers at a disadvantage. The letter specifically calls for transparency on the SEC’s rationale for restricting staking, the potential risks and benefits the agency has identified, and the broader implications for digital assets that rely on staking as part of their consensus mechanisms. The senators set a Mar. 21 deadline for the SEC to respond, signaling they expect clear answers. Now, with Bitcoin for America approaching, the event could offer a glimpse into what’s next for Washington’s crypto policy. The meeting that could change everything The first hearing of the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Digital Assets is set for Feb. 26 at 2:30 PM ET, marking the start of what could be a defining chapter in U.S. crypto policy. Senator Lummis, who chairs the subcommittee, has called it a critical first step toward bipartisan legislation, with discussions focused on market structure and stablecoins. As I gear up for the FIRST digital asset subcommittee hearing, here’s what to know: ➡️This is the 1st step towards bipartisan legislation ➡️We'll hear from experts who will shape policy on market structure & stablecoins ➡️Stay tuned for livestream details ➡️Yes this is a big deal — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) February 25, 2025 In a tweet ahead of the hearing, Lummis stated, “Yes, this is a big deal,” outlining key topics and confirming that expert witnesses will provide testimony that could shape future regulations. But she faces a key challenge—while she has worked closely with Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand on crypto policy in the past, Gillibrand is not a member of the Senate Banking Committee. That means Lummis must build alliances with other Senate Democrats to move forward. So far, there are signs of support, with Gillibrand already co-sponsoring the GENIUS Act alongside Senator Bill Hagerty, a bill that could pave the way for stablecoin regulation. The hearing’s witness lineup reflects growing pressure for regulatory clarity and reform. Among them is Jai Massari, Co-Founder and Chief Legal Officer of Lightspark. Another key witness, Austin Campbell, a well-known figure in both traditional finance and digital assets, who recently endorsed a scathing critique of the SEC’s regulatory approach under the Biden Administration. The article, “That Colossal Wreck,” accused the agency of excessive enforcement that stifled crypto innovation. Campbell claims Democratic officials once urged him to soften his stance on former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, but he refused. Instead, he doubled down, calling those responsible for what he labeled “a shameful chapter in U.S. financial regulatory history” unfit for power. Massari echoed this sentiment, calling for a “clear-eyed look” at past regulatory failures and advocating for reforms beyond political divides. https://twitter.com/JaiMassari/status/1893130125618614713 While their testimonies remain unclear, their recent comments suggest a push for a more predictable regulatory framework. Beyond Massari and Campbell, other key witnesses include Jonathan Jachym, Deputy General Counsel for Kraken Digital Asset Exchange, who recently testified in the House on crypto policy, Lewis Cohen, a blockchain and tokenization lawyer, and Timothy Massad, Director of the Digital Assets Policy Project at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government. Lummis will also work alongside Senator Ruben Gallego, the subcommittee’s Ranking Member from the Democratic side. While new to this role, Gallego has backed crypto-friendly policies, including FIT21 in the House and the repeal of SAB 121 , a regulatory rule opposed by the crypto industry. His stance could be key to shaping bipartisan cooperation. The hearing will be livestreamed for public viewing, offering an early look at how this subcommittee plans to approach crypto regulation in the months ahead.

To be precise, the memecoin’s price surged by over 4% in the last 24 hours. Thanks to this, BONK price is now at $0.00001342 with a market capitalization of over $1 billion, making it the 72nd largest crypto. Though BINK price action is promising, a few other cryptos can outshine the memecoin in the days to follow. Ergo, let’s check these tokens’ out. 3 Cryptos That Can Outshine Bonk Price Action Sui (SUI) SUI price followed BONK price track as it also pumped. The SUI bulls pushed the token’s price up by more than 8% in the last 24 hours, making it trade at $2.99 with a market capitalization of over $9.2 billion. The better news is that after a sharp decline, SUI’s weighted sentiment improved slightly last week. This suggested that bullish sentiment around SUI price is rising, which can readily push the token towards $3.5 in the coming days or weeks. BTC BULL (BTCBULL) While BONK price spiked, Cathie Wood of ARK Invest and Samson Mow of JAN3 are a few of the experts that firmly believe that the day will come when Bitcoin will become a million dollar asset. BTC Bull is a meme coin project that has formed an entire community around it. The meme coin not only follows sort-of similar tokenomics as Bitcoin, with its total supply of 21 billion mirroring Bitcoin’s supply of 21 million, it has set milestones that will allow investors to capitalize on the upcoming bull cycle. This is a result of BTC Bull’s milestones, which include burning tokens and holding BTC giveaways each time the largest cryptocurrency in the world increases by $25K. Additionally, BTC Bull plans to hold a BTCBULL token giveaway once Bitcoin hits the $250K milestone. Even though the price of Cardano is still rising, BTC Bull can benefit from the current optimism surrounding Bitcoin, and the way milestones are set up will encourage BTC airdrop winners to hold onto their Bitcoins in order to profit from the bull market. Available on presale and raising over $2.4 million to date, the BTC Bull token can be bought at a discount price of just $0.00237. If the project goes live during the bull market, a 10x, or even a 100x jump is a possibility for this token. Avalanche (AVAX) Though Avalanche price has been dropping for quite a few days, the trend might change soon and AVAX can follow BONK price action. This seems to be the case as a falling wedge pattern emerged on the token’s daily price chart. The pattern appeared in December 2024 and since then, AVAX price has been consolidating inside it. A successful test of this pattern can first push AVAX towards $34.6. A breakout above that mark can lift AVAX price towards its January 2025 high of over $54. Final Words BONK price at $0.00001342 has sparked investor interest, but SUI, BTCBULL, and AVAX show potential to surpass its trend. With bullish indicators, these cryptos could deliver significant gains in the coming days.

According to a local publication, the Metro department store in Singapore has teamed up with Singaporean crypto payments firm DTCPAY to enable stablecoin payments using assets like Tether’s USDT, Circle’s USDC, and Worldwide Stablecoin Payment Network’s WUSD. Soon, they’ll also support payments using the First Digital Dollar Stablecoin (FDUSD). Metro’s COO, Erwin Wuysang-Oei, described the partnership as a step toward keeping up with the evolving retail landscape. He emphasized that by accepting stablecoin payments, Metro is “not only embracing the future but shaping it.” “This is a transformative moment for Metro, and we are excited to lead the industry in making digital assets a viable everyday reality for our customers,” Wuysang-Oei added. The latest partnership follows DTCPAY’s decision to switch exclusively to stablecoins for payments in 2025 after it decided to drop Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) back in January. At the time, the company said the decision would allow it to offer a “more reliable, scalable, and secure payment experience.” You might also like: Robinhood aims to launch crypto offerings in Singapore by late 2025 Meanwhile, Singaporeans have increasingly warmed up to crypto, making digital assets a bigger part of daily life and investments. As previously covered by crypto.news, Singaporean wealth managers have reported allocating larger portions of their portfolios to digital assets, especially since President Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 U.S. elections. At the time, Sygnum Bank CEO Gerald Goh said locals were “more positive about incorporating crypto investments as part of their investment portfolios.” Singapore has also pulled ahead of other jurisdictions, like Hong Kong, when it comes to crypto adoption. Throughout 2024, the Monetary Authority of Singapore granted 13 new crypto licenses, doubling numbers recorded the previous year. In comparison, Hong Kong lagged behind due to an overly restrictive regulatory framework.

Bitcoin is currently 12% below the $100,000 milestone, with analysts noting that sufficient buying pressure and positive macroeconomic developments could push BTC even higher. However, analysts are warning that there could be further declines before the rally even begins. At this point, 10x Research research head Markus Thielen, who stands out with his successful predictions, said that Bitcoin has the potential to fall to $73,000. Markus Thielen, head of research at cryptocurrency analytics platform 10x Research, noted in a recent report that Bitcoin is forming a diamond top pattern, a bearish technical indicator that signals a possible decline. Stating that BTC could not protect the important support levels of $95,000 and $92,000, Thielen stated that, apart from the diamond top pattern, the fact that short-term investors are in losses will also support further correction. While the experienced analyst expects a decline in Bitcoin, he noted that historical trends point to a possible recovery in Bitcoin around $73,000. Thielen said that the long-term bullish expectation is still valid and that investors should closely follow the Fed interest rate decision in March. *This is not investment advice.

The Feb. 26 buyback was reported on X by popular on-chain analyst AI姨, who flagged Jupiter’s ( JUP ) Litterbox address used for all buyback transactions. The buyback is the first step in Jupiter’s larger strategy to repurchase JUP tokens with 50% of protocol fees. https://twitter.com/ai_9684xtpa/status/1894587658359509255?s=46&t=nznXkss3debX8JIhNzHmzw The buyback initiative, which was unveiled on Feb. 13, intends to reduce the number of tokens in circulation by locking repurchased tokens for three years and generating consistent buying pressure. The cryptocurrency community has welcomed the move, viewing it as a net positive that will boost demand and prevent JUP from becoming a “value trap.” You might also like: LIBRA’s collapse becomes Solana’s biggest scandal since FTX: How Jupiter and Meteora left retail rekt Jupiter is projected to spend about $50 million on JUP buybacks this year, based on its $102 million revenue in 2024. These buybacks would represent about 2.7% of JUP’s $1.8 billion market capitalization. Jupiter has continued to hold its spot as Solana’s top DEX aggregator. The protocol generates fees by directing trades among many DEXs, such as Raydium and Orca, and ensuring that traders receive the best exchange rates. In the past year, Jupiter’s revenue has increased significantly as a result of the memecoin trading frenzy on Solana. The Jupiter Perps trading platform, which holds over 80% of Solana’s perpetual decentralized exchange market, has been another key contributor to Jupiter’s revenue growth. In 2024, revenue increased sharply from $3 million in January to $21 million in December, according to on- chain analyst AI姨. Almost 40% of Jupiter’s total revenue for the year, or $35.86 million, came from fees during significant trading periods, including the spike in TRUMP memecoin trading. Jupiter’s buyback initiative is in line with a larger DeFi trend in which protocols such as Aave ( AAVE ) and Ethena ( ENA ) are implementing token value-accrual methods. Although the long-term effects are yet to be seen, the buyback initiative shows an increasing emphasis on aligning tokenholder value with protocol growth.

Of these, BlackRock selling news is gaining the most attention, as reports suggest that it has transferred millions of assets to Coinbase Prime. Investors fear further market crashes, so what’s happening? Let’s discuss. BlackRock Bitcoin Transfer Gives Chills to Investors BlackRock is a renowned asset custodian and issuer of the IBIT ETF. As a custodian, it holds assets on behalf of investors and often conducts transactions for various purposes. However, its recent transfer of 1,800 BTC ($160M) to Coinbase Prime puts it in a tough spot, as investors understand it as a possible sell-off. Along with the BTC transfer, the ETF provider also transferred 18,168 ETH ($44M), bringing the total to $204M. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin price crashed to $88.16k , adding extra fears among investors and speculation about selling. This is because a move to the exchange wallet often results in selling. However, that is not the case here. This is because, as a custodian, this ETF manager cannot directly buy or sell the asset. It actually holds assets on behalf of the ETF investors. More importantly, analysts believe this move does not indicate a sale. Instead, it could be related to portfolio rebalancing, redemptions, or operational adjustments within the fund. BlackRock Selling More of ETF Outflows This asset manager is grabbing investors’ attention with $204M worth of asset transfers on February 25 within a short time. Interestingly, these events happened amid the broader ETF market outflows, where the Bitcoin ETFs saw a single-day exit of $937.9M. Here, the Coinglass report reveals Fidelity ETF (FBTC) witnessed the most significant outflow of the day, at $344.7M, and IBIT came next with $164.4M, which many considered selling. Considering BlackRock holding of 584.789K BTC (2.6% of the total supply), including the $50 billion worth of token purchases in 2024 alone, investors’ concerns are considerable. If they begin selling, the crypto market crash will accelerate severely. However, this is less likely to happen, especially as this asset manager is a pro-crypto supporter. Its CEO, Larry Fink, predicts that BTC price could hit $700,000 if sovereign wealth funds allocate a small percentage of their assets to the cryptocurrency. Conclusion: No, They Are Not Selling Bitcoin Despite speculation and investor concerns, it is clear that this asset manager is not selling BTC. Though the transfers were present, that could be a part of redemptions or rebalancing, as the asset manager has done the same before multiple times. Additionally, the firm has long held a positive stance on crypto and believed in its continuous growth, even to as high as $700,000, so the selling outcome is less likely. Amid these speculations, the Bitcoin price is still volatile, trading at $88.3k after an 8% drop last week.

The team revealed a structured plan to provide education, financial incentives, and integration opportunities for developers looking to build on the network. With nearly $200 million raised in its presale, BlockDAG is using this momentum to fuel adoption by ensuring builders have the resources they need to create impactful decentralized applications. Developer Grants and Financial Support One of the key takeaways from the AMA was BlockDAG’s introduction of a developer grants program. The initiative will allocate funding ranging from $10,000 to $100,000, depending on the scope and potential impact of each project. The grants will be distributed in BDAG tokens and USDT, providing flexibility for builders who need immediate liquidity while still maintaining a vested interest in the network’s success. The funding aims to support projects in DeFi, gaming, NFTs, and cross-chain applications, ensuring a diverse range of use cases that can leverage BlockDAG’s capabilities. This financial backing is set to encourage early-stage developers and established teams alike to experiment and contribute to the ecosystem. Tutorials and Learning Resources BlockDAG is also focused on education, recognizing that onboarding developers requires more than just incentives. The BlockDAG Academy, spearheaded by Marcus Xavier, will roll out a structured learning platform covering blockchain fundamentals, smart contract development, and network-specific tools. Educational content will be divided into three levels: General Blockchain Knowledge – Covers key concepts, security practices, and wallet management. BlockDAG-Specific Training – Focuses on how to interact with BlockDAG’s architecture and smart contract framework. Advanced Development – Provides guidance on building, testing, and deploying decentralized applications (dApps) on BlockDAG. The academy will integrate with platforms like GitHub and online coding communities to streamline learning and collaboration. Encouraging Smart Contract Deployment on Testnet With the upcoming testnet beta set to launch in March, BlockDAG is actively encouraging developers to deploy and test smart contracts. The testnet will feature: A revamped BlockDAG Explorer with real-time contract monitoring Verification tools to authenticate smart contract security Visual dashboards that allow developers to track network performance Community involvement is crucial in this phase, and BlockDAG plans to reward active participants who deploy and stress-test contracts before mainnet launch. Integration with Major Coding Platforms Beyond educational resources, BlockDAG is working on seamless integration with major coding platforms. Developers will be able to access smart contract templates and frameworks through GitHub, simplifying the onboarding process. Additionally, BlockDAG is in discussions to integrate Solidity-based development environments that streamline coding for Ethereum-compatible contracts. This move ensures that experienced blockchain developers can transition to BlockDAG with minimal friction, while newcomers benefit from intuitive tools that reduce technical barriers. BlockDAG Presale Success and Future Outlook BlockDAG’s developer-focused initiatives come at a time when its presale performance is setting records. The latest statistics highlight the project’s rapid growth: Total funds raised: Nearly $200 million Current batch: 27 Batch price: $0.0248 per BDAG Total BDAG coins sold: Over 18.5 billion ROI since batch 1: 2,380% These figures underscore investor confidence in the project, with the team’s commitment to onboarding developers only reinforcing its long-term vision. Looking Ahead BlockDAG’s strategic push for developer engagement positions it as a strong contender in blockchain adoption. By funding projects, simplifying smart contract deployment, and offering structured educational programs, the network is laying the foundation for a thriving ecosystem. With testnet incentives on the horizon and upcoming exchange listings, BlockDAG is setting the stage for widespread adoption. Developers looking to be part of an actively growing network now have access to resources that will support them every step of the way.

The move will allow merchants to easily pay and receive payments in stablecoin through a new bill-pay feature. The plans were revealed during PayPal’s annual investor day, unveiling its new merchant product launches and offerings. Michelle Gill, who leads PayPal’s small business and financial services unit, explained that the goal is to help merchants onboard more vendors for seamless transactions. She emphasized that PYUSD would reduce currency conversion fees and payment delays. “A lot of the payments we’re expecting are going to be cross-border because merchants in the US are seeking to pay vendors and suppliers abroad,” she noted. Besides, PayPal plans to integrate PYUSD stablecoin into Hyperwallet this year. Hyperwallet, one of PayPal’s key acquisitions, allows businesses to send payments to freelancers, contractors, and sellers worldwide. Marc Boiron, CEO of Polygon Labs, highlighted that stablecoins are booming with a current market cap of $216.26 billion, thanks in part to platforms like PayPal making them easier to use. Last October, PayPal completed its first transaction with its own stablecoin, showcasing its potential in commercial transactions. Jose Fernandez da Ponte, PayPal’s senior VP of crypto, pointed out that the transaction highlighted other crypto use cases, noting that the speed and availability of settlement make it more attractive. He also mentioned that the current US administration is “very good for crypto” and that the US will soon catch up with the rest of the world.

On Tuesday, the net outflows stood at a staggering $937 million, marking the biggest single-day outflows since inception. The outflows have escalated as BTC price loses its crucial support levels falling all the way under $88,500 while extending its weekly losses to more than 7.52%, leading to an overall crypto market crash. Bitcoin ETF Outflows Shake Investor Sentiment Amid the crypto market crash and BTC price losing crucial support levels, US Bitcoin ETFs have witnessed a surge in outflows over the past week. The Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) market experienced its largest-ever single-day net outflow, with 14,579 BTC withdrawn globally, according to Velte Lunde, Head of Research at K33 Research. Source: K33 Research Lunde further added that the ETFs have faced sustained selling pressure throughout February with 69% of the month’s trading days seeing net outflows. This trend underscores a consistent reduction in investor exposure to Bitcoin ETFs, reflecting cautious market sentiment amid broader crypto market volatility. On Tuesday, Fidelity’s FBTC led the total ETF outflows with $344 million while BlackRock’s IBIT saw $144 million in outflows, as per data from Farside Investors . Fidelity has also recorded outflows for six consecutive days in a row. Investors have pulled $1.7 billion from cryptocurrency exchange-traded products (ETPs) and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) this week so far. Bitcoin Exchange Inflows Surge, BTC Price Crash to $70K Imminent? CryptoQuant analyst Amr Taha reported a notable spike in Bitcoin exchange activity, with the “Exchange Inflow (Top 10)” metric exceeding 5,000 BTC three times in a single day following the release of the U.S. Consumer Confidence report. Consumer confidence in the U.S. has dropped to an eight-month low, driven by growing concerns over inflation and the impact of new tariffs introduced under the second Trump administration. The increased inflows suggest potential selling pressure as large holders or institutions may be moving Bitcoin to exchanges for liquidation. This could potentially trigger further outflows from Bitcoin ETFs ahead. Source: CryptoQuant BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has suggested that Bitcoin could retrace to pre-election levels between $70,000 and $75,000 if former President Donald Trump fails to pass his proposed budget, which includes increased spending and a debt ceiling hike. “This is a test of how strong Trump’s hold is on the Republican Party,” Hayes stated, advising market participants to “chill out, retrace, and wait” as the situation unfolds.

Many altcoins have turned green now but are still deep in the red compared to the valuations since this weekend. BTC Calms at $89K It was less than a week ago, on Friday when the primary cryptocurrency was preparing for a charge of $100,000 after gaining over five grand since the Tuesday dip. However, no such challenge actually occurred as Bybit was compromised in what became the largest crypto hack ever, with $1.4 billion stolen. BTC reacted immediately with a drop to $95,000 within hours. After recovering some ground during the weekend to around $96,500, the landscape changed for the worse on Monday and especially on Tuesday. Within the span of just 24 hours or so, the cryptocurrency went from $96,000 to $86,000, losing ten grand in the process. This became one of its most violent price corrections and pushed its valuation to the lowest levels in over three months – erasing lots of the gains charted after Trump’s presidential victory. You can check some of the potential reasons behind this crash here . Since then, BTC has been able to rebound slightly and now sits quietly at $89,000. Its market capitalization, which shed over $150 billion in a day, is now at just over $1.760 trillion on CG. Its dominance over the alts has shrunk by almost 1% to 57.9%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts Bounce-Off The alternative coins suffered even more yesterday, but many have bounced off on a daily scale now. Ethereum, which dumped to $2,300, is up challenging $2,500 after a 4% daily increase. BNB is up to $630, while SOL is above $140. Even more impressive daily gains come from the likes of XRP, which has added 8.5% and sits north of $2.3, DOGE, ADA, LINK, XLM, AVAX, LTCO, SUI, TON, SHIB, HBAR, HYPE, and many others.

The total crypto market capitalization hovered just above $2.7 trillion—marking a nearly $1 trillion wipeout since its peak in December 2024, according to TradingView data. Several indicators suggest that Tuesday's sell-off may have marked a local bottom. Andre Dragosch , Head of Research at Bitwise Europe, highlighted that the Crypto Asset Sentiment Index hit its lowest level since August, coinciding with the unwinding of the yen carry trade, which saw bitcoin make a bottom at around $49,000. ""The Crypto Asset Sentiment Index just flashed a massive contrarian buy signal for Bitcoin. Widespread bearishness across flows, on-chain data, and derivatives suggests that downside risks are fairly limited. At these prices, the risk-reward outlook appears quite favorable,"" Dragosch noted. On Tuesday, investors lost $1.8 billion — the largest single-day realized loss since August — when the yen carry trade unwind resulted in $3.2 billion in realized losses, according to Glassnode data. Additionally, short-term holders, defined by Glassnode as investors who have held bitcoin for less than 155 days, sent 43,600 BTC ($3.9 billion) to exchanges at a loss— the highest level since August 2024.

XRP reached a peak of $3.40 in mid-January and has since entered a downtrend, with the price dropping 25% this month to $2.28, according to data from TradingView and CoinDesk. While the sell-off has been steep, it corresponds to only a 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the rally that started at Nov. 4's low of 49.5 cents through the Jan. 16 high of $3.40. A retracement is a drop from the principal trend. That's positive news for XRP bulls, as that level, along with the 50% and 61.8% ratios, indicates potential areas for the price to resume its previous trend, according to the CME's explainer . Trends often pull back to these levels before initiating larger rallies. That means XRP bulls have reason to be optimistic about potential gains ahead. Moreover, there has been some positive news flow regarding XRP recently. On Monday, ETF.com said Brazil's securities regulator had registered the first spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) as the Hashdex Nasdaq XRP Fund entered a so-called pre-operational phase with Brazil's Comissão de Valores Mobiliários (CVM). U.S. regulators are also reviewing applications for XRP ETFs. A potential approval could accelerate institutional demand for XRP if the uptake of bitcoin ( BTC ) and ether ( ETH ) ETFs is any guide. The Fibonacci series comprises adding the two preceding numbers to find the next number. The sequence, which has been of interest to mathematicians and scientists for centuries, occurs in the following manner: 1, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, and so on. The ratio of any number to the next higher number is close to 0.618 and if you divide any number in the sequence by the one two spaces to the right, you get 38.2. Traders use these ratios and the 50% level to predict how far an asset might retrace the primary trend, in XRP's case, the bull run. It's a different story for dogecoin because a primary trend is considered to have ended when a retracement exceeds the 61.8% level. The world's largest meme cryptocurrency by market value has dropped below 21 cents, retracing more than 70% of the rally marked by October lows near 10 cents and a high of 48.4 cents in December.",Markets|XRP|DOGE|Markets|Technical Analysis,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|DOGE|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-26 10:00:02

Despite this, firms like Grayscale and 21Shares are actively seeking approval for ETFs tied to Polkadot, Solana, and other altcoins. Meanwhile, market sentiment is currently very cautious, and CryptoQuant’s Ki Young Ju even suggested that an ”altcoin season” as most people know it is unlikely to take place in 2025. Altcoin ETFs Face Uncertain Demand The introduction of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) holding alternative cryptos in the United States may not attract a lot of investor interest, despite asset managers filing multiple applications. While analysts expect regulatory approval for some of these ETFs in 2025, demand is expected to be much lower than that for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. A crypto ETF is a regulated investment vehicle that allows investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without directly holding the underlying assets. These ETFs trade on traditional stock exchanges and track the price of a specific cryptocurrency or a basket of digital assets. Investment analysts suggest that institutional investors, who were previously hesitant to invest in Bitcoin and Ethereum before the ETF structure was introduced, are unlikely to show the same level of interest in altcoin ETFs. Katalin Tischhauser , head of research at Sygnum, pointed out that the market excitement surrounding altcoin ETFs does not seem to be backed by clear evidence of strong demand. She estimates that inflows for altcoin ETFs may range from several hundred million to $1 billion, which is a stark contrast to the over $100 billion held by US Bitcoin ETFs. Bryan Armour , the director of passive strategies research at Morningstar agrees with this, and stated that many investors who are familiar with altcoins like Solana and Dogecoin already hold these assets through spot exchanges or on-chain. He believes that institutional investors are more likely to gain exposure to altcoins through index funds that passively track the broader cryptocurrency market rather than through standalone altcoin ETFs. Recent developments in the crypto ETF space suggest a preference for more established assets. Franklin Templeton and Hashdex both launched crypto index ETFs that currently hold only Bitcoin and Ethereum, though they may expand to include other assets pending regulatory approval. Despite the skepticism from analysts, asset managers preparing to launch altcoin ETFs are still very optimistic. Research by JPMorgan suggests that cumulative demand for these products could exceed $14 billion. Federico Brokate, head of US operations at 21Shares, argues that even experienced crypto investors stand to benefit from holding altcoins in an ETF wrapper due to institutional pricing and secure custody. He also shared that independent registered investment advisors (RIAs) are increasingly considering altcoin ETFs as a way to differentiate their portfolios. The adoption of crypto ETFs follows a pattern, according to Matt Horne, head of digital asset strategists at Fidelity Investments. Just as Bitcoin ETFs saw early adopters before gaining wider acceptance, altcoin ETFs may experience a gradual adoption process over time. While the initial demand for these funds is expected to be quite limited, the market could evolve as more investors recognize the potential benefits of holding altcoins in an ETF structure. Grayscale Seeks Approval for Polkadot ETF One of the latest developments surrounding altcoin ETFs happened when Nasdaq recently filed a request to list a Grayscale ETF that will hold Polkadot’s native token, DOT. If approved, the Grayscale Polkadot Trust will join the asset manager’s growing portfolio of publicly traded crypto funds. This filing is one of many currently under review by the SEC as exchanges and asset managers seek approval for ETFs tied to altcoins. Grayscale’s DOT ETF application (Source: Nasdaq ) Grayscale already lists two spot Bitcoin ETFs and a spot Ethereum ETF, and is looking for regulatory approval for ETFs holding Solana, Litecoin, XRP, Dogecoin, and Cardano. The firm also wants to launch an ETF that holds a diversified basket of cryptocurrencies. Beyond ETFs, Grayscale manages several single-asset crypto funds that are not publicly traded. Earlier this year, it introduced investment funds for the Pyth Network’s native token and Dogecoin. In late 2023, the company launched investment funds for Lido and Optimism’s governance tokens. The push for crypto ETFs has intensified, and multiple asset managers are seeking approval to list funds tied to a range of altcoins. Among them, 21Shares has also submitted an application for a Polkadot ETF. Other proposed funds include ETFs for Hedera and Official Trump. In addition to new listings, issuers are awaiting regulatory decisions on proposed changes to existing ETFs, like allowances for staking, options trading, and in-kind redemptions. The SEC’s stance on cryptocurrency regulation shifted a lot in recent months, particularly after Donald Trump’s re-election. Under the Biden administration, the SEC took aggressive action against crypto firms by initiating more than 100 lawsuits related to securities law violations. While spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs received approval in 2024, ETFs tied to other cryptocurrencies faced resistance. However, analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence estimate that the likelihood of an XRP ETF gaining approval in the US is about 65%, with Litecoin and Solana ETFs having even stronger odds at 90% and 70%, respectively. Altcoin Season Unlikely in 2025… In addition to reduced interest in altcoin ETFs, the widespread rally known as ”altcoin season” may not materialize in 2025. However, cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals and revenue-generating models could still outperform the broader market, according to CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju . He believes that most altcoins are unlikely to survive the next market cycle, and stated that “the era of everything pumping is over.” However, projects with potential ETF approvals, consistent revenue streams, and sustained investor interest may stand out. Ju’s assessment was made as nearly a quarter of the 200 largest cryptocurrencies hit their lowest levels in over a year, which raised some concerns about a potential market capitulation. This decline also led to speculation that the market could be approaching a bottom before the next upward trend. Juan Pellicer , a senior research analyst at IntoTheBlock, pointed to the recent market correction as a possible sign of capitulation. The drop in total crypto market cap to $2.93 trillion and massive liquidations, particularly in assets like Solana, indicate that overleveraged positions are being flushed out. In financial markets, capitulation happens when investors panic-sell their holdings, leading to a steep decline in prices before the market stabilizes and begins to recover. While some assets may struggle in the current environment, Ju suggests that investors should focus more on cryptocurrencies with clear utility and strong financial models rather than hoping for a broad-based altcoin rally. Overall, it seems like the projects that can sustain long-term interest and institutional backing may be the ones that thrive.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|BUSINESS|BTC|DOT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-26 10:01:16

The new report published by the local financial regulator highlights the bright prospects for the South African DeFi sector. Table of Contents The goal of the study The numbers South Africa as a significant nascent crypto hub The goal of the study On Feb. 20, 2025, the Financial Sector Conduct Authority released a study called Market Study on Decentralized Finance (DeFi) in South Africa. The study is based on a survey of crypto asset service providers and aims to assist local regulators to better understand the role of DeFi in South Africa. The timing is important as South Africa has become one of the world’s leading countries in the DeFi sector in the 2020s. As the sector itself is already shaping the country’s economic outlook, clearer regulation is in demand, particularly when it comes to the relationship between the banks and crypto asset service providers. According to the study, the estimated annual revenue of the South African DeFi sector is $2.8 million. The main players in the market are retail clients (71%), followed by small and medium-sized enterprises. The key factors behind the sector growth identified in the study are financial inclusion facilitated by DeFi, low transaction costs, and transparency. The growing significance of the DeFi sector in the local economy brings new risks. The study points them out, citing price manipulation, security breaches of smart contracts, potential platform failures, and fraud as the main threats associated with decentralized finance. The risks outlined in the study include custody risk, oracle risk, liquidity risk, and many more. The study suggests that regulations should factor these risks in to ensure users’ protection. Respondents believe that the main ways to protect users are associated with improved regulation and educational efforts aimed to elevate the financial literacy of the residents. The numbers More than a third of respondents believe that the South African DeFi sector TVL exceeds $27 million, which is not a huge share of the global total but is still significant in the region. Moreover, it is growing rapidly. The overall DeFi market in South Africa is projected to reach $180 million by 2028. The study reveals the top use cases for DeFi in South Africa. More than half of respondents use crypto for payments, with lending and borrowing coming in second at 47.6%. A third of respondents use decentralized exchanges, and only 14.2% say they use stablecoins. Staking, asset management, and tokenization are three other popular responses. These responses show that the DeFi sector in South Africa is providing banking and remittance opportunities for residents while serving as a tokenization channel for traditional finance players. Respondents provided an outlook on the market drivers in the country, citing increasing adoption by mainstream investors (62%), the emergence of new DeFi protocols (43%), the unbanked population (33%), and the declaration of crypto as financial products (29%) as the main factors. You might also like: South African Financial Sector Regulator Declares Crypto Assets a Financial Product In general, it’s safe to say that despite the name (Decentralised Finance in South Africa), the report is largely focused on describing the DeFi sector per se so that the regulators (the report’s main audience) would know better how to deal with the growing sector. South Africa as a significant nascent crypto hub Sub-Saharan Africa, in general, is a region where the crypto sector is growing rapidly, largely because cryptocurrencies have met the unfulfilled demand for financial inclusion. South Africa, as one of the leading economies on the continent, has become one of the most important crypto hubs in Africa. The local crypto sector saw important changes in the 2020s as the government implemented a series of crypto-friendly laws. Most importantly, in October 2022, the Financial Sector Conduct Authority declared crypto to be a financial product, making it legal to use cryptocurrency in South Africa, although the ruling didn’t grant crypto a legal tender status. In general, the favorable legal climate has made South Africa one of the nascent crypto hubs in the region and in the world as well. Local crypto asset service providers are institutions regulated under the Financial Intelligence Centre Act. The AML rules are mandatory for the CASPs operating in South Africa. To control the cross-border movement of value, the country adopted a Travel Rule for crypto assets. It will come into effect from April 2025. According to Chainanalysis , the South African crypto market was valued at $26 billion in 2023. Last year’s trends included the growing interest from institutional investors seeking custody solutions in the decentralized finance sector. Reflecting the overall African trend of using crypto for everyday payments, the circulation of stablecoins in South Africa outperformed Bitcoin in 2023. The experts from the local crypto industry claim that the elections scheduled for May of 2025 won’t affect a friendly crypto regulatory climate.

Imagine a financial landscape where innovation thrives, but within a framework that ensures fairness and stability. This is the vision Circle, the issuer of USDC, is championing. Let’s dive into the heart of this discussion and explore why Circle is advocating for equitable crypto regulation , not just in the U.S., but globally, and what Tether’s CEO has to say about the competitive landscape. Why Equitable Crypto Regulation for Stablecoins Matters Now? Dante Disparte, Chief Strategy Officer at Circle, recently articulated a pressing need for the United States to establish crypto regulation that treats all stablecoin issuers fairly, regardless of their location. In an interview with The Information, Disparte emphasized that a level playing field is essential to foster growth and ensure continued access to vital banking and regulatory systems for these burgeoning financial instruments. But why is this so critical right now? Global Competition is Heating Up: Disparte anticipates a surge in global competition among stablecoin providers. Fair regulations can prevent a regulatory race to the bottom and ensure that innovation is driven by product quality and utility, not just by exploiting regulatory loopholes. Fostering Innovation: Equitable laws can encourage innovation within the stablecoins sector. When companies feel confident that the rules are fair and consistently applied, they are more likely to invest in developing better products and services. Protecting Consumers: Consistent regulatory standards, whether for U.S. or overseas entities, are vital for consumer protection. This ensures that all stablecoins operating within or serving the U.S. market adhere to similar safety and transparency standards. Maintaining U.S. Leadership: By establishing clear and equitable crypto regulation , the U.S. can maintain its leadership in the global financial landscape. A well-defined framework can attract innovation and investment in the digital asset space. The Tether Factor: Is it Really a ‘Kill Tether’ Strategy? While Circle advocates for fair crypto regulation , the landscape is undeniably competitive, and perhaps even adversarial, according to some. Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, the issuer of USDT, recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to express his perspective on the competitive dynamics. He claims that while competitors should ideally focus on building superior products and expanding their distribution networks, their “real intent is ‘Kill Tether.’” Ardoino suggests that this view is widely held by insiders and observers who interact with the U.S. government. This paints a picture of a highly charged environment where competition isn’t just about market share but potentially about the very survival of certain digital assets . Tether vs. USDC: A Tale of Two Stablecoins The contrasting statements from Circle and Tether highlight the complex dynamics within the stablecoins market. Let’s break down some key differences and points of contention: Feature USDC (Circle) USDT (Tether) Issuer Transparency Circle provides regular attestation reports and is more transparent about its reserves. Tether has faced criticism for its reserve transparency, although it has increased transparency over time. Regulatory Compliance Circle is actively engaging with regulators and is committed to full compliance. Tether has faced regulatory scrutiny and questions regarding its compliance in various jurisdictions. Reserve Composition USDC reserves are primarily held in cash and short-term U.S. government bonds. USDT reserves have included a wider range of assets, including commercial paper, corporate bonds, and others. Market Capitalization USDC has a significant market cap but is generally lower than USDT. USDT consistently holds the largest market capitalization among stablecoins . Key Focus Advocating for clear and equitable crypto regulation to foster growth and stability. Navigating regulatory challenges while maintaining market dominance and defending against perceived competitive threats. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Evolving Stablecoin Landscape For those involved in the cryptocurrency space, whether as investors, developers, or policymakers, understanding these dynamics is crucial. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed on Regulatory Developments: Crypto regulation is a rapidly changing field. Keep abreast of the latest developments in the U.S. and globally. Follow regulatory bodies like the SEC, CFTC, and international organizations like the Financial Stability Board (FSB). Understand Stablecoin Risks and Transparency: Do your due diligence on different stablecoins . Understand their reserve composition, transparency practices, and regulatory compliance status. Not all stablecoins are created equal. Support Constructive Dialogue: Encourage and participate in constructive conversations about crypto regulation . Engage with industry associations, participate in public consultations, and voice your opinions to policymakers. Consider Diversification: In a competitive and potentially volatile market, diversification can be a prudent strategy. Consider using a mix of different digital assets and stablecoins based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Advocate for Fair Rules: Support initiatives and organizations that advocate for clear, fair, and equitable crypto regulation that fosters innovation and protects consumers. The Future of Stablecoins: A Battle for Fair Play? The contrasting narratives from Circle and Tether underscore a pivotal moment for stablecoins . Circle’s call for equitable crypto regulation reflects a desire for a stable and predictable environment that fosters long-term growth and innovation. Tether’s concerns about a ‘Kill Tether’ strategy highlight the intense competitive pressures and regulatory scrutiny facing the sector. Ultimately, the future of stablecoins will be shaped by how regulators respond to these calls and how effectively the industry can navigate the complex interplay of competition and compliance. The quest for fair and effective crypto regulation is not just about the survival of individual companies; it’s about shaping the very foundation of the future digital economy.

According to Matt Hougan, the Chief Investment Officer (CIO) of Bitwise, a leading crypto index fund manager, the reign of meme-based cryptocurrencies is likely to conclude within the next six months. Is this the beginning of a new era for the crypto market , shifting away from fleeting trends and towards more sustainable growth? Is the Memecoin Craze Fading? Expert Insights In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Hougan highlighted the struggles of certain memecoins, including MELANIA and LIBRA, as indicators of a broader market shift. He pointed out that these tokens, once riding high on hype, are now facing headwinds. MELANIA, associated with the former U.S. First Lady, and LIBRA, entangled in controversy with Argentine President Javier Milei, are symbolic of the speculative frenzy that often fuels the memecoin craze . Adding fuel to the fire, Hougan also mentioned the notorious North Korean hacker group Lazarus. Known for their sophisticated cybercrimes, including the Bybit hack, Lazarus is reportedly using memecoins as a novel method to launder stolen Ethereum (ETH). This adds a layer of complexity and risk to the already volatile memecoin landscape. Here’s a quick rundown of the factors contributing to the potential decline of the memecoin boom: Market Saturation: The sheer number of memecoins flooding the market dilutes attention and investment, making it harder for individual coins to gain traction and maintain hype. Regulatory Scrutiny: As the crypto market matures, regulators are increasingly paying attention to all sectors, including memecoins, potentially leading to stricter rules and compliance requirements. Investor Fatigue: The get-rich-quick allure of memecoins can wear off as investors experience volatility and potential losses, seeking more fundamentally sound investments. Focus on Utility: The crypto narrative is gradually shifting towards real-world utility and applications, pushing aside purely speculative assets like many memecoins. Beyond Memes: The Promising Future of the Crypto Market While predicting the end of the memecoin craze , Hougan’s outlook for the broader crypto ecosystem remains decidedly optimistic. He emphasizes several key areas poised for significant growth, suggesting a more mature and robust future for the industry. Let’s delve into these positive catalysts: The Power of Bitcoin Adoption Hougan is particularly bullish on the continued institutional adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) . This isn’t just about retail investors anymore; major financial institutions, corporations, and even governments are increasingly recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value and a legitimate asset class. Why is institutional Bitcoin adoption a game-changer? Increased Legitimacy: Institutional investment brings credibility and mainstream acceptance to Bitcoin and the entire crypto space. Larger Capital Inflows: Institutions manage vast amounts of capital, and their entry into Bitcoin can inject significant liquidity into the market, driving growth and stability. Long-Term Investment Horizon: Unlike retail investors who might be swayed by short-term market fluctuations, institutions often have a longer-term investment horizon, fostering stability and sustainable growth. The Rise of Stablecoins: Stability in a Volatile World Stablecoins , cryptocurrencies pegged to a stable asset like the US dollar, are becoming increasingly crucial for the crypto ecosystem. Hougan highlights their growing importance, and for good reason. Benefits of Stablecoins: Benefit Description Reduced Volatility Stablecoins offer a refuge from the price swings inherent in other cryptocurrencies, making them ideal for transactions and preserving value. Efficient Transactions They enable fast and low-cost transactions, especially for international transfers, without the volatility risk of other cryptos. DeFi Integration Stablecoins are the backbone of many Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications, facilitating lending, borrowing, and yield farming activities. Tokenization: Unlocking New Asset Classes Tokenization , the process of representing real-world assets like real estate, art, or commodities as digital tokens on a blockchain, is another area Hougan is excited about. This innovative approach has the potential to revolutionize various industries. The Promise of Tokenization: Increased Liquidity: Tokenization can make traditionally illiquid assets more easily tradable and accessible to a wider range of investors. Fractional Ownership: It allows for fractional ownership of high-value assets, democratizing investment opportunities. Enhanced Transparency and Efficiency: Blockchain-based tokenization provides transparency and streamlines processes like asset transfer and management. DeFi Resurgence: The Future of Finance? Despite past setbacks and challenges, Hougan anticipates a strong DeFi resurgence . Decentralized Finance aims to recreate traditional financial services like lending, borrowing, and trading in a decentralized, transparent, and accessible manner using blockchain technology. Why DeFi is Poised for a Comeback: Technological Advancements: Improvements in blockchain technology, scalability solutions, and security protocols are making DeFi platforms more robust and user-friendly. Growing User Base: As more people become comfortable with crypto and seek alternatives to traditional finance, DeFi adoption is likely to increase. Innovation and Evolution: The DeFi space is constantly innovating, developing new protocols, and addressing past vulnerabilities, paving the way for a more mature and sustainable ecosystem. Navigating the Transition: A Word of Caution While optimistic about the long-term prospects, Hougan also cautions that the crypto market might experience a period of slowdown before these positive trends fully materialize. The transition from a memecoin-driven frenzy to a more fundamentally sound market takes time. Until institutional adoption, stablecoin usage, tokenization, and DeFi fully gain momentum, the market could experience some growing pains. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts: Focus on Fundamentals: Shift your attention from hype-driven memecoins to projects with real utility, strong teams, and solid technology. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify across different asset classes within the crypto space, including Bitcoin, stablecoins, and promising DeFi projects. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market trends, regulatory developments, and technological advancements in the crypto space. Manage Risk: Understand the risks involved in crypto investing and invest responsibly, only what you can afford to lose. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Crypto Matt Hougan’s forecast paints a picture of a crypto market at a turning point. The potential end of the memecoin craze could signal a healthy shift towards more sustainable growth drivers like institutional Bitcoin adoption , the utility of stablecoins , the innovation of tokenization , and the resurgence of DeFi . While a period of market adjustment might be on the horizon, the long-term outlook for the crypto space appears bright, promising a more mature, robust, and impactful future. The era of fleeting hype might be fading, but the era of real crypto innovation is just beginning.

In his recent post on X , Vitalik Buterin, a co-founder of Ethereum ( ETH ), has encouraged researchers to join the Poseidon cryptographic analysis program. Vitalik is considering switching to the Poseidon hash function to improve how it works with zk-provers (tools for verifying transactions privately). To help make this decision, Ethereum wants more information about Poseidon’s security, and they’ve extended the deadline to apply for the funding program to March 15. Highly encourage researchers to participate in the Poseidon cryptanalysis program. We are seriously considering migrating Ethereum to the Poseidon hash to optimize zk-prover friendliness, so having more information about its security properties is extremely high value. https://t.co/AhbV8abD4z — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) February 26, 2025 In Nov. 2022, a proposal called Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 5988 was introduced, suggesting adding a precompiled contract to the Ethereum Virtual Machine to implement the Poseidon hash function, aiming to enhance interoperability between the EVM and zero-knowledge rollups. You might also like: What is Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)? A deep dive Since the proposal’s introduction, it seems there hasn’t been any official implementation or major update to EIP 5988, but it looks like Ethereum is still seriously considering implementing Poseidon. The Poseidon hash function , introduced in 2019, is relatively new compared to well-established hash functions like SHA-256 and Keccak, which have been around for decades and have undergone extensive testing. However, SHA-256 or Keccakt aren’t specifically designed for zero-knowledge proofs. In contrast, Poseidon has specifically been designed for use in zero-knowledge proofs. Although it hasn’t been as extensively tested as SHA-256 and Keccak, Poseidon is already in use in production within layer-2 systems on the Ethereum network and other blockchain projects. Ethereum’s exploration of the Poseidon hash function is just a small part of its broader efforts to enhance the network’s performance. Most notably, the long-awaited Pectra upgrade will officially launch on April 8, aiming to enhance Ethereum’s scalability, improve account abstraction, boost layer-2 efficiency, and increase validator rewards. This upgrade follows the recent Dencun hard fork—which rolled out in March 2024, significantly slashing transaction fees for layer-2 networks.

Oklahoma is taking a potentially groundbreaking step into the world of digital assets. The Oklahoma House committee has just given the nod to a bill that could see Bitcoin (BTC) recognized as a strategic reserve asset. This move signals a significant shift in how states might approach cryptocurrency, and it’s definitely something to keep your eye on. Let’s dive into what this all means. Oklahoma House Committee Approves Landmark BTC Reserve Bill In a decisive move, the Oklahoma House committee has voted in favor of a bill that proposes to classify Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. According to crypto media outlet Solid Intel, the bill sailed through the committee with a strong 12 votes in favor. This is a major win for proponents of cryptocurrency adoption and could pave the way for other states to follow suit. The bill, championed by U.S. Representative Cody Maynard, was initially introduced in January and has been steadily gaining momentum. If enacted, it would grant the Oklahoma state government the authority to allocate up to 10% of its public funds into Bitcoin and other digital assets. This isn’t just a symbolic gesture; it’s a concrete step towards integrating digital currencies into the state’s financial strategy. Before reaching this stage, the bill had already cleared another hurdle, securing six favorable votes from the U.S. Committee on Banking, Financial Services and Pensions. With this latest committee approval, the legislation is now poised for a crucial vote before the full House. The crypto community is watching closely, eager to see if Oklahoma will become a pioneer in embracing Bitcoin as a state-level reserve asset. Why is Oklahoma Considering Bitcoin as a Strategic Asset? So, what’s driving Oklahoma’s interest in Bitcoin? Several factors could be at play. Firstly, there’s a growing recognition of Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value and a hedge against inflation. As traditional financial systems face uncertainties, alternative assets like Bitcoin are gaining traction. Secondly, states are likely exploring ways to diversify their investment portfolios and potentially enhance returns. Bitcoin, despite its volatility, has shown significant growth over the long term, and a strategic allocation could be seen as a forward-thinking financial move. Here are some potential benefits of Oklahoma designating Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset: Diversification of State Funds: Bitcoin’s low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds can offer diversification benefits to the state’s investment portfolio, potentially reducing overall risk. Potential for Higher Returns: While not guaranteed, Bitcoin has historically outperformed many traditional assets over longer periods, offering the potential for increased returns on state investments. Attracting Innovation and Technology: Embracing Bitcoin can position Oklahoma as a tech-forward state, potentially attracting blockchain and cryptocurrency businesses and talent. Future-Proofing Finances: As digital assets gain prominence, integrating Bitcoin into state reserves can be seen as a proactive step to adapt to the evolving financial landscape. Navigating the Challenges: What are the Hurdles Ahead? Of course, adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset isn’t without its challenges. Cryptocurrency adoption , especially at the governmental level, comes with considerations that need careful attention. Volatility Concerns: Bitcoin’s price volatility is a significant concern for any entity managing public funds. Risk management strategies would be crucial to mitigate potential losses. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. States need to navigate complex legal and compliance issues when dealing with digital assets. Security and Custody: Safeguarding Bitcoin holdings requires robust security measures and secure custody solutions to prevent theft or loss. Public Perception and Education: Educating the public and addressing potential skepticism about Bitcoin is important for ensuring transparency and public trust in this initiative. Examples of Crypto Adoption: Learning from Others While Oklahoma’s move is noteworthy, it’s not happening in isolation. Other regions and even countries are exploring or have already embraced Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in various ways. For instance: Region/Country Approach to Cryptocurrency Key Highlights El Salvador Bitcoin as Legal Tender First country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, aiming to boost financial inclusion and remittances. Switzerland (Zug) Crypto-Friendly Canton Canton of Zug has become a hub for crypto companies, accepting Bitcoin for taxes and public services. Miami, USA Pro-Bitcoin City Initiatives Mayor Francis Suarez has been a vocal Bitcoin advocate, exploring Bitcoin payments for city employees and citizens. These examples demonstrate different levels of cryptocurrency adoption and highlight the diverse ways in which digital assets are being integrated into economies and governance. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? The Oklahoma BTC reserve bill , even if you are not in Oklahoma, carries implications for the broader crypto space and individual investors. Increased Institutional Interest: State-level adoption can signal growing institutional acceptance of Bitcoin, potentially attracting further investment from larger players. Validation of Bitcoin as an Asset Class: Designating Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset strengthens its legitimacy as a viable asset class beyond just speculative trading. Potential for Regulatory Clarity: As more states and governments engage with cryptocurrencies, it could push for clearer and more consistent regulatory frameworks. Positive Market Sentiment: News like this often contributes to positive sentiment in the crypto market, potentially influencing price action and investor confidence. For individual investors, this development reinforces the narrative of Bitcoin’s increasing mainstream acceptance. While it’s essential to do your own research and understand the risks, moves like Oklahoma’s suggest a potential long-term trend towards greater integration of digital assets into the financial system. Conclusion: A Strategic Move or a Risky Bet? Oklahoma’s strategic asset consideration of Bitcoin is undoubtedly a bold and forward-looking move. Whether it’s a stroke of genius or a risky gamble remains to be seen. However, it’s undeniable that this initiative puts Oklahoma at the forefront of state-level cryptocurrency adoption in the U.S. The full House vote will be a critical juncture, and the outcome will likely have ripple effects across the crypto industry and potentially influence other states’ approaches to digital assets.

Bitcoin’s prolonged consolidation had kept Deribit’s volatility index (DVOL) in a downward trend throughout 2025. However, after bitcoin’s sharp decline, DVOL spiked to 52 before retreating back below 50—signaling a temporary surge in market uncertainty. The recent price drop below $90,000 has left a majority of options out-of-the-money (OTM) and traders facing significant unrealized losses. An option allows the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a specific price within a certain time period. According to Deribit data , out of the $5 billion of notional value that is due to expire, $3.9 billion (78%) of it is due to expire out-the-money (OTM), meaning these contracts will expire worthless. Almost 100% of calls are OTM, which are bullish bets, as the bitcoin price dropped significantly over the past few days, leaving investors with a significant amount of unrealized losses. While, the remaining $1.1 billion (22%), was in-the-money (ITM) with it being dominated with puts. ITM puts are investors having their strike prices above the spot price, meaning they hold value. However, max pain is at $98,000, that is, $10,000 higher than the current spot price. Max pain is the price at which option sellers, typically institutions, achieve maximum profit, while buyers experience the greatest amount of losses. As the max pain price is so much higher than the spot price, this could incentivize options sellers to push bitcoin price higher closer to the pain level, according to PowerTrade . ""With the end of the month approaching, bitcoin options traders should take note. Max Pain for Feb. 28 sits at $98,000, with a massive $5 billion notional value. This means the highest open interest is clustered here, incentivizing market makers to keep bitcoin close to this price. Expect increased volatility and potential price gravitation toward this level,"" PowerTrade said on X.

Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the influential co-founder and former CEO of crypto exchange giant Binance, has stepped forward to deliver a powerful message about the king of cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin (BTC) is here to stay. In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), CZ declared unequivocally that there’s “no need to panic” because Bitcoin “won’t die.” But what does this statement truly mean in the grand scheme of the crypto market, and why should investors and enthusiasts take note? Why CZ’s Confidence in Bitcoin Matters When a figure as prominent as CZ speaks about the future of Bitcoin , the crypto community listens. His tenure at the helm of Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, has given him unparalleled insights into market dynamics, investor sentiment, and the underlying strength of various digital assets. CZ’s declaration isn’t just a casual remark; it’s a statement rooted in years of experience navigating the volatile crypto landscape. Here’s why CZ’s words carry weight: Industry Veteran Perspective: CZ has witnessed numerous crypto cycles, including bull runs and bear markets. His experience provides a historical context to current market conditions. Binance’s Market Position: As the former CEO of Binance, CZ has access to vast amounts of market data and user behavior insights, giving him a unique understanding of Bitcoin ‘s role in the broader ecosystem. Influence on Market Sentiment: CZ’s opinions often influence market sentiment. His positive stance on Bitcoin can instill confidence among investors, potentially stabilizing or even boosting market morale. Decoding the ‘Bitcoin Won’t Die’ Statement CZ’s simple yet powerful statement, “ Bitcoin won’t die,” is more than just reassurance; it’s a nod to the fundamental principles and enduring characteristics of Bitcoin that have allowed it to weather numerous storms since its inception in 2009. Let’s break down what makes Bitcoin so resilient: Decentralization: Bitcoin’s decentralized nature is arguably its greatest strength. Unlike traditional currencies controlled by central banks, Bitcoin operates on a distributed ledger across a global network. This decentralization makes it incredibly difficult to shut down or control by any single entity. Scarcity: With a capped supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin possesses inherent scarcity, similar to gold. This scarcity is a core tenet of its value proposition, acting as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. Network Effect: The more people and businesses that adopt Bitcoin , the stronger its network effect becomes. This growing ecosystem enhances its utility, security, and overall value. Technological Foundation: Built on robust blockchain technology, Bitcoin ‘s underlying infrastructure is secure and transparent. Continuous development and upgrades further strengthen its technological foundation. Global Adoption: Bitcoin enjoys global recognition and adoption, transcending geographical boundaries and traditional financial systems. Its accessibility and borderless nature contribute to its staying power. Navigating Crypto Volatility with Confidence The crypto market is notorious for its volatility. Price swings can be dramatic and often influenced by a myriad of factors ranging from regulatory news to macroeconomic trends. In such an environment, maintaining market confidence is crucial. CZ’s statement serves as a reminder of the long-term potential of Bitcoin , encouraging investors to look beyond short-term fluctuations. How can investors navigate crypto volatility with greater confidence? Strategy Description Benefit Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) Investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of price. Reduces the impact of volatility by averaging out the purchase price over time. Long-Term Investing (HODLing) Holding Bitcoin for the long term, weathering short-term price fluctuations. Capitalizes on the potential for long-term appreciation of Bitcoin ‘s value. Diversification Spreading investments across different cryptocurrencies and asset classes. Reduces risk by not putting all eggs in one basket. Staying Informed Keeping up-to-date with crypto news, market trends, and regulatory developments. Enables informed decision-making and better risk management. The Enduring Appeal of Crypto Resilience The concept of crypto resilience is central to understanding why many believe in the longevity of digital assets like Bitcoin . Resilience in this context refers to the ability of cryptocurrencies to withstand market crashes, regulatory pressures, and technological challenges. Bitcoin has repeatedly demonstrated this resilience throughout its history. Examples of Bitcoin’s resilience: Market Crashes: Bitcoin has survived multiple significant market crashes, each time recovering and often reaching new all-time highs. Regulatory Hurdles: Despite varying regulatory landscapes across the globe, Bitcoin continues to operate and gain acceptance in many jurisdictions. Technological Scrutiny: Bitcoin ‘s technology has been rigorously tested and scrutinized, proving its robustness and security over time. CZ’s recent statement reinforces this narrative of resilience. It’s a reminder that despite the noise and volatility, the fundamental principles and underlying technology of Bitcoin are strong. For those deeply invested in the crypto space, this message is not just comforting; it’s a validation of their long-held beliefs. Actionable Insights: What to Take Away from CZ’s Statement So, what are the key takeaways from CZ’s reassuring words about Bitcoin ? Don’t Panic Sell: Market dips are a normal part of the crypto cycle. CZ’s statement suggests that these dips should be viewed as opportunities rather than reasons to panic and sell. Long-Term Perspective: Focus on the long-term potential of Bitcoin rather than short-term price movements. Bitcoin ‘s fundamentals remain strong, and its long-term trajectory is still promising. Educate Yourself: Continue to learn about Bitcoin , blockchain technology, and the broader crypto market. Informed investors are better equipped to make sound decisions during volatile times. Stay Informed, Stay Calm: Keep abreast of market news and developments, but avoid emotional reactions to price swings. A calm and informed approach is crucial for navigating the crypto market successfully. Conclusion: Bitcoin’s Enduring Legacy Changpeng Zhao’s assertion that Bitcoin “won’t die” is a powerful endorsement of its staying power in the digital age. It’s a message of hope and stability in a market often characterized by uncertainty. While the crypto journey will undoubtedly continue to be filled with twists and turns, the underlying resilience and fundamental strengths of Bitcoin , as highlighted by CZ, offer a compelling reason for long-term optimism. As Bitcoin matures and adoption grows, its role in the future of finance looks increasingly secure, promising a future where digital assets play an integral part in the global economic landscape.

The volatile world of digital assets has delivered another jaw-dropping moment. This time, it involves the MELANIA token, and the exit of a major crypto investor that’s sending ripples through the market. A significant player, identified as the second-largest holder of MELANIA, has just made a dramatic exit, and the numbers are, frankly, staggering. Let’s dive into the details of this market-shaking event and explore what it could mean for the future of MELANIA and the broader altcoin landscape. What Exactly Happened with the MELANIA Token Sale? According to on-chain data sleuths @EmberCN, a prominent address known for holding a substantial amount of MELANIA tokens executed a massive token sale . In a move that has stunned many, this address dumped a whopping 6.688 million MELANIA tokens. The sale was executed for 6.27 million USDC, with each token fetching a price of approximately $0.937. To put this into perspective, this same address had acquired these tokens earlier in the month at a significantly higher price of $1.5 each, investing a total of 10 million USDC. Let’s break down the key numbers: Tokens Dumped: 6.688 million MELANIA Sale Price per Token: $0.937 USDC Received: 6.27 million Original Purchase Price per Token: $1.5 Original Investment: 10 million USDC The stark reality is that this crypto investor incurred a massive market loss of $3.74 million in this single transaction. Yes, you read that right – $3.74 million vanished in a flash. This event raises serious questions about the stability and risks associated with investing in meme coins and newer altcoins like MELANIA. Why Did This Major Crypto Investor Exit? The million-dollar question (or rather, the $3.74 million question) is: why? Why would a major holder, the second largest no less, decide to cut their losses and exit so dramatically, even at such a significant financial hit? While we can only speculate, here are a few potential reasons: Fear of Further Decline: The investor might have anticipated further price drops in the MELANIA token and decided to minimize their losses by exiting preemptively. In the volatile crypto market, fear can drive even the most seasoned investors to make drastic decisions. Liquidity Concerns: Perhaps the investor needed to free up capital for other investments or to cover unexpected financial obligations. Selling off a large position, even at a loss, can provide immediate liquidity. Loss of Confidence: The investor may have lost faith in the long-term prospects of the MELANIA token. Negative market sentiment, lack of project development updates, or perceived flaws in the tokenomics could erode confidence and trigger a sell-off. Whale Manipulation or Profit Taking: While less likely given the loss, it’s always possible that this was a calculated move to manipulate the market or take profits elsewhere, even if it meant realizing a loss on this particular asset. However, in this case, the significant loss makes this scenario less probable. MELANIA Token: Another Risky Altcoin in the Crypto Sea? This incident shines a harsh spotlight on the inherent risks of investing in altcoins , particularly those with a meme-coin origin. While the allure of quick gains can be strong, the reality is that these assets are often highly volatile and susceptible to dramatic price swings. Here’s what this market loss incident tells us about the risks associated with altcoin investments like MELANIA: High Volatility and Price Swings The crypto market, in general, is known for its volatility, but altcoins , especially newer ones, can experience even more extreme price fluctuations. The MELANIA token’s price swing from $1.5 to $0.937 in a short period exemplifies this volatility. Investors need to be prepared for such rapid and potentially devastating price drops. Liquidity Risks Smaller altcoins often suffer from lower liquidity compared to established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. This means that large sell orders, like the one we witnessed with MELANIA, can have a disproportionately large impact on the price, leading to significant slippage and losses. Dependence on Hype and Sentiment Meme coins and many altcoins are heavily reliant on social media hype and community sentiment. Positive buzz can drive prices up rapidly, but negative news or a shift in sentiment can lead to equally rapid declines. The fundamental value proposition of these tokens is often weak or non-existent, making them particularly vulnerable to market sentiment shifts. Rug Pull and Scam Potential The altcoin space is unfortunately rife with scams and rug pulls. While there’s no indication that MELANIA is a scam, the risk is always present with newer, less established projects. Investors need to conduct thorough due diligence and be aware of the potential for projects to disappear overnight, taking their investments with them. Lessons for Crypto Investors: Navigating the Altcoin Market The MELANIA market loss event serves as a crucial learning moment for all crypto investors , especially those venturing into the altcoin arena. What actionable insights can we glean from this situation? Diversification is Key Never put all your eggs in one basket, especially in the high-risk world of altcoins . Diversify your portfolio across different asset classes and cryptocurrencies to mitigate risk. Don’t allocate a significant portion of your capital to a single, unproven altcoin . Due Diligence is Non-Negotiable Before investing in any altcoin , conduct thorough research. Understand the project’s fundamentals, team, tokenomics, and community. Don’t rely solely on hype or social media buzz. Look for credible information and assess the project’s long-term viability. Risk Management is Paramount Only invest what you can afford to lose. The crypto market , particularly the altcoin segment, is inherently risky. Set stop-loss orders to limit potential losses and manage your position sizes carefully. Don’t let emotions drive your investment decisions. Be Wary of Hype and FOMO Avoid chasing pumps and falling victim to FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). Often, by the time an altcoin is heavily hyped, it’s already reached its peak, and you’re likely to buy at the top. Be cautious and patient, and don’t let social media frenzy dictate your investment strategy. Long-Term Vision vs. Short-Term Gains Decide whether you’re investing for the long term or seeking short-term gains. Altcoins are often better suited for short-term trading due to their volatility. If you’re looking for long-term investments, consider more established cryptocurrencies with stronger fundamentals. Conclusion: A Stark Reminder of Crypto Market Realities The $3.74 million market loss experienced by a major crypto investor in the MELANIA token sale is a stark reminder of the wild west nature of the altcoin market. While fortunes can be made, they can also be lost just as quickly. This incident underscores the critical importance of due diligence, risk management, and a balanced investment strategy. The crypto market offers exciting opportunities, but it also demands caution and a healthy dose of skepticism, especially when it comes to newer and less established altcoins . The MELANIA saga serves as a valuable, albeit painful, lesson for all navigating the unpredictable seas of cryptocurrency investments.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/cyber-security-firm-kaspersky-revealed-one-of-the-hackers-theft-methods-users-in-turkey-are-also-in-danger-here-are-the-details/,"Cybercriminals are using fake GitHub repositories to spread malware that steals Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies, cybersecurity firm Kaspersky has warned. Kaspersky Warns Hackers Are Using Fake GitHub Code to Steal Bitcoin A malware campaign dubbed “GitVenom” has been active for at least two years and has been increasingly present on the popular code-sharing platform GitHub, according to Kaspersky's latest report. The attack begins with seemingly legitimate open-source projects, such as Telegram bots or gaming tools to manage crypto wallets, but hides malicious code designed to steal crypto assets. How Does GitVenom Work? The malware is cleverly hidden in GitHub repositories: Each project appears legitimate and often includes an AI-generated README file to build trust. Ancak, kod gizli kötü amaçlı komut dosyaları içeriyor. In Python-based projects, attackers hide malware behind 2,000 empty tab spaces in the script, which decrypts and runs a malicious payload. In JavaScript-based projects, a fake function embedded in the main file triggers a malware attack. Once activated, the malware downloads additional tools from hacker-controlled GitHub repositories. How to Steal Crypto? Once installed, GitVenom uses multiple tools to steal sensitive user data: Node.js-based password and crypto wallet thieves extract stored passwords, wallet details, and browsing history, then send them to hackers via Telegram. Remote access trojans (RATs) such as AsyncRAT and Quasar hijack a victim's device, logging keystrokes and capturing screenshots. A clipper redirects cryptocurrency transactions by replacing copied wallet addresses with those of the attacker. One such wallet received 5 BTC ($485,000) in stolen funds in November alone. Kaspersky noted that GitVenom is particularly active in Russia, Brazil, and Turkey, but its reach is global. Attackers remain undetected by imitating active development and constantly changing their coding tactics to evade antivirus detection. How to Stay Safe? Kaspersky advises developers and crypto users to: Review code carefully before running it. Verify the authenticity of any GitHub project. Be wary of overly exaggerated READMEs or inconsistent commit histories. As cyberattacks continue to increase, GitVenom is unlikely to disappear. “We expect these attacks to continue in the future, with likely minor changes in tactics,” Kaspersky concluded. *This is not investment advice.

Crypto has featured heavily since the start of President Donald Trump's presidency. In January he issued an executive order laying out specific actions, including one being for the nation to move forward with a more crypto-friendly regulatory framework. In February, Tennessee Senator Bill Hagerty introduced a stablecoin oversight bill that would establish a regulatory regime for U.S. dollar-backed coins. “Whether you’re an offshore company or based in Hong Kong, if you want to offer your dollar stablecoin in the U.S., you should need to register in the U.S. just like we have to go register everywhere else,” Allaire said. These comments were echoed by Dante Disparte, Circle's Chief Strategy Officer & Head of Global Policy and Operations. ""All companies that issue dollar stablecoins - whether they’re startups or based outside the U.S. - should have the opportunity to register in the United States and compete on a level playing field – no company that issues dollar stablecoins should get a free pass from safety and soundness rules and appropriate prudential supervision,"" Disparte, told CoinDesk in a statement. The stablecoin sector has a total market cap of $232 billion and underpins cryptocurrency trading. The tokens are also often used in international money transfers. Companies including PayPal say they plan to expand their stablecoin businesses. Michelle Gill, the general manager of PayPal’s small business and financial services group, told Bloomberg that the company intends to integrate its PYUSD stablecoin, ranked 10th largest by market cap at CoinGecko, into more of its products in the coming months .

The Altcoin Season Index, a crucial gauge for understanding the ebb and flow between Bitcoin and altcoin performance, currently sits at a reading of 25. This figure, provided by CoinMarketCap (CMC) on February 26th at 00:35 UTC, remains unchanged from the previous day and firmly plants the crypto market in what’s known as ‘Bitcoin Season’. Let’s decode what this fascinating metric means for you and your crypto portfolio. Decoding the Altcoin Season Index: What Does 25 Really Mean? The Altcoin Season Index is your compass in the often-turbulent waters of cryptocurrency trading. Imagine trying to understand if the broader market is favoring Bitcoin or if altcoins are having their moment in the sun. This index simplifies that complexity. Calculated by CMC, it meticulously tracks the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) over the past 90 days. It’s a head-to-head comparison against Bitcoin itself. Here’s the breakdown of what the index score tells us: Index Range: Scores range from 1 to 100. Bitcoin Season (0-25): When the index is low (like the current 25), it signifies a ‘Bitcoin Season’. This means Bitcoin is outperforming the vast majority of altcoins. Altcoin Season (75-100): Conversely, a high index reading signals an ‘Altcoin Season’. This occurs when at least 75% of the top 100 coins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. Neutral Territory (26-74): Scores in this range suggest a more balanced market, where neither Bitcoin nor altcoins are overwhelmingly dominant. In essence, an Altcoin Season Index of 25 is a clear indicator: we are currently navigating a Bitcoin Season . But what does this dominance really imply? Navigating Bitcoin Season: Implications for the Crypto Market When the market tips into Bitcoin Season, several dynamics come into play. Understanding these can be crucial for strategic decision-making in your crypto journey. Here’s what Bitcoin dominance typically entails: Capital Flow to Bitcoin: Often, Bitcoin Season is characterized by investors moving capital from altcoins back into Bitcoin. This is frequently seen as a ‘flight to safety’ during times of market uncertainty or correction. Bitcoin Price Strength: Bitcoin tends to show stronger price performance compared to altcoins during this period. Its dominance in market capitalization and investor sentiment often leads to increased buying pressure. Altcoin Underperformance: While some altcoins may still perform well, the majority will likely underperform Bitcoin. This doesn’t mean altcoins will necessarily decrease in value, but their gains might be less significant compared to Bitcoin’s. Market Consolidation: Bitcoin Season can be a period of market consolidation. As capital flows into Bitcoin, it can lead to a more stable, albeit potentially less volatile, market environment overall – at least until the next shift. Is Bitcoin Season always a bad sign for altcoins? Not necessarily. It’s more about relative performance. While altcoins may not be the market leaders during Bitcoin Season, they can still present opportunities. Selective altcoins with strong fundamentals, active development, and unique use cases might still hold their value or even grow. Spotting Opportunities in Altcoin Season: A Contrarian View While a low Altcoin Season Index points to Bitcoin’s current reign, it doesn’t mean altcoin opportunities vanish entirely. In fact, savvy investors might see Bitcoin Season as a strategic moment to: Identify Undervalued Altcoins: During Bitcoin Season, some fundamentally strong altcoins may be temporarily undervalued as market attention shifts to Bitcoin. This could be an opportune time for research and potential accumulation. Rebalance Portfolio: Bitcoin Season can be a good time to re-evaluate your portfolio. If you are heavily weighted in altcoins, you might consider rebalancing by increasing your Bitcoin holdings to align with the current market trend. Prepare for the Turnaround: Market cycles are inherent in crypto. Bitcoin Season won’t last forever. Astute investors use this time to research and position themselves for the eventual return of Altcoin Season, when capital and momentum might flow back into the broader altcoin market. Actionable Insight: Don’t panic sell your altcoins during Bitcoin Season. Instead, use this period to strategically assess your portfolio, identify strong altcoin projects, and potentially accumulate more Bitcoin or undervalued altcoins based on your risk tolerance and investment strategy. Challenges of Predicting Market Seasons: Is the Altcoin Season Index Foolproof? While the Altcoin Season Index is a valuable tool, it’s essential to acknowledge its limitations. No single metric can perfectly predict market movements. Here are some challenges to consider: Lagging Indicator: The index is based on 90-day performance. It reflects past trends and may not always be a leading indicator of immediate future shifts. Top 100 Focus: It only considers the top 100 coins by market cap on CMC. The broader altcoin market is vast, and many promising projects exist outside this top tier. Market Manipulation: Like any market, crypto markets can be subject to manipulation. Short-term price pumps or dumps in Bitcoin or specific altcoins could temporarily skew the index. External Factors: Macroeconomic events, regulatory news, and unforeseen black swan events can override index signals and dramatically impact the entire crypto market, regardless of Bitcoin or Altcoin Season. Key Takeaway: Use the Altcoin Season Index as one data point among many. Combine it with other forms of market analysis, including fundamental research, on-chain metrics, and broader market sentiment, for a more comprehensive understanding. Examples of Past Market Seasons: Learning from History Looking back at historical crypto market cycles, we can observe distinct periods that align with Bitcoin and Altcoin Seasons. Market Period Dominant Season Characteristics Early 2017 Bitcoin Season Bitcoin’s price surged, driven by institutional interest and anticipation of scaling solutions. Altcoins followed later in the year. Mid-Late 2017 Altcoin Season The ICO boom fueled massive capital inflow into altcoins. Many altcoins experienced exponential gains, often exceeding Bitcoin’s returns. 2018-2020 Prolonged Bitcoin Season (Bear Market) The crypto market entered a bear market. Bitcoin dominance increased as altcoins suffered significant losses. Flight to quality towards Bitcoin. Early 2021 Altcoin Season Renewed bull market, DeFi summer, NFT craze. Altcoins, particularly in DeFi and NFTs, outperformed Bitcoin significantly. Late 2021 – Present Mixed/Bitcoin Season Market volatility, corrections, and shifts in narratives. Periods of both Bitcoin and Altcoin strength, with the current phase leaning towards Bitcoin dominance. These historical examples illustrate the cyclical nature of the crypto market and the recurring shifts between Bitcoin and Altcoin Seasons. Understanding these patterns can help you contextualize the current Bitcoin Season and prepare for potential future transitions. Conclusion: Embracing the Rhythms of the Crypto Market The Altcoin Season Index at 25 is a clear signal: Bitcoin is currently leading the crypto dance. While Altcoin Season might feel like a distant dream, remember that market cycles are inevitable. Bitcoin Season provides a period of consolidation, strategic portfolio adjustments, and opportunity identification within the altcoin space. By understanding the dynamics of market seasons and utilizing tools like the Altcoin Season Index, you can navigate the crypto landscape with greater awareness and potentially position yourself for future market shifts. Stay informed, stay strategic, and embrace the ever-evolving rhythms of the crypto market.

According to the exchange’s latest announcement , the exchange is delisting BNB/UAH and ETH/UAH due to weak liquidity and trading activity. Binance clarified that users can still trade BNB and ETH with other pairs on the platform, but these specific pairs will no longer be available. The exchange also warned users that its Spot Trading Bots services for these pairs would be terminated on the same date. Traders relying on automated strategies must update or cancel their bots before the cutoff to prevent financial losses. Binance Delisting Impact On BNB & ETH The delisting of a trading pair, especially by the leading crypto exchanges like Binance, often raises concerns about price stability. While the removal of BNB/UAH and ETH/UAH may not directly impact global trading, it does indicate a weakening demand for these assets in the Ukrainian market. If traders react negatively, it could trigger short-term price fluctuations for both BNB and ETH. Additionally, the crypto market has recently faced a significant downturn, with major assets struggling to maintain support levels. This latest move by Binance might further impact investor sentiment, particularly for traders focusing on BNB and ETH. What Traders Should Watch Next? Investors should focus on the following aspects with this latest delisting announcement from Binance: Alternative Trading Pairs: Binance confirmed that BNB and ETH remain tradable on other pairs. Investors should explore available options to continue their trading strategies. Market Sentiment: A drop in liquidity for these assets could indicate declining interest. Traders should monitor volume changes on Binance and other exchanges. BNB and ETH Price Movements: With the broader market in a fragile state, any additional FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) could impact BNB and ETH prices. Watching resistance and support levels is crucial. Binance’s Future Moves: Binance has been making several changes to its offerings, including delisting underperforming assets. Keeping an eye on further updates from the exchange will help traders stay ahead. How ETH & BNB Prices Are Performing? Despite the delisting announcement, both BNB and ETH stayed in the green today. Meanwhile, most of the top altcoins and Bitcoin prices have faced massive volatility recently amid a broader crypto market crash. However, the market has witnessed a bounce back today. During writing, BNB price was up around 5% and exchanged hands at $627.34. The token has touched a 24-hour high and low of $630.82 and $596.70, respectively. On the other hand, ETH price today was up around 4.5% to $2,480, while touching a 24-hour high of $2,529.

Just when the Bitcoin ETF euphoria seemed unstoppable, we’ve got a notable development shaking things up. Franklin Templeton’s spot Bitcoin ETF, EZBC, just experienced a jolt – a significant single-day outflow. Let’s dive into what happened and what it could mean for the broader crypto market. Is this a minor blip or a sign of changing tides in the world of Bitcoin ETFs ? Record Bitcoin ETF Outflow for Franklin Templeton’s EZBC On February 25th, data from Farside Investors revealed that Franklin Templeton’s EZBC ETF witnessed a substantial Bitcoin ETF outflow of $74.1 million. This marks the largest single-day exodus since the ETF’s inception. While the spot Bitcoin ETF market has largely seen net inflows since their launch in January, this event raises eyebrows and prompts questions about investor sentiment towards specific ETFs and potentially the overall market. Here’s a quick breakdown of the key facts: ETF: Franklin Templeton Spot Bitcoin ETF (EZBC) Event: Largest single-day outflow since inception Outflow Amount: $74.1 million Date: February 25th Data Source: Farside Investors This outflow contrasts with the general trend of net inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have been a major catalyst in driving Bitcoin’s price surge in recent times. So, why did investors pull out such a significant amount from the Franklin Templeton ETF ? Understanding Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows: What Does it Mean? To understand the significance of this ETF outflow , let’s break down what ETF outflows actually represent and why they matter in the cryptocurrency context. What are ETF Outflows? ETF outflows occur when investors sell their shares of an ETF, leading to a decrease in the assets under management (AUM) of the fund. For spot Bitcoin ETFs, outflows mean that the fund needs to sell actual Bitcoin holdings to meet redemption requests from investors. Why do ETF Outflows Matter? Price Impact: Significant and sustained outflows can potentially exert downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price as the ETF sells BTC to cover redemptions. Investor Sentiment: Outflows can reflect a shift in investor sentiment. It might indicate reduced confidence in the specific ETF, or potentially a broader cooling off in enthusiasm for Bitcoin at that moment. Market Dynamics: Tracking ETF flows provides insights into the dynamics of institutional and retail investor participation in the Bitcoin market through these regulated investment vehicles. While a single-day outflow doesn’t necessarily signal a long-term trend reversal, it’s crucial to analyze it within the broader context of the spot Bitcoin ETF market and overall market sentiment. Franklin Templeton ETF EZBC: Context and Performance The Franklin Templeton EZBC ETF is one of the newer entrants in the spot Bitcoin ETF race, launched in January 2024 alongside several other prominent players like BlackRock and Fidelity. While it has attracted assets, it has generally trailed behind the leaders in terms of AUM and daily trading volumes. Here’s a comparative glance at EZBC and some of the leading spot Bitcoin ETFs (as of recent data – numbers fluctuate): Note: This is a hypothetical table for illustrative purposes. Real-time ETF data should be consulted for accurate figures. ETF Name Ticker Approx. AUM (USD Billion) Recent Daily Flow (USD Million) iShares Bitcoin Trust IBIT ~9-10 Generally Positive Inflows Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund FBTC ~6-7 Generally Positive Inflows Grayscale Bitcoin Trust GBTC ~25-30 (decreasing due to outflows) Consistent Outflows (but slowing) Franklin Bitcoin ETF EZBC ~0.2-0.3 -$74.1 Million (on Feb 25) As you can see, EZBC’s AUM is smaller compared to giants like IBIT and FBTC. This smaller size might make it more susceptible to percentage-wise larger swings in flows. However, the question remains: is this ETF outflow EZBC specific, or does it indicate broader trends in the spot Bitcoin ETF market? Spot Bitcoin ETF Market Dynamics: Broader Trends While the Franklin Templeton ETF outflow is noteworthy, it’s essential to look at the bigger picture. The overall trend for spot Bitcoin ETFs since their launch has been overwhelmingly positive, with billions of dollars flowing in. Funds like BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC have consistently attracted significant inflows, showcasing strong investor appetite for these products. Even on February 25th, the day EZBC experienced the outflow, other spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively saw net inflows. This suggests that the outflow from EZBC might be an isolated event or specific to factors concerning that particular ETF rather than a widespread exodus from the entire spot Bitcoin ETF category. Key Takeaway: While the EZBC outflow is a data point to consider, the broader trend in the spot Bitcoin ETF market remains one of net inflows and growing adoption. Monitoring daily flows across all ETFs is crucial to get a comprehensive understanding of market dynamics. Analyzing ETF Outflows: Potential Reasons and Market Impact Pinpointing the exact reasons behind a single-day ETF outflow is challenging. However, we can consider some potential contributing factors: Profit-Taking: Investors who bought into EZBC earlier might have decided to take profits after Bitcoin’s recent price appreciation. Portfolio Rebalancing: Institutional investors and large holders often rebalance their portfolios periodically. This could involve shifting assets between different ETFs or asset classes. Rotation to Other ETFs: Investors might be rotating assets from EZBC to other spot Bitcoin ETFs perceived as having lower fees, better liquidity, or stronger brand recognition. Short-Term Market Sentiment: While Bitcoin’s long-term outlook remains bullish for many, short-term market fluctuations and profit-taking activities can influence daily ETF flows. Potential Market Impact: Limited Direct Price Impact (Likely): Given the overall size of the spot Bitcoin ETF market and daily trading volumes, a $74.1 million outflow from one ETF, while significant for EZBC, is unlikely to trigger a major immediate price drop in Bitcoin. Sentiment Indicator: However, consistently large outflows across multiple ETFs *could* become a negative sentiment indicator, potentially influencing market psychology and price action in the medium term. Focus on ETF Competition: This event highlights the competitive landscape within the spot Bitcoin ETF market. ETFs with strong inflows and brand recognition are likely to be more resilient to isolated outflow events. Conclusion: Navigating the Evolving Bitcoin ETF Landscape The Bitcoin ETF outflow from Franklin Templeton’s EZBC serves as a timely reminder that the spot Bitcoin ETF market, while promising, is still evolving and subject to market dynamics. While the overall trend remains positive with strong net inflows, individual ETF flows can fluctuate based on various factors, including investor sentiment, profit-taking, and competition among ETF providers. For investors and market observers, the key is to monitor these flows consistently across all spot Bitcoin ETFs, not just isolated events. Understanding the underlying reasons behind inflows and outflows will provide valuable insights into the health and maturity of the Bitcoin ETF market and its impact on the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. The power of these ETFs to attract capital is undeniable, but vigilance and nuanced analysis are crucial for navigating this exciting new chapter in Bitcoin’s journey.

Working towards building the first-ever mainstream chain for dedicated builders, the mainnet launch comes after the successful completion of its public beta which it initiated last year in May. Further, apart from the mainnet launch, Etherlink also introduced a rewards program named as “Apple Farm”. The program is designed to incentivise users, bringing more engagement and participation for its growing ecosystem. Etherlink’s Key Distinctions With several prominent blockchain projects and protocols such as Pyth Network, The Graph, LayerZero already integrating Etherlink, the mainnet is set to further scaling of its Layer2 solutions. Etherlink aims to provide a fast, cost-effective, and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible Layer 2 solution. With its foundation on Tezos’ Smart Rollups technology, Etherlink offers sub-second block times, low transaction fees, and strong security inherited from Tezos’ Layer 1 infrastructure. Further, it is fully compatible with Ethereum-based applications, allowing developers to seamlessly migrate their projects without requiring extensive modifications. This means that dApps built for Ethereum, including those in DeFi, NFTs, and GameFi, can easily integrate with Etherlink while benefiting from faster and cheaper transactions. Other features include : Offering Subsecond finality, transactions on Etherlink are confirmed in less than 500 milliseconds, providing a smooth user experience. Transactions cost around $0.001, making it highly cost-effective. Ensuring decentralized governance, the network is governed by Tezos bakers for community-driven decision-making. With LayerZero integration, Etherlink also allows cross-chain asset transfers and smart contract interactions. Incentive Program to bring more engagement in DeFi As mentioned, to celebrate the mainnet launch, Etherlink has introduced Apple Farm, a unique rewards program designed to incentivize user engagement within the ecosystem. Users can earn “Apples”—the program’s native reward points—by interacting with dApps, using DeFi protocols, and participating in network activities. How Apple Farm Works: Allowing users to earn Apples, users will be able to accumulate Apples by performing various on-chain activities such as staking, swapping tokens, and providing liquidity. Apples can be exchanged for exclusive NFTs, governance perks, and community incentives. Active participants may also receive boosted rewards, early access to new features, and a chance to shape Etherlink’s development. Introducing Apple Farm An incentive program with $3,000,000 in rewards allocated towards Season 1 – here to make DeFi on Etherlink more rewarding. pic.twitter.com/D35MUOUWW2 — Etherlink (@etherlink) February 25, 2025 Though the launch of its mainnet and incentive program is promising, the road ahead remains challenging for Etherlink. It must compete with major Layer 2 players such as Arbitrum and Polygon. While existing Layer 1 and Layer 2 solutions, like Ethereum, face scalability challenges, they continue to dominate the industry. Establishing itself as a major player will not be easy for Etherlink.

Is this the end of the current bull market for the highly technical layer 1 blockchain, or is there still the possibility of a recovery? Bounce or further fall? The $SOL price has taken quite a fall. From the new all-time high of $295, the price has plummeted 55% to touch $132 on Tuesday. Either the current bounce continues, or there is the chance that the price could fall yet further to $127, and even to what would be a potential absolute bottom at $120. $30 below the bull market trendline Source: TradingView For those twisted and tortured souls still holding $SOL, any hope of redemption might appear to be lost. Crashing through any bull market trendline should not be taken lightly, and especially when it is to the tune of a loss so far of $30 below. In defence of the price, the very strong horizontal support at $127 is just below, and the daily Stochastic RSI is at the bottom, which is also the case for all the medium to long-term momentum indicators. Bearish divergence now played out? Source: TradingView Zooming further out, and bringing in the Relative Strength Index, it can be seen that bearish divergence has been in play since March 2024, given that higher highs in the price have been matched by lower lows in the RSI. With the huge fall in price since the all-time high, it may be that the bearish divergence is now done with. Coming momentum can bring $SOL back against $BTC Source: TradingView Against its Bitcoin pair (SOL/BTC) things are also looking difficult. The price has dropped out of the long-term triangle and is currently sitting on a horizontal support level just below the ascending trendline. As well as turning back up against its USD pair, the $SOL price needs to reenter the triangle and make ground against $BTC once again. The 2-week Stochastic RSI indicators are at the bottom. By turning back up, they can bring momentum to the $SOL price once again. It’s not over yet. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Hedge fund guy Bill Ackman?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/true-successor-to-warren-buffett-bill-ackman/,"Warren Buffett is arguably one of, if not the greatest investors in history, who “mistakenly” built up Berkshire Hathaway Inc. from a struggling textile startup to a $1 trillion conglomerate over six decades. The exemplary investor is now 94 years old; the question now is who will continue carrying the Berkshire Hathaway name on their sleeve like Buffet did? In his latest annual shareholder letter , released on February 22, the American philanthropist reaffirmed that Greg Abel, Berkshire’s vice chairman of non-insurance operations, will take over as CEO. “At 94, it won’t be long before Greg replaces me as CEO and will be writing the annual letters,” Buffett wrote. He assured shareholders that Abel, who was formally named as his successor in 2021, fully comprehends Berkshire’s principles and will maintain the company’s disciplined investment philosophy. Wall Street knows Abel will run Berkshire’s day-to-day management, but investors are pondering whether he is the true heir to Buffett’s investing legacy, which operates outside the firm. Could Bill Ackman build a modern Berkshire Hathaway? One name the streets of New York are well acquainted with is hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman, who has spent his career picking “tips” straight out of Buffett’s playbook to build his investment empire. Ackman, 58, founded Pershing Square Capital Management, a hedge fund that oversees roughly $16 billion in assets. He is a known admirer of Buffett, first learning about him as a college student in Havard before attending Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meetings and even asking Buffett questions from the floor. Now, Ackman is pursuing his version of a diversified holding company. According to a February 18 Wall Street Journal exclusive , his firm revised an offer to increase its stake in Howard Hughes Holdings Inc., a real estate developer, to 48%. The 58-year-old businessman now plans to buy 10 million shares worth $900 million to transform Howard Hughes into a vehicle that could acquire controlling stakes in private and public businesses, what he coined as a “modern-day Berkshire Hathaway.” Pershing Square has submitted a proposal to Howard Hughes Holdings (NYSE: HHH) https://t.co/2CiHxYV59J to acquire 10 million newly issued shares of the company at $90 per share. When combined with the 18.9 million shares that are currently held by the Pershing Square Funds, we… — Bill Ackman (@BillAckman) February 18, 2025 Pershing Square’s concentrated portfolio currently includes major holdings in companies like food and hospitality companies Chipotle, Hilton, and Google parent Alphabet. Ackman’s personal career also harbors “ambitious” investments, including his famous bet against bond insurer MBIA and his role in rescuing mall operator General Growth Properties. How Ackman’s strategy compares to Warren Buffett’s Since Bill Ackman launched Pershing Square in 2004, his funds have generated an average annual return of 19.8% after management fees, almost identical to Buffett’s 19.9% annualized return over six decades. However, once performance fees are factored in, Ackman’s return drops to 16.4%. Much like the retiring Buffett, Ackman holds a substantial personal stake in his firm that represents roughly 21% of Pershing Square’s funds, compared to Buffett’s 14% ownership of Berkshire. The businessman also boasts of building a network of connections in the business world. “I pretty much know every CEO in America or am one step removed,” he reckoned in the Howard Hughes deal presentation. Berkshire’s structure is a model that Wall Street would term as “simple;” Buffett wound down his investment partnerships early on and used Berkshire as his primary vehicle. Yet, Ackman still manages multiple entities, including his UK-listed investment trust and a legacy hedge fund. On the salary front, several reports say Buffett takes a modest $100,000 as the $1 trillion asset management startup CEO annually, but Ackman proposed that Howard Hughes pay Pershing Square a 1.5% fee based on market capitalization, which critics believe makes his structure less shareholder-friendly. Time is on Bill Ackman’s side One advantage Ackman may have over Buffet is time. At 58, he is the same age Buffett was when Berkshire first listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1988, with a market cap of just $5.8 billion. As of Wednesday, February 26, 2023, Pershing Square manages just over $16 billion in assets, while Berkshire now holds a market capitalization exceeding $1 trillion. Buffett currently owns about 189 operating companies, not to mention a bulky stock portfolio. In the next 30 years or so, Pershing’s CEO will have to take up the challenge of finding a way to replicate that level of compounding growth.",OP-ED|Berkshire Hathaway|Pershing Square|USD,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-26 11:55:52

What’s Happening?,https://timestabloid.com/370-million-xrp-in-96-hours-whats-happening/,"The cryptocurrency market is witnessing a significant development as XRP whales have reportedly offloaded over 370 million XRP in just 96 hours. This large-scale liquidation has sparked speculation and debate among investors about the motivations behind such an enormous sell-off and what it could mean for XRP’s future. Whale movements of this magnitude often have the potential to introduce volatility, trigger price fluctuations, or signal strategic repositioning by major holders. XRP Price Stability Amid the Sell-Off Despite the heavy selling pressure, XRP has shown surprising resilience. As of report time, XRP is trading at $2.30, reflecting a 0.074% increase from the previous close. The trading range for the day has seen a high of $2.36 and a low of $2.08, suggesting that despite the whale sell-off , demand remains strong enough to prevent a sharp decline. Historically, whale transactions can cause temporary dips, but XRP’s ability to maintain stability indicates that buyers, possibly institutional investors, are stepping in to absorb the supply. Source: Ali Broader Crypto Market Trends The XRP whale activity is occurring amid increased volatility in the broader cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, recently dropped 5% to $89,653, falling below the $90,000 threshold for the first time since November. This downturn aligns with a broader trend of market-wide corrections, influenced by macroeconomic factors such as inflation, interest rate policies, and global financial uncertainties. Since XRP often moves in correlation with Bitcoin and other major assets, the sell-off by whales could be part of a larger strategy to hedge against potential market downturns. Possible Reasons Behind the Whale Sell-Off One possible explanation for the recent whale activity is profit-taking. Over the past months, XRP has experienced significant price appreciation, leading some large holders to cash out portions of their holdings while the price remains elevated. Major investors often use such periods of market strength to secure profits and reallocate funds. Another factor could be regulatory developments affecting the crypto industry. Uncertainty surrounding U.S. regulatory policies on digital assets continues to influence market sentiment, prompting strategic adjustments by institutional investors. Additionally, market sentiment shifts driven by macroeconomic instability, central bank policies, and global events may have prompted whales to rebalance their portfolios. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP’s Long-Term Outlook While large-scale whale sell-offs can create uncertainty in the short term, they do not necessarily indicate a bearish outlook for XRP. The fact that XRP has maintained relative price stability suggests that demand remains strong, possibly fueled by long-term investors who see value in accumulating at current levels. Historically, such whale-driven liquidations are often followed by periods of accumulation, where new investors enter the market to take advantage of lower prices. XRP remains a key factor in cross-border payments and decentralized finance (DeFi), and its long-term fundamentals remain intact despite short-term market fluctuations. The sale of 370 million XRP in 96 hours underscores the fast-moving and unpredictable nature of the crypto market. While the motivations behind the whale sell-off remain speculative, XRP’s ability to withstand the pressure suggests a well-supported market. To navigate XRP’s future, investors should stay informed by tracking three key areas: on-chain data, broader economic trends, and regulatory updates. Whether this recent sell-off signals a short-term market correction or a shift in whale strategy remains to be seen, but one thing is certain—XRP remains a focal point in the evolving digital asset landscape.

FBTC's decline is driven by profit-taking, broader market risk-off sentiment, and memecoin collapses, not specific negative news. Despite headlines, the overall newsflow is positive, and recent capitulation may indicate a market bottom. Bitcoin and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ETF ( FBTC ) fell into bear market territory this week. The slow decline from the January top - which just happened to come on President Trump's inauguration day - picked up pace and culminated in a record outflow of $344.7 million on 25th February. This article looks at the drivers behind the drop, and why Tuesday's capitulation may be a good thing. The Trump Top (at least for now) The 'Trump Top' is a questionable label; President Trump has not done anything directly to create a top. However, bitcoin did peak at $109,356 on 20th January, the date of Trump's inauguration. Bitcoin has done this kind of thing before - the 2017 top happened on the day CME futures were launched. Trump's victory in the November election lifted the entire cryptocurrency space. Bitcoin rallied 57% from election day to inauguration day, pricing in a lot of optimism on favorable policies and the potential creation of a strategic reserve. The new president signed an executive order on January 23rd, forming a new crypto working group and asking it to evaluate ""the potential creation and maintenance of a national digital-asset stockpile, and propose criteria for establishing such a stockpile."" Notably, though, bitcoin did not rally on the news and this was an important signal - markets tend to top when good news no longer leads to a rally and vice versa. Since January, Trump has been more focused on other issues. The crypto working group has 180 days to file their report and in the meantime, shorter-term holders may be taking profits. This could be an important point - bitcoin is not dropping because of any specific negative driver. Rather, it's the absence of imminent news and some profit-taking. Trump has followed through on his pro-crypto pledges and there is potential positive news on the horizon when the working group report is released. Sentiment Takes a Hit The launch of the $Trump memecoin on 17th January dented sentiment as it made headlines for all the wrong reasons when its value quickly eroded. We are used to the likes of Fartcoin spiking up and down in days if not hours, but the drop in $Trump underlined there is no lasting value in these coins - it's a case of jumping out with a quick profit before everyone else does. $Melania may have been the coin that broke the market. It peaked with a market cap of $2.2B on 20th January and lost nearly $1.6B by the next day. It is now down 93% from its peak. Coin Market Cap Many memecoins are down heavily in the last month and the disastrous launch of $Libra in Argentina with the support of President Milei was perhaps the nail in the coffin of this speculative asset. Coin Market Cap Memecoins are not a direct driver of bitcoin prices but they do serve as a gauge of speculative interest, liquidity, and sentiment in the crypto space. The developments of the last month suggest sentiment is souring and memecoin traders are mostly tapped out. ""Risk-off"" in the crypto space - and indeed in general - is weighing. Technicals Financial media seem to have agreed that an arbitrary 20% drop constitutes a bear market. This may be a relatively large move in stocks or bonds, but for bitcoin, it's not unusual. A bear market of -33% unfolded last year into the August low and was followed by a 120% rally. There were several >20% drops in 2023 all of which were more of a dip in the uptrend than what I would describe as bear markets. I think it's worth making the point that a 20% drop is not necessarily something to fear. I chart FBTC rather than BTCUSD as it shows the prices traded in the US market and highlights important sessions. The most important of all is the day of the election and we have already seen the S&P 500 ( SPY ) drop into the election day gap and bottom exactly there on the 13th of January. FBTC has major support at the low of the 6th of November as it lines up with the previous high of $64. TradingView A drop to $64 would create a compelling buying opportunity, although it may be a tall ask as it would need to fall another 16%. What if this week's drop was a brief shake out and the correction is already over? The massive volume on Tuesday may signal capitulation, but we won't really know until there is a recovery back over the previous support in the $78-80 area. TradingView A close above $80 would support the view that FBTC has already bottomed and is in the next phase of the rally. Risks Bitcoin is volatile and has made large declines in the past. In the last ten years, it has lost more than 70% of its value on three separate occasions. Weakness in the broader markets tends to weigh on bitcoin and the ""risk off"" environment in recent sessions could be the start of a larger correction. Conclusions Headlines are telling us bitcoin is in a bear market and Tuesday's heavy drop was a scare. However, the newsflow is still generally positive and Trump's crypto group report is something to look forward to. The drivers of the decline look related to broader market risk-off, profit taking, and the collapse of speculative memecoins, none of which are long-term negatives specific to bitcoin. FBTC would be a compelling buy at $64 at the election gap, but we don't always get what we want. Tuesday's capitulation and record outflows may already mark the bottom and a recovery back over $80 would support this view and suggest the next stage of the rally is already underway.",FBTC,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|TRADING|REGULATION|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-02-26 11:59:15

Shiba Inu Hints at Market Turnaround,https://coinedition.com/meme-coin-meltdown-shiba-inu-hints-at-market-turnaround/,"Meme coin prices crashed significantly in the past month. The meme coins market crashed nearly 50% in the last 30 days. Shiba Inu slid into a notable support region amid the meme coins crash. Meme coins have had a rough month. The crypto category’s total market value dropped almost 50% in about 30 days. However, crypto analysts are watching individual tokens to see which one can stem the bearish pressure and force a fortune reversal. According to data from the crypto aggregation platform CoinmarketCap, the total meme coins market capitalization dropped from $96.23 billion on January 27, 2025, to $57.41 billion as of February 26, marking a month of steady decline and reflecting a 43.63% crash. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Hit Hard Many top meme coins took big losses when the whole cryptocurrency market faced heavy selling pressure. Dogecoin (DOGE), the biggest meme coin, lost 55% of its value. It went from a $0.4343 yearly high in mid-January to $0.2145 on February 25. Notably, the across-the-board decline in meme coins pushed Shiba Inu (SHIB), the second-largest after DOGE, toward important support. 1 SHIB’s price path has made analysts curious, especi… The post Meme Coin Meltdown?

Bonk and Floki have seen a significant drop in volume during a downtrend. However, as recently observed with these two tokens, the sell-off pressure could be subsiding and might pave the way for a potential rebound if new buying interest emerges. Meanwhile, ChowWow ($CHOW) has gained traction quickly. With its innovative P2E, players can earn the $CHOW token by engaging with the game. The tokens can be used to stake or trade, making it a unique value proposition. This has led to massive adoption of the $CHOW token as the presale funding hits over $193,000. BONK Price Relies On Solana’s Stability The BONK token is a community-focused crypto launched in 2017 to enable operations within Solana’s decentralized application (dApps). When the Solana token experienced a sharp drop, it brought significant volatility to the BONK coin . The meme coin has seen over 45% decrease in the monthly time frame. Bonk price chart| Source: CoinMarketCap With a market cap of around $1.25 billion, BONK’s price has maintained gains above $0.00001570, which has prevented further dip. A rebound might occur if the meme coin maintains this position. BONK announced a 2.02 trillion token burn to boost token worth by creating scarcity to celebrate the 2025 Lunar New Year and BONKdragon event. However, this strategy didn’t trigger a rally for the BONK coin. If Solana (SOL) hits $300, BONK holders could gain massive profits as the BONK token operates on the Solana blockchain. However, this scenario for SOL to hit $300 seems uncertain, and the BONK price continues to face bearish sentiments. Floki Unable To Live Up To Expectations The journey of the Floki coin reveals the volatile nature of meme coins. Despite the meme coin’s early success, the Floki token has been unable to match the performance of Shiba Inu, its predecessor. Floki faced massive challenges in November 2024, when the token’s deployer removed $25.6 million in liquidity. Price chart for Floki | Source: CoinMarketCap It caused Floki’s price to plunge by 92%. Since then, Floki has dropped by more than 50%. This series of underperformance has pushed investors to look for alternatives like the rising star, ChowWow. Meanwhile, Floki has tried to evolve into a utility token offering real-world value. It includes the NFT metaverse game Valhalla and the DeFi service FlokiFi. It also supports real-world transactions by collaborating with NOWPayments and the Floki Card. These attributes have positioned Floki among the top altcoins to watch this cycle. It further shows its potential beyond just trading, with applications in decentralized finance and non-fungible tokens, making it a promising token in the current market dynamic. ChowWow ($CHOW) Gaming Kingdom Attracts Gaming Enthusiasts One of the main draws of interest in ChowWow ($CHOW) is its ambition to redefine the meme coin narrative. To start with, the $CHOW token is designed to be self-sustaining. This has been achieved by integrating both the P2E and S2E models. This means that beyond the hype, the meme coin can still thrive independently on community engagement. Moreover, in the ChowWow gaming kingdom, players will access mini-games to engage in challenges, complete tasks, and compete against each other. Eligible winners will be awarded $CHOW tokens, allowing them to stake their tokens for higher returns while still having fun. To ensure safety and compliance with industry standards, ChowWow will implement security features to prevent data breaches and protect users’ assets. It will also conduct regular audits to guarantee its integrity and safeguard the ChowWow network. At stage one of its presale, where investors can buy the $CHOW token at just $0.008, ChowWow raised over $180,000 in funding. It is now in stage two and priced $0.01. Will ChowWow’s Growing Attention Attract Bonk and Floki Investors? Bonk and Floki have a bearish outlook, causing them to lose key support regions. The dipping trend has seen investors opt for a meme coin known as ChowWow. ChowWow’s robust economic structures have driven significant demand for the $CHOW token. Its deflationary mechanism will help reduce the total supply through burning events or buy-backs, encouraging scarcity within the ChowWow ecosystem.

These coins may benefit after the House of Representatives voted for the Trump budget with over $4.5 trillion of tax cuts. BTC price was steady at $89,000, while ETH price and XRP price were at $2,490 and $2.3. So, will this budget push coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple higher? Crypto Prices Stabilize as Trump Budget Passes the House A potential catalyst for the stability in the crypto market was that Republicans voted for Donald Trump budget proposal. His deal includes $4.5 trillion worth of tax cuts and ways to slash government spending by about $2 trillion. Notably, the budget increased the debt ceiling by $4 trillion since this may lead to more money supply in the US. Some studies have established that Bitcoin price often tracks the global money supply. Bitcoin and Money Supply Meanwhile, the budget deal comes at a time when the market is raising estimates for rate cuts this year. Rate cut expectations have soared even as inflation has remained elevated, with the headline consumer price index rising to 3%. The CME FedWatch Tool estimates that rates will end the year between 375 and 400 basis points, down from the current range of between 425 and 450 bps. BTC, ETH, and XRP prices do well when the Fed is cutting rates. Interest Rate Expectations BTC, ETH, XRP Price Prediction So, how will the new Trump budget with over $4.5 trillion in tax cuts affect the top prices like BTC, XRP, and ETH? BTC Price Technical Analysis BTC price crashed to $85,873 on Tuesday, triggering the biggest outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs . From a fundamental perspective, these sharp declines are often buy signals, meaning that Bitcoin may stage a relief rally soon. The daily chart shows that Bitcoin settled at the 200-day Exponential Moving Average. Historically, BTC often bounces back, albeit slightly, after hitting this support level. For example, it dropped to the 200 EMA point of $60,000 in October last year, setting the stage for a strong rally to a record high if $109,385. Therefore, BTC price may stage a brief rebound since it has also formed a morning star pattern. The potential level to watch will be at $95,000. BTC Price Chart ETH Price Technical Analysis ETH price also crashed as most coins dropped, triggering over $914 million worth of liquidations . While the coin has formed a death cross pointing to more downwards, it also fomed a small hammer candlestick that may point to a short-term bullish reversal. Ethereum price will need to overcome the stiff resistance at $2,852 to confirm a short-term rebound to $3,000. However, a drop below the key support at $2,318 (Tuesday’s low), will point to more downside. ETH Price Chart XRP Price Technical Analysis The XRP price also crashed and moved below the 50-day Exponential Moving Average. The risk is that the coin has formed a head and shoulders chart pattern whose neckline is around the $2 support level. A H&S pattern is one of the top bearish reversal signs in technical analysis. XRP Price Chart A drop below the neckline at $2 will point to further downside, potentially to the 23.6% retracement level at $1.6215, followed by the psychological point at $1. A move above the right shoulder will invalidate the bearish bullish Ripple price forecast.

However, looking at the last six months, Bitcoin has grown by 47.74%, indicating significant long-term gains despite short-term drops. Currently, Bitcoin is trading within a range of $93,187 to $99,226. The nearest support level is at $90,289, which could act as a price floor if the decline continues. On the upside, the nearest resistance level is at $102,367. Breaking through this resistance could signal potential movement toward the second resistance level at $108,407. Technical indicators present a mixed outlook. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 12.60, suggesting that Bitcoin is in oversold territory. This could imply potential for price stabilization or rebound. However, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is negative at -1,667, indicating bearish momentum. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $90,652, which is below the 100-day average of $95,506, reflecting recent downward trends. Ethereum suffers dips Ethereum (ETH) has experienced significant declines in recent times. Over the past week, its price dropped by 13.65%. The monthly view shows a sharper fall of 28.60%. Looking back six months, ETH is down by 6.22%. Currently, ETH trades between $2667.20 and $2915.59, reflecting a volatile market. Technical indicators suggest potential for a rebound. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 19.79, indicating that ETH is oversold. Similarly, the Stochastic oscillator reads 17.18, reinforcing this oversold condition. These metrics could signal a possible upward movement soon. For a positive shift, ETH needs to break above the nearest resistance level at $3010. Surpassing this could lead to the next resistance at $3258.36, a potential gain of around 10%. On the downside, if ETH falls below the support level of $2513.19, it might decline to the second support at $2264.80, which would be a decrease of approximately 15%. Traders are closely watching these levels to gauge ETH’s next move. Conclusion With the bull run of 2025 underway, BTC and ETH show strength despite dips, but XYZVerse stands out, aiming for 20,000% growth by uniting sports fans in a unique memecoin ecosystem.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Ethereum shows promise, but Lightchain AI, with its AI-blockchain fusion and $16.7m raised, could outpace ETH. As Ethereum (ETH) shows promising signs, experts are forecasting a potential rise to $12,000. However, Lightchain AI, currently priced at $0.006 in its presale and having already raised over $16.7 million, is drawing increasing attention for its game-changing technology. The unique combination of artificial intelligence and blockchain positions Lightchain AI for explosive growth, with some predicting a 300% surge in its value. As the project’s presale progresses, its decentralized solutions and scalable infrastructure make it a strong contender, possibly outpacing Ethereum in growth and market impact by 2025, making it a top choice for forward-thinking investors. You might also like: Binance coin remains stable, but is Lightchain AI’s rapid growth gaining more attention? Ethereum’s journey to a $12,000 price target Ethereum is currently trading at $2,807.38, reflecting its recent market activity. Analysts have set ambitious targets for Ethereum’s future price, with some predicting a rise to $12,000. This optimism is fueled by a combination of technical analysis and fundamental factors that could drive the cryptocurrency’s growth in the coming months. One of the main drivers behind these projections is the anticipated “Pectra” network upgrade, which aims to improve Ethereum’s scalability and user experience. If successful, this upgrade could enhance the platform’s appeal and utility, potentially boosting ETH’s value. Additionally, a pro-crypto regulatory environment in the U.S. could provide further support for Ethereum’s growth, creating a favorable landscape for adoption and development. Institutional adoption also remains a key factor, with increased inflows into Ethereum-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) signaling rising interest from major investors. Furthermore, technical analysis has identified an inverse head and shoulders pattern on Ethereum’s price chart, indicating a potential bullish trend. While the $12,000 projection is promising, its realization depends on the successful execution of upgrades, positive regulatory progress, and sustained institutional backing. As always, investors should account for the inherent volatility and risks within the cryptocurrency market. Lightchain AI’s rapid growth and technological leadership While Ethereum continues its dominance, Lightchain AI is rapidly gaining traction by merging artificial intelligence with blockchain technology.

The latest whale data signaled that roughly 312 million tokens were offloaded into cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. In response, traders and investors reflect bearishness surrounding DOGE price prospects, with market concerns further solidifying due to another on-chain metric. Dogecoin Whales Dump 312M Tokens Amid Market Turmoil Raising Concerns According to transaction tracker Whale Alert on X , Dogecoin whales offloaded roughly 312 million coins to Coinbase on February 26. Three massive whale transactions collectively showcased the transfer of $64 million worth of tokens. For context, crypto whales are large-scale investors holding substantial influence over the market and crypto prices. Their dumping chronicles usually signal a loss of confidence in the asset’s potential to offer gains. As a result, market participants also reflect a bearish stance on future price actions. Other Key Metric That Solidifies Concerns Simultaneously, crypto market analyst Ali Martinez revealed in a recent X post that DOGE network activity has declined 95% since last year. Notably, data indicates that the active network addresses dropped from 2.66 million in November last year to a mere 130,282 to date. Source: Ali Charts, X When coupled with the massive Dogecoin whale selloffs, on-chain metrics collectively reflect the loss of market interest. How Is The Meme Coin Performing Today? As of press time, DOGE price conversely witnessed a 5% increase in value, closing in at $0.2125. The leading meme coin hit a bottom and peak of $0.1968 and $0.2139 in the past 24 hours. The current price upswing defies the usual bearish market sentiments prevailing in light of the abovementioned market statistics. However, it’s worth mentioning that weekly and monthly charts for the token show a drop of 16% and 31%, respectively. This broader crash is what appears to have prompted the Dogecoin whale selling. Meanwhile, it’s also noteworthy that the broader slumping action mirrors the current broader crypto market trend . Bitcoin and altcoins currently face volatility due to macroeconomic heat and liquidity issues in the market. As a result, traders and investors continue to exercise caution when trading risk assets, bringing volatility to prices. On the other hand, another key on-chain metric sparked contrasting speculations among investors. Notably, DOGE long-term holders are in ‘denial,’ as revealed by Ali Martinez. This data indicated that despite market fluctuations and price volatility, long-term holders have been optimistic about the crypto’s long-term prospects.

If they continue at the same rate, the remaining assets will be withdrawn within 8-10 days. The total amount laundered has reached 135,000 ETH (~$335 million). Beosin researchers reported that the Bybit hacker started using Maya Protocol to transfer stolen assets. Bybit CEO Ben Zhou announced the launch of a website to track the activities of North Korean hacker group Lazarus Group, which Arkham Intelligence experts linked to the platform hack. He called the initiative a “bounty hunt.” The resource collects information about laundering schemes, and also offers mechanisms to combat attackers. Users can connect their wallets and join the search for illegal funds. If assets are successfully blocked, the reward is paid automatically. “Freezers” receive 5% of each bounty. The platform also provides ratings of bona fide participants in the crypto industry. In the future, it is planned to add tools for regulators and balance tracking on “live” Lazarus wallets. The platform promises not to stop until the actions of hackers and their partners are not completely stopped. What Caused The Bybit Hack - The Largest In History? “Incorrect EVM design” was the cause of the Bybit hack. This is the conclusion reached by Blockstream co-founder and cypherpunk Adam Back. According to the exchange's official statement, the incident occurred when transferring ETH from cold multisig storage to a hot wallet. Attackers tampered with the transaction signing interface so that all participants in the procedure saw the correct address. At the same time, the logic of the smart contract was changed and the hackers gained control of the Ethereum wallet. “EVM can drop to zero and nobody cares. The problem is that the Ethereum Virtual Machine hurts trust in the ecosystem, which unfairly reflects on bitcoin,” the expert pointed out. Back called the EVM “complex, fragile and insecure.” “They've been losing billions a year for several years in a row [...]. It's been zero days since the nine-figure loss on ETH,” he complained. According to Back, the Bybit incident has nothing to do with the security of hardware wallets, but is due to the difficulty of EVMs in correctly verifying a transaction. Unlike the second most capitalized cryptocurrency, bitcoin's ecosystem is devoid of such vulnerabilities, he added. “The whole point of HWW [hardware wallets] is to verify on the device screen how much you're paying and to what address. That doesn't work with ETH because of the complexity of the EVM and the size of the state. Therein lies the problem. ETH on HWW didn't even display addresses for Bybit,” the Blockstream co-founder explained. In an interview with Cointelegraph, Hacken CEO Dima Budorin questioned Beck's validity. In his opinion, the challenge is presented by the vulnerabilities and complexities of using multi-sig wallets, which is common in all ecosystems, including bitcoin. “Even similar systems in digital gold, while simple, remain susceptible to risks like human error, phishing or advanced attacks focusing on signatories' devices and workflows,” he explained. Global Ledger co-founder Lex Fisun supported Budorin. The specialist stated that only one ETH address was hacked in the Bybit incident. He suggested that this was possible because of “operational security weaknesses around cold wallet transfers rather than a fundamental flaw in the EVM.” “The exploit may have originated in the virtual machine, but we cannot confirm this at this time,” he pointed out. Bybit declined to comment on whether they believe EVMs played a role in the security breach.

Some tokens, like MakerDAO's MKR, stand out with a 20% gain in 24 hours, thanks to the DAO's buyback and burn process. IP, the native token of decentralized intellectual property-focused blockchain Story Protocol, is also in the green, having risen nearly 40%. The token's price has doubled in two weeks after being listed on South Korean exchanges. Other notable outperformers include Celestia's TIA along with XDC, QNT and HYPE. Data tracked by blockchain sleuth Lookonchain shows whales have been buying the dip in the HYPE token. XRP, meanwhile, is hanging on to a key Fibonacci level, keeping bulls' hope for bigger gains alive. According to Matthew Hougan, chief investment officer of Bitwise Asset Management, the crypto market is digesting the end of the recent memecoin frenzy, which could be replaced by productive sectors such as stablecoins, real-world assets and DeFi. ""But until they start making their presence felt, the loss of energy will create a drag on the market,"" Hougan said on X . On the macroeconomic front, the optimism seen after the Nov. 4 election is being replaced by caution, as evidenced by Tuesday's release of the U.S. consumer confidence. The gauge dropped to an eight-month low, and the one-year inflation expectations were highest for 1.5 years, with President Donald Trump's tariffs singled out as the primary concern in almost every household and business survey. The dour sentiment and a strengthening yen might keep the upside in risk assets restricted for some time. Earlier this week, Belgium's central bank's head, Pierre Wunsch, warned that the ECB risks sleep-walking into too many rate cuts. The Fed, for its part, is unlikely to do QE anytime soon. (Sure, the January meeting minutes discussed an end of quantitive tightening, but that does not mean quantitative easing.)

He also stated that the ETH blockchain could consider adopting the Poseidon hash function to improve the platform’s efficiency. Buterin’s comments come as Poseidon grants to researchers have been extended further to March 15. Some critics have rejected Buterin’s proposal citing its slower performance and reliance on specific prime fields with Poseidon hash function. Vitalik Buterin Urges Ethereum Researchers to Join Poseidon Hash Function Ethereum co-founder recently urged Ethereum blockchain researchers to participate in the ongoing Poseidon cryptanalysis program, while emphasizing the importance of scrutinizing its security properties. In a statement, Buterin highlighted that Ethereum is seriously considering adopting the Poseidon hash function to improve zk-prover efficiency, which is a critical component for enhancing zero-knowledge proof (ZK) technologies on the network. “Having more information about its security properties is extremely high value,” noted Vitalik Buterin. He also underscored the need for thorough research before the implementation of the potential upgrade. This move reflects Ethereum’s commitment to optimizing scalability and privacy through advanced cryptographic methods. Vitalik Buterin’s comments come at a time when developers are gearing up for the Ethereum Pectra upgrade . About Poseidon – A Hash Function for ZK-Proof Systems Poseidon is basically an algebraic hash function that is gaining traction due to its innovative design tailored to zero-knowledge (ZK) proof systems. Unlike the traditional hashing algorithms which rely on Bitwise operations, Poseidon utilizes addition and multiplication of elements within finite fields, enabling enhanced efficiency in cryptographic computations. This hash function is specifically optimized for practical computational integrity-proof systems such as SNARKs, STARKs, and Bulletproofs. Poseidon demonstrates exceptional performance in scenarios requiring the proof of preimage knowledge under a hash function. This also makes it a valuable tool for advancing the efficiency and scalability of zero-knowledge technologies. Its algebraic approach is a promising step forward in cryptographic research and applications. Community Members Disagree With Buterin’s Views Ye Zhang, a prominent voice in blockchain cryptography, has expressed skepticism about Vitalik Buterin’s views on transitioning Ethereum to the Poseidon hash function, Zhang highlighted several critical trade-offs and limitations that come along with this transition. He noted that while Poseidon offers zero-knowledge (ZK) prover-friendly optimizations, it comes with two major caveats: Complex Configurations: Poseidon’s reliance on specific prime fields limits its adaptability and narrows the choices for SNARK systems. Performance Bottlenecks: Compared to widely-used hash functions like Blake or Keccak, Poseidon is significantly slower, which could create major performance issues unless Layer 2 solutions are willing to compromise on compatibility. Zhang’s concerns underline the challenges Ethereum faces in balancing efficiency, compatibility, and performance as it explores migrating to more ZK-friendly cryptographic standards. Recently, Buterin also showered praises on Layer-2 solutions like Sony’s Soneium adding that it would be useful for business applications on the platform.

This approval enabled ETF applications for altcoins such as XRP, Solana (SOL), Litecoin (LTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA). As the cryptocurrency community eagerly awaits the green light for altcoin ETFs, top analysts expect them to be most likely approved. However, one analyst said that altcoin ETFs will not live up to expectations. Katalin Tischhauser, Head of Research at Sygnum Bank, stated that altcoin ETF approvals are inevitable, but they may not attract much interest among investors and will not meet expectations. “There are many altcoin ETF applications, but initial demand for altcoin ETFs will be weaker than demand for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. It is almost certain that altcoin ETFs will be approved in the market, but no one can show where the demand will come from. At this point, even if altcoin ETFs are approved, they will initially see limited demand from retail investors. Many investors are likely already holding altcoins directly, which limits interest in ETFs. Tischhauser noted that he estimated cumulative inflows into altcoin ETFs to be between $100 million and $1 billion. Morningstar manager Bryan Armour also stated that the interest in altcoin ETFs will be much less than Bitcoin and Ethereum, saying, “For Bitcoin, some institutional investors and advisors have been waiting for an ETF to access it. However, I do not expect the number of investors waiting for ETFs before investing in altcoins to be this large. Because if institutional investors had a strong interest in Solana or Dogecoin, they would have bought it by now.” However, JPMorgan had estimated that cumulative demand for altcoin ETFs would exceed $14 billion. *This is not investment advice.

Recent price forecasts and market reviews showed both positive and negative expectations for SHIB, so many investors consider other altcoins. One option getting much support is Yeti Ouro (YETIO) , which has shown strong presale performance and a new method in blockchain gaming. Shiba Inu’s Price Struggles Shiba Inu was the favorite among meme coin fans but now finds it hard to keep its upward trend. Recent forecasts predict Shiba Inu price in February 2025 at an average of $0.0000254, with highs near $0.0000349 and lows around $0.0000159. These numbers hint at some growth but do not match the large gains many investors hoped for. The cryptocurrency dropped wildly falling 65% from its December 2024 high of $0.00003343 to its February 2025 low of $0.00001160. This decline worries many SHIB holders about the token’s future and makes them look for better investment choices. Yeti Ouro: A Rising Star In The Altcoin Space As Shiba Inu tries to bounce back, Yeti Ouro (YETIO) seems a good option for crypto investors. Now in presale, YETIO gets stronger, drawing big investors. Yeti Ouro’s presale runs fast; the project has moved to Stage 3. The token price is $0.024 and has given early investors from Stage 1 the opportunity to see a 100% ROI. Experts see this trend and expect YETIO to hit $5 by the end of 2025 and give early buyers a large profit. What Sets Yeti Ouro Apart? Several factors contribute to Yeti Ouro’s growing popularity among investors: Innovative Gaming Integration: Yeti Ouro’s Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, Yeti Go, is built on Unreal Engine 5. The game will display high-quality graphics with intense gameplay. It is made in collaboration with the experts behind games such as Call of Duty, The Witcher, Dead Space and Spiderman. The game’s audio is being crafted by industry professionals who have worked on projects for Grammy-nominated artists like Major Lazer, Vybz Kartel, and Kabaka Pyramid. Play-to-Earn Mechanics: Yeti Go lets players earn, trade or sell YETIO tokens when they win in the game, which gives true rewards. Strong Tokenomics: YETIO holds 1 billion tokens, with half meant for presale buyers. A contract clause burns 5% of tokens over time to cut supply and raise value. Security Focus: Yeti Ouro’s smart contracts have been audited by SOLIDProof , enhancing investor confidence in the project’s security measures. Community-Driven Approach: The project emphasizes community building and sustainable growth, offering rewards and benefits to early investors and active participants. The development team have released the following exclusive teaser of an unreleased game level: Why Yeti Ouro Presale Is Attracting New Investors The contrast between Shiba Inu’s recent results and Yeti Ouro’s promising presale has not escaped the crypto community. Many investors who owned large amounts of SHIB now change their holdings. Many choose YETIO for its high growth in the altcoin market. Many find it hard to resist the chance to join a project that has strong basics and a clear plan to grow. Yeti Ouro gives gaming use, token scarcity along with good presale results. This mix forms a chance for investors to take part in the next trend. When the crypto market grows older, projects like Yeti Ouro with practical use and new fixes probably get more help. Shiba Inu’s path is unclear. YETIO’s growth shows that the cryptocurrency world changes fast. It is wise to know new chances. For those ready to look at more than known meme coins, Yeti Ouro’s early sale win and bold plan make it a project to watch in 2025.
