The ranking Democratic member of the House Financial Services Committee specifically targets the SEC’s decision to suspend enforcement actions against several prominent crypto firms. This development raises crucial questions about regulatory consistency and investor protection in the rapidly evolving digital asset space. SEC Crypto Enforcement Under Congressional Scrutiny Representative Waters’ formal letter to Committee Chairman French Hill reveals substantial concerns about regulatory enforcement patterns. The SEC has reportedly suspended or dropped actions against multiple companies and individuals accused of securities law violations. Notably, this list includes major industry players like Coinbase, Binance, and entrepreneur Justin Sun. Waters asserts the committee has failed to properly investigate why the SEC abandoned these actions. Furthermore, she questions how the regulatory body plans to prevent future fraud and market manipulation without consistent enforcement. The cryptocurrency industry has experienced dramatic regulatory shifts throughout the 2020s. Initially, the SEC under Chairman Gary Gensler pursued an aggressive enforcement strategy. However, recent court decisions and political pressure have created a more complex landscape. Consequently, regulatory agencies now face difficult decisions about resource allocation and legal strategy. Waters’ criticism emerges against this backdrop of changing regulatory priorities and increasing industry lobbying efforts. Historical Context of Cryptocurrency Regulation Understanding this controversy requires examining the SEC’s evolving stance on digital assets. The agency first asserted jurisdiction over certain cryptocurrencies as securities following the 2017 DAO Report. Subsequently, enforcement actions increased significantly during the 2021-2023 period. The SEC filed numerous cases alleging unregistered securities offerings and fraudulent activities. However, several high-profile legal setbacks have recently influenced the commission’s approach. Key Legal Decisions Impacting SEC Strategy Recent court rulings have substantially affected the SEC’s enforcement capabilities. For instance, the Ripple Labs decision created important distinctions between institutional and retail sales of XRP. Additionally, the Grayscale Bitcoin ETF approval signaled shifting judicial perspectives on cryptocurrency products. These legal developments have forced regulatory agencies to reassess their litigation strategies. Meanwhile, Congress continues debating comprehensive digital asset legislation that could clarify jurisdictional boundaries. The following table illustrates major SEC enforcement actions against cryptocurrency firms since 2020: Year Company/Individual Alleged Violation Current Status 2020 Telegram Unregistered $1.7B ICO Settled 2023 Coinbase Operating unregistered exchange Ongoing litigation 2023 Binance Multiple securities violations Partial settlements 2023 Justin Sun Fraud and market manipulation Dropped according to Waters Potential Impacts on Market Participants Reduced SEC enforcement could create significant consequences for various market participants. Retail investors might face increased risks without regulatory oversight. Meanwhile, legitimate cryptocurrency businesses could encounter unfair competition from non-compliant operators. The situation also raises questions about international regulatory coordination. Other jurisdictions might interpret reduced U.S. enforcement as signaling different standards. Industry experts express mixed reactions to these developments. Some legal scholars argue selective enforcement undermines regulatory credibility. Others suggest strategic retreats might allow better resource allocation. However, most agree that regulatory clarity remains essential for long-term industry growth. The current uncertainty potentially hinders institutional adoption and technological innovation. Investor Protection Considerations Representative Waters emphasizes investor protection concerns throughout her critique. She references previous cryptocurrency collapses that caused substantial investor losses. Without consistent enforcement, similar situations could potentially reoccur. The congresswoman specifically questions how the SEC plans to address: Market manipulation in decentralized and centralized exchanges Transparency requirements for cryptocurrency offerings Custody standards for digital asset storage Disclosure practices for project teams and promoters Political and Legislative Implications This controversy occurs during ongoing congressional debates about cryptocurrency regulation. Multiple legislative proposals currently address digital asset classification and regulatory jurisdiction. Waters’ letter adds urgency to these discussions. It also highlights partisan differences regarding financial regulation approaches. Democratic lawmakers generally favor stronger consumer protections. Meanwhile, Republican members often emphasize innovation and market development. The House Financial Services Committee plays a crucial role in shaping financial policy. Its oversight function includes monitoring regulatory agency performance. Waters’ criticism suggests potential committee investigations into SEC decision-making. Such inquiries could examine internal communications and resource allocation decisions. They might also consider political influences on enforcement priorities. Broader Regulatory Landscape Analysis The SEC represents just one component of the U.S. cryptocurrency regulatory framework. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission claims jurisdiction over certain digital assets as commodities. Additionally, banking regulators oversee cryptocurrency custody and banking relationships. State authorities maintain their own licensing and enforcement mechanisms. This fragmented approach creates complexity for market participants and regulators alike. International regulatory developments further complicate the situation. The European Union recently implemented comprehensive Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation. Asian jurisdictions have adopted diverse approaches ranging from restrictive to supportive. Global coordination remains limited despite cross-border nature of cryptocurrency markets. Inconsistent enforcement across jurisdictions could create regulatory arbitrage opportunities. Conclusion Representative Maxine Waters’ critique of SEC crypto enforcement actions highlights significant regulatory challenges. The suspension of cases against major industry participants raises questions about consistency and effectiveness. This development occurs amidst evolving legal precedents and ongoing legislative debates. Ultimately, regulatory clarity and consistent enforcement remain essential for market stability and investor protection. The cryptocurrency industry continues navigating complex regulatory waters while seeking legitimate pathways for innovation and growth. FAQs Q1: Why is Representative Waters criticizing the SEC? Representative Waters criticizes the SEC for suspending or dropping enforcement actions against cryptocurrency firms accused of securities violations. She believes this reduces investor protections and requires congressional investigation. Q2: Which companies does Waters mention in her criticism? Her letter specifically references Coinbase, Binance, and entrepreneur Justin Sun as examples where the SEC has reportedly halted enforcement actions. Q3: What committee does Representative Waters serve on? She serves as the ranking Democratic member of the House Financial Services Committee, which oversees financial regulation including SEC activities. Q4: How might reduced enforcement affect cryptocurrency investors? Reduced enforcement could potentially increase risks for investors through less oversight of market manipulation, fraud, and disclosure violations in the cryptocurrency space. Q5: What broader implications does this criticism have? This development highlights ongoing debates about cryptocurrency regulation, jurisdictional boundaries between agencies, and the appropriate balance between innovation and investor protection.

However, its price dropped by 0.5% at $0.1254, signifying a considerable number of selling activities. The technical analysis indicates a bearish trend that may continue to press down the price. There is also another indicator that shows DOGE could be oversold, and this is at times an indicator of an approaching bounce. There has been a lack of interest from prominent investors, despite DOGE being part of an ETF and various companies holding DOGE within their portfolios. Dogecoin Undergoes Technical Pressure A significant discrepancy is presently evident in the case of DOGE: the volume of trading has increased, while the market price has not. This seems to be an indicator of high trading volume but low market price. The graph shown is negative; this is disappointing for the traders, as they expected a positive closing result at the end of the year. Year to date, Dogecoin is down by 61% in value despite the positive event of the launch of ETFs. The price of DOGE is strongly correlated to the price of Bitcoin. This means that if the price of Bitcoin improves, the price of DOGE will also go up. Mutuum Finance: A Leading Cryptocurrency for Investments As massive capital exits high-risk meme coins, investors are looking at better-sounding projects. Among the best available is that of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ; it has an transparent presale process and functional technology. The presale has managed to raise $19.5 million from more than 18,600 investors. It is in Phase 6, which is 99% sold out. The pricing of the tokens is $0.035, indicating a 250% jump from phase one price. Speculative purchases might have seen a gain of about 420% during launch at $0.06. This makes MUTM a cheap cryptocurrency with promising prospects. With the end of Phase 6, Phase 7 begins immediately with a higher price of $0.04, indicating a 20% jump. This chance of purchase at a cheap price is short-lived. Dual-System Design – Durability Mutuum Finance uses two different loan platforms. The first one pools money for mainstream assets like ETH, while the other one allows customers to design their own loan programs for other assets. Clients receive exclusive loyalty tokens with which interest is accrued automatically. Mutuum Finance’s two-level system makes it more flexible compared to its rivals and thus the best crypto to invest in. One of the major considerations for the platform is security.Certik has carried out a major security audit, scoring MUTM highly. A bug bounty scheme worth $50,000 has been implemented. This has been done to satisfy the institutional investors. The first version of the platform is to be launched on a test network by the end of 2025. Buying MUTM is also easy, with direct credit/debit card purchases possible without restriction. There is also a $100,000 giveaway , where ten individuals win, in addition to a leaderboard from which $500 is given to the top trader each day. The Pending Opportunity at the Lowest Price With issues faced by Dogecoin, investments are moving towards platforms such as Mutuum Finance, due to their potential for development and not mere speculative endeavors. Phase 6 has been 99% sold out, thus a last chance exists for its purchase at $0.035 before price increments kick in.

Will Dogecoin follow its lead? At press time, spot silver was holding near $76 after pulling back from the earlier record high of $83.62, with the metal up roughly 181% year-to-date in 2025, an outsized move for the precious-metal. The rally is attributed to a mix of macro and market-structure drivers including expectations for easier US monetary policy in 2026, strong industrial and investment demand, persistent supply shortfalls, and silver’s recent designation as a US “critical mineral,” which added a policy-sensitive supply narrative to an already tight market. The ‘Silver Fractal’ Pitch For Dogecoin That silver move is now being used as a visual analog in crypto. X analyst Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) posted a side-by-side TradingView comparison suggesting Dogecoin’s 6-month chart resembles silver’s 3-day structure from three weeks ago, implying DOGE could be positioned for a similarly persistent advance if the fractal holds. In the shared DOGE 6-month panel, Cantonese Cat shows a large selloff candle and frames it as a potential cyclical low. Based on the silver comparison, the interpretation is not “DOGE pumps next week,” but “DOGE trends for years.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Triangle Formation Breakdown Spells Trouble As 15% Move Nears – Time To Be Cautious? In the proposed fractal path, the current 6-month candle would mark the bottom, followed by eight additional 6-month candles spanning roughly four years where seven are green and only one is red. The lone red candle is mapped as the third in the sequence, implying the first half of 2027 could be a down half-year even within an overarching uptrend. If the pattern were to track silver “exactly,” the projected cycle peak would land in the second half of 2029, with a peak price “above $11” in that window. Related Reading: Dogecoin Is Repeating Its 2020 Accumulation Cycle, Analyst Says How It Fits His Earlier Wave Framework The comparison follows Cantonese Cat’s earlier Dec. 20 post outlining a longer-horizon DOGE roadmap on the weekly chart. “We’ve already had a 13 month bear market for DOGE, with my working hypothesis of this being likely a wave 2 correction prior to wave 3 explosion,” the analyst wrote. The accompanying weekly DOGE chart labels the prior advance as “Wave 1” and the subsequent decline as “Wave 2,” with a descending trendline drawn across the multi-year structure. The Dec. 20 weekly snapshot shows DOGE around $0.13160 with retracement levels including 0.382 at about $0.11771, and 0.236 at about $0.08427, with the base (“0”) around $0.04909. Above the current price, the analysis maps 0.5 at about $0.15422 as the next resistance, followed by 0.618 at about $0.20205, 0.707 at about $0.24770, 0.786 at about $0.29681, and 0.886 at about $0.37315, before the 1.0 level near $0.48442. Above the prior high, the same map plots extension targets often used in Elliott Wave projection frameworks, labeled near 1.272 ($0.90288), 1.414 ($1.24968), 1.618 ($1.99344), 2 ($4.77927), and 2.272 ($8.90771). The implication is conditional: the extensions matter only if DOGE completes the corrective phase and reclaims the prior impulse high.

56565152,649365,1767045624,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56565152.jpeg,XRP ETFs Set To Trigger A Supply Squeeze? Here’s How Much Coins Are Left On Exchanges,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-etfs-trigger-supply-squeeze/,"XRP ETF activity is pushing the asset into a phase where market structure increasingly outweighs market sentiment, as exchange-held supply continues to contract while institutional access expands. Analysts are now examining whether sustained ETF absorption could function as a long-term demand sink, tightening liquid supply and reshaping the mechanics of price discovery. Shrinking Supply? Institutional Absorption Of XRP ETFs Accelerates A market commentator on X has drawn attention to a sharp and sustained decline in XRP balances held across centralized exchanges, pointing to a structural change in how the asset is being absorbed and held. According to the figures cited, XRP ETFs have removed approximately 750 million XRP from exchanges within a matter of weeks, leaving an estimated 1.5 billion XRP remaining in liquid exchange reserves . This pace of absorption places exchange-held supply on a visibly contracting trajectory. The same X account shared an on-chain chart that visually substantiates the decline in exchange-held XRP. The data shows total balances across centralized exchanges trending steadily lower throughout 2025. Notably, this contraction occurs while price action remains relatively contained, indicating that supply is being withdrawn from exchanges without provoking sharp directional moves. This separation between declining liquidity and stable pricing points to deliberate, conviction-driven absorption, consistent with long-term institutional positioning . ETF-held XRP, by design, functions as locked capital rather than short-term liquidity. Once absorbed into exchange-traded products and institutional custody structures, tokens are effectively sidelined from day-to-day trading activity. This creates a largely one-directional supply dynamic , reducing the amount of XRP available to respond to new demand. On-chain data visualized in the chart supports this interpretation, showing consistent outflows that persist through both local price peaks and pullbacks. Regulatory developments further contextualize this trend. The market commentator explicitly links the tightening supply to the Clarity Act , which provides a framework for compliant institutional participation. With clearer legal treatment, XRP becomes suitable for long-term balance sheet exposure and operational use. Why 2026 Is Emerging As A Structural Inflection Point The supply narrative gains additional weight when viewed through a forward-looking lens. Projections pointing to early 2026 as a potential supply shock window are based not on aggressive acceleration, but on simple continuation. At the current rate of ETF-driven absorption, exchange balances could approach critically thin levels, creating a low-float market structure where marginal demand exerts disproportionate influence on price. The chart underscores this risk. As exchange-held XRP compresses toward historically low territory, the remaining liquid supply increasingly defines price discovery. In such conditions, price formation shifts away from speculative churn and toward liquidity mechanics, where availability, custody constraints, and institutional flows dominate outcomes. Taken together, falling exchange balances , sustained ETF absorption , and the regulatory clarity introduced by the Clarity Act all point to a market steadily tightening. Should these conditions persist into early 2026, XRP’s next major phase is likely to be shaped by scarcity and institutional liquidity dynamics, establishing a structural inflection point for the asset.",XRP|ripple|ripple news|XRP ETF|XRP ETFs|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-29 22:00:24

Her departure follows a period of substantial regulatory clarification for the digital asset industry. Consequently, market participants now reflect on her contributions. LaMothe notably spearheaded critical staff statements that provided much-needed guidance on contentious issues. These included the regulatory status of memecoins and the complex framework surrounding staking services. SEC Crypto Regulation Under Cicely LaMothe’s Stewardship Cicely LaMothe’s tenure at the SEC coincided with a period of intense scrutiny and rapid evolution within the cryptocurrency sector. Her role placed her at the forefront of interpreting how existing securities laws applied to novel digital assets. Therefore, her work directly influenced compliance strategies for countless blockchain projects and financial institutions. The Division of Corporation Finance, which she helped lead, plays a crucial role in reviewing corporate filings and providing interpretive guidance. Under her direction, the division tackled some of the most ambiguous areas in fintech. Moreover, her approach was characterized by a methodical analysis of the Howey Test and other legal benchmarks. This legal test determines whether an asset qualifies as an investment contract, and thus a security. LaMothe’s team applied this framework to various crypto offerings, seeking to draw clear lines in a often-murky landscape. Her statements did not create new law but offered the SEC staff’s authoritative interpretation of existing statutes. This guidance became essential reading for legal teams and developers alike. Clarifying the Memecoin Securities Debate One of LaMothe’s most cited contributions was the 2024 staff statement on memecoins. This guidance addressed a growing market segment fueled by social media trends and community engagement. The statement clarified that simply being a meme-based digital asset does not automatically classify it as a security. Instead, the determination hinges on the economic realities surrounding its creation and distribution. The staff outlined several key factors that would trigger securities laws: Expectation of Profits: Primarily from the efforts of a centralized development team or promoter. Fundraising Function: If the token launch primarily served to raise capital for project development. Ongoing Promotional Activities: Systematic efforts by creators to influence the asset’s market price. This framework provided relief to many community-driven joke tokens while maintaining the SEC’s enforcement posture against fraudulent initial coin offerings (ICOs) disguised as memes. As a result, the statement helped segment the market between genuine community tokens and unregistered securities offerings. Impact on Market Practices and Legal Precedents The memecoin guidance had immediate real-world effects. Following its publication, several projects revised their marketing materials and token distribution models to align with the stated principles. Legal experts referenced the document in advisory opinions and even in court filings as indicative of the SEC’s contemporary thinking. However, the statement also drew criticism from some who argued it did not go far enough in providing safe harbors. Despite this, it stands as a foundational text in the ongoing dialogue between regulators and the crypto community. Outlining the SEC’s Position on Crypto Staking Another landmark guidance led by LaMothe addressed the regulatory treatment of staking-as-a-service programs. Staking, a process where users lock up tokens to support network operations and earn rewards, presented a novel challenge. The SEC staff statement analyzed whether these programs constituted investment contracts. It focused on the role of the service provider and the promises made to participants. The guidance emphasized that centralized staking services, where users surrender control of their assets to a third party expecting returns from that entity’s efforts, likely fall under securities regulations. Conversely, decentralized, non-custodial staking by individuals for network validation presented a different analysis. This distinction proved crucial for both large exchanges offering staking products and for proof-of-stake blockchain networks themselves. Key Elements in SEC’s Staking Guidance Analysis Factor Likely a Security Less Likely a Security Asset Control Custodial (user gives keys to provider) Non-custodial (user retains control) Profit Source Promised returns from provider’s efforts Protocol-defined rewards for network service Marketing Emphasis Advertised as an investment product Framed as a network participation tool The Broader Context of Regulatory Evolution LaMothe’s work occurred during a transformative era for financial regulation. The SEC, under multiple chairmen, grappled with balancing investor protection with technological innovation. Her staff statements served as interim navigational aids while Congress debated comprehensive crypto legislation. These documents filled a regulatory gap, providing stakeholders with actionable insights despite the absence of final rules. Furthermore, her departure coincides with increased institutional adoption of digital assets. Major banks and asset managers now engage with cryptocurrencies, making clear regulatory signals more vital than ever. The precedents set during her term will likely influence the SEC’s posture for years. They also establish a benchmark for how future regulators may approach similar technological disruptions in finance. Expert Perspectives on the Legacy Legal scholars and former SEC officials have weighed in on the significance of this transition. Professor Alan Michaels of Georgetown Law noted, ‘Staff interpretations like those led by LaMothe provide critical market stability. They offer a window into the agency’s enforcement priorities without the full force of a rulemaking.’ Meanwhile, industry advocates have expressed hope that her successor will continue a policy of engaged clarification. The balance between firm enforcement and productive guidance remains a central challenge for the Division of Corporation Finance. Conclusion Cicely LaMothe’s completion of her term at the SEC marks the end of a consequential chapter in SEC crypto regulation. Her leadership in authoring guidance on memecoins and staking provided essential clarity during a period of significant uncertainty. These staff statements helped shape legal strategies, compliance frameworks, and market structures within the digital asset ecosystem. As the regulatory landscape continues to evolve, the foundations laid during her tenure will serve as critical reference points. The search for her successor now becomes a focal point for an industry keenly aware of the importance of regulatory dialogue and thoughtful oversight. FAQs Q1: What was Cicely LaMothe’s role at the SEC? As Deputy Director of the Division of Corporation Finance, she helped oversee the review of corporate filings and was instrumental in developing staff interpretive guidance on applying securities laws to new financial technologies, including cryptocurrency. Q2: What did the SEC staff statement on memecoins clarify? The statement clarified that a memecoin is not automatically a security. The determination depends on factors like whether investors have an expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others, such as a central development team actively promoting the asset. Q3: How did the guidance define the SEC’s position on staking? It distinguished between custodial staking-as-a-service programs, which likely constitute investment contracts (securities), and non-custodial staking performed by individuals directly on a blockchain network, which may not. Q4: Are these staff statements legally binding law? No, they are not formal rules or laws. They are interpretive guidance that explains how the SEC staff views certain activities under existing statutes. However, they strongly indicate areas of enforcement focus and are highly influential. Q5: What happens to this guidance now that LaMothe has left? The staff statements remain published SEC guidance unless formally rescinded or superseded by new commission rules, court rulings, or subsequent staff interpretations. They continue to inform the market and SEC enforcement approaches.

This declaration, made during a press briefing at the White House, immediately sent ripples through financial markets and policy circles. The President notably added that the possibility of firing Powell remains on the table, raising fundamental questions about Federal Reserve independence. This announcement comes at a critical juncture for the U.S. economy, with inflation concerns and interest rate decisions hanging in the balance. Federal Reserve Chair Appointment Enters Critical Phase The Federal Reserve Chair position represents one of the most powerful economic roles globally. Consequently, the occupant directly influences interest rates, employment levels, and price stability. President Trump’s January timeline for announcing Powell’s successor creates immediate uncertainty. Historically, Fed chairs serve four-year terms, with Powell’s current term technically expiring in February 2026. However, presidents typically announce reappointments or new nominations well in advance. This accelerated timeline suggests significant political considerations. Market analysts immediately began speculating about potential candidates. Furthermore, they examined the implications for monetary policy continuity. The Federal Reserve has maintained a delicate balance recently. It has fought inflation while attempting to avoid triggering a recession. Any perceived political interference in this process could undermine market confidence. International observers also watch closely, as Fed decisions affect global capital flows and exchange rates. Historical Context of Federal Reserve Independence The Federal Reserve operates with statutory independence from direct political control. This principle, established over decades, allows the central bank to make difficult decisions without short-term political pressure. Presidents have occasionally criticized Fed chairs, but direct threats of removal remain rare. The Federal Reserve Act states that governors, including the chair, may only be removed “for cause.” Legal experts debate what constitutes sufficient cause, creating a gray area. Previous presidents have faced similar tensions with the Fed. President Lyndon Johnson reportedly confronted Fed Chair William McChesney Martin over rate hikes. President Richard Nixon pressured Arthur Burns during the 1970s. However, no modern president has publicly discussed firing a sitting Fed chair. This precedent makes Trump’s comments particularly noteworthy. The institutional relationship between the White House and the Fed faces a potential stress test. Economic Implications of Leadership Uncertainty Financial markets dislike uncertainty above almost all else. The prospect of a Fed chair change injects volatility into bond markets, currency valuations, and equity prices. Investors must now consider multiple scenarios. Will President Trump nominate a dovish candidate favoring lower rates? Alternatively, might he choose a hawkish inflation fighter? Each possibility carries different implications for borrowing costs and economic growth. The timing coincides with several economic challenges. Inflation remains above the Fed’s 2% target in many sectors. Meanwhile, economic growth shows signs of moderation. The Fed’s dual mandate requires balancing maximum employment with price stability. A leadership change could signal a shift in priorities between these sometimes competing goals. Businesses planning investments and hiring decisions may pause until clarity emerges. Potential Candidates for Federal Reserve Leadership Several names circulate in policy discussions as potential successors. Each candidate brings different philosophies and backgrounds. The selection will signal the administration’s economic policy direction for the coming years. Current Fed Governors: Several sitting Federal Reserve Board members understand the institution’s complexities. Their experience could ensure continuity during transition periods. Academic Economists: Presidents sometimes select renowned economists from leading universities. These candidates typically possess deep theoretical knowledge but may lack political experience. Financial Sector Executives: Leaders from banking or investment firms offer practical market experience. However, they may face scrutiny over potential conflicts of interest. International Candidates: While unusual, some past administrations considered economists with strong international credentials, particularly during global economic crises. Recent Federal Reserve Chairs and Their Tenures Chair Years Served Appointing President Key Challenge Jerome Powell 2018-Present Donald Trump Post-pandemic inflation surge Janet Yellen 2014-2018 Barack Obama Normalizing rates after financial crisis Ben Bernanke 2006-2014 George W. Bush 2008 global financial crisis Alan Greenspan 1987-2006 Ronald Reagan Dot-com bubble and 9/11 aftermath Legal and Constitutional Considerations The Federal Reserve Act provides limited guidance on chair removal. Section 10 states that governors shall hold office for fourteen years unless “removed for cause by the President.” Legal scholars debate whether policy disagreements constitute sufficient cause. Most interpretations suggest removal requires malfeasance, neglect of duty, or criminal conduct. A president attempting removal over policy differences would likely face immediate legal challenges. Congressional reaction will prove crucial. Many legislators from both parties value Fed independence. They might resist perceived political interference through hearings or legislation. The Senate confirms Fed chair nominees, giving senators substantial influence. A controversial nominee could face difficult confirmation hearings. These political dynamics create checks and balances in the appointment process. Global Reactions and Market Responses International central banks monitor Fed leadership closely. The U.S. dollar serves as the world’s primary reserve currency. Therefore, Federal Reserve decisions affect economies everywhere. Foreign officials generally prefer stability and predictability from their American counterparts. Surprise changes could disrupt coordinated international policy efforts. Financial markets reacted immediately to the announcement. The dollar experienced volatility against major currencies. Treasury yields showed unusual movements as bond traders adjusted expectations. Equity markets displayed sector-specific reactions, with rate-sensitive industries like real estate and utilities showing particular sensitivity. These market responses demonstrate the Fed chair’s global significance. Conclusion President Trump’s announcement regarding the Federal Reserve Chair position creates significant economic and institutional uncertainty. The January timeline for naming a potential successor to Jerome Powell, coupled with remarks about possible removal, tests traditional boundaries between politics and central banking. This situation unfolds against a complex economic backdrop requiring careful monetary stewardship. The coming months will reveal whether institutional norms withstand political pressure. Ultimately, the Federal Reserve’s ability to maintain price stability and support maximum employment may depend on navigating this leadership transition while preserving its operational independence. The decision about the next Federal Reserve Chair will undoubtedly shape economic policy for years beyond this administration. FAQs Q1: Can the President actually fire the Federal Reserve Chair? The Federal Reserve Act states that governors, including the chair, may only be removed “for cause.” Legal interpretations generally limit this to misconduct or neglect of duty, not policy disagreements. Any attempt to remove a chair over policy would likely face immediate legal challenges. Q2: When does Jerome Powell’s current term as Fed Chair end? Powell’s current four-year term as Chair technically expires in February 2026. However, his term as a Federal Reserve Board governor continues until 2028, allowing him to remain on the Board even if not serving as Chair. Q3: Why is Federal Reserve independence important? Central bank independence allows monetary policy decisions based on economic data rather than short-term political considerations. This independence helps control inflation, maintain financial stability, and build long-term market confidence in the currency. Q4: How might financial markets react to a Fed Chair change? Markets typically experience increased volatility during leadership uncertainty. Bond yields, currency values, and stock prices may fluctuate as investors assess the policy direction of potential successors. Rate-sensitive sectors often show particular sensitivity. Q5: What happens if the Senate rejects a Fed Chair nominee? The President would need to submit a new nominee. During the confirmation process, the Vice Chair or another Board member would likely serve as acting chair. This interim period could extend if multiple nominees face rejection or withdrawal.

The scale and concentration of this liquidity, much of it sitting idle, have sharpened focus on whether the market is primed for its next major move once sentiment flips. $69B in Stablecoins Cluster on Binance as Liquidity Waits CryptoQuant contributor Crazzyblockk wrote on December 29 that exchange-held stablecoin reserves stand at $69 billion, representing about 22% of the entire stablecoin market. Binance alone holds $49 billion, or roughly 71% of all exchange-based stablecoin buying power, making it the single largest pool of deployable capital in crypto. Crazzyblockk’s analysis also revealed a striking gap between venues, with OKX following with around $10 billion, while Bybit holds close to $3 billion. Together, the top three exchanges control about 94% of exchange stablecoin reserves, with the market watcher describing this concentration as crypto’s largest liquidity pool to date. December data shows capital has not rushed in yet. Some $8 billion in stablecoins left exchanges during the month, including $3 billion from Bybit and about $2 billion from Binance, while OKX stayed near the $10 billion mark. But even after these outflows, Binance still holds close to 15% of the entire global stablecoin supply. CryptoQuant’s view is that such reserves matter most when sentiment changes. Exchanges with deeper pools can deploy capital first, and with over two-thirds of exchange liquidity on Binance, much of the initial buying pressure would likely pass through a single venue if risk appetite returns. Crazzyblockk added that on-chain activity has dropped by about 40%, while whales accumulated around 20,000 BTC and futures open interest expanded by $2 billion, leaving everything in place for a market move except the trigger. Market Signals Mixed as Bitcoin Struggles Near Resistance Bitcoin rebounded earlier today to around $90,000, up about 2% in 24 hours, before meeting resistance. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) reclaimed $3,000, while major altcoins such as BNB and XRP also bounced, suggesting short-term relief across the market. Still, experts remain split. One of them, CW, noted that retail traders and whales were buying at the same time, particularly on Binance, while Ali Martinez warned the move could be another short-lived rebound, pointing to negative capital flows and continued spot ETF outflows. Analyst nino added another layer of caution using derivatives data. According to them, Bitcoin futures funding rates are quite high across 72-hour averages, a sign that leverage has not fully reset. Without that cooling, the market may struggle to sustain a stronger recovery. Looking ahead, macro expectations for 2026, including easier monetary policy and possible capital rotation into risk assets, have kept longer-term optimism alive. However, for now, the record stablecoin stockpile shows capital is ready, but patience is still the dominant trade until a clearer catalyst appears.

The incident has led to concerns across the crypto industry around browser-based wallets and the growing risks faced by retail-heavy communities. As one of the largest and most active ecosystems in crypto, members of the Shiba Inu community have found themselves at the center of discussions on the failure that exposed many crypto holders. Trust Wallet Extension Exploit Raises Alarm Across SHIB Community The breach in question refers to a compromised version of the Trust Wallet Chrome browser extension, specifically version 2.68. Code embedded in the update allowed attackers to access wallets and drain funds without users realizing what was happening. Several cryptocurrencies were affected, and the precise breakdown of losses by asset is currently unclear. Even so, the incident has drawn particular attention inside the Shiba Inu community due to the sheer size of its holder base and the widespread use of browser wallets among SHIB investors. Warnings quickly circulated within the SHIB ecosystem. For instance, the Susbarium | Shibarium Trustwatch account issued a public alert on the social media platform X , encouraging users to immediately disable extension version 2.68 and update to version 2.69 from the official Chrome Web Store. The notice also clarified that mobile users and other extension versions were unaffected, helping to narrow the scope of concern and reduce panic. These warnings aligned with official updates from the Trust Wallet team, which acknowledged the breach and moved quickly to contain it. What Comes Next After The Trust Wallet Breach? As the immediate fallout from the Trust Wallet browser extension breach settles, the next thing is resolution and accountability. In terms of the scale of damage, Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao stated that the breach resulted in about $7 million in losses across affected Trust Wallet accounts. Trust Wallet subsequently announced that it would reimburse all victims of the security incident. Further insight came from Eowyn Chen, CEO of Trust Wallet, who shared a December 28 update addressing the ongoing investigation. Chen acknowledged the disruption caused by the incident and noted that the team was prioritizing accuracy over speed in the compensation process. According to Chen, Trust Wallet has so far identified 2,596 affected wallet addresses. However, the company has received around 5,000 reimbursement claims, revealing a large number of false or duplicate submissions. The episode is another reminder that infrastructure risks can impact even the most established projects in the crypto space. Particularly, the situation revived memories of earlier security incidents tied to the Shiba Inu ecosystem. The most recent example was in September 2025, when the Shibarium bridge was exploited through a flash loan attack that resulted in losses estimated at about $4.1 million worth of assets, including ETH, SHIB, and KNINE.",Shiba Inu|binance|Changpeng Zhao|Chrome Web Store|Eowyn Chen|KNINE|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|Shibarium Trustwatch|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT|Susbarium|Trust Wallet,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|SHIB|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY|SECURITY INCIDENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-29 23:00:33

Bulls are struggling to find reliable support as price action weakens, and recent attempts at stabilization have failed to attract sustained demand. The loss of this psychological and structural level has left XRP vulnerable, with traders increasingly positioning defensively amid broader uncertainty across the altcoin market. Related Reading: Why $100,000 Is Bitcoin’s Most Important Resistance Level According to analysis shared by Darkfost, selling pressure on XRP has intensified materially over recent weeks. The data shows that the current move is not a minor pullback, but part of a deeper corrective phase. XRP has declined by roughly 50% from its cycle peak near $3.66, falling toward the $1.85 region. This magnitude of decline reflects a clear shift in market behavior, as earlier optimism has given way to risk reduction and capital preservation. Darkfost’s assessment suggests that the increase in selling is driven by a combination of profit-taking from older positions and capitulation from more recent buyers who entered at higher levels. As the price moves further away from prior highs, confidence has deteriorated, reinforcing the downside momentum. Exchange Inflows Highlight Rising Sell-Side Pressure Darkfost further explains that the recent surge in selling pressure becomes especially clear when examining XRP inflows to exchanges, with Binance standing out as the primary focal point. As the exchange that concentrates the largest share of XRP trading volume, Binance often serves as an early indicator of shifting market intent. Rising inflows to exchanges are commonly interpreted as a signal that holders are preparing to sell, particularly when the increase is sudden and sustained. After several weeks of relatively calm conditions, characterized by stable and moderate inflows, this pattern changed sharply around December 15. Since then, XRP transfers to Binance have accelerated, with daily inflows consistently ranging between 35 million XRP and a pronounced spike of roughly 116 million XRP recorded on December 19. This marks a clear break from the prior holding-oriented behavior observed through much of October and November. The shift in inflow dynamics suggests a change in investor psychology. Longer-term holders appear to be taking profits after XRP’s strong run earlier in the cycle, while more recent entrants are increasingly capitulating and selling at a loss as the price continues to slide. This combination amplifies downside pressure and reinforces the current corrective trend. As long as elevated exchange inflows persist, conditions for accumulation remain unfavorable. Without a meaningful slowdown in deposits, XRP is likely to struggle to form a durable base, increasing the risk that the correction extends further in both time and depth. Related Reading: Trust Wallet Exploit Drains $7M: Hundreds Of Users Affected XRP Price Action Details: Testing Demand XRP continues to trade under clear technical pressure, with price hovering near the $1.87–$1.90 zone after a prolonged downtrend on the daily chart. The structure shows a decisive loss of bullish control following the rejection from the $3.00–$3.50 region earlier in the year. Since that peak, XRP has consistently printed lower highs and lower lows, confirming a bearish market structure that remains intact. From a trend perspective, the price is trading below all major moving averages. The short-term moving average has turned sharply lower and now acts as immediate dynamic resistance, while the medium- and long-term averages are also sloping downward, reinforcing the broader bearish bias. Each recent attempt at a relief bounce has failed below these averages, suggesting that sellers continue to dominate rallies. Related Reading: Bitcoin and Ethereum Coinbase Inflows Collapse While Binance Retains Relative Activity – Details The $1.80–$1.85 region is now a critical support area. This zone has absorbed several tests in recent weeks, indicating short-term demand, but the lack of a strong rebound highlights weak buying conviction. A clean break below this level would expose XRP to a deeper retracement toward the $1.50 region, where historical demand previously emerged. Unless XRP can reclaim the $2.10–$2.20 range and hold above it, the path of least resistance remains to the downside, with risks skewed toward further consolidation or continuation of the correction.

According to a definitive report from analytics firm Delphi Digital, GameFi investment has collapsed by more than 55% this year compared to 2024. This dramatic decline signals a profound shift for an industry grappling with unmet expectations and cooling investor enthusiasm. However, within this challenging landscape, a new hybrid model—termed Web2.5—is demonstrating resilient, quiet growth by integrating blockchain technology more subtly into traditional gaming frameworks. GameFi Investment Faces a Severe 2025 Contraction Delphi Digital’s comprehensive market analysis reveals a sobering picture for GameFi funding. The firm meticulously tracks venture capital, private equity, and token launch investments specifically targeting blockchain-based games and gaming infrastructure. Their 2025 year-to-date data shows a contraction exceeding 55%, a figure that underscores a significant market correction. This decline follows several years of explosive growth where billions flowed into play-to-earn models and metaverse projects. Consequently, the current downturn represents not just a cyclical dip but a fundamental reassessment of the sector’s value proposition and timeline for mainstream adoption. Several interrelated factors drive this investment pullback. First, macroeconomic pressures on the broader cryptocurrency market have reduced risk capital availability. Second, regulatory uncertainty surrounding digital assets continues to deter institutional investors. Finally, and most critically, the performance of launched titles has failed to meet lofty expectations. Many highly funded projects promised revolutionary economies but delivered clunky experiences or unsustainable tokenomics. This execution gap has led to investor fatigue and a more cautious due diligence process. The Underperformance of Anticipated Titles The cooling enthusiasm that Delphi Digital notes stems directly from a series of high-profile disappointments. Several blockchain games that secured nine-figure investments in 2023 and 2024 launched to middling reviews and poor player retention in 2025. Analysts point to common pitfalls: Economic Imbalance: Play-to-earn mechanics often prioritized speculative asset accumulation over fun, leading to inflationary death spirals. Technical Hurdles: Complex wallet integrations and high transaction fees created barriers for non-crypto-native gamers. Quality Gap: Gameplay and graphics frequently lagged behind established Web2 titles, failing to justify the added blockchain complexity. This pattern of underperformance triggered a loss of confidence. Venture firms that once raced to back any project with “GameFi” in its pitch deck now demand proven studios, demonstrable gameplay loops, and sustainable monetization plans. The era of funding whitepapers and concept art has decisively ended. The market now rewards substance over speculation, forcing developers to focus on core gaming fundamentals before layering on blockchain elements. Expert Analysis: A Necessary Market Correction Industry veterans frame this downturn as an inevitable and healthy consolidation. “The 55% drop in GameFi investment is a brutal but necessary reset,” notes a senior analyst from a competing crypto research firm who requested anonymity for candid commentary. “It filters out projects that were purely financial instruments disguised as games. The capital remaining is smarter, more patient, and focused on long-term player engagement rather than short-term token pumps. This painful process ultimately strengthens the ecosystem’s foundation for future growth.” This perspective aligns with historical tech cycles, where hype-driven bubbles precede periods of focused, utility-driven development. The Quiet Ascent of Web2.5 Gaming Models Amidst the GameFi sector’s struggles, Delphi Digital highlights a counter-trend: the steady growth of Web2.5 games. This emerging category represents a pragmatic middle ground. Web2.5 games are primarily high-quality, traditional video games that selectively incorporate blockchain technology for specific use cases—not as their core revenue driver. Examples include: Using non-fungible tokens (NFTs) for verifiable, tradable cosmetic items like skins or costumes, leaving core gameplay unaffected. Implementing decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to allow portable player profiles and reputations across multiple games. Employing smart contracts for transparent, community-governed prize pools in esports tournaments. This approach avoids the pitfalls of full “play-to-earn” by making blockchain an optional, background feature that enhances rather than defines the experience. Major traditional gaming studios, previously skeptical of crypto, are now experimenting with these limited integrations. Their vast resources, design expertise, and existing player bases give Web2.5 initiatives a significant advantage over native GameFi startups. Consequently, investment, while quieter, is flowing toward these hybrid experiments from both crypto-native funds and traditional gaming venture arms. GameFi vs. Web2.5 Investment & Focus (2025) Model Primary Investment Trend Core Focus Example Feature Traditional GameFi Sharp Decline (-55%) In-game economy & asset speculation Earning tokens through gameplay Web2.5 Hybrid Quiet Growth Player experience & optional utility Tradable cosmetic NFT items Broader Impacts on the Cryptocurrency Ecosystem The GameFi investment slump creates ripple effects across the broader crypto industry. Layer-1 and Layer-2 blockchains that prioritized gaming as a key use case now face reduced developer activity and user acquisition on their networks. Native gaming tokens have seen valuations plummet, impacting decentralized exchanges and lending protocols that listed them. Furthermore, the metaverse vision, often intertwined with GameFi, has lost a primary driver of user engagement and virtual land sales. This contraction forces infrastructure projects to diversify their application focus beyond gaming, potentially accelerating development in decentralized finance (DeFi), social media, and supply chain solutions. However, the situation is not uniformly negative. The capital and developer talent leaving speculative GameFi projects are migrating to more robust sectors. Skilled game designers are applying their craft in Web2.5 environments. Blockchain engineers are refining scalability solutions that benefit all decentralized applications. This redistribution of resources, while painful in the short term, may increase the overall maturity and resilience of the Web3 space. The market is effectively reallocating human and financial capital to areas with clearer paths to utility and adoption. Conclusion The 55% decline in GameFi investment during 2025 marks a pivotal moment for blockchain gaming. Delphi Digital’s data confirms a difficult year defined by underperforming titles and cooled enthusiasm. This downturn represents a necessary market correction that shifts focus from financial speculation to genuine player value and sustainable design. Simultaneously, the quiet growth of Web2.5 models offers a pragmatic path forward, blending the proven strengths of traditional gaming with selective blockchain enhancements. The future of gaming on the blockchain now depends less on grandiose economic promises and more on seamless, enjoyable experiences that leverage decentralized technology where it truly adds value. The GameFi sector’s brutal reset may ultimately forge a stronger, more credible industry. FAQs Q1: What does a 55% drop in GameFi investment actually mean? A1: It means the total amount of money (from venture capital, grants, token sales, etc.) invested in blockchain gaming projects in 2025 is less than half of what it was in 2024. This indicates a major loss of confidence and a shift toward more cautious, selective funding. Q2: What are Web2.5 games, and how do they differ from GameFi? A2: Web2.5 games are primarily traditional, high-quality video games that optionally use blockchain for specific features—like verifiable item ownership—without making crypto economics the core gameplay loop. GameFi typically makes earning and trading crypto assets the central activity. Q3: Why did so many anticipated GameFi titles underperform? A3: Common reasons include prioritizing complex tokenomics over fun gameplay, technical barriers for users, unsustainable “play-to-earn” economies that inflated quickly, and a general quality gap compared to top-tier non-blockchain games. Q4: Is the GameFi sector dead after this report? A4: No, it is not dead but undergoing a severe correction and maturation phase. Investment is becoming more discerning, focusing on projects with strong gameplay fundamentals and realistic blockchain integration, rather than speculative concepts. Q5: How does this affect the average cryptocurrency investor or gamer? A5: For gamers, it may mean fewer pure “play-to-earn” launches but higher-quality hybrid experiences. For investors, it signals extreme caution with gaming tokens and a need to scrutinize a project’s actual gameplay and user adoption, not just its token model.

Market analyst Dominic Basulto from The Motley Fool believes that despite the persistent challenges seen in the fourth quarter of the year, Bitcoin could soar to $150,000 by 2026, fueled by the newly established US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Is $150,000 Possible For Bitcoin? Historical context supports Basulto’s prediction; Bitcoin’s performance over the years has shown significant recovery potential, with 2015 marking its worst bull market year at just a 36% gain. Significantly, in seven of its years, Bitcoin has achieved triple-digit percentage returns. The analyst suggests that 2026 may resemble 2019, a year when Bitcoin appreciated by 95% following the dismal performance in 2018, when it plummeted by 74%. Related Reading: XRP Supply Shock Incoming? Expert Reveals The Truth In 2019, several catalysts, such as heightened global economic uncertainty and a surge in institutional interest, propelled Bitcoin upwards—situations that appear similar to current conditions. Institutional investors are increasingly adding BTC to their portfolios, driven by spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Meanwhile, concerns over global tariffs and macroeconomic instability in the US continue to resonate among investors, setting the stage for potential bullish movement. However, Basulto emphasizes that Bitcoin can only reach the $150,000 milestone if it is perceived as a long-term store of value. If investors view it merely as another high-risk asset, they may choose to favor physical gold over digital gold, which has seen a record-breaking year. The crux of his argument centers on one pivotal factor that could significantly impact Bitcoin’s price: a notable increase in purchases by the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. What Happens If Nations Stockpile BTC? Basulto claims that if the US government were to start buying substantial quantities of Bitcoin, it could trigger a global arms race among other countries keen to create their own strategic BTC reserves. According to the analyst, such purchases from national reserves could dramatically inflate Bitcoin’s price, likely surpassing the impact of corporate treasury companies that have already amassed close to 5% of the world’s circulating BTC supply.

Although reaching the $150,000 mark may seem ambitious given Bitcoin’s recent performance, more aggressive predictions exist for 2026. For instance, JPMorgan Chase has forecasted a potential price of $170,000, while Wall Street strategist Tom Lee from Fundstrat has suggested that BTC might even hit $250,000 next year. While a variety of factors must align for BTC to reclaim its status as digital gold, the possibility of elevated prices hinges on strategic actions by both the US government and institutional investors. Basulto concluded that if the leading cryptocurrency can consolidate its position and the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve gains traction, the predicted price of $150,000 could be achieved by next year. At the time of writing, BTC’s price retraced towards $87,330 following an early Monday move above $90,500.

56566823,https://timestabloid.com/?p=93617,1767052801,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP’s 2035 Worst-Case Scenario: Potential Price Projection,https://timestabloid.com/xrps-2035-worst-case-scenario-potential-price-projection/,"XRP has struggled in recent months following a market-wide downturn, which has triggered renewed interest in long-term valuation projections. The token reached a high of $3.66 in July 2025, leading many analysts to predict significant upward potential. However, price action since then has been weaker than expected, raising the question: if the most optimistic calls do not materialize, what could a conservative outcome look like by 2035? Unrealized Bullish Forecasts Earlier in the year, when XRP hovered around $3.15, several market watchers presented ambitious targets. Mario Nawfal suggested that a move to $10 was possible if Bitcoin reached $225,000 by the end of 2025. Around the same period, Carl Moon speculated that XRP could rise as high as $30 under extremely favorable conditions. As of now, those projections remain unmet. The asset has fallen by about 44% from its July peak to $1.86 , indicating that broad optimism does not always translate into immediate price appreciation. With the year closing out below bullish expectations, some investors have shifted focus to evaluating conservative outcomes further into the future. Examining Downside Scenarios Through 2035 To assess potential lower-bound valuations, Google Gemini was consulted for a worst-case forecast. The model proposed that XRP could reach approximately $8 by 2035 even under restricted growth conditions. This would represent about a fourfold increase from current pricing, modest when compared to multi-digit predictions, but still notable given current market pressure. Gemini outlined several elements that could limit expansion. These include competition from central bank digital currencies, continued reliance on legacy payment systems like SWIFT , unresolved debates regarding decentralization, and macroeconomic instability. Limited institutional integration or slow adoption could also suppress performance. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Still, Gemini acknowledged that XRP is unlikely to remain at present levels indefinitely. It argued that progress in regulatory clarity following the SEC case and continued RippleNet usage, especially in emerging markets, may support gradual appreciation. Under the $8 outcome, XRP would retain a role within specific financial segments without becoming a dominant global settlement asset. Contrasting Forecasts Views among analysts differ widely. Researchers at Bitget presented an even more restrained outlook, proposing $3.8 as a potential floor and $5.55 as an upper limit by 2035. Their projected ceiling remains below Gemini’s worst-case scenario, illustrating how conservative some forecasts have become. Conversely, projections from Telegaon position XRP much higher. Their estimates suggest that by 2035, XRP could trade within a range of $35.47 to $40.29, assuming favourable adoption and macro conditions. This view maintains confidence in XRP’s long-term potential, although it depends on strong institutional integration and global expansion. While projections for XRP’s future vary widely, the estimates show that its performance over the next decade will largely depend on adoption, regulation, and real-world integration. Conservative models still indicate moderate growth by 2035, while more optimistic outlooks leave room for substantial appreciation if institutional usage increases.

56568587,649304,1767052852,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56568587.jpeg,Bitcoin Sees Post-Capitulation Conditions Align: Selling Pressure Falls 80%,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-sees-post-capitulation-conditions-align/,"Bitcoin continues to trade below the $90,000 level after multiple failed attempts to break higher since December 14, reinforcing a growing sense of caution across the market. Each rejection near this psychological threshold has added weight to the bearish narrative, with an increasing number of analysts now warning that Bitcoin may be entering a prolonged corrective phase in the year ahead. Despite this muted price action, on-chain data suggests a more nuanced picture beneath the surface. Top analyst Axel Adler recently shared a chart tracking Bitcoin realized losses using a seven-day moving average and a z-score framework, highlighting a clear transition from November’s extreme capitulation to a period of normalization in December. This metric measures the volume of losses realized when coins move, with the z-score used to identify stress extremes within the market. November marked the peak of selling pressure. On November 21–22, the realized loss z-score surged to between 8.7 and 10.9, with daily losses exceeding $5 billion. In comparison, the late-December spike on December 26, which reached a z-score near 1.6, appears relatively minor. More importantly, weekly realized losses have collapsed from roughly $2.4 billion at the peak to around $0.5 billion, returning to levels last seen in September and October. According to Adler, this sharp decline points to structural seller exhaustion rather than a temporary lull. Historically, markets often stabilize after such conditions, suggesting that while the price remains weak, downside pressure may be fading. Bitcoin Indicator Signals Fading Downside Pressure Adler’s report also highlights Bitcoin’s Net Realized Profit/Loss (P/L) metric, smoothed using a seven-day moving average, offering further insight into the market’s internal dynamics. This indicator tracks the balance between realized profits and realized losses over time. When the value is negative, losses dominate and capital is being destroyed; when positive, profit-taking outweighs loss realization. Currently, Bitcoin’s net realized P/L remains in negative territory, confirming that the market has not fully exited a risk-off regime. However, the direction of travel is notable. Over the final week of December, the depth of negative net P/L shrank by nearly half, signaling a meaningful reduction in loss intensity. Importantly, this improvement has unfolded without a strong price recovery, suggesting that the change is driven by seller exhaustion rather than an artificial price squeeze or short-term speculation. According to Adler, this behavior is structurally significant. When net realized P/L trends upward toward the zero line, it reflects a transition phase in which forced selling subsides, and marginal supply weakens. Historically, a sustained move back into positive territory has coincided with the early stages of local market recoveries. Taken together, the realized loss and net P/L charts present a consistent narrative. November appears to have absorbed the majority of weak hands, December functioned as an absorption and stabilization phase, and January could represent a potential inflection point—provided new demand begins to enter the market. Price Remains Range-Bounded Bitcoin remains locked in a tight consolidation below the $90,000 level, as shown on the 4-hour chart, reflecting persistent indecision after repeated failed breakout attempts. Price is currently trading near $87,600, holding within a narrow range that has defined market behavior throughout the second half of December. This structure highlights a balance between buyers defending local support and sellers consistently fading rallies. From a technical standpoint, Bitcoin is trading below the declining 200-period moving average, which continues to act as a key dynamic resistance near the $89,000–$90,000 zone. The 100-period moving average has flattened and is closely aligned with price, signaling a lack of momentum in either direction. Meanwhile, the shorter-term moving average has rolled over, reinforcing the short-term bearish bias and confirming that upside attempts are being absorbed. The price action since mid-December shows a clear compression pattern, with lower highs forming beneath resistance and higher lows developing above the $86,000–$87,000 support region. This tightening range suggests that volatility is being suppressed, often preceding a decisive move. Structurally, the $86,000 level remains critical. A clean breakdown below this support could open the door to a deeper retracement toward the low $80,000s. Conversely, reclaiming and holding above $90,000 would invalidate the current bearish structure and signal renewed upside momentum.

This pivotal development, reported from Seoul, South Korea, in early 2025, highlights a dramatic retreat from homegrown innovation, directly challenging the country’s ambitions as a global crypto hub. The trend underscores a broader industry pivot toward international assets, driven primarily by an increasingly cautious regulatory environment that now stifles local entrepreneurial spirit. Upbit’s 2025 Listing Data Reveals a Domestic Drought An analysis of Upbit’s 2025 activity reveals a stark numerical imbalance. The exchange, commanding an estimated 70% market share in South Korea, introduced 54 new cryptocurrencies to its trading platforms this year. However, only one of these assets, Story (IP), originated from a South Korean development team. This solitary ‘Kimchi coin’—a colloquial term for domestic crypto projects—stands in sharp contrast to the 53 other new listings, which primarily feature established global tokens and projects from regions with clearer regulatory frameworks. Concurrently, the delisting data further emphasizes the trend. Upbit removed ten cryptocurrencies from its exchange in 2025. Significantly, seven of those ten delisted projects were South Korean in origin. This dual action of minimal new inclusions and targeted removals has drastically reduced the overall presence and visibility of local blockchain ventures on the nation’s most critical trading venue. Consequently, retail and institutional investors now find a platform increasingly curated with international options, reshaping investment flows and market dynamics. The Regulatory Catalyst Behind Upbit’s Conservative Stance The primary driver for this conservative listing policy is a direct response to heightened government scrutiny and regulatory pressure. Following the implementation of the Travel Rule and stricter anti-money laundering (AML) guidelines, South Korean exchanges like Upbit now operate under a ‘regulatory microscope’. These platforms face severe penalties for listing assets that later encounter legal or security issues. Therefore, exchanges have adopted profoundly risk-averse internal policies to ensure compliance and maintain their operating licenses. This regulatory uncertainty creates a significant barrier for local projects. Unlike international tokens with longer track records on global exchanges, new South Korean ‘Kimchi coins’ must navigate a gauntlet of pre-listing reviews that scrutinize everything from tokenomics and team backgrounds to whitepaper claims and utility. The table below contrasts the typical listing evaluation criteria for domestic versus international projects on major South Korean exchanges as of 2025: Evaluation Criteria Domestic ‘Kimchi Coin’ Project Established International Project Regulatory History Check Extensive audit of Korean FIU compliance Review of major global exchange listings Team Due Diligence Deep background checks on all Korean members Focus on core developers and public figures Legal Opinion Requirement Mandatory from a Korean law firm Often waived if listed on top-5 global exchanges Market Provenance Must prove novel utility for Korean market Accepted based on global trading volume & liquidity This disparate process means domestic startups incur higher costs and face longer delays, making them less competitive for precious exchange listing slots. The result is a chilling effect where entrepreneurs either pivot their projects to target international markets first or abandon blockchain initiatives altogether. Industry Experts Decry the Innovation Exodus Industry leaders and analysts are vocal about the long-term consequences. “We are witnessing a capital and brain drain,” stated a senior blockchain analyst at a Seoul-based fintech research firm, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive regulatory climate. “When a local giant like Upbit lists one domestic project against dozens of foreign ones, it sends a clear signal to venture capitalists and developers. The message is that the path to success for a Korean Web3 company now bypasses the Korean market entirely.” This sentiment is echoed by developers. Many point to the 2017-2018 boom period, where ‘Kimchi coins’ often led market rallies, as a contrast to today’s environment. The current framework prioritizes investor protection to such a degree that it inadvertently stifles the very innovation needed for the sector to mature. Experts argue that without clear, innovation-friendly regulations—such as the proposed Digital Asset Basic Act which remains delayed in the National Assembly—South Korea risks ceding its early-mover advantage to jurisdictions like Japan, Singapore, and the European Union, which are advancing comprehensive crypto asset frameworks. Comparative Global Landscape and South Korea’s Position Globally, the approach to exchange listings varies significantly, placing South Korea’s current stance in clear relief. In markets like the United Arab Emirates and Switzerland, regulatory ‘sandboxes’ allow projects to launch and test under supervised conditions. Meanwhile, Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) maintains a rigorous but transparent approval process for all crypto exchanges and listed coins, providing certainty for businesses. South Korea’s current model, by comparison, is often described as ‘reactive regulation’. Key characteristics include: Ex-ante Uncertainty: Rules are often clarified only after issues arise, leaving exchanges to preemptively restrict listings. Banking Barrier: The reliance on real-name verified bank accounts for crypto trading creates a bottleneck controlled by traditional finance institutions wary of regulatory reprisal. Enforcement Focus: Recent years have seen high-profile enforcement actions against exchange executives, further incentivizing extreme caution over market growth. This environment has not only affected listings but also broader blockchain infrastructure development. Major Korean conglomerates (chaebols) that once explored ambitious blockchain projects have scaled back their public-facing initiatives, opting instead for private, permissioned enterprise solutions that attract less regulatory attention. The Ripple Effects on Investors and the Market For the average South Korean crypto investor, Upbit’s listing trend has tangible impacts. The diversification of portfolios is now skewed toward international assets, exposing investors to different market cycles and geopolitical risks. Furthermore, the lack of local projects means fewer opportunities to invest in familiar companies or concepts rooted in the Korean economy and culture. Market data shows a correlation between listing policies and trading volumes. Pairs involving the few remaining major ‘Kimchi coins’ have seen volatility spikes, as they become concentrated assets within a shrinking domestic pool. Conversely, liquidity for major global tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum on Korean exchanges has deepened, aligning prices more closely with international benchmarks and reducing the infamous ‘Kimchi premium’—a phenomenon where crypto prices in Korea once traded significantly higher than elsewhere. Conclusion The revelation that Upbit listed only one South Korean ‘Kimchi coin’ among 54 new assets in 2025 is more than a statistical anomaly; it is a critical indicator of the state of the nation’s blockchain industry. This trend, fueled by risk-averse policies stemming from regulatory uncertainty, has significantly diminished the platform for domestic innovation. While investor protection remains paramount, the current imbalance threatens to export South Korea’s crypto talent and entrepreneurial energy. The onus now falls on policymakers to provide the clear, forward-looking framework that exchanges and startups desperately need. The future of South Korea’s position in the global digital asset landscape hinges on resolving this regulatory impasse and rediscovering a balance between safety and innovation. FAQs Q1: What is a ‘Kimchi coin’? A ‘Kimchi coin’ is a slang term used within South Korea to refer to cryptocurrency projects that are developed domestically by Korean teams and primarily launched on Korean exchanges. Q2: Why is Upbit’s listing policy so important for South Korea? Upbit holds an estimated 70% market share of cryptocurrency trading in South Korea. Its listing decisions directly control which assets millions of Korean investors can access, making it a gatekeeper that shapes the entire domestic market. Q3: What specific regulations are causing exchanges to be risk-averse? Key regulations include the strict enforcement of the Financial Action Task Force’s Travel Rule (which mandates sharing sender/receiver information), stringent anti-money laundering (AML) requirements, and the potential for severe penalties if a listed token is later deemed non-compliant or involved in a scandal. Q4: Has the ‘Kimchi premium’ disappeared due to these trends? The ‘Kimchi premium’—the historical price gap where cryptocurrencies traded higher in Korea—has significantly narrowed and stabilized. This is partly due to markets becoming more efficient and Korean liquidity being dominated by global assets whose prices are set on international venues. Q5: Are other South Korean exchanges following the same trend as Upbit? Yes, other major exchanges like Bithumb and Korbit have adopted similarly cautious listing policies. The entire sector operates under the same regulatory umbrella, leading to a consolidated industry-wide shift away from listing speculative domestic projects.

This critical sentiment gauge, a composite of volatility, social data, and market metrics, provides a stark, quantitative snapshot of prevailing investor psychology. Consequently, understanding its current reading and historical context becomes essential for navigating today’s complex digital asset landscape. Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 24 The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, maintained by data provider Alternative, currently sits at 24. This represents a marginal one-point increase from the previous day’s reading. However, the index remains deep within its ‘extreme fear’ band, which encompasses scores from 0 to 25. The tool operates on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 signifies maximum fear and 100 indicates maximum greed. It synthesizes data from six core components to generate its daily score. For instance, market volatility and trading volume/momentum each contribute 25% to the final calculation. Meanwhile, social media sentiment and survey data each account for 15%. Finally, Bitcoin’s dominance share of the total crypto market cap and trends in Google search interest for ‘Bitcoin’ each make up 10% of the index. This multi-faceted methodology aims to move beyond pure price action. It captures the emotional and behavioral drivers that often precede major market movements. The current score of 24, therefore, signals more than just falling prices. It reflects high volatility, potentially declining trading volumes, negative social media chatter, and reduced mainstream search interest. Historically, prolonged periods in ‘extreme fear’ have often preceded significant market bottoms, though this pattern is not a guaranteed predictor. Market analysts consistently monitor this divergence between price and sentiment for potential turning points. Historical Context and Market Sentiment Analysis Placing the current reading of 24 into a historical framework reveals its significance. The index has experienced dramatic swings since its inception. For example, it peaked near 95 during the bull market euphoria of late 2021. Conversely, it plummeted to single digits during major crises like the COVID-19 market crash of March 2020 and the collapse of the Terra-Luna ecosystem in May 2022. The present ‘extreme fear’ reading, while concerning, is not unprecedented. It suggests a market environment similar to other major corrective phases in cryptocurrency history. Several concurrent factors typically contribute to such a low sentiment reading. Firstly, increased price volatility, especially sharp downward movements, directly impacts the index’s calculation. Secondly, a decline in spot trading volume can indicate a lack of buyer conviction. Thirdly, negative sentiment on platforms like Twitter and Reddit amplifies the fear narrative. Furthermore, a rising Bitcoin dominance rate often occurs during risk-off periods as capital flees from altcoins to the perceived relative safety of Bitcoin. The table below illustrates typical index ranges and their common market interpretations: Index Range Sentiment Label Common Market Characteristics 0-25 Extreme Fear High volatility, panic selling, negative news cycle. 26-46 Fear Cautious trading, consolidation, uncertainty. 47-53 Neutral Balanced momentum, low directional conviction. 54-74 Greed Increasing FOMO, strong bullish trends. 75-100 Extreme Greed Speculative frenzy, potential market top. Expert Perspectives on Prolonged Fear Financial behavioral analysts often reference the Fear & Greed Index as a contrarian indicator. Dr. Elara Vance, a behavioral economist specializing in digital assets, notes, ‘Sustained periods of extreme fear, like the current 24 reading, frequently create conditions for value accumulation. However, investors must distinguish between systemic fear driven by structural issues and cyclical fear within a healthy market correction. The index’s components help with that analysis.’ Meanwhile, veteran traders caution against using the index in isolation. They emphasize combining sentiment data with on-chain analytics, such as exchange flow data and holder composition, to form a more complete picture. The current environment suggests a market dominated by short-term speculators exiting, while long-term holders may be accumulating, a classic sign of a fear phase. The Mechanics and Impact of Market Sentiment The calculation of the index relies on verifiable, real-time data streams. The 25% weight given to volatility compares current Bitcoin price swings to historical averages. Similarly, the 25% market volume/momentum component analyzes trading volume and the strength of recent price movements. The social media analysis scans posts for sentiment and volume, while surveys provide a direct pulse of community outlook. The 10% weight for Bitcoin dominance measures its market share relative to all other cryptocurrencies. Finally, Google Trends data for ‘Bitcoin’ searches indicates mainstream attention levels. A low score across most of these metrics, as seen now, creates a reinforcing loop of negative sentiment that can suppress prices independently of fundamental news. This sentiment impacts market behavior in tangible ways. For instance, developers may see reduced engagement on their platforms. Additionally, project funding rounds can become more challenging. Retail investors often delay entry plans during such phases. Conversely, institutional players with longer time horizons may view this as a strategic accumulation window. The market’s structure itself can change, with derivatives markets seeing shifts in funding rates and open interest. Therefore, the index acts as a barometer for the overall health and risk appetite within the crypto ecosystem, influencing decisions far beyond simple buy or sell orders. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 24 offers a clear, data-driven signal that investor sentiment remains severely negative, categorizing the market in a state of extreme fear. This analysis stems from a composite of volatility, volume, social data, and search trends. While historically such depths of fear have sometimes marked cyclical lows, they also reflect real market stress and risk aversion. Navigating this environment requires a focus on fundamentals, robust risk management, and an understanding that market sentiment is a powerful, yet fleeting, force. Monitoring the index’s trajectory from this extreme fear zone will provide critical clues about the market’s next psychological phase. FAQs Q1: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 24 mean? A score of 24 places the market sentiment firmly in the ‘Extreme Fear’ category (0-25). This indicates high levels of investor anxiety, typically accompanied by elevated volatility, negative social media sentiment, and potential panic selling. Q2: How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index calculated? The index is calculated using six factors: volatility (25%), market volume/momentum (25%), social media sentiment (15%), surveys (15%), Bitcoin’s market dominance (10%), and Google search trends for ‘Bitcoin’ (10%). Q3: Is extreme fear a good time to buy cryptocurrency? Historically, prolonged periods of extreme fear have sometimes preceded market recoveries, leading some to view them as potential buying opportunities for long-term investors. However, it is not a timing tool and should be used alongside fundamental and technical analysis. Q4: How often does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index update? The index is typically updated once per day, reflecting a composite of data from the previous 24-hour period. Q5: Has the index been lower than 24 before? Yes. The index has fallen into single digits during major market crises, such as the March 2020 COVID-19 crash and the May 2022 Terra-Luna collapse, indicating even more severe fear than the current level.

In a Monday post on X, Alex Smirnov, founder of bridge provider deBridge, confirmed there would be “no rollback” and no reorganization of the blockchain under the updated recovery plan. Flow also released a technical implementation plan, noting that accounts impacted by the exploit have been temporarily restricted and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) operations are currently read-only as part of phase one. “There will be no chain reorganization,” said Flow. “All legitimate transactions that occurred prior to the halt remain valid and will not require resubmission or reconciliation.” The implementation plan initially faced pushback from many users due to concerns about the network’s decentralization and security. According to Smirnov, the plan, which included a rollback of the Flow chain, was a “rushed decision” that could trigger “financial damage far beyond the impact of the original exploit. FLOW plummets as exploit shakes market confidence The exploit was carried out on December 27, when an adversary exploited a flaw in Flow’s execution layer and siphoned approximately $3.9 million in assets from the network via multiple cross-chain bridges, before the validators launched measures to stop the incident. The breach, however, did affect their trust and confidence in the security and governance of the network, the Foundation and its forensic partner, FindLabs, said, adding that existing user balances were not accessed. Sentiment in the markets shifted instantly in response to the incident. The network’s native token, FLOW, slumped as the exploit and proposed recovery plan turned headlines. The price of the token plummeted by over 50% on a single day, briefly dipping to new lows of around $0.079 on platforms like Binance, before stabilizing to some extent later, according to market data. The token has underperformed wider market gains, even as other assets, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, clawed back ground. At a time when Bitcoin climbed above $90,000, and Ethereum rebounded past $3,000, respectively, FLOW continued to lag, highlighting the persistent fear of investors. Flow opts for phased restart after controversial rollback proposal Initially, the Foundation considered rolling back the blockchain to a checkpoint before the exploit, a controversial move that would have erased transactions submitted during a specific timeframe and required users to resubmit their activity. That rollback idea sparked fierce backlash from validators, bridge operators, developers, and other ecosystem participants. Implementation of the remediation plan could take several days, according to the timeline provided by Flow. Following Phase One, the blockchain is expected to relaunch its non-EVM chain, Cadence, and resume operations between the bridge and exchange. “[Flow’s] response required genuine collaboration between parties under high stress,” said Find Labs, the team behind Flow block explorer Flowscan, in a Monday X post. “It takes serious stewardship to be responsive to ecosystem feedback, yet be ready to make the hard choices at the right time.” Analysts sa y that wh ile the incident underscores challenges facing Layer‑1 networks in managing breaches without compromising decentralization, the revised plan may help restore confidence by preserving valid transactions and avoiding disruptive chain reorganizations.

This critical metric, published by the leading data aggregator CoinMarketCap, serves as a barometer for market sentiment and capital rotation. Consequently, it provides essential insights for portfolio strategy and risk assessment. The index’s stagnation suggests a cautious investor environment, where capital largely favors the perceived safety of Bitcoin over the higher-risk, higher-reward potential of alternative cryptocurrencies. Decoding the Altcoin Season Index The Altcoin Season Index offers a quantitative snapshot of market dynamics. Specifically, CoinMarketCap calculates this figure by analyzing the 90-day price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. However, the calculation deliberately excludes stablecoins and wrapped assets to focus purely on speculative performance. The core mechanism involves a direct comparison against Bitcoin’s returns over the same period. An official “altcoin season” is only declared when at least 75% of these top assets outperform Bitcoin, which would push the index score above 75. Therefore, the current score of 19 sits far from this threshold, underscoring Bitcoin’s relative strength. Calculation Method: Compares 90-day performance of top 100 coins (ex-stablecoins) vs. Bitcoin. Season Threshold: A score above 75 signals the start of an altcoin season. Current Reading: A score of 19 reflects strong Bitcoin dominance and weak altcoin momentum. Historical Context and Market Cycles Understanding the index’s current position requires examining past cryptocurrency cycles. Historically, bull markets often begin with Bitcoin leading the charge, followed by capital flowing into large-capitalization altcoins, and finally into smaller-cap projects. The index effectively tracks this capital rotation. For instance, during the 2021 bull run, the index repeatedly surged above 75, confirming powerful altcoin seasons. In contrast, prolonged periods below 25, like the present, typically align with bear markets or consolidation phases where investors seek refuge in Bitcoin. This pattern highlights the index’s utility as a cyclical indicator rather than a short-term trading signal. Expert Analysis on the Current Stalemate Market analysts point to several macroeconomic and sector-specific factors explaining the index’s low reading. Firstly, anticipation of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) flows and the upcoming Bitcoin halving event in 2024 have concentrated attention and institutional capital on Bitcoin. Secondly, regulatory uncertainty surrounding many altcoin projects has increased perceived risk. Furthermore, data from blockchain analytics firms shows that capital inflows into decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) ecosystems—key drivers of past altcoin seasons—have plateaued. This confluence of factors creates a holding pattern, reflected precisely in the static index value of 19. The Impact on Trader and Investor Strategies The steady index reading directly influences market participant behavior. For conservative investors, a low index reinforces a strategy of overweighting Bitcoin in portfolios. Conversely, venture capital and dedicated altcoin funds may view this as an accumulation phase, seeking undervalued projects before a potential rotation. Retail traders often use the index as a contrarian indicator; however, experts caution against this alone. They recommend combining the index with on-chain data, such as Bitcoin dominance charts and exchange flow metrics, for a more comprehensive view. The table below summarizes typical market phases correlated with index ranges. Index Range Market Phase Typical Characteristic 0-25 Bitcoin Dominance Capital flight to safety; altcoin weakness. 26-74 Transition / Neutral Mixed performance; capital begins testing altcoins. 75-100 Altcoin Season Widespread altcoin outperformance; high risk appetite. Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index holding at 19 provides a clear, data-driven message about the current cryptocurrency market structure. It confirms a period of consolidation and Bitcoin-centric investment. While not predictive of an immediate shift, this metric is a vital tool for gauging market sentiment and the relative strength of alternative cryptocurrencies. Monitoring for a sustained move above the 25-30 level will be crucial for signals of changing dynamics. For now, the index underscores a market in waiting, where patience and disciplined analysis remain paramount for all participants. FAQs Q1: What does an Altcoin Season Index score of 19 mean? It indicates that Bitcoin is significantly outperforming the majority of top altcoins over the past 90 days. The market is far from meeting the 75% threshold required to declare an “altcoin season.” Q2: Who calculates the Altcoin Season Index and how often is it updated? CoinMarketCap calculates and publishes the index. It is typically updated daily, tracking the rolling 90-day performance window. Q3: Can the index predict the start of an altcoin bull run? While not a perfect predictor, a sustained rise above 50 often precedes or coincides with periods where altcoins collectively begin to outperform Bitcoin, signaling shifting market momentum. Q4: Why are stablecoins excluded from the index calculation? Stablecoins are pegged to fiat currencies and designed not to fluctuate in price. Including them would distort the performance comparison against volatile assets like Bitcoin and other altcoins. Q5: Should I only invest in Bitcoin when the index is low? Not necessarily. The index is one tool among many. A low index may present accumulation opportunities in fundamentally strong altcoins for long-term investors, though it does signal higher relative risk in the short term.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $2.98 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $5.02. Tezos started strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.4909 Market cap $528.81M Trading volume (24-hour) $19.41M Circulating supply 1.07B XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3505 on December 7, 2018 24-hour high $0.5091 24-hour low $0.4916 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 4.54% (Medium) 50-day SMA $0.5032 14-Day RSI 56.01 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 24 (Extreme Fear) Green days 12/30 (40%) 200-day SMA $0.6661 Tezos price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: Tezos is digesting gains just under $0.50 after a strong breakout. Momentum is cooling but not broken, with $0.47–$0.48 acting as the key support zone. A daily close above $0.50 would be the trigger for renewed upside. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart On the 1-day timeframe as of Dec 30, 2025, Tezos trades around $0.49, consolidating just below the upper Bollinger Band near $0.51–$0.52 after a strong expansion move from the $0.45–$0.46 base. The price has reclaimed the mid-band around $0.47, which now acts as the first dynamic support and aligns with the prior consolidation zone. XTZUSDT 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView Additionally, the MACD has flipped positive, accompanied by widening histogram bars, confirming that bullish momentum remains present. Although the last candles exhibit smaller bodies, this suggests short-term exhaustion rather than a reversal. OBV remains elevated, suggesting the rally was backed by genuine participation. However, it’s also slightly flat, which indicates that the market is deciding whether it has sufficient strength for continuation. A clean daily close above $0.50 would reopen upside toward $0.52, while failure to hold $0.47 risks a deeper pullback toward $0.44–$0.45. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart On the 4-hour chart, price has rolled over from the $0.51 local high and is now compressing around $0.49, sitting on the faster Alligator averages while still above the longer-term baseline near $0.48. This structure reflects a healthy retracement within an uptrend rather than an outright breakdown. XTZUSDT 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView The CMF remains positive, showing capital inflows have not meaningfully reversed, but the Balance of Power slipping slightly negative signals sellers are gaining short-term control. As long as $0.48 holds, the structure favors sideways to higher resolution. If XTZ loses this level, it would likely accelerate a move toward $0.46, where buyers previously stepped in aggressively. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.5745 SELL SMA 5 $0.5414 SELL SMA 10 $0.5122 SELL SMA 21 $0.4991 SELL SMA 50 $0.5032 SELL SMA 100 $0.5684 SELL SMA 200 $0.6661 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.4824 BUY EMA 5 $0.5056 SELL EMA 10 $0.5608 SELL EMA 21 $0.6404 SELL EMA 50 $0.7047 SELL EMA 100 $0.7076 SELL EMA 200 $0.7280 SELL What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? Based on both charts, XTZ appears more likely to consolidate briefly before attempting another push higher, provided the $0.47–$0.48 range continues to hold. A failure there would shift focus back to deeper support rather than immediate continuation. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs, so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $1.5 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications.

Buyers returned in September, driving the price to $0.7015, and momentum carried into November with a peak of $1.856. The rally extended to December, when XTZ reached $1.909 before corrections brought the year-end close to $1.286.

It can be seen that a significant number of XRP investors have been forced to sell their holdings at a loss rather than waiting for it to recover. Transaction volumes on the XRP network are also down. The cryptocurrency must break above $2.10 to avoid having a negative year, but there is currently an underlying trend against it. At the same time, money is flowing out from larger, inactive assets to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . This is a project that is considered to be the cheap cryptocurrency currently available, with expected growth of around 55x from its presale price. Weakness of XRP The actions of the participants in the Ripple community have changed. Typically, serious investors have held on to their investments even in the face of falling prices, but now they have started selling, but at a loss, and this is a sign of a higher degree of risk aversion. Although XRP had positive periods in 2023 and another positive period in 2024, the year 2025 seems to present a very different scenario. There is a definite decrease in the community activity, which shows a lack of interaction in the network. Moreover, the current price needs to stay above $1.85 to prevent a possible movement to the level of $1.70. A breakout above the levels of $1.94 and then above $2.00 is a condition for the start of a recovery. Mutuum Finance Presale: Final Chance at a Low Price Outflow from slower assets has been beneficial in DeFi projects with concrete roadmaps. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has become one of the best options by involving an open and multi-phased presales process. It has already raised $19.5 million with over 18,600 participants. MUTM currently find ourselves in Phase 6, with tokens retailing at $0.035 every one. This particular phase is 99% sold out. This marks the final chance to invest at this rate before increasing tokens to $0.040 in Phase 7. At $0.06 as the initial offering price, the initial investors will be able to make approximately 420% profit. Two Way Lending Framework Mutuum Finance stands out for its dual approach to lending. The first aspect uses common pools for top cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, while the second aspect allows peer-to-peer trading for meme coins. It gives users as much flexibility as possible. Users are issued distinct tokens that gather interest as time goes by. The system also uses its own fees to buy back the MUTM tokens, ensuring a stable market for them. This kind of system makes it a very safe investment option for individuals looking for growth based on real usage rather than hyped benefits. Strong Security Measures in Place to Encourage Confidence However, security does not take a back seat. Mutuum Finance is in the process of having its codes audited by leading security auditors Halborn. To add to that, they have a bug bounty program worth $50,000. These factors are essential as Mutuum Finance wishes to attract genuine investors, who have to see robust safety measures in place before opting to invest in any new venture. It is yet another factor that makes Mutuum Finance an attractive venture for risk-averse investors to invest in the Defi crypto world. Increased Institutional Investment As XRP is performing poorly and activity is dwindling, smart investors are diversifying their portfolios to other projects that have strong bases. Mutuum Finance presents a clear and defined growth prospect with their presale phase ongoing. The time frame to invest at a price of $0.035 is quickly closing down.

In a post on X, Farina described this threshold as essential for meaningful exposure to potential future price growth. Establishing a Meaningful Position Farina’s recommendation focuses on scale and flexibility. At current prices just below $2 per XRP , holding 1,000 tokens represents an investment of roughly $2,000. While modest in absolute terms, Farina argues that this position provides enough leverage to take partial profits while maintaining exposure to additional gains as XRP’s market value rises. He maintains that smaller holdings may limit the investor’s capacity to benefit significantly from price appreciation. Community Trends Reinforce the Benchmark Data on wallet distribution lends weight to Farina’s argument. Among the 7.44 million XRP wallets in existence, only a small fraction hold more than 1,000 tokens. For reference, wallets holding between 500 and 1,000 XRP number 256,435, while those with 500 or fewer XRP exceed six million. This disparity highlights a concentration of larger positions within a limited group of holders. As XRP’s price increases, the cost of acquiring 1,000 tokens rises correspondingly. In October 2024, an investor could accumulate 1,000 XRP for under $500, whereas today the same holding approaches $2,000. The combination of rising prices and concentrated holdings has contributed to the perception of 1,000 XRP as a strategic milestone. Future Price Projections Support the Recommendation Farina’s guidance is tied to expectations for XRP’s long-term price trajectory. Advocates suggest that if XRP reaches $10 to $20, a 1,000-XRP position could be valued at $10,000 to $20,000. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 More aggressive projections, extending to triple-digit valuations, would substantially increase the financial impact, with a 1,000-XRP holding reaching hundreds of thousands of dollars at $100 per coin. Farina views early accumulation as a way to position for potential high-growth scenarios, including speculative multi-digit price targets over an extended period. Despite this bullish outlook, some analysts caution that reaching higher XRP price targets depends on adoption and market dynamics that may take years to materialize. Critics also highlight the potential for investors to take profits at lower levels rather than waiting for extreme valuations. Farina acknowledges these risks but frames his recommendation as a strategic approach for those willing to hold and wait for the potential expansion of XRP’s role in financial systems. Ultimately, Farina positions holding at least 1,000 XRP as a deliberate strategy to gain meaningful exposure while maintaining flexibility in managing positions over time. His advice underscores a conviction in XRP’s long-term potential, suggesting that investors who can commit to this threshold may be better positioned to capture future gains in the evolving crypto landscape.

Times Square Display Reveals 589 Bulbs According to behind-the-scenes footage and local broadcast clips, the four numerals installed above One Times Square were outfitted with a total of 589 energy-efficient LED bulbs. The figures were highlighted in video posts shared by local outlets and social feeds covering New Year preparations. The numerals stand about seven feet tall and were shown being tested in place ahead of midnight. XRP Community Notes The Coincidence Reports have disclosed that XRP holders quickly spotted the 589 count and began sharing screenshots, short clips, and commentary across social platforms. One widely viewed post asked, “589 lights for 2026 in NYC. What are the chances,” and that message was amplified by several XRP-focused accounts. The number 589 is a recurring motif in XRP social circles, and that background fed the fast spread of the content. https://t.co/b1n6aCX5Od — Caroline D. Pham (@CarolineDPham) December 28, 2025 A High-Profile Social Reaction Based on posts tracked by crypto outlets, Caroline Pham — who served as Acting Chair of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission and is now MoonPay’s chief legal officer — reacted to the Times Square footage with rocket emojis on social media. She did not make a public statement linking the display to XRP, but her reaction was noted by community members and reported by crypto news sites. Guess how many LED bulbs the 2026 New Year’s Eve sign has in Times Square this year… pic.twitter.com/dVqpoJPM5n — NotFinancialAdvice.Crypto (@NFAdotcrypto) December 27, 2025 What This Means For Markets And Messaging This moment appears to be driven by community interest rather than by any formal marketing tie between Times Square organizers and crypto firms. Major news coverage of the New Year setup focused on the event logistics and lighting; mainstream outlets did not report any official endorsement or link to XRP. The social attention did, however, generate a spike in shares and comments within crypto circles, as users posted memes, videos, and theories. How Observers Are Framing It Many posts framed the coincidence as playful symbolism rather than a signal with financial meaning. Analysts and journalists who follow crypto culture warn readers that such coincidences should not be treated as financial guidance. Based on the coverage so far, the item is best read as social media noise that reflects how online communities find patterns and share them rapidly. No Official Endorsement From Organizers Reports have made clear that Times Square event teams and broadcast partners did not announce any connection to XRP or other tokens. The 589 LED total was presented as a production detail for viewers and photographers, not as a coded message. That separation between event facts and online interpretation is central to how this story has played out.

Repeated attempts to reclaim higher ground have been rejected, reinforcing a cautious outlook among traders. As broader market sentiment remains fragile, a growing number of analysts are warning that LINK could face additional downside before a meaningful recovery takes shape. Related Reading: Trust Wallet Exploit Drains $7M: Hundreds Of Users Affected Despite the weak price action, on-chain data tells a more nuanced story. Analyst at CryptoQuant, known as CryptoOnchain, reports that recent market data reveals a compelling convergence between on-chain metrics and technical structure, pointing to growing accumulation activity at current levels. While price remains compressed, underlying behavior suggests that larger market participants may be positioning quietly rather than exiting. This divergence between declining price and improving on-chain signals is often observed during transitional phases of the market, when selling pressure begins to fade, but confidence has not yet returned. According to CryptoOnchain, indicators tracking exchange flows and holder behavior show signs of significant buying interest emerging beneath the surface, even as LINK struggles to attract speculative demand. Exchange Outflows and Long-Term Support Point to Accumulation The analysis highlights a notable shift in Chainlink’s on-chain and technical dynamics, starting with exchange netflows. According to the Binance Altcoins Token Netflow 7-day chart, Chainlink has seen a substantial withdrawal from Binance over the past week, with total outflows approaching $50 million. This magnitude stands out when compared with other large-cap altcoins such as Uniswap (UNI) or The Sandbox (SAND), which have not experienced similar capital movements over the same period. In on-chain analysis, large and sustained exchange outflows are commonly interpreted as a reduction in immediate selling pressure. Rather than preparing to sell, holders appear to be moving LINK into self-custody or long-term storage, signaling a shift toward holding behavior. This type of activity is often associated with accumulation phases, particularly when it occurs during periods of weak price action. At the same time, the technical structure reinforces the on-chain signal. The LINK/USDT daily chart shows price resting directly on a long-term bullish trendline that has acted as dynamic support since 2020. Historically, this level has consistently attracted demand and limited deeper drawdowns during corrective phases. The convergence of heavy exchange outflows and a retest of major historical support sends a strong signal of smart money accumulation. It suggests that larger investors view current levels as a strategic entry zone. Defending this support remains critical, as holding it would preserve Chainlink’s long-term bullish structure and increase the probability of a future trend reversal. Related Reading: Why $100,000 Is Bitcoin’s Most Important Resistance Level LINK Testing Structural Demand Chainlink (LINK) continues to trade under pressure, with price hovering around the $12.50 level on the 3-day chart after an extended corrective phase. The structure shows a clear loss of bullish momentum following repeated rejections from the $20–$25 region earlier in the cycle. Since that peak, LINK has established a sequence of lower highs, confirming a medium-term downtrend that remains intact. From a technical perspective, LINK is currently trading below its short- and medium-term moving averages, which have rolled over and are now acting as dynamic resistance. The 50-period moving average sits well above the current price, reinforcing the idea that recent rebounds have been corrective rather than impulsive. The longer-term moving average, however, is flattening near current levels, suggesting that selling pressure may be slowing as price approaches a historically important zone. Related Reading: Ethereum Bearish Structure Meets Bullish Supply Signal – What Happens Next The $12–$13 range stands out as a key support area. This level has acted as a pivot multiple times over the past two years, repeatedly attracting demand during periods of broader market weakness. The fact that LINK is consolidating rather than breaking down aggressively suggests that sellers are losing momentum. Volume behavior supports this view. While sell-offs earlier in the year were accompanied by sharp volume spikes, recent price action shows reduced participation, indicating distribution may be giving way to stabilization. For LINK to signal a meaningful trend reversal, bulls must reclaim the $15–$16 zone.

News regarding LaMothe’s retirement was initially revealed by the agency, which cited her statement dated Monday, December 29, in which she noted, “The work has been very challenging yet rewarding, and I have learned a lot from the dedicated people who work hard every day for this important mission.” The development marks the end of a 24‑year tenure during which she held multiple senior roles, most recently serving as Deputy Director for Disclosure Operations. She also acted as the division’s leader until James Moloney was appointed Director on September 30, 2025. LaMothe presents herself as a strong supporter of crypto Over the past year, LaMothe has been responsible for several key staff statements , particularly regarding the crypto industry. An example of these statements includes one that declared meme coins are not categorized as securities, and another that presented the commission’s perspective on staking . Moreover, apart from her role in the crypto industry, sources acknowledged that LaMothe took the initiative to guide policy recommendations for firms submitting draft registration statements, in addition to other responsibilities. Her work helped crystallize regulatory views on whether certain digital assets should be treated as securities and clarified the SEC’s stance on hot‑button issues like memecoins and staking activities Notably, SEC officials joined the agency’s Division of Corporation Finance in 2002. At this time, LaMothe assumed several senior roles. Before joining this team, she worked in the private sector, is a licensed certified public accountant, and secured her bachelor’s degree in accounting from Hampton University. With these exemplary achievements, the regulatory watchdog counts LaMothe’s retirement as a significant loss to the commission. It is worth noting that her retirement news comes at a time when the agency starts its second year of embracing a new focus centered on a more supportive approach towards the crypto ecosystem. Meanwhile, reports alleged that since the start of US President Donald Trump’s tenure in office and later under the leadership of a new chair, the SEC has given a green light to listing standards for several crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This approval marked a significant milestone in the cryptocurrency industry, as it enabled several firms to introduce ETFs that can track assets such as DOGE , SOL, and XRP. Another key achievement the industry witnessed was the SEC’s decision to withdraw various enforcement cases raised against prominent crypto companies. The agency also initiated “Project Crypto” to revise the commission’s regulations concerning digital assets. The SEC encounters several retirements this year The SEC publicly stated that Nekia Hackworth Jones, who assumed two crucial roles in the SEC’s Division of Enforcement, namely Deputy Director of the Division of Enforcement (Southeast) and, before that, Regional Director of the Atlanta Regional Office, completed her tenure in December of this year. In a statement, Jones noted that, “As both Atlanta Regional Director and Deputy Director overseeing the Home Office along with the Atlanta and Miami regional offices, I have witnessed my colleagues at this agency show an unwavering dedication to protecting investors, excellent judgment in fulfilling our mission, and impressive knowledge in all areas of the securities industry.” Interestingly, the agency had signaled a major staff cut earlier this year. At this particular moment, several workers had decided to accept voluntary buyouts and resignations after the Trump administration instructed a significant restructuring of the federal workforce. Sources familiar with the situation indicated that approximately 500 to 700 workers on the SEC’s team were expected to be laid off. A large percentage of the impacted employees came from the agency’s enforcement, examination, and legal divisions. Get seen where it counts.

The verification window, which remains open until January 3 at 6:00 a.m. UTC, represents the first formal step in what industry analysts describe as one of the most anticipated token distributions in the ZK space for early 2025. This announcement follows months of speculation about how Brevis would reward its early adopters and community contributors who have tested the platform’s capabilities in real-world applications. BREV Token Airdrop Implements Advanced Sybil Resistance Measures Brevis has implemented what it describes as a “strong Sybil filter” to ensure fair distribution of BREV tokens to genuine community members. According to blockchain security experts, Sybil attacks—where malicious actors create multiple fake identities—have plagued numerous airdrop programs in recent years, often diluting rewards intended for legitimate users. The Brevis approach requires participants to verify eligibility through three distinct channels: their cryptocurrency wallet, X (formerly Twitter) account, and Discord membership. This multi-layered verification strategy represents a sophisticated attempt to distinguish authentic community engagement from artificial participation. Furthermore, the platform has established strict linkage rules to prevent gaming of the system. Each claim address can connect to only one X or Discord account, and previously qualified wallets cannot associate with different social media profiles for additional claims. These measures reflect lessons learned from previous high-profile airdrops that faced criticism for inadequate filtering. Industry data from 2024 shows that projects implementing multi-factor verification experienced 40% fewer complaints about unfair distribution compared to those using single verification methods. Zero-Knowledge Verification Platform Expands Ecosystem Brevis operates as a zero-knowledge based verification computing platform, a specialized segment of blockchain infrastructure that has gained substantial traction since 2023. Zero-knowledge proofs allow one party to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself. This technology has become increasingly important for blockchain scalability and privacy applications. The BREV token will likely serve as the native utility token within this ecosystem, potentially governing protocol decisions, staking mechanisms, and fee structures. The timing of this airdrop coincides with broader industry trends toward more sophisticated token distribution models. Unlike early cryptocurrency airdrops that often rewarded simple wallet creation, modern distributions increasingly consider factors like: Platform engagement duration and frequency Technical contributions to protocol development Community participation in governance discussions Educational content creation about the technology While Brevis has not yet disclosed specific allocation criteria or claim schedules, the company’s emphasis on Sybil resistance suggests a data-driven approach to reward distribution. This methodology aligns with recommendations from the Ethereum Foundation’s research division, which has published extensively on fair launch mechanisms for decentralized protocols. Technical Implementation and Industry Context The verification computing market that Brevis addresses has seen remarkable growth, with industry analysts projecting the sector to reach $12.8 billion by 2026. Zero-knowledge technology, once considered primarily academic, now powers major Layer 2 scaling solutions and privacy-preserving applications across multiple blockchain networks. Brevis distinguishes itself by focusing specifically on verification computation—a process that allows smart contracts to trustlessly access and verify data from any blockchain. This capability addresses a fundamental challenge in blockchain interoperability: how can one chain verify events that occurred on another chain without relying on centralized intermediaries? The Brevis solution uses zkSNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge) to generate cryptographic proofs that can be efficiently verified on-chain. This technical approach has attracted attention from enterprise blockchain developers and decentralized application teams seeking to build cross-chain functionality. The airdrop announcement follows a pattern established by other infrastructure projects that have successfully distributed tokens to bootstrap community governance. Historical data from similar technical projects shows that well-executed airdrops can increase protocol usage by 300-500% in the months following distribution, provided the tokenomics align with long-term utility rather than speculative trading. Verification Process Requirements and Timeline Community members must complete the eligibility verification process before the January 3 deadline to participate in the BREV token distribution. The verification interface, accessible through the Brevis official channels, requires users to connect their Web3 wallet (likely MetaMask, WalletConnect, or similar), authenticate their X account through OAuth protocols, and verify Discord membership through specialized bots. This integrated approach creates an audit trail that the Brevis team can analyze to detect coordinated Sybil attacks while preserving user privacy through cryptographic techniques. The verification period of approximately two weeks provides sufficient time for genuine community members to complete the process while limiting opportunities for last-minute manipulation. This timeframe aligns with industry best practices identified in a 2024 Stanford Blockchain Research paper on optimal airdrop design. The paper’s authors noted that verification windows shorter than one week disproportionately exclude users in time zones with limited overlap with announcement times, while windows longer than three weeks increase Sybil attack surface area. Once the verification window closes, Brevis will analyze the collected data to finalize eligibility determinations. The company has indicated that specific allocation details and claim schedules will follow at a later date, suggesting a phased approach to distribution that may incorporate additional verification steps or community feedback mechanisms. This cautious methodology reflects growing regulatory scrutiny of token distributions worldwide, particularly regarding securities classification and anti-money laundering compliance. Broader Implications for Blockchain Governance The Brevis airdrop represents more than just token distribution—it serves as an initial experiment in decentralized governance for the verification computing platform. By distributing tokens to engaged community members, Brevis follows the increasingly standard practice of transitioning protocol control from core developers to a broader stakeholder community. This transition, often called “progressive decentralization,” has become a hallmark of mature blockchain projects seeking sustainable, long-term development paths. Industry observers will closely monitor how BREV token holders exercise governance rights once the distribution completes. Previous infrastructure projects have demonstrated that token-based governance works best when combined with: Clear documentation of protocol upgrade processes Transparent treasury management procedures Educational resources for informed voting Mechanisms to prevent whale dominance in decision-making The success of this governance model will influence not only Brevis’s future development but also similar projects in the zero-knowledge and broader blockchain infrastructure space. As regulatory frameworks for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) continue to evolve worldwide, the Brevis approach may provide valuable case study data for policymakers and industry participants alike. Conclusion The launch of the Brevis BREV token airdrop eligibility checker represents a carefully planned step in the platform’s evolution from technical project to community-governed ecosystem. By implementing robust Sybil resistance measures and multi-factor verification, Brevis addresses common criticisms of previous token distributions while preparing for meaningful decentralized governance. The zero-knowledge verification computing sector continues to demonstrate its critical importance to blockchain scalability and interoperability, with Brevis positioned as a significant contributor to this technological advancement. As the January 3 verification deadline approaches, community members should complete the eligibility process promptly while awaiting further details about allocation mechanisms and claim procedures for this anticipated BREV token distribution. FAQs Q1: What is the deadline to check Brevis airdrop eligibility? The eligibility checker remains open until 6:00 a.m. UTC on January 3, 2025. Participants must complete verification before this deadline to potentially qualify for BREV token distribution. Q2: What verification methods does Brevis use for the airdrop? Brevis requires three-point verification: connection of a cryptocurrency wallet, authentication of an X (Twitter) account, and verification of Discord membership. This multi-factor approach helps prevent Sybil attacks. Q3: When will Brevis release specific allocation amounts? The platform has stated that detailed information about airdrop allocations and claim schedules will be announced at a later date, following analysis of verification data and completion of the eligibility period. Q4: Can I use the same wallet for multiple claims? No. Brevis specifies that each claim address can link to only one X or Discord account, and qualified wallets cannot be reused for claims tied to different social media accounts. Q5: What is zero-knowledge verification computing? Zero-knowledge verification computing allows blockchain applications to trustlessly verify data and computations from other chains using cryptographic proofs that don’t reveal underlying information, enabling secure cross-chain interoperability and scalability.

This anticipated move represents a significant evolution in mainstream digital asset adoption, potentially transforming how billions of users interact with blockchain technology. The prediction comes amid growing institutional interest in cryptocurrency infrastructure and follows years of gradual corporate blockchain experimentation. Crypto Wallets: The Next Frontier for Technology Giants Technology analysts have monitored increasing corporate blockchain activity throughout 2024. Consequently, Haseeb Qureshi’s prediction aligns with observable industry trends. Major technology firms possess several strategic advantages for entering the cryptocurrency wallet market. These companies already manage extensive user networks, maintain robust security infrastructure, and control popular mobile and desktop platforms. Furthermore, they have developed sophisticated payment systems that could integrate with cryptocurrency functionality. Several technology corporations have already explored blockchain-related projects. For instance, Meta previously developed the Diem cryptocurrency project before regulatory challenges prompted its discontinuation. Similarly, Google Cloud has established blockchain node hosting services for Web3 developers. Apple has filed numerous patents related to blockchain technology and digital asset management systems. These developments suggest that major technology firms have maintained ongoing cryptocurrency research despite public caution. Corporate Blockchain Development Accelerates Fortune 100 companies appear increasingly likely to develop proprietary blockchain networks, particularly within financial services and fintech sectors. According to Qureshi’s analysis, these organizations will probably build private chains that connect to public blockchains. This hybrid approach allows corporations to maintain control over sensitive data while leveraging public blockchain security and interoperability. Platforms like Avalanche (AVAX) and Optimism (OP) reportedly serve as foundation technologies for these corporate blockchain projects. Several financial institutions have already announced blockchain initiatives. JPMorgan developed the Onyx Digital Assets platform for wholesale payment transactions. Bank of America has patented numerous blockchain solutions for enterprise clients. Goldman Sachs has explored cryptocurrency custody services and blockchain-based settlement systems. IBM has implemented blockchain solutions across supply chain management, food safety, and cross-border payments. These developments demonstrate growing corporate blockchain adoption beyond speculative cryptocurrency trading. Strategic Implications for Technology Ecosystems Technology corporations face strategic decisions regarding cryptocurrency wallet implementation. Companies might develop proprietary wallet solutions integrated with existing ecosystems. Alternatively, they could acquire established cryptocurrency wallet providers to accelerate market entry. Both approaches present distinct advantages and challenges. Internal development allows tighter ecosystem integration but requires significant blockchain expertise. Acquisition provides immediate technology and talent but involves integration complexities. The regulatory environment significantly influences corporate cryptocurrency strategies. Recent cryptocurrency legislation in various jurisdictions has created clearer compliance frameworks. Simultaneously, consumer protection concerns remain paramount for technology firms managing user assets. Security represents another critical consideration, as cryptocurrency wallets require robust protection against sophisticated cyber threats. Technology corporations must balance innovation with risk management when entering cryptocurrency markets.

User experience represents a crucial factor for mainstream cryptocurrency adoption. Technology corporations excel at creating intuitive interfaces for complex technologies. Therefore, their cryptocurrency wallet implementations might significantly improve current user experiences. Simplified key management, integrated security features, and seamless platform integration could address common cryptocurrency usability barriers. These improvements might accelerate cryptocurrency adoption beyond current enthusiast communities. Technical Architecture and Interoperability Challenges Corporate blockchain implementations require careful architectural planning. Private chains must maintain secure connections with public blockchains while protecting proprietary information. Cross-chain communication protocols enable asset transfers between different blockchain networks. However, these systems introduce additional security considerations and potential failure points. Technology teams must implement robust monitoring and maintenance procedures for hybrid blockchain architectures. Interoperability standards continue evolving within blockchain ecosystems. The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance has developed specifications for corporate blockchain implementations. Similarly, the InterWork Alliance has created tokenization standards for business applications. These frameworks help corporations implement compatible blockchain solutions. Nevertheless, technology teams must navigate multiple competing standards and rapidly evolving protocols when building corporate blockchain networks. Conclusion Major technology corporations appear increasingly likely to launch cryptocurrency wallets within the next year, according to Dragonfly Capital’s analysis. This development would represent a significant milestone for mainstream cryptocurrency adoption.

The rapid rate of growth indicates that onchain equities are more than just experimental, with investors and institutions taking them as a serious offshoot of mainstream financial markets. The rally has been sudden since tokenized equities became mainstream this year. September and December were the largest months for market value growth, both times signaling increased demand as a new class of products was released and liquidity across key blockchains improved, according to Token Terminal data. The current stage is quite similar to that of stablecoins in 2020, according to market observers. Back then, stablecoins were still considered niche tools useful to crypto traders. Five years on, they provide the infrastructure for global crypto markets, which now account for a sector valued at approximately $300 billion, bolstering the assertion that tokenized stocks are in their infancy. That’s not the only reason for talk of a new crypto boom, however, and industry insiders are comparing today’s market to the DeFi boom in its early days as well. Institutions accelerate tokenized stock adoption All of this has been driven, for the most part, by the institutions that power the game. Backed Finance itself launched its group of xStocks in September on Ethereum, which includes approximately 60 tokenized stocks. The distribution was coordinated with major cryptocurrency exchange operators, such as Kraken and Bybit, providing a user base for the products from day one. The introduction marked a departure from many similar pilots, favoring approaches that can be scaled more broadly. Volume increased as investors who were already familiar with the public companies being tokenized were able to trade them easily; likewise, the overall market capitalization also rose. The energy continued into December with the announcement that Securitize would enable compliant onchain trading of public equities. Its model will focus on direct shareholding, which has been a concern for the sector for some time, as the link between synthetic exposure and regulation remains uncertain. Ondo Finance is also emerging as a major player. The company appears to be the most probable contender for Solana to choose, as it aims to launch tokenized US stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Solana in early 2026. The move is another sign of growing confidence in high-performance blockchains as potential venues for regulated financial products. Nasdaq and market infrastructure firms increase commitment The clearest sign that long-term commitment was faltering might have been the Nasdaq. The exchange has confirmed that it has submitted documents to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch tokenized stocks on its platform. It will bring blockchain-based shares to one of the world’s largest market infrastructures. Tokenization is one of the company’s most important strategic projects, Matt Savarese, Nasdaq’s Head of Digital Assets Strategy, said in a statement. It is not trying to make the markets “bear new witness” but rather to remake them in a way that appeals to regulators and issuers as well as investors, he added. That being said, Savarese is optimistic that tokenization will become an organic part of the financial system in the future. “We’re not looking at upending the system; we want everyone to come along for that ride and bring tokenization more into the mainstream,” Matt Savarese, Nasdaq’s head of digital assets strategy, said in an interview. As tokenized equities become increasingly accepted by more institutions, exchanges, and regulators, the sector is gaining more reputation. Although still small in comparison to established equity markets, with emergent institutional support and rapid growth, the future for tokenized stocks could resemble that of stablecoins’ rapid rise from a niche product to a core financial infrastructure.

Despite a strong performance for precious metals this year, XRP has struggled since October 2025, reflecting broader weakness across the cryptocurrency market. Silver’s Strong 2025 Performance Silver (XAG) has been one of the top-performing assets globally in 2025, even outpacing gold (XAU) in terms of annual gains. Starting the year at $28.95, silver has surged 174% to $79 per ounce at the time of writing. This growth, combined with its total supply of approximately 1.751 million metric tonnes, has pushed silver’s market capitalization to a record $4.485 trillion. While silver has captured investor attention, XRP has underperformed during the same period, falling from $2.07 at the start of the year to $1.87 at present, a decline of over 12%. XRP as Digital Silver Within the crypto community, XRP has often been referred to as “digital silver,” reflecting its potential for value preservation and transactional utility. Advocates argue that this characterization implies a capacity for substantial growth, drawing parallels with silver’s market trajectory. Jake Molter of Molt Media highlighted that many investors previously overlooked silver, only to rush into the market as prices climbed. He suggested that XRP could experience a similar dynamic if it begins to attract mainstream attention. Market analyst Steph also noted patterns reminiscent of precious metals’ movements, including extended consolidation phases, which may indicate potential for a future uptrend in XRP. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Price Implications of a $4.48 Trillion Market Cap Currently, XRP’s circulating supply stands at 60.57 billion tokens, giving the crypto asset a market capitalization of approximately $111.99 billion. This is down from a peak of $216.69 billion in July 2025, reflecting a loss of over $104 billion. If XRP were to reach a market capitalization equal to silver’s $4.485 trillion, its price per token would rise to roughly $74. This represents a gain of 3,857% from its current level, demonstrating the significant upside potential implied by such a valuation. While the comparison with silver illustrates an extreme upside scenario, it is contingent on widespread adoption, investor interest, and regulatory clarity. XRP’s potential to achieve such a market cap relies on long-term structural growth within the cryptocurrency sector, institutional participation, and expanded use in cross-border payments and settlement systems. The “digital silver” narrative continues to influence both community sentiment and speculative projections. However, analysts caution that while matching silver’s market cap provides a useful framework for estimating potential price ceilings, practical market dynamics may prevent such rapid appreciation. Although XRP’s current market performance lags behind silver’s gains, the comparison highlights the token’s theoretical upside. For investors, the $74 target serves as a reference point for long-term planning, emphasizing the importance of adoption, liquidity, and market confidence in determining XRP’s future valuation.

Bitcoin Is Trading At The Active Investors Mean In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has shared an update on where the major Bitcoin on-chain levels currently stand. There are four pricing models of interest here, the most basic of which is the Realized Price. The Realized Price basically keeps track of the cost basis or acquisition level of the average investor on the BTC network. The spot price trading above this line means that the holders as a whole are in a state of net unrealized profit, while the reverse situation suggests the dominance of loss in the market. Related Reading: XRP Exchange Inflows Spike To End 2025: Will Price Decline Deepen? Below is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in this metric over the last few years. As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin spot price crossed above the Realized Price back at the start of 2023, and since then, its value has remained above the indicator. At present, the Realized Price is sitting at $56,200, which means that the network as a whole is in a significant amount of profit at the current spot price. While the Realized Price does provide an overall view of the blockchain, it doesn’t tend to be too useful outside of bear markets as the asset rarely interacts with it. This is a consequence of the fact that it accounts for all tokens in circulation, even the ones that have become inaccessible due to lost wallet keys. Two other models in the chart, the True Market Mean and Active Realized Price, exist to solve this issue. These indicators only provide the cost basis of the active market participants. That is, the Bitcoin investors who have recently been involved in transaction activity. The first model, the True Market Mean, is situated at $81,100 right now. This is around where the cryptocurrency found its bottom when it crashed in November. Meanwhile, the Active Realized Price corresponds to $87,700, which is the level about which BTC has recently been consolidating. Related Reading: XRP Triangle Hints At Potential 10% Move—But In Which Direction? As Bitcoin is currently trading right at the Active Realize Price, the investors holding the economically active supply can be assumed to be just breaking even on their investment. While the active traders as a whole have a neutral profitability, the same isn’t true for a segment of them known as the short-term holders (STHs). Formally, the STHs are defined as the addresses who acquired their coins within the past 155 days. With the Bitcoin STH Realized Price equal to $99,900 at the moment, this cohort is in a state of net loss. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $87,700, down 2.6% in the last seven days.

56572569,649374,1767060055,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56572569.jpeg,"Galaxy Digital Moves $39M In Bitcoin To Exchanges, Signaling Potential Sell-Off",https://bitcoinist.com/galaxy-digital-moves-39m-in-bitcoin-to-exchanges/,"Bitcoin has remained locked in a consolidation phase since late November, with price oscillating in a narrow range and failing to establish a clear directional trend. This prolonged period of sideways movement has left analysts divided about what comes next. Some expect the current weakness to evolve into a deeper downtrend as Bitcoin struggles to reclaim key resistance levels, while others argue that consolidation may be laying the groundwork for a renewed push higher once selling pressure fully subsides. For now, uncertainty dominates market sentiment. Against this backdrop, on-chain activity from major institutional players is drawing increased attention. Top analyst Darkfost recently highlighted a notable transaction involving Galaxy Digital, a prominent crypto-focused financial services firm founded by billionaire investor Mike Novogratz. Galaxy Digital operates across asset management, trading, investment banking, and venture capital, and its on-chain movements are closely monitored due to its role as a major institutional participant in the digital asset market. According to on-chain data, Galaxy Digital moved approximately 447 BTC, worth around $39 million, a few hours ago. Transactions of this size are significant, particularly during periods of low conviction and compressed volatility. Large transfers by institutional entities often raise questions about intent, whether related to portfolio rebalancing, liquidity management, or potential selling activity. Galaxy Digital Exchange Transfers Raise Short-Term Supply Concerns Darkfost explains that the destination of Galaxy Digital’s recent Bitcoin transfers adds important context to the move. On-chain data shows that the 447 BTC were sent directly to Bybit and Bitstamp, two centralized exchanges commonly used for spot and derivative trading. Transfers to exchanges are typically interpreted as a potential intent to sell or deploy liquidity, rather than long-term custody, making the transaction particularly relevant given current market conditions. Adding to the significance, Darkfost notes that an additional 200 BTC were moved just a few hours later, reinforcing the idea that this was not an isolated operational transfer. In total, the movements represent a sizable amount of Bitcoin entering exchange venues during a period of low conviction and compressed price action. Such timing naturally raises concerns about renewed sell-side pressure, especially as Bitcoin continues to struggle below key resistance levels. What stands out further is the historical context. It has been nearly one month since Galaxy Digital last transferred such a large quantity of BTC to exchanges. This pause suggests that the firm had largely remained inactive on the sell side throughout December, making the latest activity a notable change in behavior. While institutional transfers do not always translate into immediate market selling, they often precede shifts in short-term liquidity. As Bitcoin remains range-bound, Galaxy Digital’s renewed exchange activity could influence near-term price dynamics, particularly if broader sentiment fails to improve. Bitcoin Testing Structural Demand Level Bitcoin’s price action on the higher timeframe reflects a market stuck between structural support and persistent overhead pressure. After peaking above the $120,000 region earlier in the cycle, BTC has entered a clear corrective and consolidation phase, with price now trading near $87,300. The chart shows that Bitcoin has decisively lost the 50-day moving average (blue), which has rolled over and is acting as dynamic resistance during rebound attempts. More importantly, price is now compressing between the 100-day moving average (green) and the 200-day moving average (red). The 200-day MA, currently just below the $90,000 zone, has become a critical pivot. Multiple recent candles show rejection near this level, confirming it as a major supply area. As long as BTC remains below the 200-day MA, upside momentum is structurally limited. On the downside, the market has so far managed to defend the $85,000–$86,000 region, which aligns with prior consolidation and acts as short-term support. Volume has declined compared to the impulsive phases earlier in the trend, reinforcing the idea that the market is in a waiting mode rather than trending aggressively. From a broader perspective, the sequence of lower highs since October signals weakening bullish control, but the absence of a sharp breakdown below long-term averages suggests distribution rather than panic. Bitcoin remains range-bound, and a decisive move above the 200-day MA or a breakdown below $85,000 will likely determine the next directional phase.

This Bithumb BOA delisting follows a comprehensive review period and underscores the exchange’s stringent commitment to its listing maintenance criteria. The decision, rooted in procedural compliance, will directly impact token holders and offers a clear case study in evolving digital asset governance. Bithumb BOA Delisting: The Official Rationale and Timeline Bithumb issued a formal statement detailing the reasons behind the BOA token removal. Consequently, the exchange cited two primary factors for its action. First, materials submitted by the BOA project foundation proved insufficient to resolve prior concerns. Specifically, these concerns had previously triggered an “investment warning” designation on the platform. Second, Bithumb’s review concluded that BOA’s trading activity and market adoption no longer met the benchmarks required for continued support. The delisting process will follow a defined schedule to protect users. Therefore, trading for all BOA pairs will cease precisely at the announced time. Subsequently, users must withdraw their BOA tokens from the exchange wallets before a specified deadline. Failure to do so may result in complex recovery procedures. This structured approach is standard for major exchanges managing asset removals. Understanding the “Investment Warning” Designation Bithumb’s reference to an “investment warning” is a crucial piece of context. This internal flag acts as a preliminary step before potential delisting. Exchanges typically apply such warnings when a project faces significant issues. For instance, these issues can include communication failures, regulatory problems, or severe technical vulnerabilities. The warning period allows the project team to address the identified problems formally. In BOA’s case, the foundation’s response failed to satisfy Bithumb’s compliance team. This outcome highlights the increasing rigor of exchange due diligence. Moreover, it reflects a broader industry trend where platforms actively police their listings. They do this to maintain market integrity and user trust. The table below outlines common triggers for an investment warning status. Trigger Category Common Examples Project Communication Lack of updates, unresponsive team, broken roadmap deadlines Trading & Liquidity Abnormally low volume, price manipulation alerts, illiquid order books Technical & Security Smart contract vulnerabilities, network downtime, wallet failures Legal & Compliance Regulatory inquiries, legal action against founders, non-compliance with exchange requests The Role of Exchange Listing Criteria in 2025 Exchanges like Bithumb now employ multi-factor models to assess listed assets. These models go beyond initial listing requirements. They continuously evaluate a token’s health. Key metrics often include: Daily Trading Volume: Sustained activity above a minimum threshold. Community & Development Activity: Regular code commits and engaged social channels. Legal Opinion Updates: Current legal assessments confirming regulatory standing. Market Capitalization Stability: Avoiding excessive volatility or collapse. BOA’s performance across these ongoing metrics likely contributed to the final verdict. This process demonstrates a shift from passive hosting to active stewardship by trading platforms. Immediate Impacts and Investor Guidance The announcement creates immediate operational consequences for BOA holders on Bithumb. Users must take proactive steps to secure their assets. First, they should halt any open buy orders for BOA. Second, they must plan to sell or withdraw their tokens before the deadline. After delisting, the token will only exist in private wallets or on other supporting exchanges. Market reaction to such news is often predictable. Typically, the affected token experiences heightened selling pressure. This pressure comes from traders exiting positions to avoid post-delisting illiquidity. However, the long-term price discovery for BOA will then depend entirely on its performance on remaining platforms and its underlying project merits. Broader Context: South Korea’s Evolving Crypto Landscape Bithumb’s action occurs within a specific regulatory environment. South Korea has implemented rigorous rules for crypto exchanges. The Financial Services Commission (FSC) mandates strict anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) protocols. Furthermore, exchanges face significant liability for listing problematic assets. This regulatory pressure incentivizes preemptive actions like the BOA delisting. Comparatively, this event mirrors similar actions by other Korean exchanges like Upbit and Korbit in recent years. These platforms periodically review and prune their listed assets. This practice enhances overall ecosystem health. It also protects less experienced investors from projects that have become dormant or non-compliant. Expert Perspective on Exchange Governance Industry analysts view such delistings as a sign of market maturation. “A robust exchange doesn’t just list assets; it actively curates them,” notes a fintech compliance specialist familiar with Asian markets. “This Bithumb BOA delisting is a procedural enforcement of published rules. It signals to all listed projects that sustained performance and transparency are mandatory, not optional.” This perspective frames the event not as a failure, but as a routine function of a regulated marketplace. Conclusion The Bithumb BOA delisting scheduled for January 30, 2026, is a significant event driven by protocol and performance review. It underscores the critical importance of ongoing project compliance and communication in the modern cryptocurrency era. For investors, it serves as a reminder to monitor the exchange status of their holdings and understand the terms of service governing their assets. For the industry, it represents the continued professionalization and regulatory integration of digital asset trading platforms. The decisive move by Bithumb ultimately reinforces the standards required for sustainable token listings. FAQs Q1: What should I do if I hold BOA on Bithumb? You must sell or withdraw your BOA tokens before 6:00 a.m. UTC on January 30, 2026. After this time, trading will be disabled, and you will only be able to withdraw until a subsequent deadline, which Bithumb will announce. Q2: Will BOA still be traded on other exchanges after this Bithumb BOA delisting? Potentially, yes. The delisting is specific to Bithumb. The BOA token may continue trading on other platforms that support it, provided it meets their individual listing criteria. Q3: What does “investment warning designation” mean? It is a formal status applied by an exchange to flag a listed asset with serious issues. It warns users of increased risk and typically starts a review period where the project team must address the problems to avoid delisting. Q4: How common are cryptocurrency delistings? Delistings are a standard part of exchange operations. As regulatory standards tighten and markets mature, exchanges regularly review and remove tokens that fail to meet evolving requirements for security, liquidity, or project activity. Q5: Does a delisting mean the BOA project has failed? Not necessarily. While a major exchange delisting is a significant setback, a project’s failure or success is determined by its technology, adoption, and community support across the entire ecosystem, not its presence on a single platform.

MSCI’s gauge of Asia Pacific shares slipped 0.1% in early trading, and S&P 500 futures edged lower after the US benchmark fell 0.3% on Monday. The Nasdaq 100 dropped 0.5% in that session, with Tesla, Nvidia and Meta among the notable decliners. The softer equity tape arrived alongside another bout of metal volatility. Silver and gold swung after a sharp pullback from fresh all-time highs, as traders booked profits and liquidity thinned after the holidays. Crypto traders kept describing the same theme, a market that keeps moving, then does it with less depth. Market snapshot Bitcoin : $87,164, down 1.9% Ether : $2,929, down 2.3% XRP : $1.85, down 2.2% Total crypto market cap: $3.03 trillion, down 2.1% Bitcoin And Ether Drift Sideways As Year-End Volumes Fade Jake Kennis, senior research analyst at Nansen, said year-end trading has slowed and volumes have faded across major assets. “Bitcoin and Ethereum have both traded largely sideways over the past week, reflecting seasonal inactivity rather than a meaningful shift in market structure,” he said. “Activity has cooled across most chains, with a broad consolidation in active addresses, transactions, and fees generated over the past 30 days. Chains like Base saw notable pullbacks in DEX volumes following a very strong run earlier in the year. Solana remains the dominant venue for onchain trading by volume, even as user activity softened slightly over the week, with BNB Chain a distant second.” “Overall, trading activity hasn’t disappeared; it has simply slowed and become more selective as the year comes to a close.” Profit-Taking Hits Metals After New Highs Macro investors, meanwhile, stayed focused on the policy path. Investors looked ahead to the Federal Reserve’s December meeting minutes due later Tuesday, a release that often resets rate expectations when positioning runs crowded. The bigger picture still shows a strong year for risk assets, despite the late-year wobbles. The MSCI All Country World Index has climbed about 21% in 2025, and a broad measure of Asian stocks has rallied almost 26%, according to market-wrap data. In metals, the latest move showed how quickly crowded trades can unwind. Spot silver fell 4.8% on Monday after earlier hitting a record, and gold eased after setting its own peak on Friday, with profit-taking doing the heavy lifting. For crypto, Bitcoin’s steadiness looked more like a positioning pause than a conviction push, with traders watching liquidity, flows and volatility pricing for the next move into the first week of 2026.

Together, the data highlighted growing network usage alongside a defined market setup heading into year end. Ethereum contract deployments hit quarterly record in Q4 2025 Ethereum posted a new quarterly high in smart contract deployments in the fourth quarter of 2025, according to a Token Terminal chart shared on X by the BMNR Bullz account. The graphic showed 8.7 million contracts deployed in Q4 2025, marking the highest quarter on the chart’s timeline. Contracts Deployed on Ethereum (Quarterly). Source: Token Terminal The chart tracked quarterly contract deployments from 2016 through 2025 and showed a sharp jump in the final bar, which stood well above prior peaks. Earlier quarters in 2025 also printed elevated readings, but the Q4 total topped them and reset the series high. BMNR Bullz described the record as an “all time high in developer activity” and linked higher contract counts to expanding on chain building.

Meanwhile, a CoinCodex 365 day forecast shows Bitcoin down about 5% by Dec. 2026, while Ethereum targets about a 61% gain.

Bitcoin TetherUS 15 Binance. Source: Bull Theory on X Bull Theory said Bitcoin jumped about $3,000 in roughly four hours late Sunday, then pushed through $90,000 and triggered $103 million in short liquidations. The account framed the move as “weekend manipulation,” but it provided no direct evidence beyond the price action and liquidation figures. However, the rally faded as trading rolled into Monday. Bull Theory said Bitcoin then dropped about $2,700 and liquidated $40 million in long positions, which it said wiped out the earlier gains. A shared BTCUSDT chart from Binance showed a steep green run into the low $90,000s, followed by a steady drift lower and then a large red selloff that pushed price back toward the high $88,000s. The chart annotation described the sequence as a $3,000 pump in four hours, then a roughly $2,000 drop in about one hour during the sharpest leg down. Large intraday moves often cluster around thin liquidity periods, and weekends can amplify swings as fewer market makers and lower volumes leave order books more sensitive to large orders. Even so, the post’s “manipulation” claim remains an allegation, while the liquidation numbers point to forced exits as leverage met fast price changes. Bitcoin vs Ethereum Forecast Splits for 2026 as ETH Model Targets 61% Gain Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s forecast points to mild downside pressure over the next year. The model places Bitcoin’s current price near $87,780, while the projected price by December 2026 sits lower at $83,350, a decline of about 5%. The chart shows a wide range, with a predicted high near $105,543 in February 2026 and a projected low around $74,425 by December 2026.

Source: CoinCodex In contrast, Ethereum ’s outlook remains stronger across the same period. Ethereum trades near $2,963, while the projected price by December 2026 rises to about $4,768, implying a gain of roughly 61%. The model also shows a higher volatility band, with a predicted peak near $5,798 in April 2026 and a projected low around $3,042. The Ethereum projection line trends upward overall, despite several pullbacks during the year. The lower section of the chart highlights relative performance rather than absolute price. Ethereum’s projected returns fluctuate sharply but stay positive for most of the period, climbing toward the upper range by year end. Bitcoin’s projected returns, however, drift lower and remain compressed near the baseline, reflecting weaker relative performance. Taken together, the chart suggests a scenario where Bitcoin consolidates after prior gains, while Ethereum carries stronger upside expectations over the same horizon.

According to a pivotal new report from Tiger Research, South Korea is confronting a massive capital flight, with an estimated 160 trillion won ($115.3 billion) flowing from domestic investors to overseas crypto exchanges this year. This exodus represents a critical challenge for regulators and highlights a growing global competition for digital asset investment. Consequently, the implications extend far beyond simple capital movement, touching on financial sovereignty, innovation, and the future of Web3 in Asia. South Korea Crypto Capital Flight: Quantifying the $115 Billion Drain Tiger Research, an established Asian Web3 research and consulting firm, published its alarming findings in late 2024. The firm meticulously analyzed trading patterns, wallet movements, and exchange liquidity data. Their report paints a clear picture of sustained capital outflow. Fundamentally, the core driver is not mere speculation but what the researchers term an “asymmetry of investment opportunities.” South Korean investors are actively seeking financial instruments and early access not readily available on domestic platforms. Specifically, overseas exchanges offer two key attractions: Derivatives Trading: Platforms like Binance and Bybit provide sophisticated futures and options contracts. Pre-Market Trading: Investors can access tokens before they list on major South Korean exchanges, capturing early price movements. This environment creates a powerful incentive for capital to seek higher potential returns abroad. Moreover, the scale of this movement suggests a structural issue within the local regulatory framework. The Ripple Effect: Fee Revenue and the “Balloon Effect” Warning The capital flight carries a significant secondary consequence: the migration of substantial fee revenue. Tiger Research calculated the estimated fee income earned by major global exchanges from South Korean users. Their analysis, based on the $115 billion outflow, reveals a dramatic redistribution of wealth: Exchange Estimated Fee Revenue (Won) Estimated Fee Revenue (USD) Binance 2.73 trillion $1.97 billion Bybit 1.12 trillion $807 million OKX 580 billion $418 million Bitget 270 billion $194.5 million Huobi 70 billion $50.4 million This table illustrates a clear concentration of economic benefit outside South Korea. The report strongly cautions against a simplistic regulatory response. Simply blocking access to foreign exchanges, a tactic considered in some jurisdictions, could trigger a “balloon effect.” This phenomenon would disperse capital into harder-to-track, unregulated peer-to-peer channels or privacy-focused platforms, creating greater systemic risk. Therefore, the challenge is to manage, not merely obstruct, the flow of capital. Regulatory Crossroads: Innovation Versus Control The situation places South Korean policymakers at a complex juncture. The nation has historically maintained strict cryptocurrency regulations, including a real-name banking system and a ban on initial coin offerings (ICOs). These rules aimed to protect consumers and prevent money laundering. However, they also limited the product diversity on local exchanges like Upbit and Bithumb. In contrast, jurisdictions like Dubai and Singapore are crafting agile frameworks that attract both capital and crypto businesses. Tiger Research advocates for a balanced approach. They recommend fostering innovation within a “manageable framework” that could involve: Gradually permitting regulated derivatives products. Creating sandbox environments for new token listings. Enhancing international regulatory cooperation. This strategy aims to retain capital and talent domestically while maintaining necessary oversight. Historical Context and Global Parallels South Korea’s current dilemma is not entirely unique. Other nations have grappled with similar capital and talent drains in emerging tech sectors. For instance, China’s stringent crypto ban in 2021 led to a massive exodus of mining operations and developers, redistributing influence across Central Asia and North America. Similarly, Japan’s early strict regulations in the 2010s caused it to lose its initial lead in blockchain innovation. The South Korean case is distinct due to the sheer volume of retail investor participation and the advanced technological infrastructure of its population. This context underscores the high stakes involved. A misstep could cede South Korea’s position as a Web3 leader in the Asia-Pacific region. Economic and Market Impact Analysis The $115 billion outflow represents a meaningful portion of South Korea’s digital asset economy. This movement affects multiple stakeholders: Domestic Exchanges: They lose trading volume and fee income, potentially stifling their growth and R&D capabilities. Tax Revenue: The government faces challenges in tracking and taxing offshore crypto profits, impacting public finances. Financial Stability: Large, opaque cross-border flows can complicate monetary policy and financial oversight. Local Blockchain Ecosystem: Startups may find it harder to secure funding if domestic investor capital is deployed overseas. These interconnected impacts demonstrate that the capital flight is a multifaceted economic issue, not just a niche market trend. Conclusion The Tiger Research report on the South Korea crypto capital flight serves as a critical wake-up call. The estimated $115 billion moving to overseas exchanges signals a profound mismatch between investor demand and domestic market offerings. While consumer protection remains paramount, an overly restrictive stance risks economic leakage and diminished global competitiveness. The path forward likely requires a nuanced regulatory evolution—one that safeguards investors while enabling controlled innovation. Ultimately, how South Korea responds to this $115 billion exodus will significantly shape its role in the future global digital asset landscape. FAQs Q1: What is the main reason for the South Korea crypto capital flight? The primary driver is an “asymmetry of investment opportunities.” Overseas exchanges offer products like derivatives and pre-market token trading that are largely unavailable on South Korea’s strictly regulated domestic platforms, leading investors to seek higher potential returns abroad. Q2: Which overseas exchange is estimated to earn the most from South Korean users? According to Tiger Research’s calculations, Binance is estimated to have earned approximately 2.73 trillion won ($1.97 billion) in fee revenue from South Korean users involved in the capital flight, making it the largest beneficiary. Q3: What is the “balloon effect” mentioned in the report? The “balloon effect” is a warning that simply blocking access to foreign exchanges could disperse capital into unregulated, harder-to-track channels like peer-to-peer networks or privacy tools. This would increase systemic risk and reduce regulatory oversight, making the problem worse. Q4: How does this capital flight impact South Korea’s domestic crypto exchanges? Domestic exchanges like Upbit and Bithumb lose significant trading volume and associated fee revenue. This can limit their growth, reduce their competitiveness, and potentially stifle innovation and development within the local exchange ecosystem. Q5: What solution does Tiger Research recommend? Tiger Research recommends that regulators move beyond outright blocking and instead develop a framework that allows for managed innovation. This could include gradually permitting regulated derivative products and creating controlled environments for new token listings to keep capital and activity within a observable system.

This downturn comes as Bitcoin (BTC) has led a tumultuous fourth quarter, characterized by increased selling pressure and heightened volatility. Cash Flow Crisis In Crypto Notably, CoinShares recently reported that crypto products witnessed outflows totaling $446 million last week, contributing to a total of $3.2 billion in outflows since the sharp price decline on October 10th. Technical analyst Ali Martinez shared insights on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), indicating that, from a price-action perspective, a short-term bounce could be possible after such an extended downtrend, reminiscent of patterns observed following the market peak in 2021. However, when analyzing on-chain data, the overall decline in capital inflows suggests that money is currently leaving the crypto space rather than entering it. This is further supported by Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) net flows, which have seen nearly $1 billion in outflows over the past two weeks, suggesting that institutional investors are currently reducing their exposure rather than increasing their risk assets. Martinez cautioned that any potential rebound would likely be propelled by leverage rather than fresh demand, which can create scenarios where late buyers get trapped, ultimately leading to further price declines. He concluded that the risk of Bitcoin hitting lower lows remains significant as capital continues to exit the market. Could Bitcoin Recover $100,000 In Q1 2026? Despite the prevailing bearish sentiment, some optimistic forecasts have emerged for the first quarter of 2026. Crypto Rover highlighted that Q1 could be particularly bullish for both Bitcoin and altcoins for several reasons. First, fresh capital is typically deployed at the beginning of the year, as hedge funds, asset managers, and institutional players allocate new money to work. With traditional assets like gold, silver, and stock indices already nearing all-time highs, Rover believes that institutions may see crypto as an attractive opportunity, especially since Bitcoin and various altcoins still fall below their previous peaks. Second, end-of-year selling often transitions into buying come January. This behavior is frequently driven by tax-loss harvesting, where investors sell losing positions in December to lock in losses, only to re-enter those positions in January. Lastly, Bitcoin has been known to follow a four-year market cycle. The previous cycle saw Bitcoin drop from $69,000 to $32,000, before rebounding to around $48,000 and reclaiming its 50-week exponential moving average (EMA). Currently, this EMA stands near $98,200, and if Bitcoin adheres to similar patterns in Q1 2026, a move toward the $100,000 to $102,000 range is entirely plausible, marking an 18% increase from current levels. Historically, a 20% increase in Bitcoin often correlates with a 35-40% rise in Ethereum (ETH) and large-cap altcoins, while smaller altcoins may see even more dramatic increases of 60-80% before momentum stabilizes. At the time of writing, the market’s leading cryptocurrency is trading at $87,620 — a 30% drop from the all-time high of $126,000 reached in October.

Strategy Resumes Bitcoin Acquisitions On Monday, Strategy announced that, between 22 and 28 December, it had acquired 1,129 Bitcoin at an average price of around $88,568 each, totaling approximately $108.8 million. This latest purchase increased Strategy’s Bitcoin portfolio to 672,497 tokens, originally acquired for roughly $74,997 per token, making the total investment approximately $50.44 billion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears Red Yearly Close: Galaxy Digital Explains The Setup Alongside these acquisitions, the company sold $108.8 million in Class A common stock under its at-the-market equity offering, leaving a major $11.7 billion still available for future issuance and sale. This follows the week after 24 November, during which the company did not make any new crypto acquisitions or issue any securities. Notably, Strategy also paused its purchasing activities between 15 and 21 December, ending a three-week streak of acquisitions. During this time, it sold common stock amounting to $747.8 million. Bitmine Stashes 4,110,525 Ethereum On the other side, Bitmine Immersion has disclosed a significant increase in its Ethereum holdings, adding 44,463 ETH in just the past week. This move brings its total stash to 4,110,525 ETH, which constitutes about 3.41% of the entire Ethereum supply. Out of this cache, Bitmine has staked 408,627 ETH. Tom Lee, the Chairman of Fundstrat and a key figure at Bitmine, commented on the market’s seasonal activity, noting that trading tends to slow as the year draws to a close. He stated, “Bitmine added 44,463 ETH in the past week, as we continue to be the largest ‘fresh money’ buyer of ETH in the world.” Lee attributed the downward pressure on cryptocurrency and related equities to year-end tax-loss selling, which typically peaks between December 26 and December 30. Emphasizing Bitmine’s strategic focus, Lee remarked that the company remains dedicated to enhancing shareholder value. This commitment involves accretively acquiring ETH per share, optimizing yields, and income on its Ethereum holdings. Crypto Market Woes Despite these acquisitions, both cryptocurrencies have failed to regain their key levels, with BTC consolidating below $90,000 at around $87,400 and ETH trading just above $2,920. On a year-to-date basis, both ETH and BTC are set to close 2025 with losses of 12% and 6%, respectively. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Quiet Bounce Faces A Bigger Test Above $3,550 Strategy’s stock, which trades under the ticker name MSTR, is currently priced at around $156 per share. This represents a substantial 71% decline from the all-time high of $540 reached in November 2024. At the time of writing, Bitmine’s BMNR stock was trading at $28.40, having recorded an even greater loss than Strategy when compared to its all-time high price of $161. This equates to an 82% loss for the company’s stock since July of this year.

Chen explained that the wallet was improvising ways to handle the situation and urged Trust Wallet users that it would prioritize accuracy over speed when reimbursing victims. The executive emphasized that internal investigations flagged 2,596 addresses, yet it received close to 5,000 claims. The executive noted that the influx in claims is likely due to false claims or duplicate submissions from users attempting to access reimbursement for themselves. Chen explained that the fraudulent claims prompted the wallet to take appropriate measures to ensure accurate verification of wallet ownership is critical to ensure the right victims regain access to their funds. Chen also noted that the Trust Wallet team is continuing to conduct further investigations to confirm wallet addresses by combining multiple data points, thereby distinguishing between legitimate users and opportunists and exploiters. She detailed that the investigation and compensation process are the company’s top priorities and urged all team members to actively focus on the issue at hand. Trust Wallet’s browser extension was hacked Trust Wallet suffered a malicious hack through its Chrome extension, resulting in the loss of $7 million from unsuspecting users. The hack followed Trust Wallet’s recent release of version 2.68 of its Chrome browser extension, which had malicious code disguised as an analytics module. When users opened their version 2.68 wallets or keyed in their seed phrases, the hidden code secretly captured and transmitted that data to a fake domain (metrics-trustwallet.com) that was registered just days before the new version was released. The malicious data transfer granted the hackers access to seed phrases, which they used to remotely restore wallets and drain users’ funds. Some of the assets drained from victims after the hack include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and BNB Chain. Cryptopolitan previously reported on December 28 that the wallet had initiated compensation plans, which included victims submitting claims through an online form on Trust Wallet’s portal. Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao commented on the hack, confirming that Trust Wallet will fully reimburse all victims. He also informed users that the investigating team was working on uncovering how the hackers managed to sneak the malicious code into the version 2.68 release of the Trust Wallet browser extension, hinting at possible insider involvement. However, Trust Wallet has not confirmed insider involvement in the hack. CZ also assured users that their “funds are SAFU.” Blockchain Security firm SlowMist added that the hackers may have been familiar with the extension’s source code, which enabled them to successfully carry out the attack and had prepared well in advance of the day of the attack. After draining the funds from victims, the hacker proceeded to use centralized exchanges and chain bridges for laundering and swapping. SlowMist also reported that the malicious browser extension exported users’ personal information, in addition to their wallet information and passwords. Such data could be sold on the dark web for about $100, according to a Cryptopolitan coverage dated December 28.

This innovative platform, which began rolling out to selected users in mid-December 2024, represents a sophisticated fusion of prediction markets and decentralized perpetual futures exchanges. Consequently, the launch signals a potential evolution in how users interact with financial forecasting tools within the Web3 ecosystem. The platform’s unique architecture enables instant prediction creation while leveraging professional market-making systems, potentially setting new standards for DeFi applications in 2025. Kaizen Prediction Market Architecture and Core Features The Kaizen protocol operates on the Mitosis blockchain, commonly referred to by its ticker MITO. This underlying infrastructure provides the foundation for Kaizen’s custom prediction market functionality. Essentially, the platform integrates prediction market mechanics with liquidity sourced directly from decentralized perpetual futures exchanges. Users can create customized predictions by specifying three primary parameters: the target asset, the price condition, and the time duration. For instance, a user might predict whether Ethereum will exceed $5,000 within the next 30 days. Following prediction creation, a specialized group of professional market makers called “Solvers” engages in competitive quoting. These Solvers provide probability assessments for each prediction, essentially offering odds on potential outcomes. Importantly, the system automatically hedges positions on connected Perp DEXs, creating a sophisticated risk management layer. This integration represents a technical advancement in prediction market design, potentially reducing systemic risk while improving liquidity efficiency. The platform also incorporates a yield-generating mechanism through miUSDC, a yield-bearing version of the USDC stablecoin. Users can deposit USDC, which converts to miUSDC and earns interest while awaiting prediction outcomes. This feature addresses a common DeFi challenge: idle capital during waiting periods. The current beta includes three primary features: user-defined prediction creation, the competitive Solver quoting system, and settlement structures based on miUSDC. These components work together to create a comprehensive prediction ecosystem. Technical Integration with Perpetual Futures Exchanges The integration with decentralized perpetual futures exchanges represents Kaizen’s most distinctive technical innovation. Perp DEXs allow traders to speculate on asset price movements without expiration dates, using leverage and sophisticated trading mechanisms. Kaizen’s protocol connects prediction market positions directly with these liquidity pools. When a Solver provides a probability quote, the system simultaneously creates offsetting positions on Perp DEXs. This process effectively hedges the market maker’s exposure, creating a more stable and sustainable prediction market environment. This technical approach offers several potential advantages. First, it provides deeper liquidity than traditional prediction markets might achieve independently. Second, it creates natural arbitrage opportunities between prediction markets and futures markets. Third, it potentially reduces volatility in prediction pricing by connecting to larger, more established liquidity pools. The architecture demonstrates how DeFi protocols can create synergistic relationships rather than operating in isolation. Comparatively, traditional prediction markets often suffer from liquidity fragmentation and price inefficiencies. Kaizen’s model addresses these issues by tapping into the substantial liquidity already present in Perp DEX ecosystems. The table below illustrates key differences between traditional and Kaizen’s integrated approach: Feature Traditional Prediction Markets Kaizen Integrated Model Liquidity Source Isolated to platform users Connected to Perp DEX liquidity pools Risk Management Manual or platform-managed Automated hedging via Solvers Capital Efficiency Idle capital during waiting periods Yield generation via miUSDC Market Making Limited professional participation Competitive Solver system Expert Analysis of Prediction Market Evolution The development of Kaizen occurs within a broader context of prediction market evolution. Historically, prediction markets have demonstrated remarkable accuracy in forecasting events ranging from election outcomes to product adoption rates. However, decentralized prediction markets have faced adoption challenges related to liquidity, user experience, and regulatory considerations. Kaizen’s approach addresses several of these historical limitations through technical innovation. From a market structure perspective, the Solver system introduces professional market-making dynamics typically absent from decentralized prediction platforms. These Solvers compete to provide the most accurate probability assessments, potentially improving price discovery mechanisms. Furthermore, the automated hedging reduces systemic risk, making the platform more resilient during market volatility. These design choices reflect lessons learned from earlier DeFi prediction market experiments. The timing of Kaizen’s beta launch coincides with increasing institutional interest in DeFi infrastructure. As traditional financial entities explore blockchain-based forecasting tools, platforms offering sophisticated risk management and professional-grade interfaces may gain particular attention. Kaizen’s architecture appears designed to meet these evolving market demands while maintaining decentralized principles. Mitosis Blockchain Infrastructure and Ecosystem Context Kaizen operates on the Mitosis blockchain, a layer-1 protocol designed specifically for cross-chain liquidity and interoperability. The MITO token serves as the native asset for this ecosystem, facilitating transactions and governance. Mitosis emphasizes modular architecture and efficient cross-chain communication, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring multiple blockchain integrations. Kaizen leverages these capabilities to connect with various Perp DEXs across different blockchain networks. The Mitosis ecosystem has been developing steadily throughout 2024, with Kaizen representing one of its most complex applications to date. The blockchain’s technical specifications include: High throughput capabilities for prediction market transactions Cross-chain messaging protocols for Perp DEX integration Modular smart contract architecture for flexible protocol development Low transaction costs to facilitate frequent trading activity These technical characteristics create an appropriate foundation for Kaizen’s ambitious feature set. The blockchain’s design prioritizes the specific requirements of financial applications, particularly those involving real-time pricing and cross-protocol interactions. This specialized focus distinguishes Mitosis from more general-purpose blockchain platforms. Beta Testing Timeline and Development Roadmap The Kaizen closed beta began its sequential rollout in mid-December 2024, following extensive development and testing phases. The initial beta cohort received access to core prediction market functionality with limited asset selections and duration parameters. This phased approach allows the development team to monitor system performance, identify potential issues, and gather user feedback before broader release. The beta testing process follows established software development methodologies common in both traditional finance and DeFi sectors. Key testing phases include: Security auditing of smart contracts and integration points Performance testing under simulated market conditions User experience evaluation through controlled testing groups Integration verification with connected Perp DEX protocols Following successful beta testing, the development roadmap likely includes feature expansions, additional asset integrations, and potentially governance implementations. The miUSDC yield mechanism represents one area for potential enhancement, with possibilities for additional yield strategies or integration with broader DeFi yield ecosystems. The competitive Solver system may also evolve based on beta testing feedback and market dynamics. Market Impact and Future Implications Kaizen’s launch arrives during a period of significant innovation in decentralized finance infrastructure. The protocol’s unique approach to prediction markets could influence development directions across multiple DeFi sectors. Specifically, the integration model between prediction markets and derivative exchanges might inspire similar architectures in other financial applications. This cross-protocol synergy represents an emerging trend in DeFi development. From a market structure perspective, Kaizen potentially creates new arbitrage opportunities between prediction markets and perpetual futures markets. Professional traders and quantitative funds might develop sophisticated strategies leveraging these interconnected markets. Additionally, the platform could attract users seeking alternatives to traditional betting platforms or financial forecasting tools. The yield-generating aspect through miUSDC adds an additional dimension that distinguishes Kaizen from conventional prediction platforms. The regulatory landscape for prediction markets continues evolving across different jurisdictions. Kaizen’s technical architecture, particularly its integration with established DeFi protocols and professional market-making systems, might influence regulatory perceptions. Platforms demonstrating sophisticated risk management and professional participation often receive different regulatory consideration than purely retail-focused platforms. Conclusion The Kaizen prediction market represents a significant technical advancement in decentralized finance, combining prediction market functionality with perpetual futures exchange liquidity. The platform’s closed beta launch on the Mitosis blockchain demonstrates how sophisticated financial applications continue evolving within the Web3 ecosystem. Key innovations include the competitive Solver system, automated hedging mechanisms, and yield-generating miUSDC integration. These features address historical challenges in prediction market design while creating new possibilities for users and market participants. As the beta testing progresses throughout early 2025, the Kaizen protocol may establish new standards for prediction market architecture and DeFi integration models.

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC now trades at $86,986.83 on the Binance USDT pairing. This movement represents a notable departure from recent trading ranges and signals potential volatility ahead for digital asset investors. Market analysts immediately began examining the confluence of technical indicators and macroeconomic factors driving this sudden Bitcoin price adjustment. Bitcoin Price Movement and Immediate Market Context The Bitcoin price decline below $87,000 follows several weeks of consolidation between $88,500 and $91,200. Trading volume on major exchanges increased by approximately 42% during the downward move, according to aggregated exchange data. Consequently, this suggests genuine selling pressure rather than mere market noise. The Binance USDT market, representing one of the largest liquidity pools globally, recorded over $4.2 billion in BTC trading volume during the 24-hour period surrounding the decline. Meanwhile, other major exchanges including Coinbase and Kraken showed similar price action, confirming the move’s broad market validity. Historical data reveals that Bitcoin has tested the $87,000 level three times in the past 90 days. Previously, this level acted as reliable support during corrections in January and February 2025. The current breach therefore carries technical significance for chart analysts. Market depth charts from Binance show substantial buy orders clustered between $86,000 and $86,500, potentially establishing the next defensive line for bulls. Additionally, the relative strength index (RSI) on four-hour charts dipped to 38, moving from neutral toward oversold territory without reaching extreme levels. Technical Analysis and Trading Pattern Examination Technical analysts highlight several concerning developments in Bitcoin’s chart structure. First, the 50-day moving average at $88,240 now acts as resistance after the price closed below it. Second, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator shows bearish momentum increasing across multiple timeframes. Third, the Bollinger Bands have expanded significantly, indicating rising volatility. These technical factors collectively suggest the Bitcoin price may experience further testing of lower support levels before establishing a new equilibrium. Exchange flow data provides additional context for the Bitcoin price movement. Blockchain analytics firms report net outflows from exchanges totaling approximately 8,400 BTC in the 24 hours preceding the decline. Typically, exchange outflows suggest accumulation rather than distribution. However, the timing indicates some large holders may have moved assets to private wallets ahead of potential volatility. On-chain metrics show the average transaction size increased by 65% during the move, pointing toward institutional-sized transfers. Bitcoin Key Support and Resistance Levels (March 2025) Level Price Significance Resistance 1 $88,240 50-day Moving Average Resistance 2 $89,500 Previous Support Zone Current Price $86,986.83 Binance USDT Market Support 1 $86,500 Buy Order Cluster Support 2 $85,000 Psychological Level Support 3 $83,200 200-day Moving Average Macroeconomic Factors Influencing Cryptocurrency Markets Beyond technical patterns, broader financial conditions contribute to the Bitcoin price dynamics. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) strengthened by 0.8% in the same trading session, creating headwinds for dollar-denominated assets like Bitcoin. Furthermore, bond yields showed moderate increases following the latest Federal Reserve meeting minutes. Traditional equity markets experienced mixed performance, with technology stocks particularly sensitive to interest rate expectations. Cryptocurrency markets often correlate with risk assets during periods of macroeconomic uncertainty, explaining some parallel movements. Regulatory developments also merit consideration in the current Bitcoin price analysis. Several jurisdictions have announced updated digital asset frameworks in recent weeks. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations enter their final implementation phase. Meanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission continues its review of multiple spot Bitcoin ETF applications. Regulatory clarity generally supports long-term institutional adoption but can create short-term uncertainty during transition periods. Historical Volatility Patterns and Market Psychology Bitcoin’s historical volatility provides context for the current Bitcoin price movement. The asset’s 30-day volatility stands at 68%, slightly above its annual average of 64%. However, this remains well below volatility peaks exceeding 120% observed during previous market cycles. Seasoned traders recognize that 5-7% daily moves represent normal market behavior for Bitcoin, especially during transition periods between consolidation and trend phases. The current decline represents approximately a 4.2% move from recent highs, fitting within historical norms. Market sentiment indicators show a shift from greed to neutral territory. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index declined from 68 (Greed) to 52 (Neutral) following the Bitcoin price drop. This cooling of sentiment often precedes healthier market advances by shaking out weak positions. Social media analysis reveals increased discussion of buying opportunities at lower levels, suggesting many market participants view the dip as temporary rather than structural. Derivatives data shows open interest in futures markets decreased by 12%, indicating some leverage unwinding without cascading liquidations. Liquidity Distribution: Order book analysis shows balanced liquidity above and below current price Institutional Activity: Grayscale Bitcoin Trust premium turned neutral after trading at discount Network Fundamentals: Bitcoin hash rate remains near all-time highs despite price volatility Market Structure: Spot trading volume exceeds derivatives volume, suggesting organic price discovery Comparative Analysis with Alternative Digital Assets The broader cryptocurrency market followed Bitcoin’s lead during the decline. Ethereum (ETH) decreased by 5.1% against the dollar, slightly underperforming Bitcoin’s 4.2% drop. Major altcoins showed varied performance, with some decentralized finance tokens declining more sharply while certain layer-1 protocols demonstrated relative strength. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization decreased by approximately 3.8% to $3.2 trillion. Bitcoin dominance—the percentage of total crypto market value represented by BTC—remained stable at 52.3%, indicating proportional movement rather than capital rotation. Traditional finance integration continues despite short-term Bitcoin price volatility. Several major banks have announced expanded cryptocurrency custody services. Payment processors increasingly support digital asset transactions. Furthermore, corporate treasury adoption grows steadily, with new companies announcing Bitcoin allocations quarterly. These fundamental developments suggest the current price movement represents normal market fluctuation within a broader adoption trend. Institutional investors typically view such volatility as entry opportunities rather than existential threats. Conclusion The Bitcoin price decline below $87,000 represents a significant technical development within ongoing market consolidation. Trading at $86,986.83 on Binance’s USDT market, Bitcoin tests important support levels amid changing macroeconomic conditions. Technical indicators suggest increased bearish momentum, while fundamental metrics show strong network health and institutional interest. Historical patterns indicate such movements typically precede renewed volatility in either direction. Market participants should monitor key support levels around $86,500 and $85,000 while considering broader adoption trends beyond short-term price fluctuations. The Bitcoin price action reminds investors that digital assets remain volatile despite growing mainstream integration. FAQs Q1: What caused Bitcoin to fall below $87,000? The decline resulted from combined technical factors and macroeconomic conditions. Increased selling pressure on exchanges coincided with dollar strength and shifting risk sentiment across financial markets. Q2: How significant is the $87,000 level for Bitcoin? This level represented important support tested multiple times in recent months. The breach suggests changed market dynamics, though its significance depends on whether the price recovers above it quickly. Q3: Are other cryptocurrencies affected similarly? Most major digital assets experienced correlated declines, though with varying magnitudes. Ethereum decreased slightly more than Bitcoin, while some altcoins showed independent price action based on specific developments. Q4: What should investors watch following this price movement? Key indicators include exchange flow data, order book liquidity around $86,500, derivatives market positioning, and broader financial market conditions affecting risk assets. Q5: Does this change Bitcoin’s long-term outlook? Short-term price movements rarely alter long-term fundamentals. Network security, adoption trends, and institutional integration continue progressing despite normal market volatility periods.

This substantial liquidation event primarily impacted bullish traders, revealing critical vulnerabilities in leveraged trading strategies during volatile market conditions. Market analysts immediately scrutinized the data, particularly noting the disproportionate impact on Solana positions compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum markets. Crypto Futures Liquidations Reveal Market Stress Points The 24-hour crypto futures liquidations data provides a transparent window into market sentiment and risk exposure. Specifically, Bitcoin witnessed $82.12 million in liquidated positions, with long positions constituting 68.46% of the total. Consequently, this indicates that most affected traders bet on price increases. Meanwhile, Ethereum markets saw $56.43 million in liquidations, with 58.64% representing long positions. However, Solana experienced the most dramatic imbalance, with $10.37 million liquidated and a staggering 93.35% representing long positions. Therefore, this data clearly demonstrates where excessive leverage accumulated before the market correction. Perpetual futures contracts, which lack expiration dates, enable continuous leveraged trading. These instruments use funding rate mechanisms to maintain price alignment with spot markets. When prices move sharply against leveraged positions, exchanges automatically close them to prevent negative balances. This process, known as liquidation, creates cascading sell orders that can amplify price movements. Market infrastructure must handle these events efficiently to maintain stability. Comparative Analysis of Major Cryptocurrency Liquidations The following table summarizes the liquidation data, providing immediate comparative insights: Asset Total Liquidated Long Position Percentage Short Position Percentage Bitcoin (BTC) $82.12 million 68.46% 31.54% Ethereum (ETH) $56.43 million 58.64% 41.36% Solana (SOL) $10.37 million 93.35% 6.65% Several key observations emerge from this data. First, Bitcoin’s absolute liquidation volume remains highest, reflecting its dominant market capitalization and trading activity. Second, Ethereum shows a more balanced ratio between long and short liquidations, suggesting diverse positioning among traders. Finally, Solana’s extreme long-dominated liquidation ratio indicates concentrated bullish sentiment that proved vulnerable to downward price pressure. Market participants should note these patterns for future risk assessment. Expert Perspective on Leverage and Market Mechanics Financial analysts emphasize that liquidation events serve as natural risk management mechanisms in derivatives markets. According to institutional trading desks, these forced closures prevent systemic failures by limiting counterparty risk. However, excessive liquidations can create temporary liquidity gaps and increase volatility. Historical data from 2021 and 2023 shows similar patterns where long-dominated liquidations preceded short-term market bottoms. Therefore, sophisticated traders often monitor liquidation clusters as potential contrarian indicators. Regulatory developments in 2024 introduced stricter leverage limits on major exchanges, potentially mitigating the scale of these events compared to previous cycles. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) now requires U.S.-facing platforms to implement enhanced risk controls. Consequently, today’s liquidation volumes, while significant, represent a more controlled unwinding than the billion-dollar events witnessed during the 2022 market downturn. This regulatory evolution demonstrates market maturation. Impact on Market Structure and Trader Psychology Significant crypto futures liquidations inevitably affect market structure through several channels. Initially, forced selling creates immediate downward pressure on prices. Subsequently, this pressure can trigger stop-loss orders and additional liquidations in a feedback loop. Market makers and liquidity providers must absorb this selling pressure, potentially widening bid-ask spreads temporarily. However, once the liquidation cascade concludes, markets often stabilize as overleveraged positions clear from the system. Trader psychology undergoes notable shifts during these events. Bullish sentiment typically diminishes as leveraged longs face destruction. Conversely, short sellers may take profits, adding buy-side pressure. Fear and uncertainty metrics, like the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, often spike during liquidation events. Importantly, experienced traders recognize that extreme liquidation events sometimes mark local price extremes. Therefore, they analyze order book depth and funding rates for potential reversal signals. The Role of Exchange Infrastructure and Risk Parameters Modern cryptocurrency exchanges employ sophisticated risk engines to manage liquidation processes. These systems calculate margin requirements in real-time using proprietary formulas. When account equity falls below maintenance margin levels, the exchange initiates a liquidation sequence. Typically, the system attempts to close positions through regular order matching first. If unsuccessful, it deploys a liquidation engine to execute market orders. Exchange transparency regarding these processes remains crucial for trader confidence. Key risk parameters traders must monitor include: Initial Margin: The percentage of position value required to open a trade Maintenance Margin: The minimum equity percentage before liquidation triggers Liquidation Fee: The penalty charged for forced position closure Funding Rate: The periodic payment between long and short positions Understanding these mechanics helps traders avoid unexpected liquidations. Furthermore, exchanges continuously refine their systems based on market feedback and regulatory guidance. This ongoing improvement enhances overall market resilience against extreme volatility events. Historical Context and Evolving Market Dynamics The cryptocurrency derivatives market has evolved substantially since Bitcoin futures launched in 2017. Initially, liquidations frequently exceeded $1 billion during major price swings. However, improved risk management tools and trader education have gradually reduced the frequency of extreme events. The current liquidation scale, while noteworthy, represents normalized market functioning rather than systemic stress. This maturation reflects broader institutional adoption and sophisticated trading infrastructure development. Comparative analysis with traditional finance reveals parallels with futures markets for commodities and equities. Similar liquidation mechanisms exist in those markets during periods of high volatility. The key distinction lies in cryptocurrency’s 24/7 trading cycle, which allows positions to accumulate leverage without daily settlement breaks. This continuous exposure necessitates robust personal risk management protocols for all market participants. Historical precedents provide valuable lessons for current traders. Conclusion The recent crypto futures liquidations event, totaling approximately $149 million across major assets, demonstrates ongoing market volatility and the risks inherent in leveraged trading. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana each exhibited distinct liquidation patterns reflecting their unique market dynamics. While these forced closures create short-term turbulence, they also serve essential risk management functions within derivatives markets. Traders should analyze such events for insights into market sentiment extremes and potential turning points. Ultimately, understanding liquidation mechanics remains crucial for navigating cryptocurrency’s volatile landscape successfully. FAQs Q1: What triggers crypto futures liquidations? A1: Crypto futures liquidations trigger automatically when a trader’s margin balance falls below the maintenance margin requirement, typically due to adverse price movements against their leveraged position. Q2: Why were Solana long positions disproportionately affected? A2: Solana’s 93.35% long liquidation ratio suggests excessive bullish leverage accumulated before the price decline, making those positions particularly vulnerable to margin calls. Q3: How do liquidations impact overall market prices? A3: Liquidations create forced selling pressure that can amplify downward price movements temporarily, though markets typically stabilize once the overleveraged positions clear. Q4: Can traders prevent futures liquidations? A4: Traders can prevent liquidations by maintaining adequate margin buffers, using stop-loss orders, reducing leverage levels, and actively monitoring positions during volatile periods. Q5: Do liquidation events present trading opportunities? A5: Some traders view extreme liquidation events as potential contrarian signals, as they often indicate sentiment extremes, though this strategy requires careful risk management and timing.

Data reveals a withdrawal of $19.31 million on December 29, extending a pattern that signals shifting investor sentiment in the digital asset space. This streak marks one of the most persistent periods of capital exit since these groundbreaking funds launched, prompting analysis from market observers. Bitcoin Spot ETFs Experience Sustained Capital Flight According to data compiled by Trader T, the net outflow on December 29 continued a pattern established over the previous five trading days. The outflows were not uniform across all funds. Instead, they concentrated in several major products. Invesco’s BTCO fund led the withdrawals with a net outflow of $10.41 million. BlackRock’s IBIT, one of the largest funds by assets, followed with $7.94 million leaving the product. Ark Invest’s ARKB also saw significant movement, recording a $6.66 million net outflow. This consistent pattern across multiple issuers suggests a broader market dynamic rather than an issue isolated to a single fund manager. Market analysts often track these flows as a real-time gauge of institutional and retail investor appetite for Bitcoin exposure through regulated vehicles. The consecutive outflows coincide with the year-end period, a time when portfolio rebalancing and tax-loss harvesting can influence trading activity. However, the duration of this streak has captured attention. It raises questions about near-term price support and the maturity of Bitcoin’s integration into traditional portfolio strategies. A Detailed Breakdown of December 29 Fund Flows The following table summarizes the net flow activity for the major U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs on the reported date, providing a clear snapshot of investor behavior. ETF Ticker Issuer Net Flow (Dec. 29) BTCO Invesco -$10.41 million IBIT BlackRock -$7.94 million ARKB Ark Invest -$6.66 million FBTC Fidelity +$5.70 million Notably, Fidelity’s FBTC stood as the sole exception to the outflow trend. It attracted a net inflow of $5.70 million, demonstrating that demand for Bitcoin exposure persists in specific channels. All other U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs reported zero net flows for the day, indicating a neutral stance from their investor bases. This divergence highlights how different fund structures, fee levels, and marketing channels can lead to varied results even within the same asset class. Contextualizing the Cryptocurrency ETF Outflow Streak To understand the significance of a six-day outflow streak, one must consider the historical performance of these products. U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs, approved in early 2024, initially saw massive inflows as they opened Bitcoin investment to a wider audience. They provided a secure, familiar framework for accessing cryptocurrency. Periods of net outflows are not unprecedented. They often correlate with broader market conditions. For instance, outflows frequently occur during phases of Bitcoin price consolidation or decline, as investors seek to manage risk or realize gains. Several factors could be contributing to the current trend: Year-End Portfolio Management: December is a common month for investors to rebalance portfolios, harvest tax losses, or reduce speculative positions before the new year. Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price action in late December showed increased volatility, which can trigger risk-off behavior among some ETF investors. Profit-Taking: Investors who entered earlier in the year may be locking in profits, especially if they anticipate potential tax changes or market shifts in January. Macroeconomic Sentiment: Broader concerns about interest rates or economic growth can temporarily dampen appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. It is crucial to analyze these flows in proportion to the total assets under management (AUM). For the largest funds, a $10 million outflow represents a very small percentage of their total holdings. Therefore, while the directional trend is noteworthy, it does not necessarily indicate a mass exodus. Instead, it may reflect normal market churn and the actions of a subset of tactical traders. Expert Perspective on ETF Flow Data Financial analysts emphasize that ETF flow data is just one metric among many. “Daily flows are a useful pulse check, but they are inherently noisy,” notes a report from Bloomberg Intelligence. “The long-term trajectory of assets under management and the sustained viability of the product structure are more telling indicators of success.” The fact that these ETFs continue to operate with daily liquidity and tight spreads, even during outflow periods, is itself a sign of a maturing market. Furthermore, the presence of a consistent inflow into at least one major fund, like Fidelity’s FBTC, suggests demand remains segmented and selective. Different investor groups—such as registered investment advisors (RIAs), retail platforms, and institutional desks—may favor different ETF providers based on custody solutions, fees, or existing brokerage relationships. This competition among providers is healthy for the ecosystem. It ultimately drives innovation and lower costs for end investors. The Ripple Effect on Bitcoin’s Market Structure The mechanics of a spot ETF create a direct link between fund flows and the underlying Bitcoin market. Authorized Participants (APs) create and redeem ETF shares. When investors sell shares (causing outflows), APs typically redeem shares with the issuer. The issuer then sells the corresponding Bitcoin from the fund’s vault. This process can create selling pressure on the spot market. Conversely, inflows require the issuer to buy Bitcoin, creating buying pressure. A sustained period of net outflows, therefore, can translate into consistent selling from ETF issuers on exchanges. This activity can act as a headwind for Bitcoin’s price in the short term. However, market makers and other large participants often anticipate these flows. They frequently hedge their exposures in the futures and options markets. The actual market impact is thus diffused across a complex web of derivatives and trading strategies. It is rarely a simple one-to-one relationship. This dynamic also underscores the importance of transparency. The daily publication of flow data and holdings provides unprecedented visibility into institutional Bitcoin movements. This transparency was largely absent before the ETF era. Now, all market participants can see a significant source of demand and supply. This data improves price discovery. It also reduces information asymmetry between large and small investors. Conclusion The sixth consecutive day of net outflows from U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs presents a clear data point for market observers. It highlights a period of cautious or profit-taking behavior among a segment of ETF investors as the year concludes. While the outflows from funds like Invesco’s BTCO, BlackRock’s IBIT, and Ark’s ARKB are notable, the simultaneous inflow into Fidelity’s FBTC shows that demand is not universally retreating. Analyzing these Bitcoin spot ETF flows requires context. Investors must consider year-end dynamics, the relative size of the movements, and the long-term growth trend of these innovative investment vehicles. The very existence of this transparent flow data marks a monumental step forward for the digital asset market’s integration with traditional finance. FAQs Q1: What does a “net outflow” mean for a Bitcoin ETF? A net outflow occurs when the dollar value of shares redeemed from an ETF exceeds the value of shares created. This typically means more investors are selling their ETF shares than buying them on that day. Q2: How do ETF outflows affect the price of Bitcoin? Mechanically, outflows can lead ETF issuers to sell Bitcoin from their vaults to pay redeeming investors, potentially creating selling pressure on the spot market. However, the effect is often mitigated by hedging activity in derivatives markets. Q3: Is a six-day outflow streak unusual for Bitcoin ETFs? While not unprecedented, a six-day streak is a significant pattern that warrants attention. It often coincides with periods of market uncertainty, price consolidation, or seasonal factors like year-end portfolio rebalancing. Q4: Why did Fidelity’s FBTC see inflows while others saw outflows? Different ETFs appeal to different investor bases (e.g., different brokerage platforms, financial advisors). Flows can diverge based on marketing, fee structures, or the specific decisions of large institutional clients. Q5: Should investors be concerned about these outflows? As a standalone data point, short-term flows are not a primary cause for concern for long-term investors. They are a normal part of market function. The overall health of the ETF is better judged by its liquidity, tracking accuracy, and long-term asset growth.

According to data compiled by Trader T, the funds saw a collective net outflow of $9.63 million, with BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) experiencing the most substantial withdrawal at $13.28 million. Conversely, Fidelity’s Ethereum Fund (FETH) managed to attract $3.65 million in net inflows, providing a notable counterpoint to the broader trend. This persistent outflow pattern raises critical questions about near-term confidence in Ethereum-based investment products as the new year approaches. Spot Ethereum ETFs Experience Sustained Capital Flight The consistent net outflows from U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs represent a clear departure from the initial enthusiasm that followed their regulatory approval and launch. Market analysts immediately scrutinized the four-day streak, which began on December 26. The total outflows during this period now exceed $30 million, according to preliminary aggregations. This trend contrasts sharply with the generally positive net inflows observed in comparable Bitcoin spot ETFs over the same timeframe, highlighting a potential divergence in investor perception between the two leading crypto assets. Several immediate factors likely contributed to this movement. Firstly, the year-end period often triggers portfolio rebalancing and profit-taking by institutional managers. Secondly, broader macroeconomic uncertainty, particularly regarding interest rate projections for 2025, may have prompted a risk-off posture in more speculative asset classes. Finally, specific developments within the Ethereum ecosystem, such as ongoing debates about network upgrades and fee structures, can influence investor confidence in the underlying asset’s medium-term value proposition. Analyzing the Divergent Performance of Major Funds A closer examination of the individual fund data reveals a nuanced picture beneath the headline outflow figure. The stark difference between BlackRock’s ETHA and Fidelity’s FETH is particularly instructive for understanding current market dynamics. The BlackRock and Fidelity Dichotomy BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), as the largest fund by assets under management in this cohort, naturally exerts an outsized influence on the aggregate flow data. Its $13.28 million net outflow on December 29 was the single largest movement, driving the overall figure into negative territory. Industry observers note that large block trades from a single institutional client can significantly impact daily flow numbers for these relatively new products. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s Ethereum Fund (FETH) demonstrated resilience by pulling in $3.65 million. This divergence may reflect differing fee structures, marketing strategies, or the specific client bases of the two asset management giants. Other funds, including those from Grayscale, VanEck, and Bitwise, reported no net flows for the day, suggesting a period of investor indecision or equilibrium. Spot Ethereum ETF Flow Data for December 29, 2024 Fund Name (Ticker) Issuer Net Flow (USD) iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) BlackRock -$13.28 Million Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) Fidelity +$3.65 Million Other U.S. Spot ETH ETFs Various $0 (No Net Flow) Aggregate Total All Issuers -$9.63 Million The table above clearly illustrates the opposing forces at play. It is crucial to interpret single-day flows within a broader context. For instance, weekly or monthly flow data often provides a more stable view of investor commitment, smoothing out the noise of daily institutional reallocations. Furthermore, the trading volume for these ETFs remained robust, indicating active markets and liquidity, which is a positive sign for the product category’s long-term health despite the short-term outflow trend. Contextualizing the Outflows in the Broader Crypto Market To fully understand the significance of these Ethereum ETF outflows, one must consider the wider cryptocurrency and traditional financial landscape. The outflows occurred during a period of relative stability for Ethereum’s spot price, which traded within a narrow band. This disconnect between price action and fund flows suggests the movements are more related to specific product dynamics or year-end financial engineering than a direct bearish bet on ETH itself. Key contextual factors include: Year-End Financial Operations: Many funds and institutional investors engage in tax-loss harvesting, portfolio rebalancing, and window-dressing in the final week of December. These technical activities can create flow distortions that reverse in January. Macroeconomic Backdrop: Lingering questions about inflation, central bank policy, and economic growth in 2025 influence all risk assets. Cryptocurrencies, often perceived as higher-beta investments, can be particularly sensitive to shifts in liquidity expectations. Competition from Other Vehicles: Investors have multiple avenues to gain Ethereum exposure, including futures-based ETFs, direct ownership on exchanges, and staking protocols. Flows may rotate between these options based on yield differentials and risk assessments. Regulatory Environment: The regulatory stance toward cryptocurrency in the U.S. remains a foundational concern for institutional allocators. Any perceived tightening or uncertainty can prompt a cautious retreat to the sidelines. Historical Precedents and Market Psychology Historical analysis of the older Bitcoin spot ETF market provides a useful parallel. Following their launch, Bitcoin ETFs also experienced periods of net outflows that did not necessarily correlate with long-term price declines. These phases often represented consolidation after initial hype, allowing the market to establish a firmer, more sustainable base of holders. The Ethereum ETF market, being newer, may simply be undergoing a similar maturation process. Market psychology plays a role; a short-term trend of outflows can become self-reinforcing as news headlines influence sentiment, potentially creating a temporary disconnect from fundamental value. Expert Analysis on Long-Term Implications and Trajectory Financial analysts specializing in digital assets urge a measured perspective on the four-day outflow streak. While acknowledging the data, they emphasize that one week does not define a trend for an investment product designed for multi-year horizons. The primary value proposition of spot Ethereum ETFs—providing regulated, accessible, and secure exposure to ETH without the complexities of direct custody—remains intact. The true test will be aggregate flow data for the first quarter of 2025, which will reveal whether this is a transient year-end phenomenon or the beginning of a more sustained capital rotation. Furthermore, the simultaneous inflows into Fidelity’s product indicate that demand is not uniformly negative. It suggests a selective, discerning market where investors are differentiating between providers based on fees, brand trust, and platform integration. This competitive dynamic is healthy for the ecosystem and will likely drive innovation and lower costs for end-investors over time. The overall growth in total assets under management across all spot crypto ETFs since their introduction still paints a picture of significant and growing institutional adoption, of which current outflows are merely a minor fluctuation. Conclusion The fourth consecutive day of net outflows from U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs highlights a moment of recalibration for this nascent investment vehicle. Driven largely by a significant withdrawal from BlackRock’s ETHA, the trend is partially offset by inflows into Fidelity’s competing fund. While the short-term data captures attention, informed analysis requires viewing these flows within the context of year-end financial operations, broader market conditions, and the longer-term adoption curve for cryptocurrency investment products. The resilience and liquidity of the ETF structure itself are not in question. Consequently, the coming weeks will be critical for determining if this marks a brief pause or a more significant shift in institutional sentiment toward spot Ethereum ETFs. Market participants will closely monitor January’s flow data for signs of a rebound as the new investment year begins. FAQs Q1: What does “net outflow” mean for an ETF? A1: A net outflow occurs when the total dollar value of shares redeemed by investors exceeds the total dollar value of shares purchased on a given day. It indicates more money is leaving the fund than entering it. Q2: Are these outflows causing the price of Ethereum to drop? A2: Not necessarily. Spot ETF issuers must buy or sell the underlying asset (ETH) to match fund creations and redemptions. Large outflows can create selling pressure, but the overall ETH market is vast. Recent outflows have coincided with a stable ETH price, suggesting other market forces are currently dominant. Q3: Why did Fidelity’s FETH see inflows while others saw outflows? A3: This can be due to several factors: specific institutional clients allocating capital, Fidelity’s distinct fee structure or marketing efforts, or investors rotating from one fund provider to another based on platform preference or perceived advantages. Q4: Is it normal for new ETFs to experience volatile flows? A4: Yes, it is very common. New investment products often see volatile flows in their early months as the market discovers an appropriate level of demand, arbitrage opportunities are executed, and initial investors take profits. The trend becomes more meaningful over quarterly or annual periods. Q5: How should a long-term investor view this news? A5: A long-term investor should focus on the fundamental case for Ethereum and the utility of the ETF as an access vehicle. Short-term flow data is a useful sentiment indicator but is often noisy. The decision should be based on investment thesis, asset allocation goals, and trust in the fund issuer, not on a few days of outflow data.

The company said Monday it now holds 4,110,525 Ether, a stash it values at about $12B, making it the largest publicly-disclosed Ethereum treasury and placing it among the biggest crypto balance sheets in the market. Lee has pitched MAVAN as the next step in that strategy, moving BitMine from accumulation to monetisation through validator operations. “We continue to make progress on our staking solution known as The Made in America Validator Network (MAVAN). This will be the ‘best-in-class’ solution offering secure staking infrastructure and will be deployed in early calendar 2026,” continued Lee. 6/ Bitmine is currently working with 3 staking providers as the company moves towards unveiling its commercial MAVAN (Made in America VAlidator Network) in 2026. As of December 28, 2025, Bitmine total staked ETH stands at 408,627 ($1.2 billion at $2,948 per ETH). – This is a… — Bitmine (NYSE-BMNR) $ETH (@BitMNR) December 29, 2025 Breaking Down The Economics Of Staking At Institutional Scale Validator economics sit at the centre of the bet, with rewards paid in ether and shaped by network activity, validator uptime, and the yield environment that can also include MEV related revenue. BitMine has drawn headlines with a $1M a day narrative tied to staking at scale. “At scale (when Bitmine’s ETH is fully staked by MAVAN and its staking partners), the ETH staking fee is $374 million annual (using 2.81% CESR), or greater than $1 million per day” Lee said. That number rests on a stack of assumptions, including staking most of the treasury, maintaining high validator performance with minimal penalties, and seeing yields and prices stay supportive enough to keep dollar returns elevated. Regulatory Shifts Add Tailwinds To BitMine’s Staking Push For now, BitMine is not at full throttle. The company said 408,627 Ether is already staked with third party providers as it tests MAVAN ahead of a broader rollout targeted for early 2026. BitMine has also kept buying. It said it added 44,463 Ether in the past week, describing itself as the largest “fresh money” buyer of Ether, and it put its combined crypto, cash and “moonshots” holdings at $13.2 billion, including $1.0 billion in cash. The stock has become part of the story too, since liquidity matters when a treasury strategy starts to look like a leveraged proxy for Ether. BitMine said BMNR traded about $980 million a day on a five day average, ranking 47th among US listed stocks as of December 26, 2025. Policy Signals In Washington Reshape The Crypto Backdrop Backers named in the company’s disclosures include ARK’s Cathie Wood, Founders Fund, Pantera, Kraken, DCG and Galaxy Digital, with BitMine framing that support around its longer term goal of reaching 5% of the Ether supply, a target it calls the “Alchemy of 5%”. The Made in America framing also lands in a market shaped by regulatory scars from earlier staking fights, including the SEC’s 2023 case that led Kraken to shut its US staking as a service programme and pay $30M. Under President Donald Trump, the SEC has moved to dismiss its civil enforcement action against Coinbase, part of a broader rethink of crypto enforcement in Washington. Investors get another checkpoint in January. BitMine has called its annual stockholder meeting for Jan. 15, 2026 at the Wynn Las Vegas, and its proxy filing outlines votes that include director matters and proposals tied to capital structure and incentive plans.

It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,053 swing high to the $2,907 low. A clear move above the $2,950 resistance might send the price toward the $3,000 resistance. An upside break above the $3,000 region might call for more gains in the coming days. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,050 resistance zone or even $3,120 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,955 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,900 level. The first major support sits near the $2,880 zone. A clear move below the $2,880 support might push the price toward the $2,840 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,800 region. The next key support sits at $2,720.

Strategy Has Dropped Another $108.8 Million On Bitcoin As announced by Strategy Chairman Michael Saylor in an X post , the company has completed a fresh Bitcoin acquisition involving 1,229 BTC. The purchase took place in the period between December 22nd and December 28th, and cost the firm $88,568 per token or $108.8 million in total. According to the filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the acquisition has been funded using sales of the company’s MSTR at-the-market (ATM) stock offering. Last Monday, Strategy didn’t make any Bitcoin purchases, but it did announce a new addition to its recently-created USD reserve . The firm initially allocated $1.44 billion to this reserve at the start of December, which rose to $2.19 billion with its $748 million expansion last week. The BTC treasury company made this new reserve to be better able to navigate short-term market volatility and ensure that dividend payments are made on time. Like is usually the case, Saylor made a Sunday X post with the company’s Bitcoin portfolio tracker before the latest purchase as well. This time, the chairman hinted at a return to Bitcoin buying, with the caption: “Back to Orange.” This Monday was the last for 2025 and since Strategy has a history of Monday BTC acquisitions, it may be safe to assume that this was the last purchase announcement for the year from the treasury firm. In total, Strategy now holds 672,497 BTC, acquired for $50.44 billion. At the current exchange rate, these holdings are worth about $58.94 billion, so the company is currently in a net profit of 16.85%. Saylor’s firm used to be in a much bigger gain earlier in the year, but the bearish price action between October and November meant that the cryptocurrency closed some of the distance to its cost basis. Currently, Strategy’s Bitcoin break-even level lies at $74,997. Back in November, BTC came relatively close to this mark, but since that low, the asset has found some stability, so it only remains to be seen whether the coin will retest the level anytime soon. BTC Retraces After Fast Surge In Open Interest Bitcoin and Ethereum witnessed a surge in the Open Interest during the past day, as CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has pointed out in an X post . The “Open Interest” is an indicator that measures the total amount of positions related to a given asset that are currently open on all centralized derivatives exchanges. It’s visible in the below chart that the 24-hour percentage change in this metric shot up to 6% for Bitcoin earlier in the past day. The surge in Open Interest for Bitcoin and Ethereum came as the markets witnessed a rally. Often, fast heating in this metric tends to be a signal for volatility, and the warning has held this time as both assets have seen a quick retrace. Bitcoin went to as high as $90,300 during the rally, but its price is now back at $87,500, as the below chart depicts.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin accumulation|btc|BTCUSDT|Strategy|Strategy Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-30 04:00:00

Some analysts have suggested that altcoin’s chart signals a bearish performance for the coming months. Related Reading: Here’s Why Bitcoin Advocate Max Keiser Restates Bullish Outlook For 2025 Solana Faces Another Rejection From Key Resistance After hitting a three-week high of $130 on Sunday, Solana started the week with a 6.1% correction to the $122 area. The cryptocurrency recently breached below its macro support around the $120 zone, hitting an eight-month low of $116 in mid-December. Since then, the altcoin has been trading between the $120-$126 mark, attempting to break out of the local resistance multiple times but ultimately being rejected after each retest. SOL’s price surged around 5.6% toward during Sunday’s broader market bounce, trying to build a base below the crucial resistance level before plunging after the early Monday correction. Amid this performance, market observer Crypto Jobs pointed out that Solana had broken out of a six-week falling wedge, which could target the $144-$146 area if momentum holds and price confirms a retest of the breakout. However, the star-of-week pullback has momentarily sent SOL below the pattern’s upper boundary. Analyst Man of Bitcoin also highlighted that the cryptocurrency had broken above a one-month downtrend line, which suggested an initial move toward the $129-$130 area. The analyst explained that “holding above the broken trendline is key to maintaining upside momentum,” but noted that as long as the price remains below $146, a scenario where price is headed for one more low, around the $100-105 horizontal support, remains likely. Following the Monday rejection, he affirmed that “it could be that wave-4 is already complete. A decisive break below the trendline would confirm this further.” SOL’s Higher Timeframe Chart Shows Troubling Signs Market watcher Elite Crypto affirmed that Solana “doesn’t look very strong” on the higher timeframe, pointing to a multi-year bearish pattern potentially forming on SOL’s chart. According to X analysis, the cryptocurrency has been developing a Head and Shoulder pattern since early 2024, with the neckline sitting around the $105 area in the weekly timeframe. The char shows that left shoulder formed during the Q1 2024 rally, while the head and right shoulder formed during its rally to its latest all-time high (ATH) in Q1 and Q3 2025 breakouts, respectively. “If $SOL loses the $105 support then the price could move down to the $75–$51 range and this phase may last until mid 2026,” the investor detailed, adding that “after this period, the overall trend for SOL can turn bullish and set up a better move ahead.” Similarly, Henry from Lord of Alts suggested that Solana has formed a double top formation with the neckline around the current levels instead of a Head and Shoulders pattern. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears Red Yearly Close: Galaxy Digital Explains The Setup Per the analyst, “We put in a clean double top, rolled over, and now price is going back toward a zone that’s acted as real support before.” If the altcoin fails to hold the current support, its price could retrace toward the $60 mark, the chart shows. Moreover, he added that SOL’s price could also risk a drop to the $35 area in the coming months as there’s “a big gap below that market hasn’t dealt with yet.” Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",Cryptocurrency Market News|crypto analyst|crypto market correction|Crypto Market Recovery|Crypto trader|Sol|SOL ATH|SOL breakdown|Solana|Solana Analysis|Solana Price|SOLUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-12-30 04:00:59

It crashed to a low of $0.3512 on Tuesday, down sharply from the year-to-date high of $1.3245. This article explores some of the top reasons why the ADA price crashed in 2024 and potential catalysts to watch. Reasons why Cardano price crashed in 2025 There are a few reasons why the Cardano price crashed this year. First, the decline coincided with the ongoing crypto market crash that affected Bitcoin and other altcoins. Bitcoin dropped by 6.5% this year, while Ethereum plunged by 11% during the year. Additionally, the market capitalization of all tokens dropped by 8.10% this year. This explains why Cardano token plunged as the industry has a close correlation with each other. Second, ADA price dropped as concerns about its ecosystem continued. Data compiled by DeFi Llama shows that the total value locked (TVL) in its network dropped to below $250 million, making it much smaller than other popular networks like Monad and Katana. More data shows that Cardano does not have a market share in the fast-growing real-world asset (RWA) tokenization industry that has accumulated nearly $20 billion in assets. As a result, concerns that Cardano is a ghost chain remained for the most part of the year. Third, Cardano declined as it was passed over by most institutional investors who filed an application for altcoin ETFs. Only Grayscale filed for a spot ADA ETF, with other top companies like 21Shares, BlackRock, Canary, and VanEck remaining on the sidelines. Additionally, the token crashed this year after the huge liquidation event that happened on October 10, as nearly 2 million traders were liquidated . As a result, most Cardano investors have deleveraged, with the futures open interest falling from over $1.95 billion in September to the current $646 million today. Cardano price also plunged as the enthusiasm that Charles Hoskinson built earlier this year faded. For example, he predicted that Cardano would attract Chainlink as a partner, which did not happen. His hints on integrating Bitcoin DeFi in Cardano did not work out. Most importantly, his meeting with a top ‘VIP’ did not amount to any deal. Key catalysts for ADA price in 2026 There are a few potential catalysts for the Cardano price in the coming year. First, Cardano will launch the Midnight mainnet in the first quarter, a move that will boost its utility. Already, the recently launched NIGHT token launch was highly successful as the token’s market cap has remained above the $1.3 billion. Midnight is important as it will be the biggest privacy network in the crypto industry, with a focus on the zero-knowledge proof technology. The other main catalyst for Cardano will be the launch of the Leios upgrade, which will make Cardano one of the fastest-growing chains in the crypto industry. It will achieve this speed by introducing the concept of parallel block processing. Additionally, there are chances that Cardano’s price will do well as investors react to Grayscale’s launch of the first ADA ETF during the year. ADA price technical analysis Cardano price chart | Source: TradingView The weekly chart shows that the ADA price dropped from a high of $1.3245 in November last year to the current $0.3517. It has moved below the important support level at $0.5142, its lowest level in January, April, and June, confirming a bearish breakdown. The coin has remained below the 50-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA), confirming the bearish breakdown. It is also approaching its key support level at $0.3056, its lowest level in August last year. Therefore, the most likely scenario is where Cardano continues falling, with the next key support level to watch being at $0.2212, its lowest level in December 2022 and June 2023.

This finding comes at a time when sources pointed out that BlackRock’s BUIDL managed to distribute approximately $100 million in dividends since its launch in March 2024. Securitize , the leader in tokenizing real-world assets, reported this milestone on Monday, December 29. While serving as the issuer, transfer agent, and official tokenization partner for the fund, the fintech platform manages on-chain issuance and helps attract investors. BUIDL expands its reach to other significant players in the blockchain system At first, BUIDL was established on the Ethereum blockchain. Currently, the fund primarily invests in short-term, US dollar-denominated assets. Examples of these assets included US Treasury bills , repurchase agreements, and cash equivalents. Additionally, sources highlighted that the fund provides institutional investors with a suitable way to generate profits while maintaining the liquidity of their investments via a blockchain-based platform. These sources also confirmed that investors purchase BUIDL tokens connected to the US Dollar. Afterwards, they receive dividend payments straight on-chain, which demonstrate the earnings yielded from the underlying assets. Meanwhile, after being launched on Ethereum, BUIDL extended its reach to six other key players in the blockchain system. These key players included Solana , Aptos, Avalanche, and Optimism. When reporters reached out to sources close to the matter who wished to remain anonymous due to the confidential nature of the situation for comment, these sources acknowledged that the $100 million is a major achievement because it illustrates the total payments over a lifetime based on actual Treasury yields provided to holders of the on-chain fund tokens. This finding reveals that tokenized securities can conduct their operations effectively at scale while replicating key features of traditional financial products. Furthermore, this triumph highlights the effectiveness facilitated by blockchain technology, including swift and transparent settlements, clearly presented ownership records, and programmable distributions. These features are drawing the attention of several leading asset managers and institutional investors who seek to embrace tokenized real-world assets. The existence of tokenized money market funds in the market ignites debates Recently, sources pointed out that BUIDL has attracted the interest of many investors, enhancing its popularity. Following this growing interest, the value of its tokenized fund surpassed $2 billion earlier this year, prompting analysts to conclude that tokenized money market funds have solidified their position as one of the rapidly expanding sectors in the onchain RWA market. To support this claim, the analysts asserted that there are valid justifications for this trend. To begin with, they noted that this sector captures the attention of investors, as it provides earnings similar to those of money market accounts, while operating more effectively. This discovery has begun to attract the attention of traditional financial institutions. Some individuals actively participating in the market weighed in on the matter. They argued that these funds could serve as a potential alternative to the anticipated increase in stablecoins. In the meantime, JPMorgan strategist Teresa Ho released a statement in July noting that, “tokenized money market funds keep the long-standing appeal of cash as an asset, even though regulatory changes such as the approval of the GENIUS Act might improve stablecoin usage and lower the role of cash-like options.” Nonetheless, despite showcasing an accelerated increase, industry experts have started to examine tokenized money market funds thoroughly. This move was adopted after the Bank for International Settlements issued a warning that there is a high likelihood that these products could result in operational and liquidity risks, particularly because they play a crucial role as collateral in the digital asset ecosystem.

56575873,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=256483,1767068711,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Maven 11’s Strategic $2.05 Million ENA Deposit to Binance Reveals Crucial Vesting Dynamics,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/maven-11-ena-binance-deposit-analysis/,"BitcoinWorld Maven 11’s Strategic $2.05 Million ENA Deposit to Binance Reveals Crucial Vesting Dynamics In a significant on-chain transaction reported on April 10, 2025, an address associated with the prominent crypto venture capital firm Maven 11 deposited 10 million ENA tokens, valued at approximately $2.05 million, to the Binance exchange. This Maven 11-linked activity, first flagged by on-chain analyst DataNerd, provides a critical window into the movement of vested tokens from major institutional investors and their potential influence on the Ethena (ENA) ecosystem. The transaction follows a pattern of similar deposits, offering a tangible case study in post-vesting liquidity events within the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape. Analyzing the Maven 11 ENA Deposit to Binance On-chain data reveals a detailed narrative behind this deposit. The specific address in question received a substantial allocation of 18.18 million ENA tokens last month, worth an estimated $4.48 million at the time of distribution. This transfer occurred through a formal vesting schedule, a common mechanism for gradually releasing tokens to early investors and project contributors. Consequently, this recent deposit of 10 million ENA to Binance represents a major portion of that vested allocation. Furthermore, the address had previously moved 3.68 million ENA to the same exchange, indicating a phased approach to liquidity management. This activity underscores several key aspects of modern crypto markets. First, it highlights the transparency of blockchain ledgers, where major transactions are publicly visible. Second, it demonstrates the structured nature of venture capital involvement in new protocols like Ethena. Analysts closely monitor these flows because large deposits to centralized exchanges like Binance can precede selling pressure, or alternatively, signal preparation for other financial maneuvers such as collateralization or staking. Vesting Schedules: These contracts prevent immediate mass sell-offs by releasing tokens to investors over time. Exchange Deposits: Moving tokens to an exchange is typically a prerequisite for converting them to other assets or liquidity. On-Chain Analytics: Firms like DataNerd specialize in tracking and interpreting these public blockchain transactions. Contextualizing ENA and the Ethena Protocol To fully understand the impact of this deposit, one must examine the underlying asset. ENA is the governance token of the Ethena protocol, a innovative synthetic dollar project built on Ethereum. Ethena aims to create a crypto-native, yield-bearing stablecoin called USDe, which does not rely on traditional banking infrastructure. The protocol has garnered significant attention and investment since its inception, making the actions of its early backers particularly noteworthy. The involvement of Maven 11 Capital is a testament to the project’s initial credibility. As a well-known venture capital firm focused on decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain infrastructure, Maven 11’s investment choices are closely watched. Their participation in Ethena’s early rounds provided not just capital but also strategic validation. Therefore, their management of the vested ENA tokens carries weight beyond the simple dollar value, often interpreted by the market as a signal of ongoing confidence or portfolio rebalancing. Summary of Reported Address Activity Action Amount (ENA) Estimated USD Value Timeline Initial Vesting Receipt 18.18 Million $4.48 Million March 2025 Previous Binance Deposit 3.68 Million ~$756,000 Prior to April 10 Recent Binance Deposit 10 Million $2.05 Million April 10, 2025 Expert Angle: Deciphering Venture Capital Token Strategy From an institutional perspective, managing vested tokens requires a calculated strategy. Venture capital firms like Maven 11 typically operate under specific fund lifecycles and investor return expectations. A partial deposit to an exchange does not automatically equate to an immediate market sell order. Seasoned analysts, including those at firms like Arkham Intelligence and Nansen, often point out multiple potential rationales. The tokens could be moved to a custodial wallet on Binance for secure storage. Alternatively, they might be positioned for use in Binance’s various financial products, such as its Launchpool, Earn programs, or as collateral for margin trading. The phased nature of the deposits—first 3.68 million, then 10 million—suggests a measured, ongoing strategy rather than a single urgent liquidation event. This behavior is consistent with professional portfolio management, where large positions are liquidated incrementally to minimize market impact and secure optimal average prices. Market Impact and Broader Implications The immediate market reaction to such news is often nuanced. While a large exchange deposit can create near-term downward pressure on an asset’s price due to perceived selling supply, the actual effect depends on broader market depth, sentiment, and concurrent buying interest. For ENA, its price stability will hinge on organic demand for its utility within the Ethena ecosystem, including governance and staking, balancing any sell-side pressure from vesting releases. This event also serves as a broader lesson for crypto investors. It emphasizes the importance of monitoring vesting schedules and treasury movements for major projects. Upcoming unlocks for other early investors and team members are typically published in project documentation. Savvy market participants use this data to anticipate potential liquidity events, making on-chain analysis an indispensable tool for contemporary crypto research. The transparency, while sometimes creating volatility, ultimately contributes to a more informed and mature market structure. Conclusion The deposit of $2.05 million in ENA tokens to Binance from a Maven 11-linked address is a significant on-chain event that illuminates the complex dynamics of venture capital involvement in cryptocurrency. It highlights the critical role of vesting schedules, the strategic behavior of institutional holders, and the value of transparent blockchain data. For the Ethena protocol, the professional and phased management of these tokens by a respected firm like Maven 11 can be viewed as a sign of a mature investor relationship. As the digital asset ecosystem evolves, understanding these transactional patterns will remain crucial for analysts, traders, and observers aiming to gauge the underlying health and trajectory of pioneering projects like Ethena. FAQs Q1: What is the ENA token? The ENA token is the native governance token of the Ethena protocol. It grants holders voting rights on protocol upgrades and parameters related to its synthetic dollar, USDe. Q2: Why do venture capital firms receive tokens through a vesting schedule? Vesting schedules prevent immediate mass sell-offs that could crash a token’s price post-launch. They align long-term incentives by gradually releasing tokens to early backers over months or years. Q3: Does depositing tokens to Binance always mean selling? No. While depositing to an exchange is a necessary step for selling, institutions may also move tokens for secure custody, staking, participation in exchange-based earn programs, or to use as collateral for loans. Q4: Who is Maven 11 Capital? Maven 11 Capital is a specialized cryptocurrency and blockchain-focused venture capital firm. They invest in early-stage DeFi, infrastructure, and Web3 projects, providing capital and strategic support. Q5: What is on-chain analysis? On-chain analysis is the process of gathering, aggregating, and interpreting data from public blockchain ledgers. Analysts track wallet transactions, smart contract interactions, and exchange flows to derive insights into market trends and investor behavior.

XRP attracted $70.2 million, while Solana added $7.5 million. This trend has continued since their ETFs launched in the US in mid-October, and has brought total inflows to $1.14 billion for XRP and $1.34 billion for Solana. These gains come despite broader negative sentiment in the crypto market. Bitcoin and Ethereum Lose According to CoinShares’ Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report, Bitcoin and Ethereum moved in the opposite direction, seeing significant outflows. Bitcoin products lost $443 million last week, while Ethereum saw $59.5 million exit. Since the ETF launches, Bitcoin and Ethereum have recorded $2.8 billion and $1.6 billion in outflows, respectively. Multi-asset crypto funds also fell by $27.2 million, though Chainlink attracted $2.1 million. Zooming out, digital asset investment products continued to face selling pressure last week and recorded $446 million in outflows. This brings total withdrawals since the sharp price drop on October 10 to $3.2 billion, as investor confidence has yet to fully recover. While recent flows look weak, year-to-date data tells a more balanced story. Total inflows for the year stand at $46.3 billion, close to the $48.7 billion recorded over the same period in 2024. However, assets under management have increased by only 10% so far this year. This potentially means that, despite steady inflows, many investors have not seen meaningful gains once market performance is taken into account. Selling activity was seen across most regions, particularly in the United States, where $460 million was withdrawn from digital asset products. Switzerland also recorded minor losses of $14.2 million. Additionally, Sweden, Canada, and Brazil shed $3.7 million, $2.9 million, and $1 million, respectively. Germany was the prominent outlier, as it added $35.7 million over the same period. Hong Kong also settled for a modest $0.9 million. With $248 million recorded so far this month, Germany now leads in terms of regional totals amid recent market weakness. Spot Market Weakness The crypto market attempted a recovery in the final week of 2025. Major assets posted brief gains before pulling back. Bitcoin climbed above $90,000 but quickly fell to $87,603. Ethereum followed a similar pattern as it rose to $3,051 before slipping close to $2,950. XRP briefly reached $1.91 before easing to $1.87, while Solana also advanced to $129, only to retreat near $123.

56579810,649429,1767070803,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56579810.jpeg,Why Bitcoin Is Down 30% While Gold And Silver Experience Parabolic Gains,https://bitcoinist.com/why-bitcoin-is-down-30-while-gold-and-silver-gains/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a significant retracement of over 30% from its all-time high of $126,000, which was reached in October. This decline comes at a time when precious metals like gold and silver are achieving new records, marking a robust fourth quarter for these commodities. To understand Bitcoin’s next potential move, analysts at Bull Theory have suggested that historically, Bitcoin tends to rally after gold and silver have reached their peaks. The Liquidity Effect A look back at the events following the March 2020 market crash, the Federal Reserve (Fed) injected substantial liquidity into the financial system, and the first assets to respond were gold and silver. Gold, for instance, rallied from approximately $1,450 to $2,075 by August 2020, while silver experienced an impressive increase from around $12 to $29. During this entire phase, Bitcoin appeared stagnant, trapped in a trading range of $9,000 to $12,000 for five months. This inactivity followed a significant liquidation event triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic . As gold and silver peaked in August 2020, capital began to rotate into riskier assets, marking the beginning of Bitcoin’s ascent. From that point, Bitcoin surged from $12,000 to $64,800 by May 2021. The total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies skyrocketed by almost eight times during the same period, illustrating the impact of the liquidity-driven rally initiated by the Fed. Future Recovery Potential Fast forward to today, gold is nearing record highs around $4,550, while silver has surged to roughly $80. These commodities are currently experiencing upward momentum, while Bitcoin has largely remained in a sideways trend below the key $90,000 mark, similar to its behavior in mid-2020. Additionally, Bitcoin has had to contend with another significant liquidation event that took place on October 10th, paralleling the March 2020 scenario, and as a result, it has spent months moving sluggishly since then. However, the context surrounding this cycle is notably different from 2020. While liquidity from the Federal Reserve served as the main driver back then, 2026 is poised for multiple catalysts that could underpin Bitcoin’s recovery. The Fed has already resumed liquidity injections, and expectations for further rate cuts loom on the horizon. Additionally, banks may receive Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) exemptions, enabling more leverage within the system. Analysts Predict A Positive Outcome For Bitcoin Moreover, clarity on crypto regulations is improving, and anticipation surrounding the introduction of more spot crypto ETFs —especially those focusing on alternative coins—is also building, alongside increased access to cryptocurrency for large asset managers. Lastly, a new pro-crypto chair at the Federal Reserve is expected to inspire market participants to front-run forthcoming policy changes. The analysts concluded that the ongoing rise in gold and silver prices should not be interpreted as a negative signal for cryptocurrencies . In fact, this pattern has historically indicated an early signal for what could follow. If this trend continues, Bitcoin and the broader crypto markets may not take the lead initially. Instead, Bull Theory analysts believe they could begin to move after the metals have paused, suggesting that the current period of sideways action in Bitcoin is not indicative of a bear market but rather a calm before a potential storm.

According to on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain, the wallet associated with the 2021 Indexed Finance hack and the 2023 KyberSwap exploit ended approximately one year of dormancy by selling holdings of UNI, LINK, CRV, and YFI tokens over an intense eight-hour period. This transaction occurs while U.S. prosecutors continue their international pursuit of Canadian national Andean Medjedovic, the indicted fugitive allegedly responsible for stealing an estimated $65 million from the two protocols. Indexed Finance and KyberSwap Hacker Resurfaces with Major Sale The blockchain never forgets. On-chain data reveals the precise moment the dormant address sprang back to life, initiating a series of transactions that moved millions in digital assets. Analysts at Lookonchain, cited in a report by CryptoBriefing, tracked the movement of four major Ethereum-based tokens from the suspect wallet. The sale represents a significant liquidation event, potentially indicating an attempt to cash out or obfuscate funds. Consequently, this activity provides a fresh digital trail for investigators and security researchers to follow. This event underscores a persistent challenge in the crypto ecosystem: the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions can provide cover, but forensic analysis often creates a permanent, public record. The wallet’s activity directly ties back to two specific incidents that shook investor confidence in decentralized finance. Indexed Finance (2021): An exploit manipulated the protocol’s index pool mechanics, draining approximately $16 million in assets. KyberSwap (2023): A complex attack on the decentralized exchange’s Elastic pools led to a loss of nearly $49 million. Authorities have connected these two events to a single individual, highlighting a pattern of targeting sophisticated DeFi infrastructure. DeFi Security and the Fugitive Challenge The saga of these hacks extends far beyond smart contract code. It delves into international law enforcement, asset tracing, and the long memory of distributed ledger technology. U.S. prosecutors have publicly identified Andean Medjedovic as the alleged perpetrator. They secured an indictment detailing charges related to wire fraud and money laundering. However, Medjedovic remains a fugitive, demonstrating the complex jurisdictional hurdles in prosecuting cross-border crypto crime. This case exemplifies the “delay and disperse” tactic sometimes used by sophisticated actors. After an exploit, hackers often let stolen funds sit idle in dormant wallets, waiting for public attention to fade and for improved mixing or swapping services to emerge. The recent $2 million sale after a year of inactivity fits this pattern. It suggests a calculated effort to monetize a portion of the illicit gains while potentially testing surveillance by chain analysis firms and authorities. Expert Analysis on On-Chain Forensics and Recovery Security experts note that while transactions are transparent, converting stolen crypto to clean, spendable fiat currency remains a significant obstacle for hackers. Centralized exchanges increasingly integrate advanced compliance software that flags deposits from known malicious addresses. This sale of blue-chip DeFi tokens like UNI and LINK likely required the use of decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or cross-chain bridges, methods that leave their own forensic signatures. The public nature of this sale may actually aid investigators by providing a new set of transaction outputs to monitor, potentially leading to off-ramps where identity verification is required. The timeline of events is critical for understanding the persistence of crypto investigations: Date Event Estimated Impact October 2021 Indexed Finance Exploit $16 Million April 2023 KyberSwap Elastic Exploit $49 Million Late 2023 U.S. Indictment of Medjedovic Charges Filed Early 2025 Dormant Address Sells $2M in Assets Liquidation Event This sequence shows that legal and investigative processes operate on a longer timeframe than blockchain transactions, but they are relentless. The recent on-chain movement proves that even dormant addresses are under constant scrutiny by both private analytics firms and government agencies. Conclusion The $2 million cryptocurrency sale from an address linked to the Indexed Finance and KyberSwap hacks serves as a powerful reminder of the enduring nature of blockchain forensics and the ongoing efforts to bring DeFi exploiters to justice. While the pseudonymous hacker remains a fugitive, each on-chain action creates new data points for investigators. This case continues to shape discussions around protocol security, the importance of real-time monitoring tools, and the evolving collaboration between the crypto industry and global law enforcement. The resolution of the Indexed Finance and KyberSwap saga will likely set important precedents for how the digital asset world handles high-value, cross-jurisdictional theft. FAQs Q1: What cryptocurrencies did the hacker sell? The address sold holdings of UNI (Uniswap), LINK (Chainlink), CRV (Curve DAO Token), and YFI (yearn.finance) over an eight-hour period, totaling over $2 million in value. Q2: Who is suspected of being behind these hacks? U.S. prosecutors have identified and indicted Canadian national Andean Medjedovic as the alleged perpetrator behind both the Indexed Finance and KyberSwap exploits. He remains a fugitive as of early 2025. Q3: How much was stolen in the original hacks? The combined estimated loss from the 2021 Indexed Finance exploit and the 2023 KyberSwap exploit is approximately $65 million. Q4: Why would a hacker wait a year to move funds? Hackers often use a “delay and disperse” strategy, letting funds sit dormant to avoid immediate tracking and heat, waiting for improved obfuscation techniques or for surveillance to lessen before attempting to cash out. Q5: What does this mean for DeFi security? This incident highlights the persistent security challenges in DeFi, the importance of rigorous smart contract audits, and the critical role of continuous on-chain monitoring and analytics to track stolen funds long after an initial exploit.

Waters questions the SEC’s dropping of crypto enforcement cases In a letter to the panel’s Republican chairman, Representative French Hill, Waters argued that the committee has not convened a single hearing with Chairman Atkins despite its clear duty to oversee the SEC. She cited what she described as swift, substantial, and dubious policy changes during the Trump administration, many of which she said were carried out unilaterally by the chairman. Following the inauguration of the Trump administration, the SEC underwent a leadership transition. Atkins was eventually confirmed as its chairman. As a result, the regulator dropped a long list of legal disputes it had been involved in with the cryptocurrency sector. The agency withdrew from several ongoing legal disputes and dropped nearly all of its pending cases. Specifically, Waters stated that the Committee needs to oversee the SEC’s actions promptly. For instance, the dismissal of significant crypto enforcement actions. Waters mentioned that the agency has terminated or halted considerable enforcement actions against Coinbase, Binance, and Justin Sun. The ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee claimed that these cryptocurrency firms and individuals had been legitimately accused of serious violations of U.S. securities laws. Waters claimed that the defendants had declared that the SEC had done so before the Commission actually voted to stop enforcement efforts in some of these cases. “The Committee has not scrutinized the SEC’s rationale for abandoning these matters, nor how the agency intends to deter fraud and manipulation in markets touching millions of retail investors.” – Maxine Waters , the ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee. The ranking Democrat of the U.S House argued that Atkins’ office “took an unusually active role in negotiating an end to these cases”. Waters added that some corporations released from agency prosecutions disclosed the terminations before the commission’s actual decision. Waters warns SEC politicization undermines market integrity Under Chairman Atkins, the SEC has generally chosen a policymaking strategy that prioritizes staff statements and extending the compliance dates of Commission rules over notice-and-comment rulemaking. Waters argued that the policymaking strategy limits both legislative and public monitoring. It also breaches the SEC’s duties under the Administrative Procedure Act. According to the representative, the policymaking strategy overlooks public participation and conceals the interests that influence agency decision-making. Maxine Waters stated that Congress created the SEC to be separate from the White House. However, she claimed Chairman Atkins consistently presents the agency’s objective as an Administration tool. Atkins’s presentation of the agency as a white House tool threatens market integrity. Waters argued that this politicization affects market integrity, particularly when it comes to insider trading surrounding policy pronouncements that have the potential to impact the market. According to the ranking Democrat of the U.S House, reports of suspicious trading before Trump’s tariff suspension and the volatility around interventions in Argentina raise serious concerns about manipulation. Waters urged that the Committee must assess how well the agency is monitoring these concerns and what it is doing in terms of its legally required independence. Earlier this year, Waters stated that President Trump’s actions have radically changed the cryptocurrency scene in ways that are far more perilous than ever predicted. She claimed that the worst and most heinous scam in contemporary history is the crypto corruption of Donald Trump and his family. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

This move represents a calculated refinement of the platform’s trading offerings, directly impacting thousands of active margin traders globally. Consequently, market participants must adapt their strategies before the 6:00 a.m. UTC deadline. The decision follows a comprehensive review of trading volumes and liquidity metrics across Binance’s extensive portfolio. Moreover, this development highlights the evolving nature of cryptocurrency market infrastructure. Therefore, understanding the implications becomes crucial for informed trading decisions. Binance Delist Margin Pairs: A Detailed Breakdown Binance officially disclosed the affected trading pairs through a formal notice on its website. The exchange will remove both isolated and cross margin support for these specific pairs. According to the announcement, the delisting process begins precisely at 6:00 a.m. UTC on January 6, 2025. Subsequently, all pending orders will undergo automatic cancellation. The exchange strongly advises users to close their positions and transfer assets beforehand. This proactive measure aims to prevent unnecessary liquidations. The complete list of affected margin trading pairs includes: BCH/FDUSD (Bitcoin Cash / First Digital USD) TAO/FDUSD (Bittensor / First Digital USD) AVAX/FDUSD (Avalanche / First Digital USD) LTC/FDUSD (Litecoin / First Digital USD) SUI/FDUSD (Sui / First Digital USD) ADA/FDUSD (Cardano / First Digital USD) LINK/FDUSD (Chainlink / First Digital USD) Additionally, seven other pairs face removal, as confirmed by the exchange’s official documentation. The common denominator across all delisted pairs is the FDUSD stablecoin trading counterpart. This pattern suggests a strategic reassessment of FDUSD’s role within Binance’s margin ecosystem. Historically, exchanges periodically review and optimize their listed pairs. This process ensures platform efficiency and aligns with user demand. For instance, similar reviews occurred in Q3 2024, affecting several altcoin pairs. Understanding the Rationale Behind Exchange Delistings Cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance regularly evaluate their listed trading pairs. Several key metrics typically influence these delisting decisions. Primarily, low trading volume and insufficient liquidity trigger reviews. Exchanges must allocate resources efficiently to maintain optimal performance. Furthermore, regulatory considerations can impact certain asset pairings. Binance’s compliance team continuously monitors global regulatory developments. The exchange’s notice cited “periodic reviews” as the core reason. These reviews assess health metrics for all listed pairs. Consequently, pairs failing to meet specific thresholds face removal. This practice maintains overall market quality on the platform. It also protects users from illiquid markets with high slippage. Data from CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko often preview these trends. For example, FDUSD pairs have shown variable volume across different tokens. Some pairs experienced declining activity over recent months. Exchange analysts track these metrics in real-time. Their reports directly inform the product team’s decisions. Moreover, strategic shifts in business focus play a role. Binance has increasingly emphasized deep liquidity in core markets. This focus enhances user experience for the majority of traders. The delisting allows the exchange to consolidate liquidity. Therefore, remaining pairs should demonstrate improved depth and tighter spreads. Expert Analysis on Market Impact and Trader Adaptation Industry analysts provide crucial context for this development. According to market structure reports from Kaiko and CryptoCompare, FDUSD’s market share in margin trading has fluctuated. “Exchanges routinely optimize their product offerings,” notes Maria Chen, a senior analyst at Digital Asset Research. “The delisting of multiple FDUSD margin pairs likely reflects a consolidation strategy rather than a negative stance on the stablecoin itself.” Chen’s analysis points to Binance’s broader effort to streamline services. Additionally, she highlights the importance of monitoring alternative trading venues. Margin traders must now execute specific actions before the deadline. First, they should close any open positions in the affected pairs. Second, transferring assets to spot wallets or alternative margin pairs is essential. Failure to act may result in automatic position closures by the exchange. These closures could occur at unfavorable prices during low-liquidity periods. Traders using automated strategies require immediate updates to their bots. Historical data shows that similar delistings caused temporary price dislocations. However, markets typically absorb the impact within several trading sessions. The long-term effect on the underlying assets like BCH or AVAX remains minimal, according to historical precedent. The Role of FDUSD in the Cryptocurrency Ecosystem First Digital USD (FDUSD) is a regulated, Hong Kong-based stablecoin. It maintains a 1:1 peg to the US Dollar through reserves. FDUSD launched in 2023 and gained listing on major exchanges quickly. Its integration into Binance’s ecosystem was a significant milestone. The stablecoin competes in a market dominated by USDT and USDC. FDUSD’s value proposition includes regulatory clarity and institutional-grade auditing. Binance initially promoted FDUSD pairs to diversify stablecoin options for users. This move aligned with the exchange’s multi-stablecoin strategy. However, market adoption patterns have varied across different trading pairs. The following table illustrates the trading volume trend for two delisted pairs in the 30 days preceding the announcement, based on aggregated public data: Trading Pair Average Daily Volume (USD) Volume Trend BCH/FDUSD ~$2.1 million Declining (-15% MoM) AVAX/FDUSD ~$3.4 million Stable (±5% MoM) This data suggests volume was not the sole determining factor. Other considerations like operational costs and strategic alignment likely contributed. Importantly, FDUSD remains listed for spot trading against all these assets. The delisting applies exclusively to margin trading. This distinction is crucial for understanding the exchange’s intent. Binance continues to support FDUSD across its core spot and futures products. The action specifically targets underutilized margin pairings. Therefore, interpreting this as a reduction in FDUSD support would be inaccurate. Historical Precedent and Future Expectations for Crypto Exchanges Binance and other major exchanges have a history of periodic pair reviews. For instance, in September 2024, the exchange delisted several BTC and ETH margin pairs. That earlier decision also aimed to improve liquidity concentration. The crypto industry views these actions as standard operational hygiene. They mirror similar practices in traditional finance. Stock exchanges regularly delist securities that fail to meet listing standards. This process ensures market integrity and protects investors. Crypto exchanges adopt these principles as the market matures. Looking ahead, traders can expect more dynamic listing management. Exchanges will likely employ increasingly sophisticated metrics. These metrics may include user count, order book depth, and volatility profiles. The evolution towards quality over quantity seems clear. Binance’s announcement reinforces this industry trend. Furthermore, regulatory developments will influence future decisions. The Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation in Europe sets specific requirements. Exchanges operating globally must navigate a complex compliance landscape. Their product offerings must adapt to these evolving frameworks. Consequently, traders should maintain flexibility in their platform and pair selection. Conclusion Binance’s decision to delist 14 margin trading pairs, including BCH/FDUSD, represents a strategic optimization of its market offerings. This move underscores the exchange’s commitment to maintaining high-quality, liquid markets for its global user base. Traders affected by the January 6, 2025 deadline must take prompt action to manage their positions. The broader implication highlights the cryptocurrency industry’s continued maturation, where exchanges proactively manage their product suites based on performance data and strategic goals. Understanding these periodic adjustments is essential for navigating the dynamic digital asset landscape successfully. The Binance delist margin pairs action, therefore, serves as a case study in modern exchange management and market evolution. FAQs Q1: What should I do if I have an open margin position in one of the delisted pairs? A1: You must manually close your position before January 6, 2025, at 6:00 a.m. UTC. After this time, Binance will cancel all pending orders and may automatically close any remaining positions, potentially at unfavorable prices. Q2: Will I still be able to trade these assets on Binance after the delisting? A2: Yes. The delisting applies only to specific margin trading pairs. All affected assets (BCH, AVAX, ADA, etc.) and FDUSD will remain available for spot trading and likely for margin trading with other quote assets like USDT or USDC. Q3: Why is Binance delisting these particular FDUSD margin pairs? A3: According to Binance, the decision follows a periodic review of all listed pairs. Factors typically include low trading volume, insufficient liquidity, and strategic resource allocation to consolidate liquidity into more active markets. Q4: Does this delisting indicate a problem with FDUSD or the other cryptocurrencies? A4: Not necessarily. Exchange delistings are a normal part of market maintenance. FDUSD remains a listed stablecoin, and the underlying cryptocurrencies continue trading actively. The action reflects the performance of specific trading pairs, not the assets individually. Q5: How often does Binance review and delist trading pairs? A5: Binance conducts periodic reviews, typically quarterly or semi-annually. The frequency can vary based on market conditions. Users should monitor official Binance announcements and system notifications for the latest updates on product changes.

The report shows that most losses were caused by access control failures and operational security weaknesses, like compromised keys and poor off-boarding practices, rather than smart contract bugs. ZachXBT Traces Coinbase Impersonation Scam A scammer posing as a Coinbase help desk worker allegedly stole more than $2 million in cryptocurrency from exchange users, according to blockchain investigator ZachXBT. In a post that was shared on X , ZachXBT said he was able to identify the individual by cross-referencing Telegram group screenshots, social media activity, and on-chain wallet transactions tied to the thefts. The investigator alleged that the suspect, described as a “Canadian threat actor,” carried out Coinbase support impersonation scams over the past year by using social engineering tactics to trick victims into believing they were speaking with a legitimate representative from Coinbase. According to ZachXBT, the stolen funds were allegedly spent on rare social media usernames, bottle service, and gambling. He also shared a leaked video showing the suspected scammer on a phone call with a victim, offering fake customer support. X post from ZachXBT While specific technical details of each incident were not shared, the scams reportedly relied on classic social engineering techniques, where attackers pose as trusted figures to gain victims’ confidence and extract sensitive information or convince them to make fraudulent transactions. ZachXBT said the suspect tried to cover his tracks by repeatedly purchasing expensive Telegram usernames and deleting old accounts, but left a trail through public posts and frequent boasting on social media. According to the investigator, this online behavior made it relatively easy to link accounts, wallets, and movements, despite the efforts to obscure them. ZachXBT also claimed to have identified the alleged scammer’s home address by using publicly available information, though he said he would not publish it due to platform rules. Screenshots shared alongside the post showed what he described as repeated lapses in operational security, including selfies and stories flaunting a lavish lifestyle. Social engineering attacks in crypto is a big issue. Best practices include never responding to unsolicited calls or messages claiming to be from an exchange, avoiding clicking links sent by unknown parties, and always contacting customer support directly through official websites or apps. Legitimate support staff will never ask for seed phrases, login credentials, or request that users send funds to private wallets or move conversations to messaging apps. Web3 Losses Hit $3.95B in 2025 Web3 security losses climbed sharply in 2025, reaching an estimated $3.95 billion. This is according to the latest yearly security report from Hacken. The latest figure is an increase of roughly $1.1 billion compared to 2024, with more than half of the losses attributed to threat actors linked to North Korea. Data shows that losses were heavily front-loaded, peaking at over $2 billion in the first quarter of the year before falling steadily to around $350 million by the fourth quarter. While the decline later in the year may suggest progress, Hacken warned that the overall pattern points to deep, systemic operational weaknesses rather than a temporary spike caused by isolated software bugs. Key findings from Hacken’s 2025 security report According to the report, 2025 made one trend unmistakably clear: while smart contract vulnerabilities are still a risk, the most damaging and least recoverable losses are still driven by access control failures and operational security lapses. Weak key management, compromised signers, and poor off-boarding practices were identified as the dominant causes of major incidents. Hacken estimates that access control and related operational failures accounted for approximately $2.12 billion, or almost 54% of all losses during the year, compared with about $512 million tied to smart contract exploits. Crypto losses by attack type (Source: Hacken ) A single incident played a huge role in shaping the year’s statistics. The breach at Bybit, which resulted in losses of close to $1.5 billion, is described in the report as the largest theft ever recorded in the crypto industry. Hacken said this attack alone helps explain why North Korea-linked clusters were responsible for roughly 52% of all stolen funds in 2025. Hacken’s forensic team pointed out that regulators across major jurisdictions, including the United States and the European Union, have laid out what robust operational security should look like. These expectations include role-based access control, comprehensive logging, secure onboarding and identity verification, institutional-grade custody solutions like hardware security modules, multi-party computation, multi-signature setups, cold storage, and continuous monitoring with anomaly detection. Despite this, Hacken said many Web3 companies continued to operate with insecure practices throughout 2025. Yehor Rudystia, head of forensic at Hacken Extractor, pointed to recurring issues like failing to revoke developer access during off-boarding, relying on a single private key to manage critical protocol functions, and not deploying Endpoint Detection and Response systems. He explained that measures like regular penetration testing, incident response simulations, custody control reviews, and independent audits should be considered non-negotiable for large exchanges and custodians going into 2026. Looking ahead, Hacken expects regulatory oversight to shift from soft guidance toward enforceable requirements.

During this time, sentiment and market participation have understandably been negative, with investors pulling back from the cryptocurrency. However, with the year drawing to an end, a crypto analyst has explained what is expected for Bitcoin next, and why investors aren’t ready for what’s coming. Why Bitcoin Price Could Be Gearing Up For A Big Move Pseudonymous analyst Crypto Waterman took to X to outline the reasons why they believe that Bitcoin could be on the verge of a breakout. While many believe that the top is in, Waterman argues the opposite, using the trends from previous cycle tops to show why the Bitcoin price is yet to top. Related Reading: Can XRP Price Reach $10,000? Expert Says It’s Different Math, Different League For one, the analyst argues that pullbacks like these are part of each cycle, and the previous cycles were no different. But other than the pullback, there is also the gold and silver trend, with both having hit all-time highs in December 2025, while Bitcoin has continued to struggle. Waterman explained that in previous cycles, both gold and silver hit new all-time highs before the Bitcoin price followed later. As such, with both of these assets already hitting new peaks, the crypto analyst believes that leaving Bitcoin to buy gold and silver isn’t a smart choice. Additionally, one of the major markers of a Bitcoin cycle top has been the performance of the Coinbase app on the App Store. In past cycles, Coinbase had risen to number 1 before Bitcoin peaked. Meanwhile, it only reached Number 280 in October when BTC made its $126,000 all-time high. Thus, it suggests that this isn’t the top. Why This Is Not The Top Other factors are also mentioned as to why this is not the top for the Bitcoin price, one of which is the altcoin market performance. Altcoins have continued to struggle during this time, with major alts being down between 60% and 80% from their all-time highs and no sign of an altcoin season in sight.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index also did not cross the 90 mark this cycle, suggesting that euphoria did not reach its peak, as well as the MVRV Z-Score remaining below 3, when the trend is for the Z-Score to reach above 6 before it tops. Given this, the crypto analyst suggests that a number of things will happen. Investors who exited the market back in early 2025 are expected to move back in. Then, those who left in 2024 will follow, and then the 2021-2022 investor cohort will return. Finally, new retail investors join the market, which will be the signal to exit the market.

Perpetual futures monthly trades have exceeded $1 trillion, with Hyperliquid on top. On X, Duong explained that a lethargic altcoin market had motivated traders to move towards leveraging higher yields on perpetual futures. This year, altcoins have largely moved sideways, though the leverage numbers indicate that speculative exposure peaked at approximately 10% and had fallen to around 4% by October’s liquidations. According to Duong, perpetual futures now provide unprecedented amounts of leverage, allowing traders to multiply their exposure with a small amount of capital — decentralized venues command the largest volumes. This milestone marks both the increased interest of traders in highly leveraged positions and the rapid evolution of decentralized trading infrastructure. Perpetual futures enable traders to speculate on crypto price movements with leverage — typically dozens of times their initial amount — with no expiration dates, catering to both veteran speculators and automated trading strategies. Unlike classic centralized exchanges (CEXs), on-chain or decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have helped accelerate this growth. Enhanced protocols, such as Hyperliquid, Lighter, Aster, and edgeX, collectively contribute to large liquidity pools by providing 24/7 automated, non-custodial trading with very low fees on Layer 2 networks. Doung says perpetual futures are integrating with DeFi markets The Coinbase researcher noted that equity perpetual futures may attract traders seeking 24/7, leveraged exposure to U.S. equities that extends beyond traditional exchanges. “We think perpetual futures are evolving beyond isolated, high-leverage trading vehicles and are becoming core, composable primitives within DeFi markets,” he added. He explained further that deep integration between perpetual futures and DeFi will open potent new opportunities for the more efficient use of capital. In practice, this means using perp futures to provide dynamic hedges for liquidity pools, power interest rate instruments, or act as collateral in lending protocols. He further argued that the growing global appetite for U.S. equities, combined with tokenization, could pave the way for equity perpetual futures to disrupt traditional retail trading. Hyperliquid, Aster, and Lighter dominate onchain perpetual futures trading Hyperliquid’s onchain perp futures platform first went live in late 2023. Adoption later picked up in 2024 following the integration of spot trading. So far, the platform reached its highest monthly volume in July, at around $319 billion, according to DeFiLlama, as the crypto perpetual futures space became increasingly competitive. However, shortly after its token generation event in September, Aster briefly claimed the top spot in DEX perpetual futures, with $36 billion traded in a single day, accounting for more than half of the market. In November, the platform Lighter also raised $68 million after launching its public mainnet. Over the past 30 days, according to DeFiLlama data, onchain perpetual futures have traded approximately $972 billion, with Lighter, Aster, and Hyperliquid taking the top three spots. Hyperliquid Labs expects its token allocation in January Meanwhile, Hyperliquid Labs, the agency that launched Hyperliquid exchange, is set to receive its next token allocation. As announced on Sunday via a Discord post, the platform announced that it will receive its second significant token allocation early next month, comprising 1.2 million HYPE tokens ($31.2 million) that will be awarded to team members on January 6. “Moving forward, distributions, if any, will take place on the 6th of the month,” Hyperliquid co-founder Iliensinc said on Discord. On November 29, the team received its first allocation of HYPE tokens, which totaled approximately 1.75 million. Currently, approximately 238.4 million HYPE tokens are in circulation, trading at around $26, with a market capitalization of $6.2 billion and a fully diluted value of $ 25.1 billion.

This single transaction, valued at approximately $228 million, immediately captured the attention of analysts, traders, and institutional observers worldwide, raising questions about its origin and potential market impact. Decoding the $228 Million Ethereum Whale Transfer Blockchain analytics provide the foundational facts for this event. Whale Alert, a prominent service monitoring large cryptocurrency transactions, publicly reported the movement. The transaction originated from a so-called ‘cold wallet’—a private storage address with no known owner—and terminated at a known Binance deposit address. Consequently, this movement represents one of the most significant single-asset transfers to a centralized exchange in early 2025. The sheer scale of the transfer, equivalent to over a quarter of a billion dollars, classifies the sender as a ‘mega-whale,’ an entity capable of influencing market sentiment through its actions. To understand the scale, consider this transaction in context. The transferred amount of 77,385 ETH represents a non-trivial fraction of daily exchange volume. For instance, it equals roughly: ~0.06% of Ethereum’s total circulating supply. Multiple times the average daily trading volume of many mid-tier exchanges. A value greater than the market capitalization of hundreds of smaller altcoins. Such a deposit typically signals one of several intentions: preparation for a large sale (liquidation), a move to engage in leveraged trading products, or a strategic reallocation of assets. However, without identifying the sender, market participants can only analyze the potential outcomes. Historical Context and Market Impact Analysis Historically, large deposits from unknown wallets to exchanges like Binance often precede increased selling pressure. The logic is straightforward: traders move assets to exchanges to sell them. A 2023 study by Chainalysis suggested that deposits exceeding 10,000 ETH to major exchanges correlated with short-term price declines approximately 60% of the time. However, correlation does not equal causation. Sometimes, whales move funds for custody changes, staking, or participation in exchange-only offerings. The immediate market reaction to this specific transfer was notably muted, showcasing the growing maturity and depth of the Ethereum market. Five years ago, a transfer of this magnitude might have triggered a 5-10% price swing due to panic selling. In 2025, the market absorbed the news with relative calm. This resilience demonstrates increased liquidity and the presence of sophisticated institutional players who analyze on-chain data but avoid knee-jerk reactions. Nevertheless, analysts closely monitor Binance’s order books for any unusual sell-wall formations that could materialize from this deposit. Expert Perspectives on Whale Behavior Leading blockchain analysts emphasize the importance of pattern recognition over isolated events. “A single large transfer is a data point, not a trend,” notes Dr. Lena Vance, a cryptoeconomics researcher at the Digital Asset Research Institute. “We assess whale behavior by observing clusters of activity—do we see simultaneous large deposits from multiple addresses? Is there accompanying activity in derivatives markets? In this case, the solitude of the transaction suggests it may be portfolio rebalancing by a large holder, possibly an institution, rather than a coordinated sell-off.” Furthermore, the timing is critical. The transfer occurred amidst a period of relative stability for Ethereum, following the successful completion of several key network upgrades aimed at improving scalability and reducing fees. This context reduces the likelihood that the move is driven by technical concerns about the Ethereum network itself. Instead, macroeconomic factors or internal portfolio strategy for the unknown entity are more probable catalysts. The Mechanics and Transparency of Blockchain Tracking This event highlights the transparent yet pseudonymous nature of public blockchains like Ethereum. Anyone can view the transaction details on a block explorer: Transaction Hash: A unique identifier for the transfer. From: The anonymous sender’s address (a long alphanumeric string). To: The Binance deposit address. Value: 77,385 ETH. Status: Confirmed. Timestamp: Date and time of the block confirmation. While the ‘from’ address is unknown, its history is fully public. Analysts can trace its previous transactions, examining if it received funds from known entities like mining pools, venture capital firms, or other exchanges. This forensic capability allows for educated hypotheses about the whale’s identity—be it a long-term holder from Ethereum’s early days, a crypto-native investment fund, or a corporate treasury. The permanent, verifiable record is a cornerstone of blockchain’s value proposition, providing unparalleled audit trails for major financial movements. Conclusion The transfer of 77,385 ETH to Binance stands as a powerful reminder of the scale and transparency inherent to digital asset markets. While its immediate market impact was subdued, the transaction provides a valuable case study in on-chain analytics, whale behavior, and market maturity. It underscores the importance of contextual analysis over sensationalism, demonstrating that large movements are now part of the normal ebb and flow of a multi-trillion dollar asset class. Moving forward, the community will watch whether this ETH remains on the exchange or is deployed into new protocols, providing further clues to the whale’s long-term strategy. FAQs Q1: What does a large ETH transfer to an exchange usually mean? Typically, it indicates the holder intends to trade, sell, or use the assets within the exchange’s ecosystem (e.g., for staking, loans, or launches). It is often interpreted as a potential precursor to selling activity, but not always. Q2: Who could be behind such a large, anonymous transfer? Possible entities include early Ethereum adopters, cryptocurrency mining pools, investment funds (hedge funds, family offices), or the treasury of a blockchain-based project. Without further identifying information, it remains speculative. Q3: Why didn’t the Ethereum price crash immediately after this news? Modern crypto markets are more liquid and populated by institutional investors who rely on comprehensive data analysis. A single deposit, without accompanying sell orders or negative fundamental news, is often viewed as a neutral event until actionable trading intent is demonstrated. Q4: How can services like Whale Alert track these transactions? They monitor public blockchain data in real-time, using algorithms to flag transactions that exceed predefined value thresholds. All this data is inherently public on transparent networks like Ethereum. Q5: What are the other reasons a whale might move ETH to Binance besides selling? Alternatives include using the ETH as collateral for borrowing other assets, participating in a Binance Launchpool or exclusive token sale, moving to a different custody solution, or simply consolidating assets from multiple wallets into one for management purposes.

The acquisition comes just eight months after Manus launched with a viral demo that captured Silicon Valley’s attention, demonstrating AI agents capable of screening job candidates, planning vacations, and analyzing stock portfolios with unprecedented sophistication. This strategic purchase represents Meta’s most aggressive push yet into practical, revenue-generating AI applications, positioning the social media giant against competitors like OpenAI and Google in the race for AI dominance. Meta’s $2 Billion Manus Acquisition: Strategic Implications Meta’s acquisition of Manus represents a calculated strategic shift for the technology conglomerate. For years, Meta has invested heavily in AI infrastructure, spending approximately $60 billion on computing resources and research. However, investors have grown increasingly concerned about the return on this massive investment. Manus provides Meta with something critically important: a proven, revenue-generating AI product. The startup recently announced it had crossed $100 million in annual recurring revenue with millions of users, demonstrating commercial viability that Meta’s own AI initiatives have struggled to achieve at scale. The $2 billion purchase price matches the valuation Manus was seeking for its next funding round, according to Wall Street Journal reports. This valuation represents a fourfold increase from the company’s $500 million post-money valuation in April 2024, when Benchmark led a $75 million funding round. The rapid appreciation reflects both Manus’s explosive growth and the intense competition for promising AI startups among technology giants. Meta plans to maintain Manus as an independent operation while integrating its AI agents across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp platforms, where Meta AI already operates. The Meteoric Rise of Singapore’s AI Unicorn Manus’s journey from unknown startup to $2 billion acquisition target represents one of the fastest ascents in technology history. The company materialized in spring 2024 with a demonstration video that immediately went viral across technology circles. The slick presentation showed AI agents performing complex tasks that previously required human intervention, including screening job candidates with nuanced understanding, planning multi-destination vacations with budget constraints, and analyzing stock portfolios with sophisticated risk assessment. Initially, Manus claimed its technology outperformed OpenAI’s Deep Research system, though independent verification remained limited. Despite this, the startup attracted immediate attention from prominent investors. Benchmark’s general partner Chetan Puttagunta joined Manus’s board following the April funding round, while other notable backers included Tencent, ZhenFund, and HSG (formerly Sequoia China). The company’s rapid growth trajectory surprised many industry observers, particularly given its aggressive pricing strategy of $39 or $199 monthly subscriptions for a service still in testing phase. Manus Timeline: From Launch to Acquisition Date Milestone Valuation/Investment Spring 2024 Company launches with viral demo video Undisclosed seed round April 2024 Benchmark leads $75M funding round $500M post-money valuation Mid-2024 Relocates headquarters from Beijing to Singapore N/A Late 2024 Announces $100M+ annual recurring revenue N/A Early 2025 Meta announces $2B acquisition $2B purchase price Revenue Generation and Market Validation Manus’s financial performance provided crucial validation for Meta’s acquisition decision. The startup achieved several remarkable milestones in its brief existence: Rapid User Adoption: Millions of users signed up within months of launch Strong Revenue Growth: Crossed $100 million in annual recurring revenue Enterprise Traction: Business clients adopted AI agents for recruitment and analysis Technical Validation: Demonstrated capabilities beyond current market offerings Bloomberg initially questioned Manus’s pricing strategy, noting the $39 and $199 monthly fees seemed aggressive for a service in testing phase. However, the company’s subsequent revenue performance silenced most critics. This commercial success particularly appealed to Meta executives facing investor pressure to demonstrate returns on their massive AI infrastructure investments. Geopolitical Considerations and Regulatory Scrutiny The acquisition faces potential regulatory hurdles due to Manus’s origins and ownership structure. The startup launched eight months ago with Chinese founders who established parent company Butterfly Effect in Beijing during 2022. The company relocated to Singapore in mid-2024, but its Chinese connections have already attracted political attention. Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican and senior member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, criticized Benchmark’s investment in Manus back in May 2024. Cornyn questioned on social media platform X whether American investors should subsidize technology development that could benefit China’s competitive position. His concerns reflect broader bipartisan consensus in Congress regarding technology competition with China. Meta has proactively addressed these concerns by announcing that Manus will sever all ties with Chinese investors following the acquisition. A company spokesperson confirmed to Nikkei Asia that Manus will discontinue services and operations in China entirely. This geopolitical dimension adds complexity to an already significant technology deal. Regulatory approval processes may involve multiple government agencies examining national security implications. However, Meta’s clear separation plan and Manus’s Singapore headquarters likely mitigate the most serious concerns. The company’s proactive approach demonstrates lessons learned from previous technology deals facing similar scrutiny. Integration Strategy and Competitive Landscape Meta plans to integrate Manus’s technology across its ecosystem while maintaining the startup’s operational independence. This balanced approach allows Meta to leverage Manus’s innovation without stifling the entrepreneurial culture that drove its rapid success. The integration will focus on several key areas: Enhanced Meta AI: Improving existing chatbot capabilities across platforms Business Solutions: Developing AI tools for advertisers and enterprise clients Consumer Applications: Implementing vacation planning and personal assistant features Developer Tools: Creating APIs for third-party integration with Manus technology The acquisition positions Meta more competitively against other technology giants investing heavily in AI. Google continues developing its Gemini AI system, while Microsoft maintains its partnership with OpenAI. Amazon recently announced expanded AI initiatives through AWS, and Apple has quietly built AI capabilities into its ecosystem. Manus gives Meta distinctive technology in practical AI applications rather than just research capabilities. Market Impact and Industry Response Industry analysts predict several immediate effects from this acquisition: Valuation Inflation: Other promising AI startups may see increased valuations Accelerated Competition: Rivals may pursue similar acquisition strategies Talent Migration: AI researchers and engineers may gravitate toward Meta Regulatory Attention: Increased scrutiny of major technology acquisitions The deal also validates Singapore’s growing importance as an AI innovation hub. The city-state has actively cultivated technology startups through favorable policies and investment incentives. Manus’s success from its Singapore base will likely attract more AI companies to establish operations in the region, potentially creating a new center of gravity in global AI development. Financial Implications and Investor Perspective For Meta investors, the Manus acquisition represents both opportunity and validation. The company’s massive AI infrastructure investments have concerned some shareholders who questioned the return timeline. Manus provides immediate revenue generation and proven commercial applications that can justify continued investment. The $2 billion price, while substantial, represents approximately 3.3% of Meta’s annual infrastructure spending, making it a relatively modest bet with potentially significant returns. Early Manus investors achieved exceptional returns on their investments. Benchmark’s $75 million investment from April 2024 would be worth approximately $300 million in the acquisition, representing a fourfold return in less than a year. Other investors including Tencent and ZhenFund similarly benefit from the rapid appreciation. These returns will likely fuel further investment in AI startups as venture capitalists seek similar outcomes. Meta’s stock performance following the announcement will provide important market validation. Previous major acquisitions have sometimes pressured stock prices in the short term, but strategic acquisitions that demonstrate clear revenue potential typically receive favorable market responses. Analysts will closely watch integration execution and revenue contribution metrics in coming quarters. Conclusion Meta’s acquisition of Manus represents a pivotal moment in the artificial intelligence industry, demonstrating the intense competition for promising AI startups and the strategic importance of practical, revenue-generating applications. The $2 billion deal accelerates Mark Zuckerberg’s AI transformation vision while addressing investor concerns about returns on infrastructure investments. As Meta integrates Manus’s technology across its platforms, users can expect more sophisticated AI assistants and business tools. However, regulatory scrutiny and geopolitical considerations add complexity to this otherwise straightforward technology deal. The acquisition ultimately validates Singapore’s emergence as an AI innovation hub and signals continued consolidation in the rapidly evolving artificial intelligence sector. FAQs Q1: How much did Meta pay to acquire Manus? Meta acquired Manus for $2 billion, matching the valuation the startup was seeking for its next funding round. Q2: What does Manus’s AI technology do? Manus develops AI agents capable of screening job candidates, planning vacations, analyzing stock portfolios, and performing other complex tasks that typically require human intelligence. Q3: Why is there geopolitical concern about this acquisition? Manus has Chinese founders who started the parent company in Beijing before relocating to Singapore, raising concerns about technology transfer and national security implications. Q4: How will Meta integrate Manus into its existing platforms? Meta plans to maintain Manus as an independent operation while weaving its AI agents into Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp to enhance existing Meta AI capabilities. Q5: What was Manus’s revenue before the acquisition? The startup recently announced it had crossed $100 million in annual recurring revenue with millions of users, demonstrating strong commercial traction despite its brief existence.

Crypto Treasury Company’s Turmoil Intensifies On Monday, Nasdaq-listed crypto treasury company Alt5 Sigma is facing renewed scrutiny after appointing a new audit company with an expired and inactive license earlier this month, the Financial Times initially reported. The Las Vegas-based company rebranded from a biotech company to a Digital Asset Treasury Company (DAT) earlier this year, seeking to become the first publicly traded firm to accumulate WLFI, the token of US President Donald Trump’s crypto ventures, World Liberty Financial. As the report noted , the company’s financial position has turned murky over the past few months due to its failure to file quarterly results on schedule. Now, its recent switch of auditors has deepened its current position as the newly appointed firm, Victor Mokuolu CPA PLLC, was allegedly fined by accounting regulators and failed an inspection under the standard peer review process. According to the Financial Times, filings in the state of Texas show that the company’s licence expired in August. Meanwhile, the board’s records show that its license has not been renewed by December 26. Therefore, state regulations prohibit the firm from doing any audit work until the licence is renewed. The audit company has reportedly been working for over two years to address its deficiencies, which previously resulted in a failing grade under the accounting profession’s peer review process in 2023. This year’s failure to renew its license follows the Texas State Board of Public Accountancy and another US regulator’s actions against the firm for “repeatedly failing to file regulatory paperwork on time.” In a statement to the news media outlet, Alt5 Sigma affirmed that the auditor is “undergoing a peer review per Texas State Board of Accountancy regulations and will be completed by the end of January 2026, at which point the auditor expects the firm’s licence to be active.” The Trump-backed crypto treasury firm emphasized that “No reviews or audits of Alt5’s financial statements will be issued by our auditor until the firm’s licence is active.” In an update, the Financial Times added that Alt5 Sigma fired the audit firm on Christmas Day following its inquiries about the issue. A regulatory filing made on Monday reportedly shows that the company has hired LJ Soldinger Associates as its new accounting firm. Alt5 Sigma Risks Nasdaq Delisting The controversial December 8 appointment comes amid a period of turmoil for the company , the report noted, as it already risks being delisted from Nasdaq, where it trades under the ticker “ALTS.” The company failed to submit its quarterly results for the period ending in late September, blaming the delay on the “timeliness and responsiveness” of its previous auditor, who seemingly quit last month. This has opened the door to a potential delisting from the stock exchange. In August, World Liberty Financial unveiled its partnership with Alt5 Sigma and became an investor in the technology firm, which sought to raise $1.5 billion for its crypto treasury strategy based on WLFI. As a result, multiple World Liberty Financial co-founders joined Alt5 Sigma’s board. Notably, Zach Witkoff, son of President Trump’s Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, was appointed as chairman of the crypto treasury firm. Similarly, Eric Trump joined the company’s board as a director, while Zak Folkman became a board observer. Nonetheless, Trump stepped down from his position in September, just weeks after being appointed, as revealed in a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing Jonathan Hugh, Alt5’s Chief Financial Officer (CFO), left the company after just three months, while chief executive Peter Tassiopoulos resigned in October. Meanwhile, board member David Danziger parted ways with the firm in November. This also puts the company “in violation of a requirement to have an audit committee of a certain size and with accounting experience,” the report concluded.",Crypto News|ALT5 Sigma|Crypto Treasury Company|Digital Asset Treasury Company|Doland Trump|Eric Trump|Nasdaq Stock|Trump Family crypto venture|WLFI|WLFI token|WLFI Treasury|WLFIUSDT,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-30 06:00:08

The announcement, made via the project’s official X account on February 15, 2025, outlines an equitable distribution model that could reshape competitive dynamics in the rapidly expanding DeFi derivatives sector. This strategic token launch arrives during a period of unprecedented growth for decentralized perpetual trading, which has seen volumes increase by over 300% since 2023 according to industry analytics firm DefiLlama. Lighter LIT Token Launch Details and Distribution Framework The Lighter team revealed comprehensive details about their upcoming LIT token distribution. According to their announcement, the token allocation will follow a balanced three-way split among critical stakeholders. Specifically, the ecosystem will receive one-third of tokens to fund future development and community initiatives. Meanwhile, the project team and early investors will each receive equal portions of the remaining allocation. This distribution model mirrors successful approaches implemented by leading decentralized exchanges like dYdX and GMX, which have demonstrated the importance of balanced token economics for long-term sustainability. Industry analysts immediately noted several distinctive aspects of Lighter’s approach. First, the equal distribution among three primary stakeholder groups represents a departure from more investor-heavy models seen in earlier DeFi projects. Second, the announcement emphasized ecosystem development as a primary allocation category, signaling strong commitment to platform growth beyond immediate financial returns. Third, the timing coincides with increasing regulatory clarity around exchange tokens in major jurisdictions, potentially positioning LIT favorably for broader adoption. Decentralized Perpetual Futures Market Context and Competitive Landscape The perpetual futures market has undergone dramatic transformation since 2020, evolving from centralized dominance to robust decentralized alternatives. Currently, decentralized perpetual exchanges command approximately 25% of total crypto derivatives volume, up from just 3% in 2021 according to CryptoCompare data. Lighter enters this competitive space alongside established players including dYdX, GMX, Gains Network, and Perpetual Protocol, each with distinct technical architectures and token models. Several factors differentiate Lighter’s approach within this crowded marketplace. The platform utilizes an innovative automated market maker design specifically optimized for high-leverage trading. Additionally, Lighter incorporates cross-margin capabilities across multiple assets, a feature that reduces liquidation risks for traders. The forthcoming LIT token will integrate directly into this technical infrastructure, potentially serving governance, fee discount, and staking functions based on industry standard practices. Expert Analysis: Token Economics and Market Implications Cryptocurrency economists emphasize the importance of sustainable token models for exchange platforms. “Successful exchange tokens typically balance utility, governance, and value accrual mechanisms,” explains Dr. Elena Rodriguez, blockchain economist at Cambridge Digital Assets Programme. “The equal three-way distribution model proposed by Lighter suggests careful consideration of long-term alignment between users, builders, and funders. However, the specific utility functions and emission schedule will ultimately determine LIT’s market reception.” Historical data supports this analytical perspective. Exchange tokens with clear utility and balanced distribution have generally outperformed purely speculative counterparts during market cycles. For instance, tokens providing fee discounts, governance rights, and revenue sharing have demonstrated stronger retention during bear markets according to Token Terminal research. The LIT token announcement notably avoids specifying exact utility functions, leaving room for community input during development phases. Technical Architecture and Security Considerations Lighter’s underlying technology represents a significant innovation in decentralized perpetual trading. The platform employs a virtual automated market maker design that maintains constant liquidity without requiring traditional liquidity providers. This architecture potentially reduces impermanent loss concerns while maintaining competitive spreads. Security audits conducted by leading firms CertiK and Trail of Bits have confirmed the robustness of Lighter’s smart contract implementation, with no critical vulnerabilities identified in recent assessments. The integration of the LIT token into this technical framework presents both opportunities and challenges. From a security perspective, additional smart contract complexity introduces potential attack vectors that require careful mitigation. However, properly implemented token functionality could significantly enhance platform capabilities. Potential integrations might include collateralization options, governance mechanisms for protocol parameters, or loyalty reward systems for active traders. Regulatory Environment and Compliance Framework The regulatory landscape for exchange tokens has evolved considerably leading into 2025. Recent guidance from international bodies including the Financial Stability Board and International Organization of Securities Commissions has provided clearer frameworks for token classification. Lighter’s announcement timing appears strategically aligned with these developments, potentially positioning LIT within regulatory safe harbors for utility tokens rather than security classifications. Several jurisdictions have established specific guidelines for exchange tokens. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation, fully implemented in 2024, creates distinct categories for utility tokens with limited payment functions. Similarly, Singapore’s Payment Services Act provides exemptions for tokens primarily facilitating access to specific platforms. Lighter’s documentation emphasizes the LIT token’s intended use within its ecosystem, potentially aligning with these regulatory frameworks. Market Response and Trader Sentiment Analysis Initial market response to the LIT token announcement has been cautiously optimistic according to social sentiment analysis tools. Crypto Twitter engagement metrics show predominantly positive reactions, with particular emphasis on the equitable distribution model. Derivatives traders have expressed interest in potential fee reduction mechanisms, while DeFi enthusiasts have highlighted governance possibilities. However, some community members have requested additional details regarding token vesting schedules and emission rates, which the Lighter team has indicated will follow in subsequent announcements. Comparative analysis with previous exchange token launches reveals interesting patterns. Successful launches typically feature transparent communication, gradual information release, and community involvement in final parameter decisions. Less successful launches often suffer from information asymmetry, excessive initial circulating supply, or unclear utility propositions. Lighter’s measured announcement approach suggests learning from these historical precedents. Future Development Roadmap and Ecosystem Expansion The LIT token launch represents just one component of Lighter’s broader development strategy. The project roadmap includes several additional milestones for 2025, including cross-chain expansion, advanced order types, and institutional gateway development. Token integration will facilitate these initiatives by aligning stakeholder incentives and providing governance mechanisms for protocol evolution. Ecosystem development constitutes a particularly significant aspect of Lighter’s vision. The allocated tokens will fund various initiatives including developer grants, liquidity mining programs, and educational resources. This comprehensive approach mirrors successful ecosystem strategies implemented by platforms like Uniswap and Aave, which have cultivated robust developer communities and diverse integrations. Conclusion The Lighter LIT token announcement marks a strategic evolution for the decentralized perpetual futures exchange, potentially enhancing its competitive position within the rapidly growing DeFi derivatives sector. The balanced distribution model, technical innovation, and regulatory awareness demonstrated in the announcement suggest careful planning and industry awareness. As the project progresses toward token launch, market participants will closely monitor utility specifications, emission details, and integration timelines. Ultimately, the LIT token’s success will depend on its ability to deliver tangible value to traders, governance participants, and the broader Lighter ecosystem while navigating an increasingly complex regulatory and competitive landscape. FAQs Q1: What is the Lighter LIT token?

According to Barclays data debit and credit card spending fell, even as households still found ways to treat themselves to small indulgences and memorable moments. That is the first year-over-year decline since 2020 — a period in which spending fell 7.1% as the pandemic shut down businesses and prevented far-flung families from gathering for traditional celebrations. Economists said the dip was a sign that households were beginning to feel pressure from inflation, stagnant wage growth, and broader economic uncertainty. Official figures released last week reinforced the picture. Disposable incomes adjusted for inflation fell 0.8% in the third quarter, marking the longest stretch without any income growth since late 2014. Weak spending and high savings rates are a “ball and chain” for the British economy , which is highly dependent on some recovery in consumer demand to achieve even modest growth forecasts, analysts at Barclays said. Rising prices push households to cut spending Rising prices in key sectors are putting pressure on households across the UK. Grocery prices fell 1.7% over the past year, while the cost of broader essentials dropped 2.3%. For households that stick to what they can genuinely afford, rather than splurging on luxury items like designer goods, discretionary spending — including clothing, electronics, entertainment, and recreation — rose by just 0.8%. In contrast, spending on non-discretionary items such as housing, transportation, and bills remained the dominant part of household budgets. However, economists warned that the ongoing caution of households could dampen the UK’s short-term growth outlook. The OBR has already pencilled in a little growth; doing more to rebuild consumer confidence is key to achieving this. Such weak consumer sentiment, held back by an increased cost of living and stagnant growth in take-home pay, as well as concerns about the economy’s outlook, could still act as a drag on private consumption in the future, analysts said. Given that households account for a vast proportion of aggregate demand, their reluctance to consume might be Britain’s Achilles’ heel in the near term. Consumers splurge on experiences and small indulgences Although overall spending was down, consumers are still treating themselves to smaller luxuries that offer instant gratification, according to Barclays. Spending on health, beauty, and pharmacy products was the standout, increasing 9.5% over the year. This is consistent with the so-called “lipstick effect,” where individuals increase consumption of low-cost luxuries instead of other products to maintain a high mental health status during financial pressure. Entertainment and experiences were also relatively robust. Big music tours from artists like Oasis, Coldplay, and Sabrina Carpenter drew robust spending, revealing that consumers are willing to splurge on experiences even as they pull back elsewhere. Barclays said these tendencies reflect a more discerning approach to consumption. Consumers are opting for experiences over big-ticket purchases — small indulgences instead of extravagant ones — mirroring not only squeezed household budgets but also a craving for emotional fulfillment. While those spending habits provide some relief to businesses within the leisure and beauty sectors, they are unlikely to compensate for broader declines in household consumption, analysts said. The data gives a mixed picture for the UK economy. Although households continue to pay for experiences and small pleasures, the overall spending pullback reflects the headwinds confronting the economy, as inflation lingers and income growth remains flat.

The exchange projected XRP could reach a range of $9 to $13 during the current market cycle. XRP currently trades at $1.87, far below the suggested target and well under its prior all-time high. The contrast between XRP’s current price and Uphold’s forecast excited many in the XRP army. However, it also raised immediate questions about timing, catalysts, and whether the market can support such a move. The post did not include a timeline beyond referencing this cycle, leaving room for more debate. JUST IN: Uphold exchange predicts $9-$13 $XRP this cycle — Wendy O (@CryptoWendyO) December 28, 2025 What a $9 to $13 XRP Would Represent A move from $1.87 to the lower end of the projected range would require a sharp shift in momentum. It would signal renewed confidence in XRP’s role within crypto markets and payment infrastructure . At $9, XRP would trade at nearly 5x its current level. At $13, the gain would be approximately 7x. Such prices would also place XRP among the largest digital assets by market value. It would flip Ethereum and become the second-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap exceeding $700 billion. Supporters view it as achievable if liquidity expands and institutional use grows. Critics see it as difficult, given current supply levels and competition within the sector. Community Reaction Remains Mixed Responses to the post showed a wide range of views. Some users argued that high price targets serve mainly to attract liquidity rather than reflect realistic outcomes. Others suggested XRP could approach $9 next year. A few commenters expressed confidence in Uphold’s insight into market behavior. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Skeptical voices also appeared. Some questioned the usefulness of cycle-based predictions in today’s market, arguing that the cycles cannot be clearly defined. Others pointed to XRP’s supply and market cap as major obstacles to reaching double-digit prices. XRP’s Position Going Into the Cycle XRP enters this phase of the market with a unique profile. It has an established user base, long-standing support, and ongoing relevance in cross-border payments. It also has full regulatory clarity in the U.S., and regulated XRP-backed vehicles, such as spot ETFs have received notable attention , showing interest from institutional investors. At the same time, XRP has lagged some major assets during previous rallies. That history shapes how traders interpret projections, such as $9 to $13. While some investors see risks, many see the current level as an opportunity, and Uphold’s prediction has reinforced their confidence.

This transaction, valued at approximately $330 million, represents one of the most significant single-entity deposits of 2025 and has ignited intense speculation about market sentiment among the ecosystem’s most influential holders. The event, reported by blockchain analytics firm Onchainlens, coincides with the same address grappling with substantial unrealized losses on a highly leveraged trading position, adding a critical layer of financial pressure to the narrative. Consequently, this action provides a rare, high-stakes window into the strategies and potential distress signals of crypto’s earliest and most substantial investors. Decoding the $330 Million Ethereum Deposit to Binance The core transaction is both simple and monumental. According to on-chain data, the Ethereum deposit originated from a wallet address beginning with ‘0x99E1E.’ The funds moved directly to a known Binance deposit wallet. In cryptocurrency markets, such large-scale transfers to centralized exchanges like Binance are widely interpreted as a precursor to selling activity. The rationale is straightforward: traders typically move assets to exchanges to access order books, liquidity, and trading pairs not available in private wallets. Therefore, a deposit of this magnitude from a long-term holder often signals a potential intent to liquidate a position, which can exert downward pressure on the asset’s price if executed. However, the story deepens considerably with further investigation. Blockchain sleuths quickly uncovered that the sending address is not merely a passive storage wallet. Instead, it is actively engaged in decentralized finance (DeFi) and perpetual futures trading. Specifically, the entity maintains a five-times leveraged long position on the Hyperliquid derivatives platform. This position is spread across three major assets: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). At the time of the ETH transfer, this leveraged bet was reportedly underwater, facing an unrealized loss of roughly $50 million. This context transforms a simple deposit into a complex financial maneuver, potentially driven by a need for liquidity to meet margin calls or to strategically rebalance a pressured portfolio. The Anatomy of a Crypto Whale’s Portfolio To understand the potential motivations, one must analyze the typical behavior and tools available to large holders, or ‘whales.’ Their actions are rarely one-dimensional. For instance, a deposit could serve multiple purposes beyond an imminent sale. It might be collateral for borrowing, a move to participate in a high-yield exchange offering, or a step in a complex arbitrage strategy. The concurrent existence of a leveraged loss, however, strongly tilts the probability toward a defensive or corrective action. Market analysts note that when facing liquidation risks on one platform, whales often move assets to raise capital or provide additional collateral elsewhere, creating a chain reaction of on-chain activity. Bitcoin OG and the Psychology of Long-Term Holders The term ‘Bitcoin OG’ carries significant weight in cryptocurrency circles. It refers to individuals or entities who acquired Bitcoin in its earliest days, often before 2013, and have held through multiple market cycles. These holders are celebrated for their conviction and are often perceived as having a high pain threshold and a long-term vision. Their actions are scrutinized because they are seen as savvy, patient, and less likely to panic-sell. Therefore, when an OG moves a vast sum of a different asset like Ethereum, it sends a powerful signal. It may indicate a strategic shift in portfolio allocation, a loss of confidence in a specific asset’s short-term prospects, or a pragmatic response to urgent financial needs unrelated to core investment theses. Historically, large deposits from OGs have sometimes preceded local market tops or periods of increased volatility. For example, similar movements were observed before the market corrections of 2018 and 2022. However, correlation does not equal causation. Each event has unique drivers. In this case, the $50 million leveraged loss is a glaring, specific catalyst that distinguishes it from a purely profit-taking exit. This suggests the move may be more about risk management on a losing trade than a fundamental bearish turn on Ethereum itself. Nevertheless, the market often reacts first and asks questions later, which is why these events cause immediate ripples. Leverage and Liquidity: A Dangerous Dance The use of high leverage, such as the 5x position identified, magnifies both gains and losses. In a volatile market, a relatively small price move against the position can trigger automatic liquidations by the protocol. To avoid this, traders must either add more collateral or close part of their position. The $330 million ETH deposit could provide the necessary firepower to shore up the Hyperliquid position, effectively using the ETH as new collateral to prevent the $50 million paper loss from becoming a realized one. This practice, known as ‘defending a position,’ is common but risky, as it can lead to even greater losses if the market continues to move unfavorably. Market Impact and Broader Implications The immediate market impact of such news is typically a mix of speculation and caution. Other traders monitor these flows closely, using them to gauge sentiment. The potential for $330 million worth of sell-side pressure on Ethereum is non-trivial, though Binance’s deep liquidity could absorb a gradual sell-off without catastrophic price effects. The more significant impact may be psychological, affecting trader confidence and potentially leading to increased selling from smaller investors who follow whale movements. Furthermore, this event highlights several key trends in the 2025 crypto landscape: Increased Transparency: Tools like Onchainlens make whale activity instantly public, increasing market efficiency and sometimes volatility. Cross-Protocol Activity: Modern whales operate across CeFi (Binance), DeFi (Hyperliquid), and simple holding, creating interconnected risk profiles. The Ethereum Ecosystem: Despite the rise of other Layer 1s like Solana, Ethereum remains a core holding and liquidity tool for major players, as evidenced by its use here as a multi-million dollar maneuvering asset. Conclusion The $330 million Ethereum deposit to Binance by a Bitcoin OG is a multifaceted event rooted in both on-chain data and off-chain market mechanics. While the simple narrative points to a potential large sale, the deeper context of a $50 million unrealized loss on a leveraged position reveals a likely story of risk management and liquidity rebalancing. This action underscores the complex, high-stakes strategies employed by cryptocurrency’s largest holders and serves as a real-time case study in how leverage can force significant moves even from the most steadfast investors. For the broader market, it is a reminder of the transparency and interconnectedness of blockchain finance, where every major transaction tells a story of strategy, pressure, and adaptation. FAQs Q1: What does ‘Bitcoin OG’ mean? A1: ‘Bitcoin OG’ is a term for ‘Original Gangster’ and refers to early adopters and long-term holders of Bitcoin, often from the cryptocurrency’s first few years. They are respected for their early vision and historical holding patterns. Q2: Why is a large deposit to an exchange like Binance seen as a potential sell signal? A2: Centralized exchanges are the primary venues for converting crypto to fiat currency or other assets. Large deposits typically indicate an intent to use the exchange’s trading tools, with selling being the most common reason, as holders have little need to keep such large sums on an exchange for pure storage. Q3: What is an unrealized loss? A3: An unrealized loss is a decrease in the value of an open investment that has not yet been sold. It is a ‘paper loss.’ The loss only becomes realized, or locked in, when the position is closed at the lower price. The whale’s $50 million loss on Hyperliquid was unrealized at the time of the ETH transfer. Q4: How does a leveraged long position work? A4: A leveraged long position allows a trader to borrow funds to amplify their exposure to an asset’s price increase. For example, 5x leverage means a $20 million investment controls a $100 million position. While this magnifies profits if the price rises, it also magnifies losses if the price falls, potentially leading to liquidation if the loss exceeds the trader’s initial collateral. Q5: Could this deposit be for something other than selling? A5: Yes. While selling is the most direct interpretation, other possibilities include using the ETH as collateral for a loan, participating in a staking or earning program on Binance, or preparing for a complex multi-asset trade. The context of the leveraged loss, however, makes a liquidity-related motive most probable.

Analyst Lays Out the Warning Signs,https://cryptopotato.com/is-a-0-80-xrp-coming-analyst-lays-out-the-warning-signs/,"Ripple’s cross-border token has been rejected on multiple occasions at both key supports at $2.00 and $1.90, which have now turned into significant resistance levels. Popular analyst Ali Martinez outlined a couple of reasons why the asset might be due for another shock, and a possible dump by over 55%. In a recent post on X, the analyst with more than 160,000 followers warned that the network activity on Ripple’s platform has plunged in recent weeks. He noted that the number of active addresses has decreased from 46,000 to under 39,000 in the span of just several days. However, this is somewhat expected given the Holiday season, as investors tend to stay away. His second reason might be more concerning, as it involves whales – perhaps the most crucial investor cohort behind every cryptocurrency. They have been on a substantial selling spree for over two months now. In fact, they began disposing of their XRP tokens once it became known that the long-anticipated spot Ripple ETFs would go live in the US in November. At one point, they had dumped almost 1.5 billion tokens in less than a month, and they have continued selling as he reported recently.

56582227,649446,1767078005,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56582227.jpeg,Ethereum TVL Set For Explosive Growth: Sharplink CEO Foresees Tenfold Surge In 2026,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-tvl-set-for-explosive-growth-sharplink-ceo/,"Joseph Chalom, the CEO of Sharplink, has outlined an optimistic forecast for Ethereum’s (ETH) future, emphasizing a significant increase in the total value locked (TVL) within the network in the coming year. Stablecoin Expansion And Institutional Interest According to a report from CoinMarketCap, Chalom anticipates that the stablecoin market will soar to $500 billion by December 2026. Currently, the total market capitalization for stablecoins stands at approximately $308.46 billion, suggesting a 62% growth from current figures. Given that Ethereum is responsible for processing over half of all stablecoin transactions across various blockchain networks, the projected expansion in stablecoin issuance and transaction volume is set to significantly elevate the network’s TVL. Chalom further predicts that the market for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) will also witness substantial growth, potentially reaching a total value of $300 billion next year. This is expected to move beyond tokenizing individual securities and funds to encompass complete fund complexes, thereby increasing Ethereum’s relevance in the financial ecosystem. Key to this expected growth is the increasing involvement of major financial institutions from traditional finance such as BlackRock, which has shown heightened interest in blockchain technologies over the past year. Chalom predicts that it could serve as a catalyst for moving significant assets onto Ethereum’s infrastructure. Can Ethereum Overcome Price Challenges? The rise in total value locked usually indicates increased network utilization, which can bolster market sentiment and may influence Ethereum price dynamics. Currently, data shows ETH’s TVL at approximately $68.20 billion. Crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen recently expressed skepticism about Ethereum reaching new price highs in 2026, particularly in light of Bitcoin’s (BTC) market conditions. However, Chalom anticipates that sovereign wealth fund holdings and tokenization efforts on Ethereum could grow five- to tenfold in the coming year. This potential increase is attributed to competitive pressures that may encourage institutional investors , who have previously been hesitant about cryptocurrency exposure, to reconsider their strategies as peer adoption accelerates. Moreover, Chalom believes that the integration of on-chain artificial intelligence (AI) agents and prediction markets will gain mainstream traction in 2026, further driving activity and adding value to the Ethereum ecosystem. Ultimately, Sharplink’s CEO stressed that the convergence of institutional interest from traditional finance firms, expanded applications, and the involvement of sovereign funds could significantly position Ethereum for impressive TVL growth in the near future. Currently, Ethereum is trading at around $2,930, marking a 13% year-to-date decline for the leading altcoin. Compared to its all-time high of $4,964 reached earlier this year, the cryptocurrency is currently trading 40% below this level.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/finance-expert-xrp-is-the-future-of-cross-border-payments-heres-why/,"Global payments still move through systems built decades ago, and transactions cross borders slowly at high costs. That reality explains why new digital solutions keep gaining attention. Recent comments from crypto commentator Levi Rietveld underscore why XRP remains at the center of this shift, even as governments test their own digital currencies. Rietveld focused on a core issue that many overlook. Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) focus on domestic use. They do not solve global payment friction. That gap creates an opening for blockchain networks designed for cross-border movement. XRP and the XRP Ledger aim directly at that problem. $XRP Is The Future Of Cross‑Border Payments! pic.twitter.com/I7qxdk3dht — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) December 27, 2025 Limits of Central Bank Digital Currencies Rietveld explained that CBDCs solve national challenges, not international ones. He said, “Central bank digital currencies are domestic by nature.” Central banks issue them for internal payment efficiency, monetary control, and financial inclusion. Cross-border payments remain outside their core design. This matters for global trade and remittances. Businesses and individuals still need a neutral bridge asset to move value between currencies. Without that bridge, CBDCs risk becoming digital versions of existing systems. They improve speed inside borders but fail to connect economies efficiently. Rietveld also noted the experimental phase underway. He said countries are testing various models. The Central Bank of France has previously expressed a preference for XRP’s features in Europe’s CBDC . The need for an efficient system underscores the importance of an established settlement layer like XRP, which already operates globally. Ripple’s Strategy Targets the Gap Ripple positions XRP as a neutral asset that connects different currencies and systems. Rietveld emphasized Ripple’s work with central banks. He said Ripple has “ partnered with several central banks around the world,” adding that some partnerships remain unannounced. These partnerships involve issuing and testing digital assets on the XRP Ledger. That approach allows institutions to maintain control while leveraging an existing blockchain infrastructure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The XRP Ledger offers fast settlement and low transaction costs. It also operates independently of any single government. Those traits make it suitable for cross-border settlement between CBDCs, stablecoins, and traditional currencies. Stablecoins and XRP Are Converging Rietveld also linked CBDC development with the rise of stablecoins. Both address payment efficiency but from different angles. Stablecoins already move value across borders with speed. CBDCs aim to modernize domestic money. XRP sits between them as a settlement layer , and RLUSD, Ripple’s stablecoin, can play a crucial role in the system. As more digital currencies launch, interoperability becomes critical. XRP can serve as the bridge asset that connects these systems without forcing direct currency swaps. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

A cryptocurrency exchange operator working under orders from a suspected North Korean hacker, along with his military recruit that local media reports identified simply as Mr. B, have been sentenced to prison after they received substantial amounts of Bitcoin in exchange for military intelligence. South Korea sends crypto exchange operator to jail for spying The Supreme Court’s 3rd Division, led by Chief Justice Lee Sook-yeon, recently upheld the lower court’s judgment against the 40-year-old defendant, identified only as Mr. A, who violated the National Security Act by spying. In July 2021, Mr. A received instructions through Telegram from an individual operating under the alias “Boris,” suspected of being a North Korean hacker . Mr. A approached an active-duty military officer, Mr. B, who was 30 years old at the time, with an offer to pay in cryptocurrency in exchange for classified military information, which the court believes was at Boris’s orders. Mr. B used sophisticated spying equipment, including a hidden camera embedded into a watch and a USB-shaped hacking device called “Poison Tap,” designed specifically for detecting and extracting military secrets to allow hackers remote access to a laptop and attempt to penetrate South Korea’s defense systems. Boris was gunning for access to the Korean Joint Command and Control System (KJCCS). Mr. B successfully obtained and provided the login details for the system to both Boris and Mr. A. However, authorities confirmed that the actual hacking attempt failed. What were the South Korean spies paid? Mr. A received Bitcoin worth approximately 700 million won ($525,000) for his role in the espionage scheme. Mr. B, was paid Bitcoin valued at 48 million won ($36,000). Investigators also revealed that Mr. A attempted to recruit more conspirators by approaching another active-duty officer with offers of payment in exchange for military organizational charts. However, this second officer rejected the offer. Mr. A was found guilty and given a four-year prison sentence along with a four-year suspension period. The court emphasized that Mr. A “was at least aware of the fact that it was trying to detect military secrets for a country or group that is hostile to the Republic of Korea.” The judges said that Mr. A only cared about his economic gain while “committing a crime that could have endangered the entire Republic of Korea,” which was an offense that deserved severe punishment. Both the appellate court and the Supreme Court agreed with this assessment and maintained the original sentence. Mr. B was charged with violating the Military Confidentiality Protection Act and received a harsher 10-year prison sentence. He was also hit with a 50-million-won fine from the Supreme Court.

This action immediately triggers heightened scrutiny for the Solana-based project, signaling potential removal from one of Asia’s most significant trading platforms. Consequently, the announcement has sent ripples through the crypto community, prompting urgent reassessments of project viability and exchange compliance standards. Bithumb Delisting Decision: A Breakdown of the Official Rationale Bithumb’s compliance team issued a formal statement detailing the reasons behind the FIDA watchlist designation. The exchange conducted a comprehensive quarterly review, a standard procedure for all listed assets. During this audit, reviewers identified multiple, specific deficiencies. Primarily, these shortcomings related to the project’s disclosures and its operational progress. For instance, Bithumb cited inadequate transparency regarding Bonfida’s updated business plan and roadmap. Furthermore, the exchange noted a significant gap between the project’s published milestones and its verifiable, on-chain business operations. This gap raised fundamental questions about project management and execution. Industry analysts immediately recognized this as a classic enforcement of the “Improvement Request” system used by Korean exchanges. Under this framework, projects receive a warning and a correction period. Bithumb’s announcement did not specify the exact duration of this grace period for Bonfida. However, historical precedent suggests it typically spans 30 to 60 days. During this window, the Bonfida team must address all cited issues to Bithumb’s satisfaction. Failure to do so will result in a formal delisting procedure, halting all trading pairs involving FIDA on the exchange. Understanding the Bonfida Project and Its Market Position To grasp the full impact of Bithumb’s decision, one must understand Bonfida’s role. Bonfida is a flagship project built on the Solana blockchain, positioning itself as a full-stack suite for the Serum decentralized exchange (DEX) ecosystem. Its FIDA token serves multiple utilities, including governance, fee discounts, and rewards. The project launched with considerable fanfare, capitalizing on Solana’s high-speed, low-cost transaction capabilities. Initially, it gained traction for offering advanced trading tools, analytics, and a domain name service (SNS) for Solana addresses. The following table outlines Bonfida’s core offerings prior to the watchlist announcement: Product Description Status Pre-Announcement Bonfida API Professional trading API for Serum Operational Bonfida Analytics Advanced charts & data for Solana DeFi Live, with periodic updates Solana Name Service (SNS) Human-readable addresses (.sol domains) Active, with growing registrations FIDA Token Governance, fees, staking Listed on multiple exchanges Despite this technological foundation, Bithumb’s review suggests a disconnect between these services and the project’s strategic business development. Market data shows FIDA’s trading volume on Bithumb was modest but consistent before the news. The token’s price reacted predictably to the announcement, experiencing a sharp, double-digit percentage decline within hours. This volatility underscores the market’s sensitivity to exchange compliance actions. Expert Analysis: The Broader Implications for Crypto Listings Financial compliance experts view Bithumb’s action as part of a global trend toward stricter exchange self-regulation. “Exchanges like Bithumb are increasingly acting as gatekeepers,” notes Dr. Min-ji Park, a fintech researcher at Seoul National University. “They are proactively managing their reputational and regulatory risk by auditing listed projects, not just for legal compliance, but for fundamental operational health. This move is less about punishing one project and more about Bithumb enforcing a higher standard for its entire marketplace.” This scrutiny extends beyond South Korea. Major global exchanges, including Binance and Coinbase, have similarly expanded their monitoring and periodic review processes. The common triggers for watchlisting or delisting include: Poor Liquidity & Volume: Consistently low trading activity. Team Diligence: Lack of communication or development updates. Network/Security Issues: Repeated smart contract vulnerabilities or network failures. Legal/Compliance Risks: Regulatory actions against the project in any jurisdiction. Failure to Meet Roadmap: Significant, unexplained delays in delivering promised features. Bithumb’s specific focus on business plan disclosure and operational progress suggests Bonfida may have faltered in the last two categories. The exchange’s decision provides a clear, public case study for other projects on the necessary rigor of ongoing communication and execution. The Ripple Effect: Impact on Investors and the Solana Ecosystem The immediate consequence for FIDA holders on Bithumb is uncertainty. Investors now face a difficult choice: sell the token on the exchange before potential illiquidity, transfer holdings to a private wallet, or wait for the Bonfida team’s response. Historically, tokens that survive a watchlist period often recover partially, but those delisted can struggle to regain listings on other top-tier exchanges. For the broader Solana ecosystem, the event is a reminder of the interdependence between applications and their underlying infrastructure. Bonfida is a significant DeFi component within Solana. Therefore, any perceived weakness in a major ecosystem project can affect sentiment toward the entire network. However, analysts caution against overstating this impact. “Solana’s ecosystem is now vast and diversified,” states Alex Turner, lead analyst at CryptoMetrics. “While Bonfida is a notable project, the health of the network does not hinge on a single application. The focus will be on how the Bonfida team handles this challenge and whether it can restore confidence.” The timeline of events is critical for understanding the narrative: Q4 2024: Bithumb initiates its standard quarterly project review cycle. Early March 2025: Bithumb’s compliance team identifies issues with Bonfida’s disclosures. March 15, 2025: Bithumb publicly announces FIDA’s placement on the delisting watchlist. Next 30-60 Days (Expected): Bonfida’s correction period. The team must submit revised documentation and evidence of progress. Q2 2025: Bithumb will announce its final decision: either removal from the watchlist or initiation of delisting. Conclusion The Bithumb delisting watchlist announcement for Bonfida (FIDA) represents a pivotal moment in cryptocurrency market maturation. It highlights the escalating standards that major exchanges enforce for continued listing privileges. This action underscores a shift from mere technical listing to ongoing operational and communicative diligence. For investors, it reinforces the necessity of deep due diligence that extends beyond a project’s whitepaper to its consistent execution and transparency. The coming weeks will be crucial for the Bonfida team to demonstrate rectification and for the market to observe how effectively one project can navigate this high-stakes compliance challenge. FAQs Q1: What does it mean for a token to be on a “delisting watchlist”? A delisting watchlist is a formal warning status issued by an exchange. It indicates the exchange has identified compliance or operational issues with the project. The project enters a probationary period to fix these problems. If unresolved, the token will be permanently removed from trading on that platform. Q2: Can I still trade FIDA on Bithumb right now? Yes, trading for FIDA typically continues normally during the watchlist period. The announcement is a warning of potential future action, not an immediate trading halt. However, investors should monitor Bithumb’s official notices for any changes. Q3: What specific issues did Bithumb find with Bonfida? Bithumb cited deficiencies in the project’s disclosure of key information, such as its business plan, and discrepancies in the actual progress of its business operations compared to its stated goals. The exact details are part of a private report to the Bonfida team. Q4: Where else is FIDA listed, and are other exchanges likely to follow Bithumb? FIDA is listed on other global exchanges like FTX, Bybit, and Gate.io. Other exchanges may initiate their own reviews based on Bithumb’s action, but they are not obligated to follow suit. Each exchange conducts independent evaluations based on its own policies. Q5: What should FIDA holders do in response to this news? Holders should first consult the official response from the Bonfida development team. They should review their own risk tolerance and consider diversifying their portfolio. It is also prudent to ensure tokens are held in a secure, self-custody wallet if long-term holding is the strategy, regardless of exchange status.

First off are Solana (SOL), XRP, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Solana’s blockchain is leading the charge as one of the fastest processing networks in the world, whose SOL prices are predicted to rise significantly as the associated DeFi and NFTs networks and developments burst with added activity and have the whale money behind them. Next follows XRP, which has already been positively impacted by improved regulation and investment funds that moreover currently put it in the list of top cryptos as far as development is considered. Finally, while perhaps tangentially interesting is the development track record of Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is an ETH-linked DeFi crypto that is now in presale phase 7 priced at just $0.04. MUTM is one of those crypto to buy now that might end up costing significantly more very soon. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis As Solana (SOL) has been volatile due to numerous trends prevailing, at the moment, Solana (SOL) is at a critical point where the prices are heavily compressed inside or around an essential support level, which usually precedes a breakout. Since SOL prices have shown a strong response to the macro-level support line, the prices are now out of the descending channel and are preparing a compression-level base, which suggests the reduction in selling sentiment and the consequent exhaustion of the selling pressure. Technically, the sentiment remains slightly positive, considering the resistance, along with the support level. XRP’s Quiet Power Shift: Institutions And Whales Are In Control While it may appear as if there is not much happening in terms of the price actions seen in XRP, what is actually going on beneath the hood indicated that there has been much more going on in terms of the strategic activity surrounding XRP price movements than what is apparent on the charts. In reality, it is increasingly becoming the norm where the tone has been set by institutional investors, using spot XRP ETFs to drive total net asset value above $1.2 Billion in a mid-session quiet accumulation trend, marked by persistent inflows even during conditions of low market volatility, which are classic signs of a long-term accumulation trend as opposed to short-term speculations. However, the on-chain whale activity statistics indicate a definitive return, as the number of accounts holding 100,000,000 to 1,000,000,000 XRP has cumulatively gathered sufficient supply to near-approach 12.8%, a classic function of coordinated whale buying as a result of a mid-session dip. However, even in this case, the prices are simply range-bound between the figures of $1.90 and $1.94, which lies beneath all the critical EMA levels and is marked by a deceleration of selling activity as indicated by an RSI of 43, a flat OBV, and the MACD being in the negative region. MUTM Presale has Entered Phase 7 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly setting a strong foundation for its presence in the DeFi list of cryptocurrencies and is nearing the final stages of its presale. The tokens can be purchased for $0.04 in phase 7, and this is the best possible time for an individual to join the project as the adoption rate is quite advanced. Over 18,570 persons have contributed over $19.5 million alone for the presale, and this is an indication of the usefulness and adaptability of Mutuum Finance. Investors considering what crypto to buy now would do well to observe this presale phase. Dual-Layer Lending: Engine for Growth Among the reasons why Mutuum Finance has gained popularity is through its novel dual-lending system, which has been able to solve problems not only for stable assets but even for the volatile ones. This has been made possible through the use of the Peer to Contract (P2C) method, where the project establishes fully auditable smart contracts that utilize pools of larger assets USDT, ETH, and SOL, the interest rates for which keep fluctuating based on the usage level of the pools. MUTM also utilizes the Peer to Peer (P2P) module that has the capability to lend, borrow, or both for volatile assets, which means that while ensuring that liquidity pools are stable, the platform is still flexible. This ensures that these two aspects are scalable, adaptive, and highly supportive of the MUTM token, which has huge growth prospects. As SOL is pegged to its support levels and XRP is enticing institutional investment, focus is on Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Phase 7 presale at $0.04 is ongoing, and there are 18,570+ contributors and over $19.5M already raised. Dual lending is on the horizon, as is MtTokens and Sepolia Testnet, making Mutuum Finance one of the few DeFi projects that allow presale holders to make money before the next leg of growth. MUTM is one of the most promising crypto to buy now opportunities, standing tall among the top cryptos for 2026.

56583423,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=256516,1767079811,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Metaplanet Bitcoin Purchase: Strategic 4,279 BTC Acquisition Bolsters $3 Billion Treasury",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/metaplanet-bitcoin-purchase-treasury/,"BitcoinWorld Metaplanet Bitcoin Purchase: Strategic 4,279 BTC Acquisition Bolsters $3 Billion Treasury In a decisive move underscoring the maturation of digital assets within traditional finance, Tokyo-based Metaplanet Inc. has strategically expanded its corporate treasury, announcing the acquisition of an additional 4,279 Bitcoin (BTC). This significant purchase, confirmed in April 2025, elevates the publicly listed Japanese company’s total Bitcoin holdings to 35,102 BTC. Consequently, the firm’s treasury reserve now carries an approximate market value of $3 billion, reinforcing its position as a global leader in corporate Bitcoin adoption. Metaplanet Bitcoin Purchase: A Deep Dive into the Strategy Metaplanet’s latest transaction represents a calculated continuation of a treasury strategy first formally adopted in 2024. The company pivoted to holding Bitcoin as a primary reserve asset to hedge against macroeconomic pressures, specifically Japan’s prolonged environment of negative real interest rates and a significantly depreciating yen. This purchase of 4,279 BTC follows a series of earlier accumulations, systematically building a position that now rivals the holdings of several notable North American corporations. The move is not an isolated speculation but a core component of the firm’s long-term balance sheet management. Furthermore, this strategy aligns with a growing trend of Asian firms seeking asset diversification beyond traditional government bonds and fiat currencies. The Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Landscape in 2025 The landscape for corporate Bitcoin treasury assets has evolved substantially since MicroStrategy’s pioneering moves earlier in the decade. In 2025, adoption is characterized by a broader geographic spread and more nuanced financial reasoning. Companies like Metaplanet are now leveraging Bitcoin not merely for its appreciation potential but for its operational utility as a non-sovereign store of value. This shift is particularly pronounced in economies facing currency volatility. For instance, several technology and investment firms across Southeast Asia have begun allocating small percentages of their cash reserves to Bitcoin. Metaplanet’s aggressive stance, however, places it at the vanguard, demonstrating a level of conviction that prompts market analysts to re-evaluate Bitcoin’s role in global corporate finance. Expert Analysis: Treasury Management in a Digital Age Financial strategists point to Metaplanet’s actions as a textbook case of modern treasury risk management. “Metaplanet is executing a clear hedge against currency debasement,” explains a senior analyst from a Tokyo-based financial research firm. “By converting yen-denominated reserves into Bitcoin, the company is effectively insulating a portion of its value from domestic inflationary policies. The scale is what commands attention. Holding over 35,000 BTC transforms their balance sheet into a hybrid entity—part traditional business, part substantial digital asset fund.” This analysis is supported by the company’s own disclosures, which frame Bitcoin as a superior long-term store of value compared to holding cash or Japanese government bonds (JGBs) yielding negative real returns. Financial Impact and Market Reaction The market’s immediate reaction to the purchase announcement was measured, reflecting a growing sophistication in how such news is processed. While Bitcoin’s price saw a minor uptick, the more significant reaction was observed in Metaplanet’s own stock ticker on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Historically, the company’s share price has demonstrated a heightened correlation with Bitcoin’s market movements since initiating its treasury strategy. This latest acquisition solidifies that relationship. Analysts have created a simple comparison to illustrate the scale of Metaplanet’s holdings relative to other known corporate entities: Company Approximate BTC Holdings (2025) Estimated USD Value MicroStrategy ~250,000 BTC ~$21.5B Metaplanet 35,102 BTC ~$3.0B Tesla ~10,500 BTC ~$0.9B This positioning makes Metaplanet the second-largest publicly disclosed corporate holder of Bitcoin globally, a fact that carries substantial weight in investment circles. The purchase was likely funded through a combination of cash reserves and strategic debt issuance, a method perfected by other corporate holders. Importantly, the company follows a strict custody protocol, storing its Bitcoin with a combination of regulated custodians and multi-signature cold wallet solutions to ensure security and compliance. Regulatory Environment and Future Implications Metaplanet’s continued accumulation occurs within a progressively clarifying Japanese regulatory framework. Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) has established guidelines for cryptocurrency as a holding asset for listed companies, providing a legal pathway that Metaplanet carefully navigates. This regulatory clarity is a key enabler absent in many other jurisdictions. Looking forward, Metaplanet’s strategy may influence other Japanese and Asian corporations contemplating similar moves. Potential implications include: Increased Institutional Demand: Other firms may follow, creating sustained buy-side pressure in the Bitcoin market. New Financial Products: Banks may develop tailored lending products using Bitcoin as collateral for corporate clients. Accounting Standards Evolution: Widespread adoption could pressure accounting bodies to refine treatment of digital assets on balance sheets. The company has indicated its strategy is long-term, with no intention of selling its Bitcoin holdings in response to short-term price volatility. This “HODL” mentality, adopted from retail crypto culture, is now a formalized corporate treasury policy. Conclusion Metaplanet’s purchase of 4,279 Bitcoin is far more than a simple asset acquisition; it is a robust statement on the future of corporate finance. This strategic Metaplanet Bitcoin purchase fortifies a $3 billion treasury reserve, showcasing a sophisticated response to global macroeconomic challenges. The move solidifies Japan’s role in the institutional adoption of digital assets and provides a compelling case study for companies worldwide. As corporations seek refuge from inflation and currency weakness, Bitcoin’s proposition as a treasury reserve asset grows increasingly credible, with Metaplanet leading by example in the Asian market. FAQs Q1: How much Bitcoin does Metaplanet own after this purchase? Following this latest acquisition, Metaplanet holds a total of 35,102 Bitcoin (BTC). This positions the company as one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin in the world. Q2: Why is a Japanese company buying so much Bitcoin? Metaplanet has adopted Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset to hedge against Japan’s negative real interest rates and the long-term depreciation of the Japanese yen (JPY). The company views Bitcoin as a superior store of value compared to holding cash or low-yielding government bonds. Q3: How does Metaplanet’s Bitcoin holding compare to MicroStrategy’s? While MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate holder with roughly 250,000 BTC, Metaplanet’s 35,102 BTC makes it the second-largest publicly disclosed corporate holder globally, representing a significant and strategic allocation. Q4: Is it safe for a public company to hold Bitcoin on its balance sheet? Metaplanet employs rigorous security measures, including the use of regulated third-party custodians and multi-signature cold storage wallets. The regulatory environment in Japan also provides a framework for such holdings, mitigating certain legal and operational risks. Q5: What impact does this have on the price of Bitcoin? Large, public acquisitions like this are generally viewed as bullish signals. They demonstrate strong institutional demand, reduce the available supply of Bitcoin on the market, and lend credibility to Bitcoin’s value proposition, which can positively influence market sentiment and price over the long term.

The exchange confirmed deposit suspensions for TWT will commence at precisely 7:00 a.m. UTC on December 30, 2024, marking another chapter in South Korea’s evolving digital asset oversight framework. Coinone Delisting Decision: Regulatory Context and Immediate Actions Coinone’s announcement follows months of intensified scrutiny from South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC). Consequently, the exchange implemented enhanced monitoring protocols for all listed assets. Specifically, Coinone evaluates tokens against six critical criteria: transaction volume stability, wallet security standards, development team transparency, regulatory compliance documentation, market capitalization sustainability, and community governance activity. Trust Wallet Token reportedly showed deficiencies in multiple categories during Coinone’s quarterly review cycle. Furthermore, the exchange maintains a structured delisting process with three distinct phases. Initially, the watchlist placement serves as a formal warning to project teams. Subsequently, exchanges grant a standard 30-day remediation period for compliance improvements. Finally, either delisting or watchlist removal occurs based on demonstrated corrections. This systematic approach mirrors procedures at other major Korean exchanges like Upbit and Bithumb, creating consistent industry standards. Technical and Compliance Assessment Framework Exchange compliance teams utilize quantitative scoring systems for evaluation. For instance, they assess daily trading volumes against three-month averages. Additionally, they verify wallet security through independent audits. Moreover, they review developer activity metrics on public repositories. Trust Wallet Token’s assessment reportedly revealed concerning patterns in trading volume consistency and documentation completeness. These findings prompted the preventive watchlist action. Trust Wallet Token’s Market Position and Historical Performance Trust Wallet Token functions as the native utility token for the Trust Wallet ecosystem, a Binance-owned mobile cryptocurrency wallet supporting multiple blockchains. Originally launched in 2017, TWT provides holders with governance voting rights, premium feature access, and merchant payment capabilities. The token experienced significant growth during the 2021 bull market, reaching an all-time high of $2.72 in November 2022 according to CoinMarketCap historical data. However, recent market data reveals concerning trends. Trading volumes declined approximately 42% across Korean exchanges during Q4 2024. Simultaneously, wallet adoption metrics showed slower growth compared to competing solutions. These market dynamics likely influenced Coinone’s evaluation, as exchanges prioritize assets with sustainable ecosystem development. The table below illustrates TWT’s recent performance metrics on Korean exchanges: Metric Q3 2024 Q4 2024 Change Average Daily Volume (KRW) ₩3.2 billion ₩1.85 billion -42.2% Unique Traders 18,450 12,880 -30.2% Wallet Integration 47 merchants 49 merchants +4.3% Market analysts note several contributing factors to these trends. First, increased competition from newer wallet solutions affected market share. Second, regulatory uncertainty created hesitation among Korean users. Third, broader market conditions reduced overall cryptocurrency activity. These combined elements created challenging conditions for TWT’s Korean market presence. South Korea’s Evolving Cryptocurrency Regulatory Landscape South Korea’s financial authorities have progressively strengthened digital asset regulations since 2021. The Specific Financial Information Act (SFIA) amendments established comprehensive reporting requirements. Additionally, the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) enhanced monitoring capabilities. These regulatory developments created stricter compliance environments for all market participants. Key regulatory requirements affecting exchange listings include: Real-name verification systems linking bank accounts to exchange accounts Travel Rule compliance for transactions exceeding ₩1 million Quarterly reporting of suspicious transaction patterns Proof of reserves demonstrating adequate asset backing Cybersecurity certifications from approved auditing firms Furthermore, the Digital Asset Basic Act (DABA), scheduled for full implementation in 2025, introduces additional requirements. This legislation mandates stricter token classification standards. It also establishes clearer investor protection mechanisms. Consequently, exchanges proactively adjust listing criteria ahead of regulatory deadlines. Coinone’s watchlist placement reflects this forward-looking compliance strategy. Comparative Analysis with Previous Delisting Events Coinone previously delisted 24 cryptocurrencies in March 2023 following FSC guidelines. Analysis of those cases reveals consistent patterns. Typically, projects with incomplete documentation faced removal. Similarly, tokens with declining developer activity received warnings. Moreover, assets with security vulnerabilities experienced immediate suspension. Trust Wallet Token’s situation appears less severe than previous delistings, suggesting potential for compliance resolution. Market Impact and Investor Implications The announcement immediately affected TWT’s market performance. Trading volumes increased 180% within two hours of the news. Simultaneously, the token price declined approximately 8.5% against the Korean Won. These reactions demonstrate market sensitivity to exchange listing status, particularly in regulated jurisdictions like South Korea. Investors holding TWT on Coinone face specific procedural requirements. Deposit functionality ceases completely on December 30. However, withdrawal services remain operational throughout the evaluation period. Trading continues normally unless further announcements modify conditions. This approach allows investors to manage positions while the project team addresses compliance concerns. Industry experts emphasize several key considerations for affected investors: Monitor official communications from both Coinone and Trust Wallet Review alternative exchange options for TWT trading pairs Understand tax implications of potential asset transfers Evaluate long-term project fundamentals beyond exchange listings Consider diversification strategies for portfolio risk management Technical Analysis of Trust Wallet’s Ecosystem Development Trust Wallet maintains active development across multiple blockchain networks. Recent GitHub commit activity shows consistent updates to core functionality. The wallet currently supports over 70 blockchains and thousands of tokens. This technical breadth demonstrates ongoing project development despite exchange challenges. However, regulatory documentation presents potential concerns. Korean exchanges require specific compliance materials including: Legal opinions regarding token classification Anti-money laundering (AML) policy documentation Proof of entity registration in relevant jurisdictions Cybersecurity audit reports from certified firms Team identification and background verification documents Industry sources suggest documentation completeness, rather than technical capability, likely triggered the watchlist placement. This pattern matches previous cases where fundamentally sound projects faced temporary exchange issues due to administrative requirements. The 30-day remediation period allows for document submission and review. Broader Implications for Cryptocurrency Exchange Standards Coinone’s systematic approach reflects industry maturation. Exchanges increasingly implement transparent evaluation frameworks. These systems benefit market integrity through consistent standards. Moreover, they provide clearer guidelines for project teams seeking listings. International exchanges observe Korean regulatory developments closely. Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) employs similar listing criteria. Similarly, Singapore’s Monetary Authority (MAS) emphasizes compliance documentation. This regulatory convergence creates global standards for cryptocurrency markets. Consequently, projects must maintain comprehensive compliance across multiple jurisdictions. The watchlist mechanism itself represents industry best practices. It provides warning before drastic action. Additionally, it establishes clear remediation pathways. Furthermore, it maintains market stability during evaluation periods. These procedural safeguards distinguish mature exchanges from less regulated platforms. Conclusion Coinone’s placement of Trust Wallet Token on its delisting watchlist demonstrates rigorous compliance with South Korea’s evolving cryptocurrency regulations. The exchange follows established procedures providing remediation opportunities while protecting investor interests. Market reactions reflect temporary uncertainty rather than fundamental project concerns. Ultimately, this event highlights the cryptocurrency industry’s ongoing maturation through standardized listing criteria and transparent evaluation processes. The coming weeks will determine whether Trust Wallet Token addresses compliance requirements sufficiently for continued Coinone listing, setting important precedents for exchange-asset relationships in regulated markets. FAQs Q1: What does “delisting watchlist” mean for Trust Wallet Token on Coinone? Coinone’s delisting watchlist indicates formal concerns about TWT’s compliance with exchange requirements. The token remains tradable during evaluation, but deposits stop on December 30. The project team has approximately 30 days to address identified issues before final determination. Q2: Can I still withdraw TWT from Coinone after December 30? Yes, withdrawal functionality continues throughout the evaluation period. Only deposit services suspend on December 30. Investors can transfer existing holdings to other wallets or exchanges without restriction during this phase. Q3: What specific issues caused Coinone’s watchlist placement? While Coinone hasn’t disclosed detailed findings, industry standards suggest potential documentation gaps in regulatory compliance, trading volume sustainability concerns, or security verification requirements. The exchange evaluates six criteria including transaction stability and team transparency. Q4: How does this affect TWT trading on other exchanges? Currently, this announcement specifically affects Coinone listings. Other exchanges continue normal TWT operations. However, regulatory actions often influence broader market perceptions, potentially affecting trading volumes and prices across multiple platforms temporarily. Q5: What happens if Trust Wallet Token gets fully delisted from Coinone? Full delisting would remove all TWT trading pairs from Coinone. The exchange would establish a specific withdrawal period, typically 30-60 days. Investors would need to transfer assets elsewhere before deadline. Historical data shows most projects address issues during watchlist periods to avoid full delisting.

56583884,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=256513,1767080411,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,BTC Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratio Reveals Stunning Market Equilibrium Across Top Exchanges,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/btc-perpetual-futures-long-short-ratio-analysis/,"BitcoinWorld BTC Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratio Reveals Stunning Market Equilibrium Across Top Exchanges Global cryptocurrency markets witnessed a remarkable display of equilibrium on March 15, 2025, as the aggregate BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio across the world’s three largest derivatives exchanges settled into a near-perfect balance. This precise 50.04% long versus 49.96% short split presents a fascinating snapshot of collective trader psychology and offers a critical data point for understanding current Bitcoin market structure. The BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio serves as one of the most direct sentiment gauges available to analysts, reflecting the immediate positioning of leveraged traders who significantly influence short-term price volatility. Decoding the BTC Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratio The BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio represents the percentage of open positions betting on price increases versus those betting on declines. Analysts meticulously track this metric because it provides a real-time window into market sentiment. A ratio heavily skewed toward long positions often signals excessive optimism, which can precede a market correction. Conversely, a dominant short position might indicate pervasive fear, potentially setting the stage for a bullish reversal. The current data reveals an exceptionally balanced market. Specifically, the 24-hour aggregate ratio shows 50.04% of traders are long, while 49.96% are short. This near-parity suggests a lack of strong directional consensus among leveraged participants, often preceding a period of consolidation or a significant breakout. The Mechanics of Perpetual Futures Contracts Unlike traditional futures with set expiry dates, perpetual futures contracts, or “perps,” run indefinitely. Exchanges maintain the contract’s price alignment with the underlying spot market through a funding rate mechanism. This rate periodically transfers funds from longs to shorts or vice versa, depending on market skew. Consequently, the long/short ratio directly influences these funding payments. A market heavily tilted toward longs typically results in positive funding rates, where longs pay shorts to maintain their positions. The current balanced ratio likely corresponds with relatively neutral funding rates across exchanges, reducing the immediate cost of holding positions for both sides. Exchange-by-Exchange Analysis of Bitcoin Derivatives Sentiment While the overall market shows equilibrium, a granular look at individual exchanges reveals subtle but important variations in trader behavior. These differences can stem from regional user bases, available trading products, or varying risk appetites. Exchange Long Ratio Short Ratio Net Sentiment Binance 49.97% 50.03% Neutral/Slightly Bearish OKX 47.84% 52.16% Bearish Bybit 49.42% 50.58% Neutral/Slightly Bearish Aggregate 50.04% 49.96% Perfectly Balanced Firstly, Binance , the global leader by open interest, displays a virtually even split at 49.97% long versus 50.03% short. This indicates that the platform’s vast and diverse user base holds no strong collective bias at this moment. Secondly, OKX shows the most pronounced skew, with 52.16% of positions held short. This bearish tilt among OKX traders could reflect regional sentiment or specific market views within that exchange’s community. Finally, Bybit also leans slightly bearish at 50.58% short. The aggregation of these figures into a net-neutral overall ratio demonstrates how different trader cohorts can offset each other, creating a stable macro picture from volatile micro-components. The Historical Context and Predictive Power of Sentiment Data Market historians often compare current sentiment extremes to past events to gauge potential outcomes. For instance, during the bull market peak in late 2021, aggregate long ratios frequently exceeded 70%, signaling extreme greed. Conversely, during the bear market troughs of 2022 and 2023, short ratios dominated, reflecting deep-seated fear. The present equilibrium is historically significant. Periods of such balance often occur at inflection points, where the market digests previous moves and prepares for its next major trend. Analysts from firms like Glassnode and CryptoQuant have published research showing that extended periods of neutral sentiment, as measured by derivatives data, frequently resolve in powerful directional moves. Therefore, while the current BTC perpetual futures data suggests calm, it may also indicate the calm before a storm. Correlation with On-Chain and Spot Market Indicators Sophisticated analysts never view derivatives data in isolation. They cross-reference the long/short ratio with other key metrics to build a robust market thesis. Critical complementary data includes: Spot Exchange Flows: Net inflows to exchanges often precede selling pressure, while outflows suggest accumulation. Realized Profit/Loss: Measures the aggregate profit or loss taken by investors moving coins, indicating seller exhaustion or strength. Options Skew: The pricing of put options versus call options shows institutional sentiment and hedging demand. Currently, neutral derivatives sentiment coincides with stable spot flows and moderate realized volumes. This multi-indicator alignment reinforces the narrative of a market in a state of indecision, awaiting a fundamental catalyst. Practical Implications for Traders and Risk Managers For active participants in the cryptocurrency markets, this data is not merely academic. It has direct implications for strategy and risk management. A balanced long/short ratio typically leads to lower funding rates, making it cheaper to hold both long and short positions. This environment can favor range-bound trading strategies or the use of delta-neutral approaches. However, traders must remain vigilant. Such equilibrium is inherently unstable. The first exchange to show a decisive break in its ratio could signal the direction of the impending move. Risk managers, therefore, monitor these figures to adjust position sizes and set stop-loss levels, understanding that high leverage in a neutral market can lead to violent liquidations if sentiment shifts abruptly. The Role of Institutional Participation The increasing presence of institutional traders on these platforms adds a new layer to sentiment analysis. Institutions often use futures for hedging spot holdings or executing sophisticated arbitrage strategies, not purely for directional speculation. Their activity can sometimes distort retail-focused sentiment indicators. The current balanced ratio may partly reflect significant institutional hedging activity, which offsets more speculative retail positioning. Data from CME Group’s Bitcoin futures, a predominantly institutional venue, would provide a valuable comparison to the retail-heavy exchanges analyzed here, offering a more complete picture of the entire market’s posture. Conclusion The latest BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio data presents a compelling portrait of a cryptocurrency market at a crossroads. The precise 50.04% to 49.96% split across Binance, OKX, and Bybit signifies a rare moment of collective indecision among leveraged traders. While individual exchanges like OKX show a bearish lean, the aggregate picture is one of perfect balance. Historically, such equilibrium does not last indefinitely. It either resolves through a gradual buildup of conviction in one direction or shatters via an unexpected catalyst. For market participants, this data underscores the importance of disciplined risk management and multi-faceted analysis. The BTC perpetual futures market remains a critical sentiment barometer, and its current reading clearly signals a market holding its breath, waiting for the next chapter to begin. FAQs Q1: What does the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio actually measure? The ratio measures the percentage of total open interest in Bitcoin perpetual futures contracts that is held by traders betting on price increases (long) versus those betting on price decreases (short). It is a direct gauge of leveraged market sentiment. Q2: Why is a balanced 50/50 ratio significant? A perfectly balanced ratio indicates a lack of strong directional bias among futures traders. It often occurs during consolidation periods or at potential market inflection points, as extreme optimism or pessimism has been washed out. Q3: How does the long/short ratio differ from the funding rate? The long/short ratio shows trader positioning. The funding rate is a periodic payment between longs and shorts designed to tether the perpetual futures price to the spot price. A high long ratio usually leads to positive funding rates (longs pay shorts). Q4: Which exchange’s ratio should I pay the most attention to? Binance, as the largest exchange by open interest, often sets the overall tone. However, divergences between exchanges (like OKX’s current bearish skew) can signal differing regional sentiments or early shifts in momentum worth monitoring. Q5: Can the long/short ratio predict Bitcoin’s price direction? It is a contrarian indicator at extremes. Extremely high long ratios can signal overcrowded trades and precede sell-offs, while extreme short ratios can indicate excessive fear and precede rallies. A neutral ratio, like the current one, is not predictive of direction but of potential volatility.

As exchange-traded funds (ETFs) steadily absorb available supply, liquidity dynamics around XRP are tightening, laying the groundwork for what could become a pivotal transition by 2026. Declining exchange balances are a key on-chain signal, indicating reduced near-term selling pressure as fewer tokens remain readily available for trade. In XRP’s case, this drawdown is increasingly driven by institutional products, particularly ETFs, that pull supply off exchanges and lock it into long-term allocation vehicles. This dynamic mirrors earlier Bitcoin cycles, where ETF-driven demand fundamentally reshaped liquidity, price discovery, and volatility. XRP’s edge lies in the convergence of shrinking exchange liquidity and rising regulatory clarity. After years of legal uncertainty in key jurisdictions, clearer frameworks are emerging, materially reducing compliance risk for institutions. This matters because large financial players don’t allocate capital on narratives, they require regulatory certainty, deep and predictable liquidity, and dependable settlement infrastructure. XRP is increasingly meeting all three. As liquidity tightens, XRP’s price discovery is fundamentally shifting. Historically driven by retail-led hype cycles, rapid rallies followed by sharp pullbacks, XRP is now entering a more structural phase. According to XRP Update, ETFs are steadily absorbing supply while exchange balances continue to decline, reducing readily available tokens. In this environment, price action is increasingly shaped by persistent demand and constrained liquidity, not short-term speculation. Well, this shift carries profound implications for XRP’s role in global finance. By 2026, XRP is increasingly positioned to operate as institutional liquidity infrastructure, particularly for cross-border payments and treasury flows. In this framework, demand is driven by utility rather than hype: faster settlement, capital efficiency, and balance-sheet optimization. Institutions operating at this level tend to hold longer term, reinforcing structural supply constraints. Tighter liquidity, however, cuts both ways. It can magnify upside during demand expansion, but it also elevates the importance of consistent inflows. With speculative excess fading, price appreciation becomes more deliberate, yet significantly more resilient. That durability is a defining trait of assets evolving from speculative vehicles into financial infrastructure. Therefore, falling exchange balances, sustained ETF absorption, and advancing regulatory clarity are fundamentally reshaping XRP’s market structure. If these trends hold, 2026 may be remembered not as another speculative cycle peak, but as the year XRP became embedded in institutional liquidity infrastructure, where price discovery is structural, disciplined, and driven by real-world utility with the present price being $1.86. Conclusion The persistent decline in XRP exchange balances, alongside ETF-driven supply absorption, signals a fundamental shift in market structure. XRP is moving away from speculation-led price cycles toward structurally driven price discovery shaped by tighter liquidity, regulatory clarity, and growing institutional participation. If these dynamics persist, 2026 may mark XRP’s transition from a volatile trading asset to an embedded component of institutional liquidity infrastructure, where demand is rooted in real-world utility rather than hype.

Key Takeaways: South Korea’s comprehensive crypto law has been delayed to 2026 due to a dispute over who should be allowed to issue stablecoins. Regulators are proposing strict stablecoin rules, including 100% reserves held in banks. The draft law would raise compliance standards across crypto. While authorities broadly agree on imposing strict investor protection standards, a prolonged dispute over who should be allowed to issue stablecoins has stalled legislative progress. According to a report from Yonhap News Agency , the Financial Services Commission (FSC) is drafting a wide-ranging Digital Asset Basic Act that would introduce robust safeguards for stablecoin users. Regulators Propose Full Reserve Custody Rules for Stablecoin Issuers Under the proposal, issuers would be required to hold reserve assets entirely in bank deposits or government bonds and entrust 100% of those reserves to licensed custodians such as banks. The goal, regulators say, is to insulate investors from losses if a stablecoin issuer collapses. By segregating reserves and placing them under third-party custody, authorities aim to prevent the spillover risks that have plagued poorly backed digital assets in past market failures. Beyond stablecoins, the bill would significantly raise compliance standards across the crypto sector. Digital asset service providers would be subject to disclosure rules, advertising restrictions, and customer protection requirements similar to those in traditional finance. In cases of hacks or system outages, firms could be held liable for damages even in the absence of negligence, mirroring liability standards applied to online retail platforms. The draft law could also reopen the door to domestic token fundraising. Initial coin offerings (ICOs), banned in South Korea since 2017, may be permitted for local projects that meet strict disclosure and risk management criteria, marking a notable shift in policy. LATEST: South Korean payments giant BC Card has completed a pilot project that enabled foreign users to pay local merchants using stablecoins, as part of preparations to implement a stablecoin payment structure. pic.twitter.com/MMfugenwbR — CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap) December 23, 2025 Despite agreement on investor protections, stablecoin regulation remains the central point of contention. The Bank of Korea has pushed for a model in which stablecoins are issued only by consortia controlled by banks, insisting that lenders hold at least a 51% ownership stake. The central bank argues this approach is necessary to protect monetary stability and prevent systemic risks. The FSC, however, has resisted setting a fixed ownership threshold. Officials have warned that limiting issuance to bank-led structures could sideline technology firms and slow innovation in payments and digital finance. Regulators Propose Full Reserve Custody Rules for Stablecoin Issuers The two bodies are also split on governance. The Bank of Korea favors creating a new licensing committee dedicated to stablecoin oversight. However, the FSC maintains that an additional body would be unnecessary, noting that it already operates as a statutory regulator in coordination with the central bank and the Ministry of Economy and Finance. This month, South Korea revealed that it is preparing one of its most aggressive crackdowns on cryptocurrency-related financial crime by expanding its travel rule requirements. The new threshold covers transactions under 1 million won ($680), which until now allowed users to bypass identity checks by breaking transfers into smaller amounts.

56584546,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=256525,1767081311,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Upbit Announces Crucial Ethereum Network Suspension: Proactive Pause for Hard Fork Security,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/upbit-ethereum-hard-fork-suspension-3/,"BitcoinWorld Upbit Announces Crucial Ethereum Network Suspension: Proactive Pause for Hard Fork Security In a decisive move for blockchain security, South Korea’s premier cryptocurrency exchange, Upbit, has announced a temporary suspension of all Ethereum network deposits and withdrawals. This proactive measure, scheduled for January 6th, directly supports an upcoming and critical Ethereum hard fork. Consequently, the exchange prioritizes user asset safety during this significant network upgrade. Upbit’s Ethereum Network Suspension: Timeline and Scope Upbit will halt all deposit and withdrawal services for assets on the Ethereum network starting precisely at 11:00 p.m. UTC on January 6. This suspension affects a wide range of ERC-20 tokens and ETH itself. However, trading for these assets on Upbit’s order books will continue normally throughout the maintenance period. The exchange has not specified an exact end time for the suspension, stating services will resume only after confirming the hard fork’s stability. This approach is standard industry practice for major blockchain upgrades. Historically, exchanges like Coinbase and Binance implement similar precautionary pauses. For instance, they did so during Ethereum’s previous major upgrades, like the Merge. Therefore, Upbit’s action aligns with established security protocols. The suspension prevents potential transaction losses or conflicts that could occur if the network splits during the fork. Users must complete any necessary transfers well before the deadline. Understanding the Ethereum Hard Fork Context A hard fork represents a permanent divergence in a blockchain’s protocol, creating a new chain path. This upcoming Ethereum hard fork likely involves core protocol upgrades, such as adjustments to gas fees or consensus mechanisms. Network developers propose these changes to enhance scalability, security, or efficiency. Subsequently, node operators and miners must upgrade their software to follow the new rules. Hard forks are complex events that carry inherent risks. For example, a poorly coordinated fork can lead to temporary network instability or even a chain split. Exchanges play a critical role in managing these risks for their users. By suspending movements, Upbit ensures all user balances are correctly accounted for on the canonical post-fork chain. This process eliminates confusion and protects funds. Expert Analysis on Exchange Protocol During Forks Blockchain infrastructure experts consistently advocate for this cautious exchange approach. A 2023 report by the Crypto Council for Innovation highlighted that over 95% of major exchanges suspend deposits and withdrawals during planned hard forks. This statistic underscores the procedure’s necessity. The primary goal is to prevent replay attacks, where a transaction valid on one chain is maliciously broadcast to the other. Furthermore, exchanges must perform meticulous wallet reconciliation after the fork. They need to verify all holdings on the new chain. This verification process can take several hours post-upgrade. Upbit’s communication, while brief, follows the transparent model expected by regulators and users in 2025. Providing clear advance notice allows users to plan accordingly and demonstrates operational diligence. Practical Impacts and User Action Guide For Upbit users, this announcement requires specific preparatory actions. First, all pending Ethereum or ERC-20 withdrawal requests must be completed before the deadline. Second, users expecting deposits should inform senders about the suspension window to avoid failed transactions. Third, it is advisable to use this time to review general security practices, like enabling two-factor authentication. Key User Actions: Complete ETH/ERC-20 withdrawals before 11:00 p.m. UTC, Jan 6. Inform deposit senders about the maintenance window. Note that trading within Upbit remains unaffected. Monitor official Upbit announcements for the resumption notice. Comparatively, other global exchanges will likely announce similar schedules as the hard fork date approaches. Users with assets on multiple platforms should check each exchange’s status page. This event also highlights the importance of self-custody for experienced users who wish to interact directly with the hard fork, though this carries significant technical risk. Broader Implications for the South Korean Crypto Market As South Korea’s largest exchange, Upbit’s operations significantly influence local market liquidity. Scheduled maintenance can cause short-term volatility spikes for KRW trading pairs. However, well-communicated plans typically mitigate severe market disruptions. The South Korean Financial Services Commission (FSC) mandates strict user protection measures for virtual asset service providers (VASPs). Upbit’s preemptive suspension complies with these regulatory expectations for risk management. The exchange’s decision also reflects the maturation of crypto market infrastructure. In the industry’s early years, hard forks often caused exchange outages and user losses. Today, standardized procedures protect the ecosystem. This evolution supports greater institutional participation. Moreover, it builds trust among retail investors who rely on exchanges for secure asset custody during core protocol transitions. Conclusion Upbit’s temporary suspension of Ethereum network services is a necessary and standard security procedure. It safeguards user assets during the upcoming Ethereum hard fork. The move underscores the exchange’s commitment to operational safety and regulatory compliance. Users should adhere to the announced timeline to ensure smooth transactions. Ultimately, such meticulous preparations by major exchanges like Upbit contribute to the overall stability and reliability of the cryptocurrency market during critical network upgrades. FAQs Q1: Can I still trade Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens on Upbit during the suspension? Yes, the suspension only affects deposits to and withdrawals from the Ethereum network. Trading of these assets on Upbit’s internal order books will continue operating normally. Q2: What happens if my Ethereum deposit is sent to my Upbit address during the suspension? The transaction will remain pending on the blockchain, but Upbit will not credit it to your account until after services resume and network stability is confirmed. Your funds are safe but will be delayed. Q3: Why do exchanges suspend services for a hard fork? Exchanges suspend deposits and withdrawals to prevent transaction errors, replay attacks, and to ensure accurate accounting of user balances on the correct post-fork blockchain. It is a critical security measure. Q4: How long will the Ethereum network suspension last on Upbit? Upbit has not provided a specific end time. Services will resume only after the exchange completes its post-fork stability checks and wallet reconciliations. This process typically takes several hours after the hard fork is finalized. Q5: Does this affect cryptocurrencies on other blockchains, like Bitcoin or Solana? No, this announcement specifically applies only to assets on the Ethereum (ETH) network. Deposits and withdrawals for coins on other blockchains (e.g., Bitcoin, Solana, Polygon) will continue as usual unless stated otherwise.

While short-term price action remained muted, analysts and industry figures are increasingly focused on whether crypto’s long-standing four-year cycle is breaking down and what that could mean heading into 2026. Crypto markets consolidate amid year-end slowdown Bitcoin, at the time of writing, was trading at $87,392, down 2.4% on the day, while ether fell 2.2% to $2,947 and XRP slipped 1.9% to $1.85. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization declined 2.59% to $2.96 trillion. According to Jake Kennis, senior research analyst at Nansen, trading conditions have softened as the year draws to a close. He said in a CryptoNews report that Bitcoin and Ethereum have largely traded sideways over the past week, reflecting seasonal inactivity rather than a structural change in the market. On-chain activity has also cooled, with consolidation in active addresses, transactions, and fees over the past month. Kennis noted that networks such as Base experienced pullbacks in decentralized exchange volumes after a strong run earlier in the year. Solana continues to dominate on-chain trading by volume, though user activity has eased slightly, while BNB Chain remains a distant second. Overall, he said trading has slowed and become more selective rather than disappearing altogether. Long-term outlook centers on durability and adoption Looking beyond near-term consolidation, Haseeb Qureshi, managing partner at crypto venture firm Dragonfly, expects 2026 to reinforce long-running trends rather than reset the market. In a recent X post, Qureshi argued that durability, distribution, and real-world usage are taking precedence over rapid experimentation. Qureshi expects bitcoin to finish 2026 above $150,000, even as it accounts for a smaller share of the total crypto market. He views that combination as evidence that activity elsewhere could expand without displacing bitcoin’s role as the sector’s anchor asset. He was more cautious on newer fintech-branded blockchains, suggesting that enthusiasm may not translate into sustained usage. Instead, he expects developer activity to remain concentrated on neutral and composable infrastructure, with Ethereum and Solana continuing to outperform relative to expectations. He also anticipates deeper corporate involvement, particularly in payments and financial services, with at least one major technology company launching or acquiring a crypto wallet. Four-year cycle debate intensifies The outlook comes amid growing debate over whether crypto’s traditional four-year cycle, tied to Bitcoin halving events, is still relevant. Historically, halvings were followed by a bull run peaking around 18 months later, then a sharp correction and prolonged bear market. Some analysts argue that institutional participation through exchange-traded funds, corporate treasuries, and improved market infrastructure has weakened this pattern. Nick Ruck, director of LVRG Research, said in a CoinTelegraph report that sustained institutional demand has reduced volatility and softened post-peak crashes, potentially extending the bull market into 2026. Others, however, believe the cycle remains intact. Markus Thielen, CEO of 10x Research, has said bitcoin entered a bear market in late 2025, pricing in a slowing economy. Analysts, including “Rekt Capital” and PlanB have also suggested that expectations around the cycle may be driving selling pressure. Major institutions remain optimistic. Grayscale has forecast a new bitcoin all-time high in the first half of 2026, while Standard Chartered now expects bitcoin to reach $150,000 by the end of that year.

What’s Coming Next?,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-unrealized-profits-hit-yearly-low-whats-coming-next/,"Crypto analyst Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto) highlighted a concerning trend for XRP as net unrealized profits hit a yearly low. The analyst shared a Glassnode chart showing XRP’s NUPL (Net Unrealized Profit/Loss) declining sharply while the price currently hovers around $1.87. This development signals that a significant portion of holders are now underwater on their investments. BREAKING: $XRP UNREALIZED PROFITS HIT YEARLY LOW. pic.twitter.com/2rhmwclTRc — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 27, 2025 Understanding the Chart and NUPL Metrics The chart shows XRP experiencing a peak in unrealized profits in December, amid a massive rally that began the previous month. Following that strong run in late 2024, XRP’s price briefly surpassed $3, driving high unrealized gains. Over the subsequent months, profit-taking, regulatory concerns, and broader crypto market trends contributed to a downward trajectory. While the asset’s NUPL saw another resurgence in July when XRP hit its peak price , the overall trend was downward. XRP’s price followed that downward trend, experiencing notable losses in the months following its peak. As a result, NUPL metrics now show a contraction, signaling lower investor confidence in near-term price growth. The NUPL line has transitioned from green, representing belief and minimal losses, into yellow and orange hues, indicating growing anxiety and hope as prices fall. This shift suggests that many early buyers are holding positions at a loss, while the broader market sentiment edges closer to fear. Potential Recovery and Opportunities Despite the current trend, many analysts remain bullish on XRP. Its ecosystem, particularly adoption in cross-border payments , continues to attract interest. Low unrealized profit levels can create entry points for strategic investors. A shift in sentiment may turn underwater positions into support, helping the price recover. Investors observing these NUPL levels may see an opportunity to buy at a lower risk. Historical patterns suggest that XRP often rebounds after periods of high losses. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Looking Ahead XRP’s present unrealized profit low highlights both market volatility and potential for recovery. Careful monitoring of technical indicators, regulatory updates, and ecosystem growth is essential. If investor sentiment improves, NUPL can return to positive territory, signaling renewed optimism. The current period could represent a strategic buying opportunity for long-term holders looking to increase positions ahead of a potential rebound. XRP has demonstrated resilience through previous cycles. Current NUPL readings may be a critical moment for investors considering long-term strategies. While the market shows pressure, the fundamentals remain strong. Those who act with insight and timing could benefit if XRP regains traction.

With a focus on user experience and developer tools, NEAR Protocol is positioned to drive significant medium term growth in the decentralized application ecosystem. Its potential to disrupt traditional industries and capture market share in the blockchain space makes it an intriguing investment opportunity for those interested in innovative technology solutions. Why is NEAR down? NEAR is trading at $1.52 amidst the ongoing market conditions, as the bulls continue to fail at maintaining foothold above the $1.55 mark. Significant bearish activity suggests further price decline across short term. Will NEAR recover? NEAR protocol price has seen a massive selloff in the last thirty days as price fell from near the $3.00 mark to the current $1.5 price level. However, analysts believe that this bearish momentum will be short-term, predicting price targets in a range of $2.25 and the $2.5 by the end of 2025. Will NEAR reach $10? In the past few days NEAR observed a quick recovery to the $2.80 level where it faced short-term resistance and crashed back below the $2.70 mark. Will NEAR reach $20? NEAR protocol price is expected to cross the $20 threshold by 2031 This supports the long term forecast as the industry continues to see increasing adoption across the mainstream. The bullish rally will be supported by NEAR’s vision of a scalable future and user and developer-friendly architecture that sets it apart from other blockchains. Will NEAR reach $50? The chance of NEAR protocol price reaching the $50 mark depends on various circumstances, such as future network development, market regulations, and the broader cryptocurrency market growth. If NEAR continues its current trajectory, it can reach $50 in the next several years. Does NEAR have a good long term future? Yes, NEAR has a good long-term future due to its innovative technology, focus on scalability and strong ecosystem development, which supports a favorable market sentiment and price prediction.

NEAR Protocol historic price sentiment NEAR price history The Near Protocol (NEAR) began its journey in August 2020, aiming to create a scalable and permissionless blockchain. The first recorded trade value in October 2020 was $1.072, closing the year at $1.459 after a recovery. In 2021, NEAR showed an uptrend, starting at $1.305 and reaching an all-time high (ATH) of $7.572 by March 13. A market downturn pushed the price down to $1.537 by July 19, but it rebounded to $11.776 on September 9 and further to $13.168 on October 26. By 2022, NEAR’s price crashed to below $2.00, losing over 90% of its peak value. Throughout 2023, NEAR saw low volatility, with prices remaining below $2.50 for most of the year. Since the start of 2024, NEAR has experienced a strong recovery, climbing to $7.80. However, after reaching the $8.00 mark in mid-May, it fell back to $5.60. In June, NEAR traded between $4.48 and $7.66. It rose from $5.20 to $6.04 in July but closed the month below $5.00. NEAR started August at $5.00, declining to $3.89 by the end of the month. In September 2024, the asset bounced back and closed the month above the $5.20 mark. In October, the price stumbled and fell to $4.850 in the first few days before closing the month below the $4.00 mark leaving a negative outlook at the start of November. November saw NEAR making remarkable strides as the bulls held strong control of markets during the month, a trend that was expected to continue into December. However, the month saw NEAR plummet from heights of $7.00 to fall below $5 before closing the month. In January the price could not find a stable foothold and the price continued dwindling, closing the month just above $4.00 In February the price fell significantly towards the $3.00 mark and continued to decline ending the month at $2.80. In March the price continued to decline ending the month near $2.50, a trend that continued in April ending the month at $2.35. In May the price recovered but only to the extent of reversing April’s losses as the month ended below $2.50. June saw further decay as despite the early bullish signals, bears dominated the month and NEAR closed the month around $2.12. In mid-July, the price of NEAR Protocol surged toward the high of $3 but it started to decay in the later half of the month, a trend that continued in August with NEAR closing the month at $2.38. In September, the price rose sharply to the $3.40 mark but failed to maintain the level ending the month at $3.00 In October the price declined further as bears dominated the crypto markets with NEAR ending the month below the $2.00 mark. The trend continued in November with NEAR closing the month at the $1.80 mark.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|NEAR|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-30 08:07:29

Fund analysis supports a ""Hold"" rating for BTCI and a ""Sell"" rating for BITO. BITO faces significant risks due to its potential inability to sustain high payouts amid declining Bitcoin prices. BTCI could serve as a ""safe haven"" should Bitcoin prices remain range-bound for an extended period. Investment thesis This article concludes my comparative analysis of the main cryptocurrency ETFs, identifying the leaders and laggards during the bear and bull markets for Bitcoin. At first glance, NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF (BTCI) and ProShares Bitcoin ETF (BITO) appear fundamentally similar, whereas a more detailed analysis reveals significant differences between them. Furthermore, it is in this pair, I believe, where one of the main underperformers among exchange-traded funds with cryptocurrency instruments as their underlying assets is hidden. Considering that the price of Bitcoin may continue to decline by up to 20%, investing in these assets requires particular caution. Especially in BITO, who risks not being able to continue paying the current high dividend yield. Fundamental similarities and differences between BITO and BTCI BITO and BTCI funds are structurally similar players in the crypto asset ETF market, focusing on generating cash flow through Bitcoin. If we compare these funds with spot ETFs (such as IBIT), we see that they are focused on generating high returns not only during a Bitcoin bull market, but also regardless of the market cycle. These funds leverage the high volatility of crypto assets to generate income, allowing them to make high monthly payments to investors. As a result, both BITO and BTCI are actively managed, meaning that portfolio managers make real-time decisions to generate cash flow. If BTCI actively selects strike prices and expiration dates for call options, then BITO makes decisions on rolling from one futures contract to another. Even though these funds have Bitcoin in their names, neither of them holds it directly. They use derivatives in their investment strategy, so they don't have to deal with the operational risks of intermediaries when cold storing crypto assets. Like I said, they use high volatility, meaning they cash in on any active Bitcoin price movements. For BTCI, they do this by increasing the value of the options they sell. And for BITO, it's by locking in more profits on futures when prices go up. Although these funds have very similar investment concepts (at first glance), a deeper analysis of the fundamental similarities between BITO and BTCI allows us to identify the criteria by whom they should be distinguished. They are, essentially, two different instruments in terms of their internal structure and objectives. Firstly, it is reflected in the fact that they have different underlying assets. BTCI is based on spot ETFs, whereas BITO is based on Bitcoin futures. In addition, their income generation mechanisms differ, since options and futures have differences. The first case involves receiving a premium from the sale of call options, whereas the second case involves the distribution of realized profits from rollovers. When you invest in BTCI, it's like choosing a fund where only 20% of the portfolio is made up of the underlying asset, Bitcoin. Other assets are structured option contracts and government bonds that let you mimic owning Bitcoin and generate monthly income for shareholder payouts. However, the BTCI allows for synthetic exposure to Bitcoin. In other words, the fund earns when the underlying asset itself rises, yet its growth potential is limited due to the call options sold. By using positions through other Bitcoin ETFs, it applies its call option selling strategy to them. When the market starts to grow sharply, it means losing potential profits from the growth in the value of the crypto asset. In a sideways market, BTCI is the one that can generate extra income. With BITO, owning Bitcoin futures contracts means buying contracts at a future price. In periods when the future price is higher than the current price, a fund loses some of its returns when rolling over from an old contract to a new one. The funds also differ in terms of dividend yield. Both have high yields, with BITO significantly higher. Its current dividend yield is 78.29%, whereas BTCI's is 36.44%. That's 1.14 times more. The high payout ratio at BITO is due to the fact that the fund has to distribute almost all of its realized profits. Each time the price of Bitcoin goes up, additional profits are generated, and these are paid out to shareholders. But if the price of Bitcoin keeps going down or stays flat, those dividends could drop a lot ( they're already going down from $1.77 to $0.74 ). That's why BITO's high dividend yield isn't really reliable. Dividend History of BITO When it comes to BTCI, the advantage here is that payments are more predictable . They can even be maintained during periods of moderate Bitcoin price declines (as we are seeing in the fall and winter of 2025). Portfolio managers of BTCI aim to generate stable monthly payments, where the target range for the year is set at around 30%. The dividend yield is supported by the volatility of the Bitcoin price. When the market is more volatile, it is more likely that bonuses will be received, and these will be distributed to investors. Dividend History of BTCI In addition, we would like to briefly discuss the difference in tax efficiency between funds. The BTCI has high tax efficiency because it uses a capital return optimization strategy. Thanks to this, the investors can reduce their tax payments on dividends received, since part of the payments is considered a return of funds rather than income. BITO has standard tax efficiency, whereby dividends are considered ordinary income, making them subject to high taxation. If you are focused on generating passive income with stable payments, you believe in the long-term growth of Bitcoin, and you require high tax efficiency of payments, BTCI is exactly the asset you need. BITO cannot boast such features, making it a less profitable fund in terms of overall performance. Comparative table of BITO and BTCI The table below compares the main criteria that distinguish BITO and BTCI. Many criteria favor BTCI. Firstly, the Sharpe ratio is historically higher for the selected fund. BTCI's operating mechanism allows it to receive a premium from options even if the price of Bitcoin falls, thereby improving the risk/return ratio. The managers of BITO completely trust the movement of the Bitcoin futures price, making the fund's results more volatile. The difference in beta to Bitcoin is also worth noting. The standard indicator for BITO is 1.0x, making it highly correlated with the price of the crypto asset. BTCI, however, has a significantly lower beta. Thus, when the price of Bitcoin falls by 10%, the return on BITO decreases by 10%, whereas BTCI's return decreases by 5%. At the same time, this characteristic reduces potential profits when the price of Bitcoin rises sharply.

Alas, they both have negative values for the period from one month to one year. But while the total return of BTCI for the last year was -3.22% , that of BITO was -13.28%. That is why, for me, BTCI demonstrates better results in terms of capital preservation, whereas BITO is prone to costs from rolling over futures. If the market continues to decline, it will be necessary to pay out previous dividends from the capital base. This makes BITO a risky asset in the long term, so my recommendation for it is to ""Sell."" In order to make the analysis of BTCI's total return complete, for comparison I added BLOX ( which I recommend ""Buy"" ) and IBIT ( which I recently downgraded to ""Hold"" ). Only because of the recent launch of BLOX (less than a year ago), a 6-month period was used. Total Return, 6M Risks of investing in BTCI and BITO As my recommendation for BITO is ""Sell,"" I am not assessing the risks associated with it, because I am unlikely to make a decision to invest in this asset in the future. For BTCI, I recommend ""Hold,"" meaning that there is potential for the rating to be upgraded to ""Buy."" For those who already have BTCI in their portfolio, there is one major risk to consider when investing in this asset: profit-taking in the event of a Bitcoin price recovery. As a reminder, the beta is around ~0.45–0.60. Therefore, even if Bitcoin rallies by approximately 20%–30% from current prices, BTCI will only increase in value by 10%–15%. In other words, the current total loss of -15.26% over the past six months may not be offset. This is why investing in such an asset seems risky to me if a bull market is expected. But since Bitcoin has the potential for a 20% correction, this risk can be offset by the advantage that BTCI managers generate income even if the price of the underlying crypto asset falls. Conclusion The results of the comparative analysis between BITO and BTCI reveal fundamental differences between them, as reflected in the actual performance of the funds. Between these two assets, my choice would be BTCI, because it can generate cash flow while protecting against moderate Bitcoin price volatility. This is ideal for conditions when the market is in a sideways range. But in the event of a price increase, some of the profit will be cut off. That is why my recommendation for this asset is ""Hold."" BITO, meanwhile, has a high speculative nature and is suitable for a bullish Bitcoin market. However, it would be a mistake to choose BITO if you expect the downward correction in the cryptocurrency market to continue or if you expect the price to fluctuate in a sideways range for a long period of time. In general, comparing its total return with other assets, like BLOX and IBIT, allows us to recommend ""Sell.""",IBIT|BLOX|BITO|BTCI,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-12-30 08:11:05

This purchase ends a notable pause in buying activity that began after the company’s last major public purchase alongside Strategy in late September. The new acquisition, valued at over $450 million and executed at an average price near $105,412 per Bitcoin, brings Metaplanet’s total holdings to 35,102 BTC. The company’s director, Simon Gerovich, confirmed the purchase on social media, stating the total portfolio cost approximately $3.78 billion, averaging $107,606 per BTC.+ A key metric for the company is “BTC Yield,” which measures the change in Bitcoin held per share. Metaplanet reported a yield of 11.9% for the quarter and an impressive 568.2% for the year to date in 2025, indicating its strategy has significantly increased Bitcoin exposure per share even as it issued more stock. This move signals a restart of the firm’s dedicated “Bitcoin Treasury Operations,” which had been publicly quiet since a coordinated buying period with industry leader Strategy. That previous activity occurred on September 22, 2025, when both companies announced large purchases. At the time, Strategy added 850 BTC, while Metaplanet executed a massive $630 million purchase of 5,419 BTC, a move that briefly saw it outperform its larger U.S. counterpart in scale relative to its size. It followed this transaction up a couple of weeks later with a $615 million buy of another 5,268 BTC to bring its stash to 30,823 BTC. Since that flurry, Metaplanet had not reported any new market purchases until this week’s announcement.

By 2028, CRO could reach a maximum value of $0.4, with an average trading price of $0.35. Cronos is expected to reach a maximum level of $1.13 in 2031. Cronos (CRO) is the native cryptocurrency token of the Cronos chain, a decentralized, open-source blockchain developed by the Crypto.com payment, trading, and financial services company. CRO aims to power the next generation of decentralized crypto assets and applications, serving as a utility token. And enable real-time, low-cost transactions globally. Cronos cross-bridge mainnet beta suggests a bright future for CRO. This feature aims to improve interoperability between significant blockchain ecosystems, potentially increasing CRO’s attractiveness to developers and users. CRO’s recent performance reflects robust market sentiment and confidence. These factors, combined, make Cronos a compelling investment opportunity within the dynamic crypto market, thereby increasing the demand for CRO. Eminem’s involvement comes as Crypto.com has been actively expanding its visibility through various high-profile partnerships, including those with actor Matt Damon, major sports teams, and even Trump Media. In this Cronos price prediction, we’ll focus on exploring the future market trends of CRO, its current price momentum, and its past performance, using in-depth technical analysis and a price prediction model.

Rallies are being sold, as repeated rejections near $0.095 signal strong intraday supply. Bearish risk remains, with a breakdown below $0.09161 likely to accelerate downside pressure. On December 30, 2025, Cronos (CRO) trades at $0.09293, reflecting a 1.53% decline over the past 24 hours, according to the chart data provided. The price action shows CRO struggling to hold higher ground after a brief upside attempt, with sellers regaining control near the upper intraday range. Cronos 1-day price chart: CRO consolidates as lower highs cap upside momentum The daily timeframe shows resistance at $0.09515 and support at $0.09161, both defined by recent price extremes. With CRO trading near the midpoint of this range, price action points to consolidation rather than a clear breakout, as a late-session spike failed to hold and highlighted strong overhead supply. CRO/USDT Chart: TradingView The daily chart continues to print lower highs following rejection near $0.095, signaling capped bullish momentum. Sellers remain active above $0.092, while buyers defend the $0.09161 support; a daily close below this level would increase downside risk, whereas a sustained move above $0.09515 would be needed to restore a bullish bias. Cronos 4-hour price chart: CRO struggles to build upside momentum On the 4-hour chart, CRO price action appears more reactive, highlighting short-term sentiment shifts within the broader daily range. The chart shows a sharp upward spike during the session, followed by an immediate rejection, confirming $0.095 as a strong intraday supply zone and reinforcing seller presence at higher levels. CRO/USDT Chart: TradingView The $0.09161 support remains critical on this timeframe, as multiple tests have held but failed to generate strong upside continuation. Price behavior suggests high liquidation rather than accumulation, with traders selling into rallies instead of building momentum. As long as CRO trades below $0.09515, short-term risk remains tilted to the downside, while a breakdown below $0.09161 would likely accelerate bearish pressure on lower timeframes. Cronos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.1767 SELL SMA 5 $0.1512 SELL SMA 10 $0.09541 BUY SMA 21 $0.1027 SELL SMA 50 $0.1118 SELL SMA 100 $0.1526 SELL SMA 200 $0.1421 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.1082 SELL EMA 5 $0.1200 SELL EMA 10 $0.1482 SELL EMA 21 $0.1708 SELL EMA 50 $0.1647 SELL EMA 100 $0.1448 SELL EMA 200 $0.1278 SELL What to expect from Cronos? CRO is likely to remain range-bound in the near term as long as price holds between $0.09161 support and $0.09515 resistance. Continued rejection near the upper boundary suggests sellers remain in control, limiting the potential for a sustained recovery unless buying pressure increases decisively. A break below $0.09161 would expose CRO to deeper downside on lower timeframes, potentially accelerating bearish momentum. Conversely, a daily close above $0.09515 would be required to invalidate the current lower-high structure and signal a possible shift toward a bullish recovery. Is Cronos a good investment? Cronos (CRO) currently shows range-bound behavior with limited upside, suggesting short-term caution for investors. The repeated rejections near $0.095 and the risk of a breakdown below $0.09161 indicate that downside pressure could persist, especially on lower timeframes. For investors, this means CRO may be more suitable for short-term traders looking to capitalize on intraday swings rather than long-term holders seeking strong bullish momentum. A clear daily close above $0.09515 would improve the outlook, but until then, the market remains cautious and bearish-leaning. Why Is Cronos (CRO) Down Today? CRO’s decline today reflects a combination of technical resistance and profit-taking pressure. Repeated rejections near $0.095 indicate strong seller activity, preventing sustained upside and keeping price within the $0.09161–$0.09515 range. Additionally, the broader market sentiment may be cautious, with traders selling into short-term rallies rather than accumulating, contributing to downward pressure. Without a decisive breakout above resistance or a strong bullish catalyst, CRO is likely to continue facing consolidation and limited upward momentum. Will Cronos reach $0.5? Based on long-term forecasts, Cronos (CRO) is projected to reach $0.50 by 2029, potentially increasing its market capitalization as its ecosystem and user adoption continue to grow. Will Cronos reach $1? Projections for Cronos estimate it could reach $1 by 2031, driven by its expansion in DeFi, NFT integrations, and partnerships. Will Cronos reach $100? It is unlikely that Cronos’s price will reach $100, as this would require an extremely high market capitalization, surpassing the current CRO coin price prediction for the cryptocurrency sector. Does Cronos have an excellent long-term future? Cronos CRO holds promising long-term potential due to Crypto.com ’s ongoing innovations, such as DEX expansions, NFT integration, and metaverse applications, collectively enhancing CRO’s appeal and utility. These strategic initiatives, along with CRO’s liquidity, staking rewards, and network governance, position it as a solid investment for those with a long-term perspective, especially considering institutional adoption.

In 2020, CRO rose steadily, reaching above $0.20 by August before dropping to $0.06 by year-end. In 2021, CRO followed the crypto bull run, surpassing previous highs and achieving an all-time high of $0.9698 on November 24, boosted by listings on Coinbase Pro and Bitrue. CRO opened 2022 at $0.5575 but fell to $0.4409, partially due to concerns over a potential security breach on the Crypto.com platform, which temporarily suspended withdrawals in January. In 2023, Cronos experienced a peak in mid-March at around $0.80, followed by a steep decline and stabilization at around $0.20 by mid-year. It maintained a slight oscillation around this range in the following months. CRO started 2024 at $0.10, rallied to a yearly high of $0.18 in March, and declined to $0.12 by June. It stabilized between $0.08 and $0.10 from July to October, traded at $0.07193 and $0.09521 in November, and ended the year in a range of $0.138 and $0.234 in December. In January 2025, Cronos traded within the range of $0.158 to $0.163 but lost momentum towards the end of the month, resulting in a trading range of $0.1005 to $0.160 in February. Later in March, Cronos traded within the range of $0.08076 and $0.0950. However, after touching the $0.1 mark by the end of March, the Cronos price triggered a bearish rally. In April, the CRO price declined heavily due to the rising trade war between the US and China. The Cronos price dropped to a low of $0.08. However, it has been surging toward $0.09 in recent weeks of May. As of June, Cronos (CRO) declined from approximately $0.098 to $0.081, experiencing a steady downtrend with brief attempts at recovery near $0.085 in July.

This strategic pivot, reported by crypto derivatives trading firm STS Digital and observed by analysts globally, signals a maturation phase for alternative cryptocurrencies as institutional-grade financial instruments. Consequently, the move carries profound implications for market structure, liquidity, and price discovery mechanisms. Altcoin Options Attract Institutional Capital Flows For years, Bitcoin dominated institutional crypto strategies. However, the landscape is shifting decisively. According to data from STS Digital, a specialized crypto derivatives firm, institutions are now systematically applying options tactics to major altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Avalanche (AVAX). This trend accelerated notably throughout 2024 and into 2025. Primarily, these investors seek to manage the inherent price volatility of these assets while generating additional yield on their holdings. The October 10 market event, where cascading liquidations triggered a sharp downturn, underscored the critical need for sophisticated risk management tools beyond simple spot holdings. Furthermore, the growing depth and reliability of derivatives exchanges have enabled this shift. Platforms now offer sufficient liquidity and robust infrastructure for large-scale options trading on numerous altcoins. This development provides the necessary foundation for institutional participation. The table below outlines the core motivations driving this institutional move into altcoin options: Primary Motivation Institutional Objective Common Altcoins Targeted Volatility Management Hedge against sharp price swings and downside risk ETH, SOL, ADA Yield Generation Produce income from existing asset portfolios AVAX, DOT, MATIC Capital Efficiency Gain targeted exposure or protection without full asset purchase Major Layer 1 and DeFi tokens Risk Mitigation Avoid forced liquidations during market stress events High-market-cap assets with liquid options markets Deconstructing the Core Options Strategies in Use Institutions are not employing a monolithic approach. Instead, they tailor specific strategies to their market outlook and risk tolerance. The covered call stands as one of the most prevalent tactics. Here, an institution owns the underlying altcoin and simultaneously sells (or “writes”) call options against that holding. This strategy generates immediate premium income, effectively enhancing yield. However, it caps the upside potential if the asset’s price surges beyond the option’s strike price. Conversely, other institutions utilize protective puts or sell put options. Selling puts allows an investor to earn a premium while expressing a bullish or neutral view, with the obligation to buy the asset at a lower price if it declines. Buying put options, meanwhile, acts as direct insurance, paying off if the altcoin’s price falls below a certain level. This serves as a precise hedge for spot portfolios. Additionally, buying call options prepares a portfolio for a potential rally without committing the full capital required to own the asset outright. These tools collectively offer a versatile toolkit for navigating the altcoin market’s distinct rhythms. Expert Insight on Market Evolution and Risk Dynamics Market analysts point to the growing correlation between traditional finance (TradFi) practices and crypto markets as a key driver. “The application of these strategies represents a natural progression,” notes a report from Artemis Capital, a quantitative research firm. “As asset managers build larger, more diversified crypto portfolios, the demand for granular risk management tools increases exponentially.” The maturation is also evident in the options market’s metrics. Open Interest and daily volume for altcoin options have seen triple-digit percentage growth year-over-year, according to data from Deribit and Bybit. Nevertheless, experts caution about the unique risks. Altcoin options markets, while growing, are generally less liquid than Bitcoin’s. This can lead to wider bid-ask spreads and greater slippage on large orders. Moreover, the underlying volatility of altcoins themselves makes pricing models more complex. Events like network upgrades, regulatory news for specific tokens, or ecosystem-specific developments can trigger volatility that is harder to hedge perfectly. Therefore, institutions often combine these options strategies with rigorous fundamental and technical analysis of each altcoin project. The Broader Impact on Crypto Market Structure The institutional embrace of altcoin options is reshaping the market in several tangible ways. First, it contributes to deeper liquidity and more efficient price discovery across the derivatives complex. Increased trading volume improves market resilience. Second, it legitimizes altcoins as assets worthy of sophisticated financial engineering, potentially attracting more conservative capital over time. Third, the flow of institutional premiums into the options market creates a new class of market participants—option sellers—who provide liquidity and assume risk for a fee. This activity also influences spot market dynamics. Large options positions, particularly at key strike prices, can lead to increased spot trading volume as market makers hedge their exposures. This phenomenon, known as “pin risk,” can amplify movements around monthly or quarterly options expiration dates. Regulators are increasingly monitoring this interplay between derivatives and spot markets to ensure stability and prevent manipulation. The strategic shift underscores a broader trend: the cryptocurrency market is developing the layered complexity characteristic of mature financial ecosystems. Enhanced Liquidity: Institutional order flow boosts trading volume and tightens spreads. Sophisticated Hedging: Allows for precise risk management tailored to specific altcoin exposures. New Yield Avenues: Creates income-generating opportunities in both bullish and sideways markets. Market Maturation Signal: Indicates a move beyond speculative trading to structured portfolio management. Conclusion The strategic pivot toward altcoin options by institutional investors marks a definitive step in the financialization of the cryptocurrency sector. This movement transcends mere speculation, reflecting a calculated approach to volatility management, yield generation, and strategic portfolio construction. As derivatives infrastructure continues to mature and regulatory clarity improves, the utilization of these sophisticated instruments is likely to expand further. Ultimately, the growing institutional activity in altcoin options serves as a powerful indicator of the market’s ongoing evolution from a niche asset class into a complex and integral component of the global financial landscape. FAQs Q1: What are altcoin options? Altcoin options are financial derivatives that give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) a specific altcoin at a predetermined price on or before a certain date. They are used for hedging, speculation, and income generation. Q2: Why are institutions moving into altcoin options now? Institutions are moving now due to increased market maturity, deeper liquidity on derivatives exchanges, a need to manage risk in diversified crypto portfolios, and the desire to generate yield in a complex market environment, especially following volatile events. Q3: What is a covered call strategy for altcoins? A covered call involves owning an altcoin and selling call options against that holding. The investor collects the option premium as income but agrees to sell the coin at the strike price if it is reached, capping maximum upside potential. Q4: How does this trend affect the average altcoin investor? This trend generally leads to more liquid and stable markets, better price discovery, and the availability of more sophisticated trading and hedging products. However, it may also link altcoin prices more closely to derivatives market activity and institutional flows. Q5: Are altcoin options riskier than Bitcoin options? Typically, yes. Altcoins often exhibit higher volatility and may have less liquid options markets than Bitcoin, leading to wider spreads and potentially more complex risk dynamics.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-triangle-pattern-update-analyst-says-expect-a-big-move-soon-heres-why/,"XRP is trading near $1.85 as technical boundaries tighten around the price. Two levels now matter more than any narrative. One sits above the current price, and the other sits below. A new chart from crypto researcher and analyst Ripple Bull Winkle (@RipBullWinkle) isolates those boundaries and outlines the exact price levels that will define the digital asset’s next major move. XRP TRIANGLE PATTERN UPDATE Price: $1.85 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ TRIANGLE PATTERN 101 A triangle = price squeezed between falling resistance + rising support. Think: spring coiling before it snaps. – Break above → bullish breakout likely – Break below → … pic.twitter.com/NHZeBW7jga — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) December 27, 2025 Triangle Structure Drives the Setup Ripple Bull Winkle identifies a classic triangle formation on the XRP chart. He describes it as the “price squeezed between falling resistance + rising support.” His focus stays on mechanics. Lower highs continue to press down from above. Higher lows continue to rise from below. That convergence tightens the range with each session. According to his analysis, this structure reflects a balance rather than weakness. Buyers and sellers remain active, but neither side controls momentum. He states that XRP is trapped between two key levels . The asset is at the apex of the triangle, and he defines resistance at $1.89 and support at $1.94. That narrow zone reflects the compressed market. Potential Targets for XRP Ripple Bull Winkle outlines clear outcomes based on confirmation. He states that a break above resistance would shift control to buyers, pushing XRP from $1.89 to $3.08. That upside target represents the measured move tied to the triangle structure. It would also mark the digital asset’s highest level since the crash in early October . He also defines a potential downside scenario. He notes that falling below support would favor sellers, sending XRP from $1.94 to $0.62, a level not seen since late 2024. That level represents the lowest target he provides, and his approach treats both outcomes as valid until the price confirms one side.

He states that “Volume will confirm the winner.” Price movement alone does not complete the setup. Market participation does. A breakout without volume lacks follow-through. XRP is now at the apex of the triangle, with little room to move, and Ripple Bull Winkle tells investors to “ expect a big move soon .” Compression cannot last indefinitely, and the digital asset must choose a direction. The next move will define the trend’s direction, not just short-term price action. His targets remain fixed. $0.62 marks the low end. $3.08 defines the high end.

In her letter, Waters outlined ten pressing points that she expects the Committee to address as a matter of priority. SEC’s approach threatens market integrity The first issue she raised involves what she described as the “independence and politicization” of the SEC, which she said “threatens market integrity,” particularly in relation to insider trading risks and politically sensitive financial interventions. “Congress designed the SEC to be independent of the White House. Yet, Chairman Atkins repeatedly frames the agency’s agenda as an instrument of the Administration,” Waters said. “Reports of suspicious trading preceding the President’s tariff pause, and volatility surrounding interventions in Argentina, raise serious questions about manipulation.” She questioned whether the Commission is “adequately policing these risks,” and if it is honoring its statutory obligations to maintain regulatory independence. Waters also claimed that the SEC “has terminated or stayed major enforcement actions against multiple crypto companies and individuals that had been credibly accused of major violations of our securities laws, including Coinbase, Binance, and Justin Sun.” According to her, the Chairman’s office played an unusually active role in negotiating an end to these cases , and she called for the Committee to “scrutinize the SEC’s rationale for abandoning these matters,” and look into how the agency plans on deterring fraud and manipulation going forward. Waters further criticized the SEC’s approach to policymaking, accusing the agency of bypassing formal rulemaking procedures in favor of opaque staff-level decisions. She said this strategy undermines regulatory transparency and shields key decision-makers from accountability. “This approach flouts the SEC’s legal obligations under the Administrative Procedure Act, excludes the vital role public comment provides in identifying issues, and hides from Congressional and public view precisely what interests are influencing SEC decision-making, so that we cannot weigh the motives of those parties molding SEC policy,” she wrote. Other concerns she raised in the letter range from the weakening of market surveillance and corporate reporting standards, and the abandonment of climate-risk disclosures, to the erosion of shareholder rights, deregulation of private securities, audit oversight failures, and potential conflicts of interest related to Chairman Atkins’ private-sector background. As such, she has urged the Financial Services Committee to convene an oversight hearing without delay. “The Committee’s oversight obligation is not optional. Investors, retirees, and working families deserve transparency and accountability,” Waters concluded. Atkins, who took over from former SEC Chair Gary Gensler earlier this year, has since taken a more lenient stance in favor of the crypto industry. Under his leadership, the agency has shelved high-profile enforcement actions, relaxed transparency standards for digital asset funds, and promoted new regulatory tools through initiatives like Project Crypto . A history of crypto scrutiny Representative Waters has been a vocal critic of the crypto industry’s regulatory posture on several occasions over the past few years. Earlier in 2025, Waters and other Democrats organized Anti-Crypto Corruption Week to oppose three Republican-led crypto bills, including the CLARITY Act and the GENIUS Act . She argued that these bills lack crucial consumer and national security guardrails and would “open the floodgates to massive fraud and financial ruin.” She has also condemned President Donald Trump’s decision to pardon former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, and has frequently criticized the Trump family’s involvement in cryptocurrency ventures, which she describes as rife with conflicts of interest.

The adjustment comes amid heightened volatility in Asian currency markets and represents a substantial shift from previous projections, reflecting the complex interplay between monetary policy, market forces, and strategic government actions. Bank of America’s Revised USD/KRW Forecast Analysis Bank of America’s research division now projects the USD/KRW exchange rate to stabilize around 1,280-1,320 through mid-2026, marking a notable revision from their previous forecast of 1,350-1,400. This adjustment follows the South Korean government’s decisive intervention in foreign exchange markets, which involved substantial dollar sales and won purchases. The bank’s analysts cite three primary factors driving this revision: Government intervention scale : Unprecedented volume of currency market operations Policy coordination effectiveness : Synchronized actions between monetary and fiscal authorities Market sentiment shift : Reduced speculative pressure on the Korean won Furthermore, the revision incorporates recent economic data showing stronger-than-expected export performance and controlled inflation metrics. Bank of America’s currency strategists emphasize that while short-term stabilization appears likely, medium-term risks remain substantial, particularly regarding global dollar strength and regional economic dynamics. South Korean Government Intervention Strategy The South Korean government implemented a multi-pronged intervention strategy beginning in late 2024, accelerating through 2025 as currency pressures intensified. Authorities deployed approximately $15 billion in foreign exchange reserves to support the won, while simultaneously implementing regulatory measures to curb speculative trading. The Ministry of Economy and Finance coordinated closely with the Bank of Korea, creating a unified policy response that surprised many market observers with its scale and timing. Key intervention mechanisms included: Intervention Type Estimated Scale Primary Objective Direct Market Operations $8-10 billion Immediate currency stabilization Forward Market Activity $4-5 billion Managing future expectations Regulatory Measures Multiple directives Reducing speculative flows Market participants initially questioned the sustainability of these interventions, given South Korea’s substantial but finite foreign exchange reserves. However, the government’s coordinated approach, combined with improving economic fundamentals, gradually shifted market psychology. The intervention succeeded not only in stabilizing the exchange rate but also in signaling strong policy commitment to currency stability. Expert Analysis and Market Implications Financial experts across Asia are closely monitoring the situation, with many noting broader implications for emerging market currencies. Dr. Min-ji Park, Senior Currency Analyst at Seoul National University’s Economic Research Institute, explains: “The South Korean intervention represents a case study in modern currency management. Authorities balanced immediate stabilization needs with longer-term reserve adequacy concerns, while maintaining transparency to avoid triggering capital flight.” Market implications extend beyond the USD/KRW pair. Regional currencies, particularly the Taiwanese dollar and Singapore dollar, experienced reduced volatility as the intervention demonstrated regional central banks’ capacity to manage currency pressures. Global investment funds have adjusted their Asian currency allocations accordingly, with many increasing exposure to Korean assets based on reduced currency risk premiums. Economic Context and Historical Precedents South Korea’s current currency challenges emerge from a complex global economic environment. The Federal Reserve’s prolonged tightening cycle, combined with China’s economic rebalancing, created perfect storm conditions for Asian currencies throughout 2024-2025. Historical analysis reveals important parallels with previous intervention episodes: 2008 Global Financial Crisis : Similar scale interventions with different economic backdrop 2013 Taper Tantrum : Comparable market dynamics but stronger Korean fundamentals today 2020 Pandemic Response : Different intervention objectives but similar policy coordination Current interventions differ significantly in their proactive nature and integrated policy approach. The government preemptively addressed potential speculative attacks through enhanced monitoring and rapid response mechanisms. This forward-looking strategy contrasts with previous reactive approaches and reflects lessons learned from past currency crises. Global Financial Institution Responses Bank of America’s forecast revision aligns with broader adjustments across global financial institutions. Major banks including Citigroup, HSBC, and JPMorgan have similarly moderated their USD/KRW projections, though with varying degrees and timelines. The consensus shift reflects growing recognition of intervention effectiveness and improving Korean economic indicators. International Monetary Fund monitoring indicates cautious approval of South Korea’s approach, emphasizing the importance of maintaining adequate reserves while pursuing stability objectives. The Bank for International Settlements has noted the intervention’s technical sophistication, particularly in managing market expectations through forward guidance and transparent communication. Technical Analysis and Trading Patterns Technical analysts observe significant changes in USD/KRW trading patterns following the intervention. Volatility metrics have declined approximately 30% from pre-intervention peaks, while trading volumes have shifted toward longer-term institutional participants. Options market data reveals reduced demand for extreme downside protection on the won, indicating improved market confidence. The intervention’s timing proved particularly effective, coinciding with seasonal export conversion flows that naturally support the won. By amplifying these fundamental flows, authorities achieved maximum impact with minimal reserve expenditure. This strategic timing demonstrates sophisticated market understanding and operational expertise. Future Outlook and Risk Factors Looking forward, several factors will determine whether the USD/KRW stabilization proves durable. Export performance remains crucial, with semiconductor and automotive sectors showing particular importance. Global dollar trends continue to represent the primary external risk, while domestic inflation management presents ongoing challenges. Potential risk factors include: Renewed Federal Reserve tightening beyond current expectations Deterioration in China-Korea trade relations Unexpected shifts in global energy markets affecting import costs Domestic political developments affecting policy continuity Most analysts project gradual normalization of intervention measures as markets stabilize, with authorities likely maintaining enhanced monitoring capabilities developed during this period. The experience may prompt permanent changes in South Korea’s foreign exchange management framework, potentially including new tools for managing capital flows. Conclusion Bank of America’s revised USD/KRW forecast reflects a significant reassessment of South Korea’s currency outlook amid government intervention. The adjustment acknowledges both the immediate effectiveness of market operations and improving economic fundamentals. While challenges remain, particularly regarding global monetary policy divergence, the intervention has successfully stabilized currency markets and reduced systemic risks. The USD/KRW forecast revision serves as an important indicator of broader Asian currency trends and demonstrates the continuing relevance of strategic foreign exchange management in an increasingly volatile global economy. FAQs Q1: Why did Bank of America revise its USD/KRW forecast? Bank of America revised its forecast primarily due to effective South Korean government intervention in currency markets, combined with stronger-than-expected economic fundamentals including export performance and controlled inflation. Q2: How significant was the South Korean government’s currency intervention? The intervention involved approximately $15 billion in various market operations, representing one of the largest coordinated currency stabilization efforts in recent years, with particularly sophisticated timing and execution. Q3: What are the main risks to the revised USD/KRW forecast? Primary risks include unexpected Federal Reserve policy shifts, deterioration in regional trade relations, global energy market volatility, and potential changes in domestic economic policies or political conditions. Q4: How does this intervention compare to previous South Korean currency measures? Current interventions are more proactive, better coordinated across government agencies, and more transparent than previous measures, incorporating lessons learned from past currency challenges including the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Q5: What implications does this have for other Asian currencies? The successful intervention has reduced volatility across regional currencies by demonstrating effective policy responses, potentially establishing a template for other economies facing similar currency pressures in the current global environment.

XRP’s High-Stakes Crossroad,https://coinpaper.com/13452/breakout-or-bloodbath-xrp-s-high-stakes-crossroad,"XRP at a Crossroads: Breakdown Risk vs Accumulation Signal According to market analyst Paul Bennett, XRP is facing a critical juncture that could define its trajectory in the coming months. By trading near the $1.91–$1.93 zone, the digital asset hovers around a long-term support zone that has historically served as a reliable rebound point since the November 2024 breakout. This area is shaping up as a decisive make-or-break level for the cryptocurrency. CoinCodex data confirms XRP is currently priced around $1.87, highlighting a slight pullback but still within the crucial support region. Bennett highlights that despite ongoing short-term pressure, XRP’s long-term accumulation thesis stays intact if key support holds. As a result, a breach could spark a major breakdown, risking deeper losses. Since its November 2024 breakout, XRP has repeatedly bounced within the $1.87–$1.93 zone, highlighting it as a key accumulation area. Sustained support here could signal growing institutional interest and reinforce confidence in XRP’s structural growth. A decisive break below, however, may shift sentiment, heightening downside risk and challenging its role as a long-term accumulation asset. Well, Bennett acknowledges XRP’s pivotal moment because consolidation near key support offers long-term accumulation opportunities amid rising adoption and improving liquidity, yet accelerating bearish momentum could trigger a breakdown. Therefore, the market now faces a decisive crossroads, either reinforcing post-breakout gains or succumbing to a corrective pullback. Furthermore, XRP’s $1.87–$1.93 support zone is critical. A hold reinforces long-term accumulation, drawing institutional and retail interest, while a break could trigger a high-timeframe sell-off. As Bennett notes, the next few days may decide whether XRP rallies or faces a sharp correction. Conclusion XRP’s $1.87–$1.93 support zone is a make-or-break point. Holding it reinforces the long-term accumulation narrative, attracting both institutional and retail buyers. A break, however, risks a major high-timeframe breakdown, shifting sentiment and opening the door to further losses. Therefore, the verdict is whether XRP extends its post-breakout momentum or faces a sharp corrective phase.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-30 09:07:37

BTCI has demonstrated the ability to track Bitcoin's price movements and hedge against downturns, lessening the blow during crypto corrections. Despite BTCIs attractive high 25-38% yield, investors should not rely on this level of income long term due to declining volatility of the asset over time. Back in February of this year, I covered NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF ( BTCI ) in depth: how the fund works, its competitors, and how investors can use the fund in their own portfolio to manage the asset risk of Bitcoin. Since then, I've learned more about Bitcoin and developed a lot of comfort with the asset. We've also observed heavy investment and business structuring around Bitcoin between institutional investment, product offerings, and treasuries like Strategy Inc. ( MSTR ), ProCap Financial, Inc. ( BRR ), and Cardone Capital buying Bitcoin at a blistering pace. Bitcoin has had a volatile ride in 2025, peaking above $126,000 before correcting 30%, but BTCIs high monthly distributions, which range between 25-38%, turn this volatility into a consistent cash flow cushion. The key risks remain and were felt this year: capped upside in rallies and significant downside risk during crypto winters, but for my new goal, I think it's worth it. I've since committed to building a position equivalent to one full Bitcoin's value via BTCI ETF. I want the exposure to Bitcoin and cash flow an options ETF can provide to help offset all my fixed expenses: subscriptions, car tabs, cellphone, water, internet, energy, insurance, fuel, property taxes, and grocery bills with passive income to have financial security. While building ownership of a single Bitcoin is a somewhat concentrated and challenging endeavor, over time it should represent less than 10% of my estate while hedging inflation, growing wealth, and providing cash flow. Bitcoin's Performance At its peak, BTCI was floating between a 50-75% return attributed to Bitcoin's $75,000 to $126,000 price increase from April to October 2025 this year. However, since inception in 2024, BTCI has outperformed the S&P 500 by 6% at 26.37% vs. 20.34% respectively due to Bitcoin's price dive back to the $80,000 range in the last few months. This, in my opinion, has been a great buying opportunity for both Bitcoin and, in my case, BTCI. Due to the inherent high volatility of Bitcoin, dollar cost averaging over time and taking advantage of large dips is an excellent approach to managing your Bitcoin position. This is exactly what I'm doing now as I buy $50 of BTCI per day and reinvest all the distributions. Data by YCharts Year to date, BTCI and Bitcoins returns didn't end up turning out positive outside of a pending year end spike compared to the S&P 500s excellent and steady 19% return. Interestingly, BTCI faired a little better on total returns compared to Bitcoin and iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) being only down -1.34% vs -6-7% for Bitcoin. BTCI has moved very nicely and in line with Bitcoin itself with slightly less volatility. The payouts have provided a real buffer during these choppy consolidation phases. Pure Bitcoin is great for treasury companies or those who want to preserve wealth, for me its just hard holding something with no cash flow or more importantly, an exit strategy to convert the asset into cash flow. The biggest personalities in the space don't recommend selling Bitcoin, but what good is $5M of Bitcoin in my Estate if it just sits there producing nothing? I believe Bitcoin will have more applications to generate cash flow in the future, options strategies are just one of them. Data by YCharts Income Risk While I initially see and will continue to see a large chunk of my portfolio income rapidly come from BTCI, eventually around $2,000 per month, over time I believe it will actually only be 5% of my income needs as volatility drops and my dividend growth positions grow into seven-figure positions. Over the past five years, Bitcoin has declined in volatility considerable relative to the USD and I expect the asset to decline further as time goes on, but stay above the volatility of say, the S&P 500. Bitcoin 5 Year Volatility (bitbo.io/volatility/) Bitcoin 1 Year Volatility (unusualwhales.com) Bitcoin's implied volatility is 0.405 compared to 0.112 for the S&P 500 so still quite a bit more volatile. This means BTCI should continue paying out significantly more than, say, NEOS S&P 500 High Income ETF ( SPYI ) which pays a 12% annual yield steadily, but I caution investors to not rely on 25-38% annual yields forever, as I could see the yield coming down to 16% one day as volatility lessens. Coupled with potential declining distributions, keeping your cost basis under control is another risk to manage to lessen paper losses. That's why I recommend both dollar cost averaging over time into Bitcoin and buying the dips. Outlook Nearly one year ago, BTCI was my tentative entry point into Bitcoin without abandoning my focus on income. After proving itself through 2025's roller coaster and crash, or more like a correction in the crypto world, I've committed to the product as a way to get exposure, upside, and income from a great alternative asset that's rapidly changing the world and the way we do business. I currently own roughly $10,000 worth of BTCI or over 200 shares. To own one Bitcoin via BTCI, you need roughly 2,000 shares, give or take 100 shares, based on historic BTC-USD/BTCI ratio price movements. For fellow income-oriented investors on the fence about crypto, this correction is a good time to consider gaining some exposure to BTCI and Bitcoin before we march our way back up into another six figure Bitcoin.",IBIT|BTCI,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-12-30 09:08:42

Additionally, Standard Chartered and JPMorgan analysts also predicted BTC’s price to hit $150,000 and $150,000–$170,000 by the end of 2026, respectively. On-chain data from CoinGecko indicate that the current price of Bitcoin (BTC) is $87,103.24, representing a 3.3% increase from the previous day. The cryptocurrency is still 30.8% below its peak value of $126,080, which was attained just three months prior on October 6, 2025. Qureshi believes that the cryptocurrency industry is progressing beyond speculation and is witnessing significant integration with the established financial system; thus, his forecast for 2026 will be more positive. He warned that in the DeFi industry, insider trading scandals cannot be ruled out. Qureshi stated that perpetual products will surpass a 20% market share, and perpetual derivatives DEXs may merge into approximately three dominant platforms. According to Qureshi, Ethereum and Solana are expected to outperform Tempo, Arc, and Robinhood Chain in terms of daily active addresses, stablecoin flows, and RWAs. Qureshi stated that top developers will continue to build on neutral infrastructure chains, which will strengthen their ecosystem by attracting top software engineers. He projected that the overall supply of stablecoins will increase by approximately 60% in 2026, with USD remaining at 99% or higher. As the industry diversifies, USDT’s dominance is expected to gradually decrease to approximately 55%. Qureshi stated that the use of stablecoin-backed cards is expected to increase by an astounding 1,000% with Rain emerging as the primary beneficiary of this trend, swiftly becoming the main way for stablecoins to enter and grow in new markets. Qureshi made a bullish statement about Zcash in the unexpected reply to the user. He expressed his belief that privacy will trail behind. There will be some adoption of private transactions on Arc and Tempo. He stated that Zcash will probably succeed because people want to believe in it. Qureshi further noted that he believes the majority of people would continue to act in the same manner in 2026. Qureshi says big companies will adopt blockchain for Real-World use Qureshi cited the current trend of large firms and organizations entering the cryptocurrency market. According to Qureshi, at least one major technology company, such as Google, Apple, or Meta, is expected to release or acquire a cryptocurrency wallet in 2026. He claimed that the possible release of the crypto wallet would put billions of daily users in touch with cryptocurrency via platforms they already use. Qureshi demonstrated that the emergence of additional Fortune 100 companies would start utilizing blockchain technology for practical applications beyond consumer technology, particularly in the banking and financial industries. Qureshi stated that these enterprises are likely to establish personal and licensed networks utilizing existing toolsets, such as Avalanche subnets, OP Stacks, Orbit, or ZK Stack. He further stated that the recent trend demonstrates the prevalence of blockchain as a beneficial business tool that extends beyond its speculative value. Despite this business interest, Qureshi expressed doubts about the new public blockchains that financial technology firms have built, occasionally referred to as fintech L1s. He argued that such networks will not be as good as expected. He added that these networks will not draw a large amount of traffic or users out of popular chains such as Ethereum or Solana.

LIT will start trading on Lighter and soon spread to other exchanges. Lighter announced the generation and trading launch of its native LIT token after building up its trading volumes in the past few months. Lighter was one of the perpetual futures DEXs to emerge in 2025, boosted by the success of Hyperliquid and Aster. The exchange announced the Lighter Infrastructure Token (LIT), which would align the incentives within the ecosystem. As Cryptopolitan reported earlier, Lighter had already announced the year-end airdrop to its users. We are announcing the Lighter Infrastructure Token (LIT)! Lighter is building infrastructure for the future of finance and the native token is key to aligning incentives. In this thread, we will describe the structure of the token, broader vision, and roadmap of use cases. — Lighter (@Lighter_xyz) December 30, 2025 LIT is one of the tokens that will distribute the value of the ecosystem from the start. The model is based on the approach of Hyperliquid, which uses HYPE to benefit token holders. “Revenues from our core DEX product as well as future products and services can be tracked in real-time on chain and will be allocated between growth and buybacks depending on market conditions,” explained the exchange team. The newly launched LIT token is still in the earliest stage of price discovery and has yet to set up a price range. LIT will be distributed to token holders based on the points accrued from two farming seasons in 2025. LIT will be distributed to holders directly The launch of LIT was anticipated by the end of the year. The token will distribute 25% of the total supply to point farmers, fully unlocked and ready for trading. Soon after the launch, LIT traded at $2.62, later dipping to $2.30. LIT then recovered and started accruing gains at over $2.80. Lighter entered its first stage of price discovery, with early trading pairs on BingX taking most of the volume. | Source: CoinMarketCap . The initial price discovery for the token is happening only on BingX, while still waiting for decentralized pairs and trading on Lighter itself. The LIT token launch was widely anticipated, in addition to Lighter’s roadmap for 2026. LIT arrives after a year of contentious new token events, where most of the launched assets crashed. LIT may also attempt to perform in a way similar to HYPE by encouraging holding. However, even HYPE has been pressured by profit-taking. Lighter becomes trading volume leader The Lighter DEX only locks in around $1.4B in value, much smaller compared to other DEXs. The platform is among the leaders in daily volumes, reaching $4.7B ahead of its LIT token launch. Lighter emerged as one of the perpetual futures DEXs with the highest trading volumes, passing even Hyperliquid and Aster. | Source: Dune Analytics . Hyperliquid, Aster, and Lighter were the three exchanges to emerge in 2025 with the highest level of liquidity. Recently, Lighter flipped Aster with a higher TVL metric and more active trading volumes. The Lighter activity increased as the platform was preparing for its TGE. At that time, Hyperliquid barely reached $2.5B in trading volumes. Lighter is yet to prove that the volume is organic and linked to real entities. The volumes on Lighter have been growing for the whole of 2025, though incentivized by the point farming program.

At present, the DeFi token is in Phase 7 of its presale and is only available for the discounted price of $0.04. Following this phase, the presale will enter Phase 8, in which the cost for the DeFi token will increase to $0.045, an increase of almost 20%. Following the presale, the DeFi token will then reach its launch price of $0.06. The presale structure is not only set up to develop awareness through the creation of ‘scarcity value’ but is set to give the initial supporters a substantial forecasted return on investment value of over 300%. Mutuum Finance is quickly being recognized as the top crypto choice and the best crypto to invest in for savvy investors. Other investment projects and platforms only lay emphasis on the market ‘hype’ and ‘trend-inspiration’ and not on creating genuine DeFi functionality. Since market sentiment is warming up towards altcoins and their capacity for use and functionality, the presale and investment benefits offered by Mutuum Finance make this particular crypto one of the leading and best cryptocurrencies to invest in for the year. MUTM Presale Phase 7 One of the trending stories today regards Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as it has been classified as the top crypto projects to purchase in the DeFi presale space today. At the moment, they are in Presale Phase 7, where the tokens can be purchased at $0.04. However, this particular phase is selling fast as it will cost $0.045 in Phase 8, indicating an increase of about 20%. The presale is already yielding $19,500,000, consisting of a total of 18,570 MUTM holders. The existing Phase 7 market value is a 300% improvement over Phase 1 market value of $0.01. The proposed launch value for MUTM is set at $0.06, which guarantees a possible ROI of 420%. The figures highlight the vast potential offered by the MUTM cryptocurrency, making it the best crypto to invest in for long-term growth. Lending and Borrowing Model Drives Utility The appeal of MUTM does not end there, considering that its innovative loan and borrow system has been made to ensure that the use of the cryptocurrency is sustainable by allowing users to earn interests by interacting with the system. In addition, the smart contracts for the lending and borrowing on the system are being audited by Halborn Security . Mutuum Finance has introduced an upgraded dashboard with a leaderboard for top 50 holders and another leaderboard with winners for 24 hours, resetting every day at 00:00 UTC. The top MUTM buyer in this daily leaderboard is rewarded with a $500 MUTM bonus, provided they make an account transaction in the day, thus pushing them to engage actively with the blockchain. Such an incentive mechanism adds to MUTM token utility, further reinforcing its position as the top crypto in the DeFi sector. Earn Real-Time Passive Income by Using mtTokens Mutuum Finance brings in something novel to the table through mtTokens, which is also the reward system offered to clients for lending their assets to the platform. As compared to traditional assets that can only generate interest when withdrawn, mtTokens enable clients to earn passive income in real-time, meaning one earns while retaining liquidity on the Mutuum Finance platforms. In fact, this is the aspect that makes the MUTM token so useful within the Mutuum Finance ecosystem, solidifying its reputation as the best crypto to invest in this year. DeFi token Mutuum Finance, based on the Ethereum network and available on presale at $0.04 in Phase 7, is giving investors one of the final opportunities available before the price boost of 20% at $0.045 in Phase 8. More than 18,560 investors have already contributed $19.5 million, and this shows that the token is on the right track and enjoying market confidence. Mutuum Finance is offering an audited lending and borrowing system, along with current mtToken rewards and community leaders, and therefore it is providing utility along with tremendous growth opportunities. Investors can expect an ROI of 420% at launch, which is why MUTM is increasingly seen as the top crypto and the best crypto to invest in for both new and experienced investors.

Nonetheless, Bitwise’s CEO, Hunter Horsley, says that despite the intricate nature of Iran’s economic meltdown, Bitcoin could provide people everywhere with protection from devaluing currencies. He commented , “Economic mismanagement — The story of the past, present, and future. Bitcoin is a new way for people to protect themselves.” Iran’s inflation has surged over 40% since last year Since the June war with Israel, the rial in Iran has lost more than 40%, with the official exchange rate sitting at an estimated 1.4 million per US dollar. A rate well beyond the official level of the early 1980s was at 70 rials per dollar, according to Alex Gladstein, Chief Strategy Officer at the Bitcoin-focused Human Rights Foundation. The currency’s decline is only adding to the challenges confronting President Masoud Pezeshkian and the nation’s top leaders. US sanctions curtailing oil income have only intensified the currency’s fall, and the nation’s inflation rate rose to 42.2% year-on-year in December. Moreover, gold coins, a popular hedge against inflation for Iranian households, reached an all-time high of 1.7 billion rials. Protests in central Tehran began on Sunday, particularly among electronics retailers, before merchants in the city’s Grand Bazaar joined the fray on Monday. State TV covered the protests, reporting that the demonstrators were demanding the stabilization of foreign currency prices. Mohammad Reza Farzin, the governor of the Central Bank of Iran, also stepped down amid the protests, a move that deepened uncertainty about the country’s fate. Sigel says the government restricted Bitcoin mining at a critical time Crypto trading is permitted in Iran; however, self-custody regulations remain vague, and the government has taken steps to discourage people from engaging in Bitcoin mining, according to VanEck’s Matthew Sigel. He argued that the country stepped up enforcement against unregistered Bitcoin mining at the worst possible moment as people rushed to protect their wealth. Ideally, Iran’s tight Bitcoin mining rules have limited locals’ ability to exploit cheap power, which could enable mining Bitcoin for around $1,300 per coin as of October, far below the current price of $87,600. Overall, Iranians remain under economic strain as sanctions isolate the country from international markets, a situation exacerbated by Bank Melli’s bankruptcy in October, which put millions of accounts at risk. In February, Iran’s central bank also cautioned that eight additional domestic banks could face dissolution if they fail to carry out reforms. Not to mention, the state’s crypto exchange Nobitex was hacked for $81 million in June, with Iranian crypto flows falling 11% by the following month during renewed conflict with Israel. Faced with rising inflation, many Iranians, however, have been left uncertain about when relief will arrive, as the prices of staples such as chicken, dairy products, and beans have soared amid cooking oil shortages. Sheyda, a pensioner, railed: “They pay us in currency [rials] that literally turn to ash as you attempt to purchase basic goods. Shopkeepers say everything now is priced in dollars, even milk, and prices go up almost every day.” Authorities have already loosened some social restrictions, like dress codes for women, in addition to extending food assistance to lower-income households. The government will introduce new subsidies next year to assist workers who survive on roughly $100 a month. However, former US Secretary of State has accused the Iranian government of corruption, blaming it for the deteriorating economy. He noted, “The people of Iran deserve a representative government that serves their interests – not those of the mullahs and their cronies.” Sharpen your strategy with mentorship + daily ideas - 30 days free access to our trading program",News|Bitwise|BTC|IRR|USD,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MINING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-30 09:31:19

Recent on-chain data shows whales accumulating ETH through 2025, as retail investors continue to exit. Concurrently, network activity has hit a fresh high, which indicates greater demand by the builders and long-term holders. Whales Increase Holdings as Retail Exits The latest data shows a clear divergence between large and small investors. Wallets holding large amounts of ETH have grown their balances from around 14 million to over 22.2 million tokens throughout 2025. Meanwhile, retail wallets have declined from 11 million ETH to 8.3 million. Crypto analyst Mister Crypto commented , “Whales are accumulating Ethereum while retail is dumping their bags.” His chart illustrates the change clearly. While retail holdings dropped throughout the year, large investors steadily added to their positions. Supporting this view, a recent CryptoPotato report noted that wallets holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH now hold over 21 million tokens combined. Exchange reserves are also down more than 4 million ETH this year, suggesting fewer coins are available for trading. Developer Activity Hits All-Time High Ethereum is also seeing record levels of activity from developers. On-chain metrics show that 8.7 million smart contracts were deployed in Q4 2025, marking the highest quarter ever. BMNRBullz stated , “ This isn’t speculation, it’s builders shipping ,” pointing to growing use of the Ethereum network beyond price speculation. More smart contracts suggest increased use of applications, infrastructure, and real-world assets. This rise in on-chain usage is being tracked closely by institutions looking beyond price trends. Market Levels to Watch Ethereum is trading near $2,940, down 3% over the last day and 1% for the week. The asset has ranged between $2,900 and $3,050 in the last 24 hours. Analysts are watching key levels near $2,880 for support and $3,060 for resistance. CRYPTOWZRD said , “A rejection after a retest of the $2,880 support would offer further upside.” They added that a move above $3,060 may trigger a fresh long opportunity. The intraday structure remains tied to Bitcoin’s movement, but ETH is holding above key levels. On the weekly chart, Ethereum continues to form a large structure that may act as a bull flag. Bitcoinsensus shared a chart showing a series of higher lows and lower highs since 2022. A recent failed breakout attempt was followed by more consolidation. If ETH breaks out from the upper range, the technical target is set near $7,000. Other traders are watching monthly charts for a possible double bottom setup. Trader Tardigrade called attention to a possible breakout pattern forming, while Ted flagged liquidity near $2,900 and $3,100 as key zones traders are watching in the short term.

The Japanese memory chipmaker outperformed every company tracked on the MSCI World Index during the year, even as global markets faced repeated volatility tied to trade policy , ra tes, and tech spending fears. The rally pushed Kioxia to the top of Japan’s Topix index for 2025, less than a year after the company debuted on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in December. AI storage demand drives Kioxia’s pricing pressure as Microsoft and Apple become customers Kioxia now carries a market value of roughly ¥5.7 trillion, or $36 billion, and counts Apple and Microsoft among its customers as hyperscale data centers expanded to meet AI workloads, according to its latest quarterly filing from November. NAND chips are the core of data centers that power large models, and capacity has not kept pace with demand. Investors positioned around that imbalance, sending Kioxia higher on expectations that pricing and volumes would support revenue into 2026. “In tech, we go into 2026 mainly geared to memory, whether that’s direct exposure to Kioxia or second derivative plays,” said Amir Anvarzadeh, Japan equity strategist at Asymmetric Advisors. Amir said wafer suppliers such as Sumco were also positioned to benefit next year as memory production stayed under pressure. The rally did not move in a straight line. Shares fell 23% in a single session in November after quarterly earnings failed to meet elevated expectations built into the stock, thanks to concerns across AI-linked equities about stretched valuations during the second half of the year. Even so, supply conditions remained tight. “Worries about a data center investment slowdown shouldn’t really affect memory prices fo r ne xt term, as the market is already heavily undersupplied,” Amir said. Japanese equities hit records as policy support meets tech demand Kioxia’s rally happened alongside a record-setting year for Japanese equities. The Topix index closed 2025 at 3,408.97, beating the 2,881.37 level last seen at the peak of Japan’s late-1980s bubble economy. The index rose 22% over the year, marking its third straight annual gain. Global financial markets crashed big time in April after President Donald Trump’s Liberation Day tariffs triggered global selloffs, but Japan recovered relatively quickly, hitting new all-time highs by July as trade tensions eased. In November, Japan’s first female prime minister, Takaichi Sanae, announced about ¥18 trillion, or $115 billion, in additional stimulus funding. The package targeted 17 strategic industries, including quantum computing and nuclear fusion, reinforcing long-term tech spending plans. Some AI-linked stocks lagged late in the year, though, like SoftBank with its 17% plunge over the past 3 months, but the company remained up about 90% year to date. Market participation broadened, with small-cap stocks rising 27% and mid-caps gaining 26%, both beating large caps for the first time since 2022. The Nikkei 225 closed at 50,339.48, its second straight record year end, as gains from major stocks drove a 26% annual rise, topping the Topix for a third consecutive year, with Kioxia standing at the center of Japan’s strongest equity run in decades.

Geoffrey Kendrick, Standard Chartered’s global head of digital assets research, cites two major catalysts for XRP’s bullish outlook: the SEC’s withdrawal of its appeal against Ripple, easing legal uncertainty, and the potential approval of a spot XRP ETF, which could unlock substantial institutional investment. On the other hand, a Monte Carlo simulation, a statistical model widely used in finance, projects a 60% probability that XRP will trade between $1.04 and $3.40 by 2026, with a median estimate of $1.88. Therefore, this suggests strong potential for steady accumulation despite ongoing short-term volatility with XRP’s price presently being $1.87 per CoinCodex data . While Standard Chartered’s bullish $8 target excites the market, some analysts remain cautious, favoring a more conservative $3 projection amid lingering regulatory and sentiment risks. Yet, the potential approval of a spot XRP ETF could be a game-changer, offering institutional investors a regulated, accessible way to enter the market. XRP’s price remains highly sensitive to regulatory and adoption developments. The SEC’s withdrawal signals growing mainstream acceptance of digital assets, likely attracting hesitant institutional players. A spot ETF would further boost liquidity and lower entry barriers, potentially fueling significant buying pressure and driving a strong price rally. Well, Standard Chartered’s bullish outlook reinforces the case for a major XRP breakout. While market volatility poses risks, regulatory clarity and rising institutional adoption support strong long-term growth potential. Conclusion XRP is at a critical juncture. Regulatory clarity and the potential approval of a spot ETF set the stage for substantial long-term growth. While short-term volatility persists, Standard Chartered’s forecast highlights significant upside potential. The coming months could prove decisive, with strategic accumulation and market developments determining whether XRP reaches its $8 target or takes a more conservative path.

A stark warning from a prominent cryptocurrency analyst suggests the altcoin market faces an unprecedented shakeout. According to seasoned trader Michaël van de Poppe, a majority of alternative cryptocurrencies may not survive through 2026. This prediction challenges the widespread assumption of a universal market recovery and points toward a period of severe consolidation driven by fundamental weaknesses. Altcoin Elimination 2026: The Core Prediction Michaël van de Poppe, a well-known figure in crypto trading circles, recently shared a concerning outlook with BeInCrypto. He explicitly stated that most altcoins will fail to endure the coming years. This forecast stems from observable market conditions that have, in his analysis, been harsher for many projects in the past year than during the notable downturn of 2022. Consequently, the stage appears set for a significant thinning of the crypto ecosystem. Van de Poppe identifies several primary drivers for this potential altcoin elimination. First, failed tokenomics models have plagued numerous projects, creating unsustainable inflation or misaligned incentives. Second, poor financial management by development teams has drained treasuries and halted progress. Finally, excessive price declines have eroded community trust and developer motivation, creating a vicious cycle of decline. The Harsh Reality of Crypto Market Consolidation The concept of market consolidation is not new to finance, but its application to the cryptocurrency sector carries unique weight. Unlike traditional markets, many crypto projects lack mature revenue models or tangible assets. Their value often hinges entirely on network utility and speculative belief. Therefore, a consolidation phase would naturally filter out projects that fail to demonstrate real-world use or economic sustainability. Historical data supports this trend. For instance, after the 2017-2018 boom, thousands of tokens listed on exchanges eventually became inactive or worthless. The current cycle, according to analysts, may see a more pronounced version of this cleansing. Market capitalization has increasingly concentrated around Bitcoin and Ethereum, while liquidity for smaller altcoins has often dried up during bear markets, making recovery exceptionally difficult. Expert Analysis on Survival Criteria Van de Poppe’s analysis provides a clear framework for identifying exceptions to the predicted altcoin elimination. He emphasizes a growing disparity between a project’s fundamental health and its current market price as a key survival signal. Specifically, he highlights four critical on-chain and financial metrics that investors should monitor closely: Rising On-Chain Activity: An increasing number of unique active addresses and transactions indicates genuine user adoption, not just speculation. Expanding Total Value Locked (TVL): For DeFi and staking protocols, a growing TVL shows capital commitment and trust in the network’s security and utility. Growing Trading Volume: Sustained volume, especially on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) native to a project’s ecosystem, suggests persistent liquidity and interest. Increasing Fee Revenue: Projects that generate meaningful and growing fee revenue have a proven economic model, which is crucial for long-term development funding. The crucial insight is that these metrics must demonstrate positive trends despite falling or stagnant token prices. This divergence often signals undervaluation and strong underlying fundamentals that could support a long-term recovery. Case Studies: Projects Defying the Altcoin Elimination Trend Van de Poppe cited three specific projects as examples possessing the attributes needed to potentially survive the predicted consolidation: Arbitrum (ARB), Aave (AAVE), and Near Protocol (NEAR). His analysis points to concrete data rather than mere sentiment. Arbitrum, a leading Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solution, presents a compelling case. Reports indicate its ecosystem has grown by approximately 200% in terms of developer activity and deployed applications over the past year. Remarkably, this expansion occurred while its native token, ARB, traded at or near all-time lows. This stark contrast between ecosystem growth and token price exemplifies the “disparity” van de Poppe describes. Aave, a flagship decentralized lending protocol, has consistently maintained one of the highest Total Value Locked (TVL) figures in DeFi. Its fee revenue model is well-established, and its governance community is highly active. Similarly, Near Protocol has shown resilience through continued technological development and strategic partnerships, fostering steady on-chain activity. The table below summarizes key comparative strengths: Project Primary Strength Key Survival Metric Arbitrum (ARB) Ecosystem Scale & Adoption 200% ecosystem growth amid price lows Aave (AAVE) Revenue & Market Dominance Sustained high TVL and fee generation Near Protocol (NEAR) Technology & Developer Activity Consistent on-chain growth and innovation Broader Market Context and Investor Implications This prediction arrives during a period of heightened regulatory scrutiny and evolving macroeconomic conditions. Governments worldwide are crafting frameworks for digital assets, which will likely increase compliance costs and eliminate projects that cannot adapt. Furthermore, institutional investment is increasingly selective, favoring projects with clear governance and proven utility over speculative narratives. For investors, this analysis underscores the importance of fundamental research. The era of profiting from broad altcoin rallies may be giving way to a phase requiring diligent project selection. Investors are advised to look beyond price charts and deeply analyze treasury reports, governance proposals, GitHub commit history, and on-chain metric dashboards. Diversification across a large basket of unknown altcoins may carry significantly higher risk if the predicted consolidation occurs. The Role of Tokenomics and Community A project’s long-term viability heavily depends on its tokenomic structure. Models with high, continuous inflation to pay validators or vendors without corresponding value creation often lead to sell pressure. Conversely, projects with deflationary mechanisms, clear utility for the token (like fee payment or governance), and sustainable emission schedules are better positioned. A strong, engaged community that participates in governance also contributes significantly to resilience, as it provides a decentralized support system beyond the core development team. Conclusion The prediction of a major altcoin elimination by 2026 presents a sobering outlook for the cryptocurrency market. While challenging, this potential consolidation phase could ultimately strengthen the ecosystem by redirecting capital and attention toward projects with robust fundamentals, sustainable models, and real utility. As Michaël van de Poppe’s analysis indicates, the key to navigating this period lies in identifying projects where fundamental growth diverges positively from price action. For the broader industry, this shakeout may be a necessary step toward maturity and long-term stability. FAQs Q1: What does “altcoin elimination” mean? A1: In this context, “altcoin elimination” refers to the prediction that a large number of alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) will fail, become inactive, or lose nearly all their value by 2026 due to unsustainable models, poor financials, and market pressures. Q2: Which altcoins are most likely to survive according to this analysis? A2: The analysis suggests projects with strong fundamentals despite low prices are most likely to survive. Examples given include those with rising on-chain activity, growing Total Value Locked (TVL), increasing trading volume, and sustainable fee revenue, such as Arbitrum, Aave, and Near Protocol. Q3: What are the main reasons for this predicted consolidation? A3: The primary drivers cited are failed tokenomics (unsustainable economic models), poor financial management by project teams, and excessive price declines that erode community and developer support, creating a cycle that is difficult to break. Q4: How can an investor identify an altcoin with strong fundamentals? A4: Investors should look for verifiable on-chain metrics like growing active addresses and transactions, increasing TVL for DeFi projects, consistent development activity on platforms like GitHub, and a clear, sustainable revenue model for the protocol itself. Q5: Is this prediction a guarantee that most altcoins will fail? A5: No, it is an analysis and prediction based on current market conditions and trends. It serves as a warning and a framework for evaluation, not a certainty. Market dynamics can change based on new technologies, regulations, and macroeconomic factors.

Bittensor (TAO) historic price sentiment TAO price history by Coingecko TAO launched on March 6, 2023, at $93.4, but fell below its opening price within a week, sliding into the $76 range. By early April, it had lost half its value, dropping to $47, and continued downward to its $30.83 low in May before slowly recovering to $63 by the end of the month. The token climbed to $86.18 in July, just under its launch price, then pulled back again and traded near $54 through October. Momentum returned in November, pushing TAO into the $95 range and then sharply to a peak of $379 on December 15, 2023. TAO trended downward into early 2024 but surged to its all-time high of $757.60 in March. It quickly corrected to $522 in April and continued weakening through mid-year, reaching $216 in July. A brief rebound to $357 faded again as the token slipped back toward the mid-$200s by late summer. Momentum returned in October, pushing TAO into the $660 range before cooling to $468. It climbed once more to $679 in November but ultimately closed 2024 at $440.69. TAO opened 2025 at $439.73, peaked at $565 in January, and its price decreased to the $324 level in February. In March, TAO dipped to the $259 mark and descended further to $228 in April; however, in May, it recovered to $467 as the Bittensor market revived. The coin traded between $235.68 and $476.10. TAO opened trading in November at $506, lost 46% of its value, and closed the month at $269.11.

Meta aims to boost automation across consumer and business products, as Manus is expected to continue operating its subscription services. Meta said that Manus already serves the day-to-day needs of millions of businesses and users worldwide, and that it plans to scale these services to more businesses. Manus will essentially continue to operate its subscription service without disruption, although further terms of the acquisition are yet to be disclosed. Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reported that the deal was closed at over $2 billion. However, Manus was seeking to raise funds at a $2 billion valuation when Meta approached it. Mauns emerged earlier this year as a product of the Chinese startup Butterfly Effect (A.K.A Monica.Im), before growing into a separate entity after claiming its chatbot offered better performance than OpenAI’s Deep Research agent. The company claimed that it had generated over $100 million in just eight months after launch, with its run rate exceeding $125 million. Partnership reinforces Manus’s role as the execution layer Manus said it believes in the potential of autonomous agents, and this development reinforces its role as an execution layer. The development also enables advanced AI capabilities to be transformed into scalable, reliable systems that can perform end-to-end tasks in the real world. Additionally, Manus has developed one of the leading autonomous general-purpose agents that can independently execute complex tasks, such as data analysis, coding, and market research. The company stated that it has already served more than 147 trillion tokens and created over 80 million virtual machines, with plans to scale these services to more businesses. “Joining Meta allows us to build on a stronger, more sustainable foundation without changing how Manus works or how decisions are made.” – Xiao Hong , CEO at Manus Meanwhile, Manus said its solution is driving value for millions of global users, with plans to expand subscriptions to the billions of users and millions of businesses on the Meta platform. However, its priority is ensuring that this change will not disrupt customer services through its official app or website. Meta extends specialized AI startup acquisitions Meta’s acquisition of Manus ali g ns with its broader strategy of acquiring specialized AI startups to accelerate its AI business. The acquisition strategy also includes the development of its open-source Llama LLMs (large language models). In June, Meta invested approximately $14.3 billion in AI startup Scale AI. The deal brought the startup’s founder and CEO, Alexandr Wang, onto Meta’s executive team. Meta also said that Manus employees will join its teams as the company continues to aggressively poach AI talent from startups and major rivals, such as Google and OpenAI . The tech firm further acquired AI-wearables startup Limitless earlier this month as it seeks to expand its AI device business. Limitless develops a small, AI-powered pendant that records conversations and generates summaries. The CEO of Limitless, Dan Siroker, said that this acquisition helps bring personal superintelligence to everyone. “We share this vision and we’ll be joining Meta to help bring our shared vision to life.” – Dan Siroker , CEO of Limitless Meta’s Ray-Ban smartglasses have also been a surprise hit, as the world of AI wearables has slowly grown this year. However, no single company has been able to develop a standout product. Several wearables are available that are similar to Limitless products. Meanwhile, Plaud comes in a small pill or card shape that can be clipped on or worn around the wrist or neck. Friend also offers a pendant-style device, while Bee, which is worn as a wristband, was bought by Amazon. The e-commerce giant also runs AI through its Alexa+ Echo Speakers, while Google’s Pixel 10 phones have integrated the Gemini assistant. Get seen where it counts.

56589570,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=256553,1767088811,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Ethereum Whales Defiantly Accumulate 120,000 ETH as Retail Investors Capitulate in Major Market Divergence",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ethereum-whales-accumulate-retail-sells/,"BitcoinWorld Ethereum Whales Defiantly Accumulate 120,000 ETH as Retail Investors Capitulate in Major Market Divergence December 2025 – A significant divergence in Ethereum investment behavior has emerged, with sophisticated institutional players accumulating substantial ETH holdings while smaller retail investors demonstrate persistent selling pressure, according to comprehensive on-chain data analysis from multiple blockchain intelligence platforms. This market split represents one of the most pronounced smart money versus retail investor divides observed in cryptocurrency markets since the 2024 consolidation period, potentially signaling important underlying market dynamics and future price direction indicators. Ethereum Whales Demonstrate Strategic Accumulation Pattern Blockchain analytics reveal a consistent accumulation pattern among Ethereum whale addresses since the second half of 2025. According to data aggregated from Glassnode, Nansen, and Etherscan, addresses holding more than 1,000 ETH have increased their collective holdings by approximately 120,000 ETH since December 26, 2025. This accumulation represents a notable shift in whale behavior following the market consolidation period throughout 2024. The strategic timing of these acquisitions suggests sophisticated investors may be positioning themselves for anticipated market developments. Furthermore, concentration metrics indicate wallets controlling more than 1,000 ETH now command approximately 70% of the total ETH supply. This proportion has steadily increased since late 2024, demonstrating a gradual but persistent consolidation of Ethereum among larger holders. Market analysts typically interpret such concentration increases as potential indicators of institutional confidence or strategic positioning ahead of significant network developments. On-Chain Data Reveals Clear Behavioral Split Multiple blockchain intelligence firms have independently verified the divergent behavior between whale and retail segments. The data shows consistent net outflows from smaller wallets (holding less than 10 ETH) throughout the latter half of 2025, contrasting sharply with the accumulation patterns observed in larger address cohorts. This divergence becomes particularly pronounced when examining exchange flow data, which reveals whales moving assets to cold storage while retail investors demonstrate higher exchange deposit activity. Several technical indicators support this behavioral analysis: Exchange Net Position Change: Major exchanges show net outflows exceeding 150,000 ETH since Q3 2025 Wallet Distribution Metrics: Addresses holding 0.1-10 ETH decreased by 2.3% since September 2025 Transaction Volume Analysis: Large transactions (>$100k) increased 18% while small transactions decreased 12% Hodler Net Position: Long-term holder supply reached new annual highs in December 2025 Retail Investor Behavior Shows Capitulation Characteristics Retail investor segments have demonstrated consistent selling pressure throughout the latter half of 2025, according to exchange data and on-chain metrics. This behavior pattern aligns with historical market cycles where retail investors frequently reduce positions during consolidation periods or following extended sideways price action. The psychological dynamics of retail trading often differ substantially from institutional investment approaches, potentially explaining this behavioral divergence. Market psychology research indicates several factors influencing retail behavior: Factor Impact on Retail Behavior Evidence Period Price Consolidation Increased impatience and position reduction Q3-Q4 2025 Media Sentiment Reduced coverage leading to decreased engagement Throughout 2025 Alternative Opportunities Capital rotation to other asset classes H2 2025 Regulatory Uncertainty Cautious position sizing and risk reduction Ongoing Exchange data from Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken shows consistent retail-sized outflows since August 2025, with particular intensity during periods of low volatility. This pattern suggests retail investors may be responding to opportunity cost considerations or portfolio rebalancing needs rather than fundamental concerns about Ethereum’s long-term prospects. Smart Money Indicators and Historical Precedents The concept of “smart money” following in cryptocurrency markets refers to the investment patterns of sophisticated, well-informed participants whose actions often precede significant market movements. Historical analysis reveals several instances where whale accumulation during retail selling periods preceded substantial price appreciation. The current divergence bears similarities to patterns observed in early 2023 and late 2020, both periods that preceded notable Ethereum rallies. Crypto trader Mister Crypto, who maintains approximately 143,000 followers on platform X, highlighted this divergence in recent analysis. He emphasized that investors should monitor smart money flows, noting that whale behavior often provides more reliable market direction signals than retail sentiment. However, analysts universally caution that past performance never guarantees future results, and multiple factors influence cryptocurrency valuations. Several fundamental developments may be influencing smart money positioning: Ethereum Protocol Upgrades: Continued development of scalability solutions Institutional Adoption: Growing enterprise blockchain implementations DeFi Evolution: Maturation of decentralized finance ecosystems Regulatory Clarity: Progressive framework development in major markets Staking Economics: Sustainable yield opportunities for large holders Market Structure Implications and Liquidity Dynamics The growing concentration of Ethereum among whale addresses carries significant implications for market structure and liquidity dynamics. While increased institutional holding can contribute to price stability during volatile periods, it also raises questions about decentralization and market accessibility. The current 70% control by addresses holding more than 1,000 ETH represents a notable concentration level, though still within historical ranges observed since Ethereum’s inception. Liquidity analysis reveals important market mechanics: Order Book Depth: Increased whale holdings may reduce available liquidity Price Impact: Large transactions could experience reduced slippage Market Efficiency: Information asymmetry between segments may increase Volatility Patterns: Different holding behaviors affect price discovery Market microstructure research suggests that while whale accumulation can temporarily reduce circulating supply and support prices, sustainable market health requires balanced participation across investor segments. The current divergence therefore represents both opportunity signals and potential structural considerations for market observers. Comparative Analysis with Bitcoin Whale Behavior Parallel analysis of Bitcoin markets reveals somewhat different dynamics, with both whale and retail segments demonstrating more varied behavior patterns throughout 2025. Bitcoin whale addresses (holding >1,000 BTC) have shown accumulation since Q2 2025, but with less pronounced divergence from retail segments. This comparative analysis suggests Ethereum’s specific fundamentals and development roadmap may be driving unique investor behavior. Key differences between ETH and BTC whale behavior include: Metric Ethereum Whales Bitcoin Whales Accumulation Rate 120,000 ETH since Dec 26 ~15,000 BTC in same period Concentration Trend Steadily increasing since 2024 Relatively stable since 2024 Exchange Behavior Consistent cold storage movement Mixed exchange/cold storage patterns Transaction Frequency Lower frequency, higher value Higher frequency, varied value These behavioral differences likely reflect varying investment theses between the two dominant cryptocurrencies, with Ethereum’s utility and development roadmap potentially attracting different investor profiles than Bitcoin’s store-of-value characteristics. Conclusion The pronounced divergence between Ethereum whale accumulation and retail investor selling represents one of the most significant market dynamics observed in cryptocurrency markets during 2025. While whale addresses have accumulated approximately 120,000 ETH since December 26, retail segments have demonstrated consistent distribution patterns. This smart money behavior, combined with wallets holding more than 1,000 ETH controlling approximately 70% of total supply, suggests sophisticated investors may be positioning for anticipated network developments and market evolution. However, market participants should consider multiple data points and conduct independent research before making investment decisions, as cryptocurrency markets remain influenced by complex global factors and technological developments. FAQs Q1: What defines an “Ethereum whale” in current market context? An Ethereum whale typically refers to addresses holding more than 1,000 ETH, though definitions vary among analytics platforms. Some analysts use 10,000 ETH as the threshold for “mega whale” classification. The current analysis focuses on addresses exceeding 1,000 ETH based on standardized blockchain metrics. Q2: How reliable is whale behavior as a market indicator? While whale accumulation patterns often correlate with future price movements, they represent just one of many market indicators. Sophisticated investors consider multiple factors including fundamentals, technical analysis, and macroeconomic conditions. Historical patterns show correlation but never guarantee future performance. Q3: What tools do analysts use to track whale movements? Analysts utilize blockchain explorers like Etherscan, specialized analytics platforms including Glassnode and Nansen, exchange transparency reports, and on-chain data aggregation services. These tools provide visibility into address behavior, transaction patterns, and holding changes across different wallet segments. Q4: Does increased whale concentration threaten Ethereum’s decentralization? Increased concentration raises valid questions about network decentralization, though Ethereum’s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and widespread validator distribution provide counterbalancing factors. The network’s fundamental architecture aims to maintain security and decentralization regardless of token distribution patterns. Q5: How does current whale behavior compare to previous market cycles? Current accumulation patterns show similarities to late 2020 and early 2023, both periods preceding significant Ethereum price appreciation. However, each market cycle features unique characteristics, and direct comparisons require careful consideration of differing market structures, regulatory environments, and technological developments.

But he rejected the idea that this automatically implies a blow-off alt cycle: “I don’t think it will be wild enough to call it alt season. I think alts will rebound nevertheless, just not to crazy highs.” Moreover, Qureshi said “the recent crop of fintech chains” will not meet expectations on usage and value flow. “Despite the excitement around the recent crop of fintech chains, their metrics will underwhelm,” he wrote, pointing to “daily active addresses, stablecoin flows, and RWAs.” He named Tempo, Arc, and Robinhood Chain as likely laggards, while adding that “Ethereum and Solana will overdeliver” and that “best developers will continue to build on neutral infra chains.” On enterprise rails, he expects more large companies to launch networks, skewing toward regulated incumbents. “Many more Fortune 100s launch blockchains, although increasingly concentrated among banking and fintech players,” he wrote, adding: “Expect Avalanche to be a standout here, alongside OP stack, Orbit, and ZK Stack.” Qureshi also predicted a major distribution move from consumer tech: “A big tech company (Google, Facebook, Apple, etc.) launches or acquires a crypto wallet in 2026.” And he offered a contrarian timing call on Monad: “Monad gets written off as dead by CT, but metrics take off in the latter part of the year after analysts have already forgotten about it.” On infrastructure, he said DoubleZero adoption broadens: “At least 3 other chains connect to DoubleZero to improve their latency & throughput metrics. DoubleZero hits 80%+ stake on Solana.” DeFi And Stablecoins Qureshi forecass a more concentrated perpetuals market structure. “Perp DEX market share consolidates to something like 3 big venues a la HBO (market share something like 40 / 30 / 20), followed by a long tail of smaller players who compete over the leftovers (last 10%),” he wrote. He also expects product expansion into equities. “Equity perps take off, becoming >20% of total DeFi perp volume by EOY,” he wrote, alongside “significant growth in RFQ compared to CLOBs/AMMs, both on spot and perps.” He added a reputational tail risk: “Some DeFi-related insider trading scandal hits mainstream media.” Qureshi predicts a large expansion in stablecoin supply while remaining overwhelmingly dollar-based. “Stablecoin supply expands by ~60% in 2026, and USD remains 99%+,” he wrote. He expects Tether to cede some share: “USDT dominance declines moderately to ~55%.” His strongest distribution claim centered on payments. “Stablecoin-backed cards grow 1,000% in 2026—insanely fast growth,” Qureshi wrote. “Becomes the dominant way that stablecoins land and expand in emerging markets. Rain is the biggest winner here.” Regulation And Prediction Markets Qureshi predicted a US legislative deal next year, but with caveats on what the industry gets. “Clarity Act gets signed into law in 2026 after some significant markups and horse trading,” he wrote. “A bit of buyer’s remorse from crypto insiders.” He also forecast political scrutiny if Democrats take the House. “Dems win the house, and there is a parade of hearings about anything in crypto that touched TRUMP / WLFI,” Qureshi wrote. “The underlying deals get subpoenaed.” In his scenario, Trump distances himself: “Trump insists he was never involved and didn’t know anything about it (and thus these deals are not protected by executive privilege). Anyone who signed a stupid deal gets publicly embarrassed.” Qureshi expects prediction markets to expand rapidly amid unresolved US legal fights. “Prediction markets grow like crazy,” he wrote, citing “big legal fights over sportsbetting regulation and federal pre-emption,” but adding that “nothing major gets resolved next year, so status quo continues through 2026.” He argued Polymarket extends its cultural edge and distribution. “Meanwhile Polymarket continues to steamroll the culture,” Qureshi wrote. “Prediction markets are perceived as cool and smart, and so are allowed to throw up odds everywhere.” He added that as domestic expansion ramps, “it starts winning more and more domestic market share from Robinhood and sportsbooks.” Most competitors, in his view, will not matter. “The explosion of other platforms tacking on prediction markets mostly flop,” he wrote. “90% of prediction market offerings are totally ignored and then wind down by EOY.” Qureshi said “B2B partnership-driven distribution underperforms, direct-to-consumer outperforms,” with demand concentrated in “Polymarket, Robinhood, and Kalshi frontends (plus traditional sportsbooks).” AI And Privacy Qureshi argued crypto’s practical AI use remains narrow. “Primary AI use cases in crypto remain within software engineering and security. Everything else remains a prototype,” he wrote. “Wallet automation remains minimal.” He added: “AI agents will still not be ‘paying each other’ or spending any meaningful money in 2026.” On spam and identity, he dismissed the near-term feasibility of a Worldcoin -style gate despite theoretical promise. “Worldcoin has verified 17 million identities—that’s 1 in 500 people,” Qureshi wrote. “Being at 1/500 distribution is way too small of an identity base for any service to transition to using Worldcoin as an identity gate.” He suggested an alternative path: “ZK Passports are probably more likely in the short-medium term, because much more of the world’s population as an NFC-enabled passport and can scan it with their phones.” Asked about privacy as a major theme, Qureshi demurred. “I think privacy is going to be a laggard,” he wrote. “ Zcash will likely do well because people want to believe, and there will be some adoption of private transactions on Arc, Tempo, etc.” Still, he returned to his overarching frame: “I predict mostly people will keep doing things in 2026 the way they’ve already been doing them.” At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $2.93 trillion.",Crypto News|bitcoin|crypto|crypto news|Crypto Predictions 2026|Dragonfly|Haseeb Qureshi,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-30 10:00:46

Ripple has consistently reiterated its plan to build the Internet of Value . Xaif responded to this goal with a video of Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin affirming Ripple’s plan for XRP. Xaif Highlights a Clear Distinction In the video Xaif referenced, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin spoke directly about what Ethereum is designed to be. His wording was precise. “People talk about cryptocurrency 2.0 being like the internet of value. We’re not the internet of value, Ripple is the internet of value.” Xaif used this statement to reinforce a core argument. Ethereum focuses on generalized computation. Ripple focuses on value transfer, and XRP sits at the core of that system . The roles differ by design, and XRP was built to be an integral part of global finance. Ripple has repeated its goal for years. The company positions XRP as a bridge asset for moving value across borders in real-time. That goal aligns with the concept of the Internet of Value. Xaif’s post connects those dots and strengthens the argument with Buterin’s comments. Vitalik Buterin knows better than all the maxis about Ripple and what it can do.. he himself admits Ethereum is not Internet of Value, Ripple $XRP is Internet of Value. https://t.co/5sfHPF5AxN pic.twitter.com/0FFBp0HELP — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) December 28, 2025 XRP’s Functional Focus Versus Ethereum’s Architecture Ethereum excels at programmability. Smart contracts, decentralized applications, token standards, and more. However, these do not define an Internet of Value on their own. Vitalik’s statement acknowledges that distinction clearly. XRP was built for settlement. It completes transactions in seconds at fractions of a penny. Financial institutions use it to move value, not to experiment with execution environments. That focus gives XRP a different value proposition. It does not compete on the same axis as Ethereum. It competes on utility tied to payments. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This distinction fuels long-standing predictions that XRP could surpass Ethereum in market relevance. Some analysts extend that view further. They argue that if global value transfer becomes the dominant use case, XRP could flip Ethereum and become the second-largest asset in the crypto market. Why the Debate Persists The idea that XRP could overtake Ethereum is not new. What keeps it alive is utility. Markets reward assets that solve real problems at scale. If value transfer becomes crypto’s primary function, networks designed for that task gain an advantage. Vitalik’s own words define Ethereum’s scope, and Ripple’s mission defines XRP’s purpose. While many critics dismiss XRP’s potential, ETH maxis can draw their conclusions from Buterin’s own words. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This forecast, shared with his substantial following of approximately 164,000 on the social platform X, hinges on concerning metrics emerging from the XRP Ledger’s on-chain data. The analysis points to a sharp contraction in network participation and a notable shift in behavior among large holders, often called ‘whales.’ Consequently, this development raises critical questions about near-term price stability for one of the market’s most recognized cryptocurrencies. XRP Price Prediction Relies on Critical On-Chain Metrics Ali Martinez’s analysis centers on two primary on-chain indicators that signal potential weakness for XRP. First, the data reveals a marked decrease in daily active addresses on the XRP Ledger. This metric, a key gauge of user engagement and network utility, recently fell from approximately 46,000 to 38,500 addresses. Such a decline often suggests waning organic interest or usage, which can precede price softness. Second, and perhaps more impactful for immediate price action, Martinez identified that large wallet entities have transitioned into net sellers. Specifically, these whales have offloaded more than $40 million worth of XRP over just a few days, creating substantial sell-side pressure in the market. These combined factors form the basis for the bearish technical outlook. The analyst’s framework suggests that if the current selling pressure persists, XRP could breach a crucial support level at $1.77. A sustained break below this threshold might then trigger further downside momentum, potentially targeting the $0.80 region. This analysis provides a data-driven perspective on market sentiment shifts that often escape casual observation. The Mechanics of On-Chain Analysis On-chain analysis involves examining blockchain data directly to infer investor behavior and network health. Unlike traditional technical analysis, which studies price charts, this method looks at fundamental network activity. Key metrics include: Active Addresses: The number of unique addresses participating in transactions. A decline can indicate reduced network utility. Whale Transactions: Large transfers from major holders, which can signal accumulation or distribution phases. Exchange Flows: Movements of assets to and from exchanges, hinting at trading intent. Understanding the Broader Cryptocurrency Market Context This warning for XRP arrives during a period of heightened sensitivity across the broader digital asset market. Global macroeconomic factors, including interest rate policies and regulatory developments, continue to influence investor risk appetite. Furthermore, XRP has navigated a unique legal landscape following the conclusion of its high-profile lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. While the resolution provided initial positive momentum, the market now appears to be assessing the token’s fundamentals more closely. Analysts like Martinez argue that on-chain data provides an unfiltered view of these fundamentals, often acting as a leading indicator for price trends. Historically, periods of declining network activity have correlated with price consolidation or decline for many cryptocurrencies. For instance, similar patterns of falling active addresses preceded downturns in other major assets during previous market cycles. Therefore, Martinez’s focus on this metric aligns with established analytical frameworks used by blockchain researchers. The current data presents a cautionary signal that merits attention from market participants. Comparing Network Vitality Across Blockchains To contextualize the XRP Ledger’s activity drop, analysts often compare it to other major networks. The table below illustrates a simplified snapshot of recent relative changes, though specific figures fluctuate daily. Blockchain Network Key Activity Metric Recent Trend (Example) XRP Ledger (XRPL) Daily Active Addresses Decreasing (~16% drop noted) Ethereum Daily Active Addresses Variable, often stable Solana Daily Active Addresses Generally increasing This comparative view helps investors understand whether a trend is isolated or part of a broader market shift. For XRP, the noted contraction appears pronounced against its own recent history. The Impact of Whale Behavior on Market Dynamics The movement of $40 million in XRP by large holders represents a significant market event. Whale wallets, typically holding millions of dollars in assets, possess the capacity to influence liquidity and price discovery. When these entities become net sellers, as Martinez observed, it often floods the market with supply that must be absorbed by new buyers. If demand does not match this increased supply, downward price pressure inevitably follows. This dynamic is a core principle of market economics applied to the crypto asset class. Monitoring whale activity has become a standard practice for crypto analysts. Platforms like Santiment and IntoTheBlock provide tools that track these large transactions in real-time. The recent data from the XRP Ledger shows a clear pattern of distribution, where whales are moving assets to exchanges—a common precursor to selling. This behavioral shift from accumulation to distribution is a critical red flag for technical analysts projecting future price movements. Historical Precedents of Whale-Driven Corrections Market history offers several examples where sustained whale selling precipitated major corrections. In 2021, similar patterns of large Bitcoin transfers to exchanges preceded a multi-month market downturn. While each asset’s context differs, the underlying mechanism remains consistent: large-scale redistribution of assets alters the supply-demand balance. For XRP, the $40 million sell-off, while notable, must be considered relative to its total market capitalization and daily trading volume to assess its full impact potential. Technical Analysis and Key Support Levels for XRP Beyond on-chain data, traditional chart analysis identifies specific price levels that traders watch closely. Ali Martinez highlighted $1.77 as a key support level for XRP. In technical terms, a support level is a price point where buying interest has historically been strong enough to prevent further decline. A breach of such a level, especially on significant volume, can trigger automated sell orders and shift market psychology from bullish to bearish. The subsequent target of $0.80, in this analysis, would likely represent a longer-term support zone based on previous market structure. It is crucial to understand that price predictions are probabilistic, not certain. They represent one possible path based on current data and historical patterns. Market conditions can change rapidly with new developments, such as positive adoption news or shifts in broader financial markets. Therefore, analysts consistently stress that these forecasts should inform risk management strategies rather than serve as definitive guarantees. Risk Management Strategies for Investors In light of such warnings, experienced market participants often review their strategies. Common approaches include: Position Sizing: Ensuring no single asset comprises an outsized portion of a portfolio. Stop-Loss Orders: Setting automated orders to sell at a predetermined price to limit losses. Diversification: Spreading investments across different asset classes and cryptocurrencies. Focus on Fundamentals: Looking beyond short-term price moves to long-term utility and adoption. Conclusion Analyst Ali Martinez’s XRP price prediction of a potential fall to $0.80 underscores the importance of monitoring on-chain fundamentals alongside price charts. The dual signals of declining daily active addresses and substantial whale selling present a coherent, data-backed case for near-term caution. While market predictions are inherently uncertain, this analysis highlights how blockchain transparency provides unique insights into investor sentiment and network health. As the cryptocurrency market evolves, such data-driven perspectives will remain vital for investors navigating its volatility. The key takeaway is the demonstrated value of on-chain metrics in forming a comprehensive market view. FAQs Q1: What is the main reason behind the warning for XRP’s price? The warning primarily cites two on-chain data points: a significant drop in daily active addresses on the XRP Ledger and the selling of over $40 million in XRP by large holders (whales) in recent days. Q2: Who is Ali Martinez? Ali Martinez is a cryptocurrency analyst with a substantial following on social media platform X (approximately 164,000 followers). He is known for his technical and on-chain analysis of various digital assets. Q3: What does ‘daily active addresses’ mean, and why is it important? Daily active addresses refer to the number of unique blockchain addresses participating in transactions each day. It’s a key metric for gauging genuine network usage and user engagement. A decline can suggest waning interest or utility. Q4: What is the key support level mentioned for XRP? The analyst identified $1.77 as a critical support level. A sustained break below this price could, according to the analysis, open the path for a further decline toward $0.80. Q5: Should investors sell their XRP based on this prediction? This article presents a factual report of an analyst’s prediction. Investment decisions should be based on individual research, risk tolerance, and financial goals. Predictions are not guarantees, and markets are influenced by numerous unpredictable factors.

This staggering figure, equivalent to 268 trillion won, represents a watershed moment for digital asset adoption worldwide. The comprehensive analysis reveals that 368 institutions now maintain substantial cryptocurrency positions, with corporations accounting for a dominant 73% share of these holdings. This development signals a fundamental shift in how traditional finance views and utilizes blockchain-based assets. Institutional Crypto Holdings Reach Unprecedented Levels The $185 billion milestone represents more than just a numerical achievement. It demonstrates institutional confidence in cryptocurrency markets during a period of significant regulatory evolution. Santora’s data, compiled through sophisticated blockchain analysis techniques, provides unprecedented transparency into institutional positioning. The research firm, which rebranded from IntoTheBlock earlier this year, specializes in on-chain analytics and institutional market intelligence. Their methodology combines blockchain data analysis with traditional financial research techniques, creating a comprehensive picture of institutional cryptocurrency exposure. Furthermore, the distribution of these holdings reveals important patterns about institutional adoption. The concentration among 368 institutions suggests that while participation remains somewhat exclusive, it has expanded significantly from just a few years ago. This growth trajectory indicates increasing institutional comfort with cryptocurrency risk management and custody solutions. Major financial centers worldwide now regularly report cryptocurrency exposure in their quarterly filings, creating greater transparency for investors and regulators alike. Corporate Dominance in Cryptocurrency Investment Corporations control approximately $135 billion of the total institutional cryptocurrency holdings, representing their growing strategic interest in digital assets. This corporate participation takes multiple forms, including treasury reserve assets, payment system infrastructure, and strategic investments in blockchain technology. Technology companies lead this corporate adoption, followed by financial services firms and increasingly, traditional manufacturing and retail corporations diversifying their asset portfolios. The corporate cryptocurrency strategy typically follows three main approaches: Treasury Diversification: Companies allocate portions of cash reserves to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as inflation hedges Operational Integration: Businesses incorporate cryptocurrency payments and blockchain solutions into their existing operations Strategic Investment: Corporations invest in cryptocurrency as part of broader technology and innovation portfolios This corporate movement began gaining significant momentum in 2020 when several publicly traded companies announced Bitcoin treasury allocations. Since that time, the practice has evolved from experimental to increasingly mainstream among corporate treasury management strategies. The scale of corporate participation now dwarfs early adopter activity, creating more stable market conditions through reduced volatility and increased liquidity. Regional Distribution and Regulatory Impact Geographic analysis reveals distinct patterns in institutional cryptocurrency adoption. North American institutions maintain the largest aggregate holdings, followed closely by Asian and European entities. However, growth rates vary significantly by region, with emerging markets showing particularly rapid institutional adoption in some cases. Regulatory clarity, or the lack thereof, plays a crucial role in determining institutional participation levels across different jurisdictions. The following table illustrates the regional distribution of institutional cryptocurrency holdings: Region Percentage of Total Holdings Number of Institutions North America 42% 154 Europe 28% 103 Asia-Pacific 22% 81 Other Regions 8% 30 Regulatory developments continue to shape institutional participation patterns significantly. Jurisdictions with clear cryptocurrency regulations typically see higher institutional adoption rates. Conversely, regions with regulatory uncertainty or restrictive policies experience slower institutional growth despite sometimes strong retail cryptocurrency markets. This regulatory landscape continues to evolve as financial authorities worldwide develop more comprehensive frameworks for digital asset oversight. Asset Allocation and Portfolio Strategies Institutional cryptocurrency portfolios demonstrate sophisticated asset allocation strategies that differ markedly from retail investor approaches. Bitcoin continues to dominate institutional holdings, representing approximately 65% of total institutional cryptocurrency exposure according to Santora’s analysis. Ethereum follows as the second most popular institutional cryptocurrency, with growing interest in select alternative cryptocurrencies and tokenized assets. Institutional portfolio construction typically emphasizes several key principles: Risk Management: Institutions employ sophisticated hedging strategies and position sizing Custody Solutions: Professional custody arrangements secure digital assets Compliance Frameworks: Robust compliance programs address regulatory requirements Portfolio Integration: Cryptocurrency positions integrate with traditional asset allocations This institutional approach contrasts with earlier cryptocurrency investment patterns that often emphasized maximum exposure to a single asset. Modern institutional strategies typically view cryptocurrency as one component within diversified portfolios, allocating between 1% and 5% of total assets under management to digital assets in most cases. This measured approach reflects institutional risk management protocols while still providing meaningful exposure to cryptocurrency market growth. Market Impact and Liquidity Considerations The substantial institutional presence in cryptocurrency markets has fundamentally altered market dynamics and liquidity profiles. Institutional trading volumes now represent significant portions of daily cryptocurrency market activity, particularly during traditional market hours. This institutional participation has contributed to reduced volatility in major cryptocurrency markets while simultaneously increasing overall market depth and liquidity. Market structure evolution has accompanied institutional growth. Traditional financial infrastructure providers now offer cryptocurrency trading, custody, and settlement services to institutional clients. This infrastructure development has lowered barriers to entry for additional institutions considering cryptocurrency exposure. Furthermore, regulatory developments have created clearer pathways for institutional participation, though regulatory frameworks continue to evolve across different jurisdictions. Liquidity improvements benefit all market participants through tighter bid-ask spreads and reduced price impact for larger transactions. These improvements have made cryptocurrency markets more accessible to additional institutional participants, creating a virtuous cycle of increasing participation and improving market structure. The $185 billion institutional milestone reflects both current participation levels and the improved market conditions that enable such substantial institutional positioning. Future Trajectory and Industry Implications The current institutional cryptocurrency holdings represent a foundation for future growth rather than a ceiling. Several factors suggest continued institutional expansion in cryptocurrency markets. Traditional financial institutions increasingly offer cryptocurrency products and services to their clients, expanding access to digital assets. Regulatory clarity continues to improve in major financial jurisdictions, reducing uncertainty for institutional participants. Additionally, cryptocurrency market infrastructure has matured significantly, addressing earlier concerns about custody, security, and operational reliability. Industry analysts project several key developments in institutional cryptocurrency adoption: Increased tokenization of traditional assets on blockchain networks Broader integration of cryptocurrency in institutional portfolio strategies Expansion of cryptocurrency derivatives and structured products Greater regulatory standardization across major financial markets These developments will likely support continued institutional growth in cryptocurrency markets. However, challenges remain, including regulatory fragmentation, technological complexity, and market volatility. Institutions continue to navigate these challenges while increasing their cryptocurrency exposure in measured, risk-managed ways. The $185 billion milestone therefore represents both current achievement and future potential for institutional cryptocurrency adoption. Conclusion Global institutional crypto holdings surpassing $185 billion marks a definitive turning point in digital asset adoption. This substantial milestone, dominated by corporate investments representing 73% of total holdings, demonstrates growing institutional confidence in cryptocurrency markets. The participation of 368 institutions worldwide reflects both geographic diversity and increasing mainstream acceptance of digital assets within traditional finance. As regulatory frameworks mature and market infrastructure improves, institutional cryptocurrency adoption will likely continue its growth trajectory. This institutional participation fundamentally strengthens cryptocurrency markets through increased liquidity, reduced volatility, and enhanced legitimacy within the global financial system. FAQs Q1: What methodology did Santora use to calculate institutional cryptocurrency holdings? Santora employed sophisticated on-chain analytics combined with traditional financial research methods. Their analysis tracks cryptocurrency movements to known institutional wallets, cross-references public disclosures, and utilizes proprietary algorithms to identify institutional holdings while maintaining data privacy and security standards. Q2: Which types of institutions hold the most cryptocurrency? Publicly traded corporations maintain the largest cryptocurrency holdings, followed by private investment funds, hedge funds, and traditional financial institutions. Technology companies and financial services firms currently lead institutional adoption, though participation continues to diversify across industry sectors. Q3: How does institutional cryptocurrency investment differ from retail investment? Institutional investment typically involves larger positions, sophisticated risk management strategies, professional custody solutions, and compliance frameworks. Institutions generally allocate smaller portfolio percentages to cryptocurrency than retail investors and employ more diversified approaches across multiple digital assets. Q4: What impact does institutional investment have on cryptocurrency markets? Institutional participation increases market liquidity, reduces volatility, and improves market structure through tighter spreads and better price discovery. This institutional presence also enhances market legitimacy and encourages further infrastructure development within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Q5: Are institutional cryptocurrency holdings concentrated in specific geographic regions? North American institutions hold the largest share at 42%, followed by Europe at 28% and Asia-Pacific at 22%. Regional distribution reflects varying regulatory environments, with clearer regulatory frameworks typically correlating with higher institutional participation levels.

The critical question remains: will BCH achieve the significant $1000 milestone? This comprehensive analysis examines market fundamentals, technological developments, and adoption metrics that will shape Bitcoin Cash’s trajectory over the next five years. Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction: Market Context and Historical Performance Bitcoin Cash emerged from the 2017 Bitcoin hard fork, creating a cryptocurrency specifically designed for everyday transactions. The network prioritizes faster transaction speeds and lower fees compared to its predecessor. Market analysts consistently track Bitcoin Cash price predictions because the cryptocurrency serves as a barometer for peer-to-peer electronic cash adoption. Historical data shows BCH reached its all-time high of $4,355.62 in December 2017, demonstrating significant volatility and market potential. However, the cryptocurrency market experienced substantial corrections throughout 2022 and 2023, creating new baseline levels for analysis. Current Bitcoin Cash price predictions must consider this historical context while evaluating future growth drivers. Technical Analysis and Market Indicators for 2026-2030 Technical analysts examine multiple indicators when formulating Bitcoin Cash price predictions. The 200-day moving average provides crucial long-term trend information, while trading volume patterns reveal institutional and retail interest levels. Market capitalization relative to Bitcoin offers insights into BCH’s competitive positioning within the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Furthermore, on-chain metrics including active addresses, transaction counts, and network hash rate contribute significantly to accurate Bitcoin Cash price predictions. These technical factors combine with macroeconomic conditions to create comprehensive forecasting models.

This analysis provides a detailed, evidence-based Bitcoin SV price prediction for 2026 through 2030, examining the critical factors that could influence its journey toward the $100 threshold. Market data from Q1 2025 indicates a renewed focus on blockchain scalability, a core tenet of the BSV project. Bitcoin SV Price Prediction: Foundational Market Context Bitcoin SV, created from a hard fork of Bitcoin Cash in November 2018, aims to restore the original Satoshi Nakamoto protocol. Furthermore, its primary vision emphasizes massive on-chain scaling for enterprise use. The network has consistently focused on maintaining stability and increasing block capacity. Consequently, its market performance remains intrinsically linked to adoption metrics within its specific niche. Historical price action shows BSV experiencing significant volatility, mirroring broader crypto market cycles while also reacting to project-specific developments and regulatory news. Technical and Fundamental Analysis for 2026 A 2026 price prediction requires examining both on-chain data and macroeconomic trends. Key technical indicators, such as network hash rate and transaction volume, provide insight into underlying health. For instance, a sustained increase in daily transactions could signal growing utility. From a fundamental perspective, the expansion of the BSV ecosystem through developer initiatives and enterprise partnerships will be crucial. Market analysts from firms like CoinMetrics often correlate such adoption with long-term value accrual. Regulatory clarity, expected to evolve by 2026, will also serve as a major price determinant for all proof-of-work assets. Expert Perspectives on Scaling and Adoption Industry experts frequently highlight the importance of real-world utility. Dr. Craig Wright, a prominent figure associated with Bitcoin SV, has consistently advocated for its use as a global data ledger. Independent analysts, however, stress that price movement depends on measurable adoption, not just technological vision. Reports from entities like the Bitcoin Association track enterprise progress, providing verifiable data points for investors. The competitive landscape, including other scalable blockchains, will inevitably influence BSV’s market position by 2026. Evaluating the 2027-2030 Long-Term Trajectory The path from 2027 to 2030 introduces more variables. Projections must account for technological maturation, global economic conditions, and the potential integration of blockchain into traditional finance. A model based on gradual adoption suggests a compounding effect on network value. Conversely, scenarios involving prolonged bear markets or technological disruption present downside risks. The table below outlines a spectrum of potential price ranges based on different adoption scenarios, synthesized from multiple analytical models. Year Conservative Scenario Moderate Adoption Scenario High Adoption Scenario 2026 $45 – $60 $60 – $85 $85 – $110 2027 $50 – $70 $70 – $100 $100 – $140 2030 $65 – $90 $90 – $150 $150 – $250+ These ranges are not financial advice but illustrate how variable outcomes depend on key drivers. Critical factors for the upper bounds include: Enterprise Integration: Widespread use for supply chain or data storage. Regulatory Tailwinds: Clear, supportive frameworks for scalable blockchains. Network Effects: Significant growth in developers and daily active addresses. Will the BSV Price Hit $100? A Data-Driven Assessment The $100 price level represents a significant psychological and financial milestone. Reaching it requires a substantial increase in market capitalization from current levels. Analysis of past bull cycles shows that assets with strong narratives can achieve rapid appreciation. However, achieving sustainable value at that level necessitates fundamental growth. The primary pathway involves demonstrating undeniable utility that attracts consistent capital inflow. Metrics to watch include the total value of assets tokenized on BSV and its cost efficiency compared to traditional data solutions. Market sentiment, measured through social volume and exchange inflow/outflow data, will provide early signals of momentum building toward such a target. The Impact of Macroeconomic and Crypto Market Cycles Bitcoin SV does not operate in a vacuum. Its price is highly correlated with Bitcoin’s dominance and the overall crypto market cycle. Historical data reveals that altcoins, including BSV, often amplify Bitcoin’s movements. Therefore, any prediction for 2027-2030 must factor in projected halving cycles of Bitcoin and global liquidity conditions. Institutional adoption of digital assets as a whole could create a rising tide that lifts all major protocols. Conversely, macroeconomic contractions or stringent regulations could suppress growth across the sector for extended periods. Conclusion This Bitcoin SV price prediction for 2026-2030 highlights a future defined by both opportunity and uncertainty. The potential for BSV to reach $100 exists, particularly under a moderate to high adoption scenario in the latter part of the decade. Ultimately, its price will be a function of verifiable network growth, broader cryptocurrency adoption, and its ability to carve a unique, valuable niche in the blockchain ecosystem. Investors should prioritize rigorous fundamental analysis and a clear understanding of the project’s long-term roadmap over short-term speculation. FAQs Q1: What is the main factor that could help Bitcoin SV reach $100? The primary factor would be substantial, measurable adoption of its blockchain for enterprise data and microtransaction solutions, translating to increased network usage and demand for BSV tokens. Q2: How does Bitcoin SV’s technology differ from Bitcoin’s? Bitcoin SV focuses on massively scaling block size to facilitate high volumes of low-cost transactions and data storage, aiming to stay true to a specific interpretation of Bitcoin’s original design for peer-to-peer electronic cash. Q3: Are the price predictions for 2030 reliable? No long-term cryptocurrency price prediction is reliable in the absolute sense. The 2030 forecasts are speculative models based on current trends, projected adoption, and known variables; they carry significant risk and uncertainty. Q4: What are the biggest risks to this Bitcoin SV price prediction? Major risks include prolonged industry-wide bear markets, failure to achieve technological adoption versus competitors, adverse regulatory developments targeting proof-of-work coins, and broader macroeconomic instability. Q5: Where can I find verifiable data on Bitcoin SV’s network growth? On-chain data can be tracked through blockchain explorers like WhatsOnChain, while ecosystem development and enterprise updates are often published by the Bitcoin Association, providing sources for fundamental analysis.

This indecision has led to heightened debate among XRP market proponents about the best crypto to buy for now. While XRP technical indicators are mixed and the momentum trend starts to fade, a rising tide of investors has begun to turn their attention to a new cryptocurrency costing less than $0.05 in order to seek out the best crypto to buy today. XRP Price Performance Indicates Strategic Exhaustion This recent market movement for XRP demonstrates the reasons why many investors are reconsidering their strategies. XRP had attempted to climb but could not maintain its momentum past $1.93 after being close to $1.95, which led to more selling pressure. Experts have been ambivalent about the future market. There has been an argument that the selling pressure has been lessening, but there has been an examination that XRP has been below its important average statistics. This has led investors to look for other cryptos that have greater statistics for growth instead of focusing on large, but slowly-moving, markets like XRP. Mutuum Finance Shines as the Under $0.05 Rotation Play As momentum in XRP has slowed down, attention is now focused on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is a defi crypto that is quickly gaining momentum within its presale. Currently, they are in Phase 7, which is selling out rapidly. This is actually the last phase to buy at $0.04 as phase 8 begins at a scale of nearly 20% to $0.045. The price has already appreciated by an impressive 300% from the Phase 1 price of $0.01, highlighting the reason why most analysts consider this to be the best cheap crypto to invest in now. Since the commencement of the presale, a total of $19,500,000 has been raised, with the total number of Mutuum Finance holders now standing at 18570. The FOMO factor is escalating as Phase 7 is filled quickly. Those investors choosing to stay on the sidelines may end up missing this relatively rare opportunity before the next pricing phase. As the launch price for MUTM is established at $0.06, current investors are placing their bet on an expected 420% increase after launch, establishing it as an often-go-to solution on the question of the best cryptocurrency to invest in. When Phase 8 launches, the opportunity to invest at this point is cut and dried. Aside from the price momentum, Mutuum Finance is also strengthening its legitimacy with real progress on its front. An independent audit is already being conducted, wherein Halborn Security is examining the lending and borrowing contracts of Mutuum Finance. The code is also finalized and is being analyzed, which is a move that excites many investment-minded individuals looking for which cryptocurrency to buy for long term. Community engagement is another unique factor propelling MUTM to become one of the best cryptos to purchase. The project team just launched a dashboard that displays a leaderboard of the top 50 holders of the crypto in a 24-hour cycle. Every day, the first person on the list gets a $500 MUTM reward by making a trade of any kind, and their list resets every day at 00:00 UTC. Why Long-Term Capital is Moving It’s easy to understand why the debate on which cryptocurrency to buy for long term has gained momentum, given the divergent degrees of popularity that XRP has been witnessing, both in its phase of consolidation, particularly if the growth of MUTM Presale is taken into consideration.

The currency traded at about 1.4 million rials to the US dollar, and the rial has lost over 40% of its purchasing power since the two-week war in June. The central bank governor, Mohammad Reza Farzin, resigned amid the unrest, heightening public worry. Crowds Close Shops As Tensions Rose Shop owners around the Grand Bazaar and the Jomhouri shopping areas shut their doors and urged others to join them. Video on social media showed people chanting “Don’t be afraid, we are together,” while security forces used tear gas to push back groups in several districts. Reports have disclosed that many locals blame poor central bank policy for the rapid fall in value and the sudden squeeze on household finances.

Alex Gladstein of the Human Rights Foundation pointed out that the rial’s official rate was about 70 per dollar in the early 1980s, underlining how deep the fall has been. Still, legal limits and unclear rules on self-custody make it hard for many Iranians to move into crypto safely. Mining remains tightly controlled, and exchanges face cyber risk and regulatory pressure. Bitcoin remains a focus for some Iranians looking to preserve wealth amid the collapsing rial and uncertain banking system. While access is limited by strict regulations and unclear rules around self-custody, experts like Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley suggest it can serve as a store of value when local currency fails.

The unexpected reduction has caught the attention of investors, prompting questions about the future trajectory of the cryptocurrency. This article explores the potential implications of this move and which coins might be poised for a positive shift. Uniswap (UNI) Struggles but Shows Promise for Uptick Source: tradingview Uniswap (UNI) is currently priced between around $5.69 and $6.66, hinting at a possible bounce. The coin's price has seen a slight dip of about 1% over the past week and nearly 2% in the last month. With a key resistance point just over $7, UNI could rise around 20% if it breaks through. Support levels around $5.15 could prevent further drops. An RSI of nearly 42 suggests it's not in the oversold zone, offering room for growth. While recent months have shown a decline, patience might pay off as minor improvements in momentum indicators hint at potential gains if the broader market strengthens. Conclusion The burn of 100 million tokens marks a significant event for UNI. This reduction in total supply can lead to potential scarcity. It might influence the token's value positively if demand remains steady or increases. The move indicates that UNI is likely entering a new phase. Future impacts on price and market behavior will depend on how this scarcity interacts with investor sentiment and market demand. Key factors to watch include transaction volumes and further developments from Uniswap. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

According to multiple analysts cited by CoinDesk, this divergence sets the stage for a significant convergence, with Bitcoin poised to follow gold’s upward trajectory in 2026. This prediction hinges on observable historical patterns and fundamental shifts in global monetary policy. Bitcoin’s Projected Path Following Gold’s Rally Market data reveals a compelling narrative for 2026. Precious metals, particularly gold and silver, have experienced substantial gains this year. Specifically, gold has surged approximately 70% year-to-date, while silver has jumped about 150%. Conversely, Bitcoin’s performance has lagged behind these traditional assets. This performance gap, however, is not viewed as a weakness but rather as a potential precursor to a major catch-up rally. Analysts point to gold’s technical strength as a leading indicator. Gold’s price has remained firmly above its 200-day simple moving average (SMA) for an impressive 750 consecutive trading days. This marks the metal’s second-longest bull run in recorded history. The sustained momentum suggests deep-seated investor confidence in tangible assets as a hedge against fiat currency depreciation and geopolitical uncertainty. Decoding the Historical Lag Pattern The core analytical framework supporting the 2026 prediction involves a documented temporal relationship. Historical price action analysis indicates that gold’s major movements have consistently preceded similar movements in Bitcoin by an average of about 26 weeks, or roughly six months. This lagging correlation has been observed across multiple market cycles since Bitcoin’s maturation as a macro asset. For instance, the sideways consolidation phase gold experienced in the summer of 2024 is now seen as a direct analog to Bitcoin’s current trading pattern in late 2025. If this historical pattern holds, the explosive breakout that followed for gold could be replicated for Bitcoin in the coming year. This analysis is not mere speculation but is grounded in comparative chart study and macroeconomic flow theory. Expert Analysis on Store-of-Value Dynamics Financial experts emphasize the underlying driver for both assets: their perceived role as a reliable store of value. Investors have increasingly favored gold in response to expansive fiscal policies, rising national debt levels, and concerns over currency debasement. This flight to safety has fueled gold’s record-breaking rally. The same macroeconomic forces that bolster gold—inflation expectations, low real interest rates, and demand for non-sovereign assets—are also fundamentally bullish for Bitcoin over the long term. The key difference lies in market maturity and investor base. Gold benefits from a vast, established institutional framework, while Bitcoin is still integrating into traditional portfolios. The lag represents the time it takes for capital to rotate from one inflation hedge to another, especially as regulatory clarity for digital assets improves and institutional adoption accelerates. Comparative Performance and Market Context A clear comparison illustrates the current market stance: Gold (XAU): +70% YTD, sustained bull run >750 days above 200-day SMA. Silver (XAG): +150% YTD, often exhibiting higher volatility than gold. Bitcoin (BTC): Performance lagging precious metals, consolidating in a key range. This context is crucial. The significant outperformance of precious metals has not diminished Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition. Instead, it has highlighted a potential valuation gap. Analysts argue that as global liquidity conditions evolve and risk sentiment shifts, capital seeking the highest asymmetric returns may flow from matured gold positions into Bitcoin, catalyzing its predicted rally. The Role of Macroeconomic Indicators Several forward-looking indicators support the convergence thesis. Central bank balance sheets, real yield curves, and dollar index (DXY) movements all play a role. Historically, periods of dollar weakness and expansive liquidity have benefited both hard assets and cryptocurrencies. Current projections for 2026 suggest a macroeconomic environment conducive to this dual strength, potentially allowing Bitcoin to close its performance gap with gold. Conclusion In summary, a consensus among analysts points toward Bitcoin mirroring gold’s historic rally in 2026, based on a reliable lagging correlation and shared store-of-value characteristics. While gold’s current bull run demonstrates robust demand for inflation-resistant assets, the historical precedent suggests Bitcoin is next in line for significant appreciation. This predicted movement for Bitcoin is not isolated but is viewed as part of a broader rotation within the alternative asset universe, driven by enduring macroeconomic trends. Investors and market observers will closely monitor the 26-week lag window for confirmation of this anticipated pattern. FAQs Q1: Why do analysts think Bitcoin will follow gold’s rally? Analysts base this prediction on a historical pattern where Bitcoin’s price movements have lagged behind gold’s by approximately 26 weeks. Gold’s current strong bull run and technical setup are seen as leading indicators for Bitcoin’s future price action. Q2: How long has gold been in its current bull run? Gold’s price has remained above its 200-day simple moving average for 750 consecutive trading days, marking its second-longest bull run on record, which demonstrates sustained institutional and retail demand. Q3: What is the main reason both gold and Bitcoin are rising? Both assets are primarily viewed as hedges against fiat currency depreciation and inflation. Investors turn to them as stores of value when confidence in traditional monetary systems wanes or during periods of economic uncertainty. Q4: Does Bitcoin always follow gold’s price movements? Not always perfectly, but a significant correlative lag has been observed over multiple market cycles. The relationship strengthens during periods of macro-driven market stress when both are treated as alternative, non-sovereign assets. Q5: What could disrupt the prediction that Bitcoin will follow gold in 2026? Unforeseen regulatory crackdowns on cryptocurrencies, a sudden shift to dramatically higher real interest rates, a major black swan event specific to crypto markets, or a breakdown in the historical correlation pattern could all potentially disrupt this prediction.

Blockchain investigator ZachXBT exposed the Canadian threat actor, known as Haby or Havard, using on-chain analysis and social media evidence. The scammer made calls to Coinbase users with phone numbers claiming to be from customer support, and then directed the victims to transfer funds to wallets controlled by the attackers. ZachXBT traces theft via blockchain analysis. Investigations began when Haby, on December 30, 2024, posted a screenshot showing a 21,000 XRP theft worth $44,000 from a Coinbase user. ZachXBT matched the wallet address to two additional Coinbase user thefts amounting to approximately $500,000. Analysis showed Haby had swapped stolen XRP to Bitcoin through instant exchanges. 9/ Additional screenshots taken from his IG show off more social engineering thefts. One story post leaked ""From ""Harvi's MacBook Air"" A person from their chat even advised him to stop flexing so often. pic.twitter.com/YJQlbxTfyK — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) December 29, 2025 Through timing analysis, ZachXBT tracked down Haby’s Bitcoin address. In February 2025, Haby had shared screenshots in a group chat showing a wallet containing $237,000. The Bitcoin balance for the identified address matched the screenshots from February 1, 2025. Tracing backward from this address uncovered three additional Coinbase support impersonation thefts totaling over $560,000. The investigator linked the wallets to Haby through leaked information in social media posts and screen recordings. A leaked video showed Haby conducting a social engineering call with a target. The screen recording exposed the email address and his Telegram account. Additional Instagram screenshots displayed posts bragging about social engineering thefts. One story post revealed “From Harvi’s MacBook Air” in the device information. Scammer operated with poor operational security Haby regularly posted stories and selfies on social media platforms displaying his lifestyle funded by stolen cryptocurrency. The posts showed purchases of expensive Telegram usernames, luxury items, bottle service, and gambling expenses. A member of his chat group advised him to stop posting about his activities so frequently. The scammer appeared to have little concern for operational security. Social media analysis revealed his location in Abbotsford, near Vancouver, British Columbia. OSINT performed on his story posts confirmed the location. Haby frequently bought expensive Telegram usernames and deleted his most recent account two days before the investigation was published. Previous accounts showed his alias in various chats, confirming the authenticity of leaked screenshots. Coinbase support impersonation scams escalated in 2025 The 2025 period was a rather challenging time for Coinbase users. Attackers moved from traditional phishing to precision targeting using data stolen from Coinbase support systems. A May 2025 insider data breach carried out highly effective impersonation scams throughout the year. It involved bribery by cybercriminals who hired overseas customer support agents, mainly in Hyderabad, India, to steal internal data. Compromised information includes names, emails, phone numbers, home addresses, government ID images, and real-time account balances. The attackers did not access the private keys and passwords directly. Overall, about 1% of Coinbase users were targeted, amounting to approximately 70,000 high-value clients. Attackers demanded a $20 million ransom in exchange for deleting the stolen data. Coinbase declined the ransom demand, set up a $20 million bounty on the attackers, and refunded affected victims. Multiple arrests happened in December 2025 Law enforcement activity peaked in December 2025 with several arrests related to Coinbase impersonation scams. Ronald Spektor of Brooklyn, New York, was charged with stealing $16 million from approximately 100 users. His methodology involved using stolen customer data to pose as Coinbase “Elite Support” and alerting users to pending unauthorized transactions. He guided victims to move funds to a “secure vault” that was actually a wallet he controlled. Indian police arrested a former Coinbase support agent on December 29, 2025, connected to the May data theft. The arrest confirmed the bribed insider theory and was the first major law enforcement action against the source of the data leak. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Instead of exiting positions, borrowers use Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies as collateral to access cash or stablecoins. This article explains how crypto-backed loans work today, the main product structures you’ll encounter, the top providers in 2026, and the real risks and costs borrowers need to understand before using them. What Is a Crypto-Backed Loan? A crypto-backed loan allows you to borrow money by pledging cryptocurrency as collateral. The basic structure is simple: You deposit crypto (for example, BTC or ETH) The platform assigns a borrowing limit based on a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio You receive fiat (EUR, USD) or stablecoins (USDT, USDC) You repay the loan to unlock your crypto These loans are overcollateralized, meaning you always deposit more value in crypto than you receive in cash. This protects lenders against crypto price volatility. The Two Main Loan Models in 2026 1. Fixed-Term Crypto Loans This is the more traditional structure. You borrow a fixed amount upfront Interest accrues on the full loan immediately Repayment terms are predefined Early repayment may not reduce total cost Best for: Users who know exactly how much they need and plan to repay within a defined period. Drawback: Less flexibility and often higher effective cost if funds are not fully used. 2. Crypto Credit Lines (Most Common in 2026) Crypto credit lines have become the dominant model. You receive a borrowing limit, not a lump sum You draw funds only when needed Interest applies only to the amount used No mandatory monthly payments Repay anytime to reduce interest and risk Top Crypto-Backed Loan Providers in 2026 Clapp — Regulated Credit Lines for Europe Clapp is a licensed crypto lender offering revolving credit lines backed by major cryptocurrencies. It operates under a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license in the Czech Republic, placing it within the EU regulatory framework. Why it stands out Credit-line model with no fixed repayments Interest only on borrowed funds Conservative LTV design Euro withdrawals and SEPA support Clear compliance and disclosure standards Best for: European users who want regulated access to liquidity without selling crypto. Nexo — Large Centralized Lending Platform Nexo offers crypto-backed credit lines with broad asset support and fast access to funds. Strengths Instant borrowing after collateral deposit Wide range of supported assets Integrated monitoring of LTV and risk Considerations Fully custodial Interest accrues as long as funds are borrowed Best for: Users seeking a familiar, all-in-one centralized platform. YouHodler — Higher Borrowing Power YouHodler focuses on offering higher LTVs than conservative lenders. Strengths Larger borrowing capacity Quick loan issuance Trade-offs Tighter liquidation margins Requires active collateral monitoring Best for: Experienced borrowers comfortable with higher risk. CoinRabbit — Simple Fixed-Term Loans CoinRabbit offers straightforward crypto loans without complex configurations. Strengths Easy setup No credit checks Fast access to funds Limitations Fixed-term structure Less flexibility than credit lines Best for: Users who want simplicity over customization. Alchemix — DeFi Self-Repaying Loans Alchemix uses deposited assets to generate yield that repays the loan over time. Strengths Non-custodial No forced repayments Transparent on-chain mechanics Limitations Crypto-only borrowing Requires DeFi knowledge Repayment speed depends on yield Best for: Advanced users who prefer self-custody. Understanding Loan-to-Value (LTV) LTV is the most important risk variable. 30% LTV: Conservative, high safety buffer 50% LTV: Balanced risk 70%+ LTV: High risk, small margin for price drops If collateral value falls and your LTV crosses a threshold: You may receive a margin alert You may need to add collateral or repay part of the loan If ignored, liquidation occurs Regulated and compliance-focused lenders typically favor lower LTVs. Risks to Consider Crypto-backed loans are not risk-free. Key risks include: Market volatility: Sudden price drops can trigger liquidation Custodial risk: Centralized platforms hold your collateral Overborrowing: Easy access can lead to excessive leverage Protocol risk (DeFi): Smart contracts can fail Regulation improves transparency, not outcomes. Final Thoughts By 2026, crypto-backed loans have become more structured, more regulated, and more flexible than early versions. Credit lines now dominate, offering borrowers control without rigid repayment schedules. The safest platforms focus on clarity, conservative limits, and predictable liquidation rules, not aggressive leverage. Whether you choose a regulated European lender like Clapp, a large centralized platform, or a DeFi protocol, the principle is the same: crypto-backed borrowing is a risk-management tool, not free money. Used carefully, it can unlock liquidity while preserving long-term exposure. Used recklessly, it magnifies losses just as efficiently as gains.

According to on-chain data analyzed by checkonchain and reported by CoinDesk, Bitcoin long-term holders (LTHs) have transitioned into net accumulators for the first time since July. This pivotal cohort, defined as addresses holding BTC for at least 155 days, has purchased a net total of approximately 33,000 BTC over the past month. This reversal follows a prolonged period where these same investors acted as the market’s primary source of selling pressure, distributing over one million BTC during Bitcoin’s price decline. The move provides a crucial signal about underlying market strength and potential sentiment change as 2025 approaches. Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Shift from Sellers to Accumulators The behavior of long-term holders serves as a critical barometer for Bitcoin’s health. Consequently, their recent pivot demands close examination. Throughout much of the year, this group consistently offloaded holdings. Specifically, they sold more than one million BTC as the cryptocurrency’s price corrected downward by roughly 36% from its October peak. However, the latest 30-day window reveals a stark contrast. These seasoned investors have net-purchased 33,000 BTC, worth hundreds of millions of dollars at current valuations. This accumulation phase marks their first net-positive buying activity in several months. On-chain analytics firm checkonchain provided the crucial data for this analysis. The firm meticulously tracks wallet movements to classify investor cohorts. Their methodology offers a transparent window into market participant behavior. Furthermore, this data is independent of exchange-reported volumes, which can sometimes be misleading. The shift suggests that investors with the strongest conviction are now finding value at current price levels. This activity often precedes broader market recoveries. Understanding the On-Chain Data and Holder Classification The definition of a “long-term holder” is not arbitrary. checkonchain uses a specific, data-driven threshold of 155 days. Addresses holding coins for less than this period are classified as short-term holders (STHs). This classification is vital for accurate market analysis. Short-term holders typically react to price volatility and news headlines. Conversely, long-term holders exhibit more strategic, patient behavior. The 155-day rule creates a clear distinction between these two psychologically different groups. Importantly, this reclassification process helps explain the current buying pressure. Coins purchased by short-term holders during the last six months are now aging into the long-term holder cohort. Therefore, the apparent net buying from LTHs may partially reflect this automatic reclassification. As checkonchain noted, buying pressure from the past half-year could now be offsetting the persistent selling pressure from earlier in the year. This creates a dynamic and self-reinforcing cycle for market stability. The Mechanics of Market Supply and Sentiment This shift has direct implications for Bitcoin’s available supply. When long-term holders sell, they increase the liquid supply on exchanges, often depressing prices. When they accumulate, they withdraw coins from circulation, reducing sell-side pressure. The net purchase of 33,000 BTC represents a meaningful absorption of market supply. To visualize the scale of this change, consider the following comparison of holder behavior: Time Period Long-Term Holder Action Approximate BTC Volume Market Context Jan – Oct 2024 Net Selling >1,000,000 BTC Price decline ~36% Past 30 Days Net Accumulation +33,000 BTC Price consolidation phase This table highlights the dramatic reversal in behavior. Several key factors likely contribute to this change: Perceived Value: Long-term holders may view current prices as a strategic entry point. Reduced Volatility: A period of price consolidation often encourages accumulation. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader financial conditions can influence asset allocation decisions. Network Fundamentals: Strong Bitcoin fundamentals persist despite price action. Historical Context and Potential Market Implications Historically, accumulation by long-term holders has correlated with later price appreciation. While past performance never guarantees future results, this pattern provides a useful framework. These investors typically possess a deep understanding of Bitcoin’s cycles. Their collective actions often signal a transition between market phases. The current accumulation follows a significant price correction. Therefore, it may indicate a belief that the worst of the selling has concluded. The broader cryptocurrency market closely watches these signals. Altcoin markets often take directional cues from Bitcoin’s strength. Consequently, renewed confidence from Bitcoin’s core investor base could have ripple effects across the entire digital asset ecosystem. However, it is crucial to maintain a neutral perspective. On-chain data provides evidence of behavior, not a crystal ball for price prediction. Market outcomes depend on a complex interplay of additional variables including regulatory developments, institutional adoption, and global liquidity conditions. Expert Analysis on Holder Psychology and Market Cycles Market analysts emphasize the psychological importance of this shift. Long-term holders represent “strong hands.” Their willingness to buy during uncertainty demonstrates resilience. This behavior often contrasts with that of short-term traders, who may capitulate during downtrends. The reclassification mechanism also introduces a natural, time-delayed bullish factor. Coins purchased during fear gradually become inert, reducing potential future supply shocks. This process inherently supports price stability over longer time horizons. Furthermore, the data underscores a maturation within the Bitcoin investor base. The presence of a large, patient cohort helps dampen extreme volatility. It also suggests a growing recognition of Bitcoin as a long-term store of value, rather than purely a speculative asset. This evolving narrative is central to Bitcoin’s adoption journey. The actions of these holders provide real-time, on-chain validation of that thesis. Conclusion The transition of Bitcoin long-term holders from net sellers to net buyers marks a critical inflection point for the market. Their accumulation of 33,000 BTC over the past month signals a potential stabilization in investor sentiment following a prolonged corrective phase. While driven in part by the mechanical reclassification of coins, this shift undeniably reduces immediate sell-side pressure and reflects strategic positioning by Bitcoin’s most committed investors. Monitoring the continued behavior of this cohort, alongside other fundamental and macroeconomic factors, will be essential for understanding Bitcoin’s trajectory as it moves forward. The data provides a compelling, evidence-based narrative of renewed accumulation at a pivotal moment. FAQs Q1: What defines a Bitcoin “long-term holder” (LTH)? Analytics firms like checkonchain typically define a long-term holder as any Bitcoin address that has held its coins without spending them for at least 155 days. This threshold separates them from more reactive short-term holders. Q2: Why is the shift from selling to buying by LTHs significant? Long-term holders are considered informed, patient investors. When they sell en masse, it often signals distribution during a top. When they accumulate during a downturn, it suggests they see value, which can indicate a potential market bottom or reversal phase. Q3: Does the net purchase of 33,000 BTC guarantee a Bitcoin price increase? No, it does not guarantee a price increase. While historically a bullish signal, on-chain data is one of many factors. Price depends on broader market sentiment, macroeconomic conditions, regulatory news, and overall supply and demand dynamics. Q4: What is the difference between “net accumulation” and simple buying? Net accumulation refers to the total amount of Bitcoin added to wallets minus any Bitcoin sold or spent from those same wallets over a period. It measures the overall change in holdings, not just gross purchases. Q5: How does the 155-day reclassification rule affect the data? It means that coins bought by short-term traders 155 days ago automatically become part of the long-term holder supply today. Therefore, some of the apparent “buying” by LTHs is actually the aging of existing coins into the new category, which mechanically reduces the visible sell-side from that cohort.

They allow users to access USDT or USDC without selling Bitcoin , Ether, or other digital assets. For long-term holders, this offers a way to unlock liquidity while maintaining market exposure. To use stablecoin loans effectively, it is essential to understand how they work, what risks they involve, and how platforms structure borrowing terms. What Is a Stablecoin Loan? A stablecoin loan is a crypto-backed loan where the borrowed asset is a stablecoin, typically USDT or USDC. The borrower deposits crypto as collateral, receives stablecoins, and repays the loan plus interest over time. The value of the loan is determined by Loan-to-Value (LTV), which measures how much is borrowed relative to the value of the collateral. As collateral prices change, LTV changes in real time, affecting risk and liquidation thresholds. Why Borrow USDT or USDC Instead of Selling Crypto? Selling crypto converts price volatility into a realized outcome and may trigger tax liabilities. Borrowing stablecoins keeps the crypto position intact while providing liquidity for spending, trading, or cash flow needs. Stablecoins are widely accepted across exchanges, DeFi protocols, and payment rails. This makes them a practical bridge between volatile assets and everyday use. How Stablecoin Borrowing Works in Practice After depositing collateral, the platform assigns a borrowing limit based on collateral value and risk profile. The borrower can then draw USDT or USDC up to that limit. Interest accrues on the borrowed amount, and the loan remains active until repaid. If collateral value falls and LTV rises too high, the platform may issue warnings or liquidate part of the collateral to cover the loan. Some platforms issue fixed-term loans. Others, like Clapp , use a credit-line model that allows borrowers to draw and repay stablecoins at any time. Using Crypto as Collateral Bitcoin and Ether are the most commonly accepted collateral assets due to their liquidity and market depth. Some platforms also support SOL, stablecoins, and select altcoins. More volatile assets usually carry lower maximum LTVs. This reduces borrowing power but helps manage liquidation risk. Platforms that support multi-collateral credit lines , such as Clapp, allow users to combine multiple assets into a single collateral pool, which can smooth volatility at the portfolio level. Interest Rates and Cost Structure Interest rates on stablecoin loans vary based on LTV, collateral type, and market conditions. Lower LTV positions generally receive lower rates. A key distinction is whether interest accrues on the full approved loan or only on the amount actually used. On Clapp, interest accrues only on withdrawn stablecoins. Unused credit carries 0% APR, which can reduce costs for borrowers with fluctuating liquidity needs. Managing Liquidation Risk Liquidation is the primary risk in stablecoin borrowing. It occurs when LTV reaches a predefined threshold due to falling collateral prices or increased borrowing. Managing risk involves maintaining a conservative LTV, monitoring positions regularly, and responding early to alerts. Adding collateral or repaying part of the loan reduces LTV and restores safety margins. Platforms that provide real-time LTV tracking and early notifications give borrowers more room to act before liquidation becomes unavoidable. Common Use Cases for Stablecoin Loans Stablecoin loans are used for a range of purposes. Some borrowers use them for everyday expenses or operational costs. Others deploy stablecoins into trading strategies, DeFi protocols, or short-term investments. In all cases, the goal is liquidity without selling core assets. The flexibility of credit-line models makes stablecoin borrowing more adaptable to changing needs. Final Thoughts Stablecoin loans convert crypto holdings into usable liquidity without forcing liquidation of long-term positions. They are powerful tools when used carefully, but they require an understanding of LTV dynamics and liquidation risk. Platforms that combine transparent pricing, flexible credit structures, and real-time risk monitoring make stablecoin borrowing easier to manage. Used responsibly, USDT and USDC loans can extend the utility of crypto portfolios without compromising ownership. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The measures aimed at curbing illegal mining activities across the country include hefty fines, “forced labor” and even prison sentences. Moscow to prosecute illegal miners under updated criminal law The Ministry of Justice in Moscow is proposing amendments to the Criminal Code and the Criminal Procedure Code of the Russian Federation, intensifying the fight against citizens involved in illegal cryptocurrency mining. The Bitcoin-related activity was officially legalized and regulated in late 2024, but the bigger part of the industry remains in the shadows, with many mining enterprises avoiding registration with Russia’s tax authority and some minting coins on stolen electricity. The justice department now wants their operators punished. According to the draft changes posted on Russia’s Official Internet Portal of Legal Information, a new article – “Illegal mining of digital currency and the activities of a mining infrastructure operator” – will be added to the criminal code. It introduces monetary penalties of up to 1.5 million rubles (over $19,000), mandatory community service that may reach 480 hours, and forced labor for up to two years for “conducting digital currency mining by a person not included in the register of persons engaged in digital currency mining.” Up to five years of imprisonment awaits those who make particularly large profits or participate in organized crime groups mining digital currencies in breach of the rules, the Interfax news agency reported Tuesday. The document highlights the measures are targeting actions that “cause significant damage to individuals, organizations, or the state, or are associated with the generation of a large amount of income” – 3.5 million rubles or more (almost $45,000). Crimes committed by organized groups or inflicting large-scale financial damages and generating large amounts of income, in excess of 13.5 million rubles (over $172,000), will result in even tougher penalties. These “shall be punishable by a fine of 500,000 to 2.5 million rubles, or an amount equal to the convicted person’s wages or other income for a period of one to three years, or by forced labor for up to five years, or by imprisonment for up to five years,” the new article continues. Russia makes good on promises to criminalize illegal mining Russian authorities legalized and regulated cryptocurrency mining with a dedicated law that went into force on November 1, 2024. It allows legal entities, sole proprietors and private individuals to engage in the activity. The first two categories, as well as mining infrastructure operators, are required to register their businesses and equipment with the Federal Tax Service (FNS) and pay taxes. The registration is not mandatory for amateur miners using less than 6,000 kWh of electricity monthly. All of them are obliged, however, to report the minted cryptocurrency to the government. While the legalization helped Russia tap into the profits of an industry that utilizes its competitive advantages in mining, such as abundant energy resources and cool climates, growth in the sector has also caused some headaches. At the end of May this year, the FNS announced its register lists 1,000 enterprises. Later estimates suggest less than a third of all mining firms have announced their activities to the state. And then the number of active crypto farms was estimated at close to 200,000. Meanwhile, the increasing concentration of mining facilities in some parts of the vast country, both authorized and underground, led to power shortages and was met with temporary or permanent restrictions in about a dozen regions. Earlier in December, the Russian government made it clear it intends to criminalize illegal crypto mining, as reported by Cryptopolitan. The initiative to introduce criminal liability for miners who steal electric power and administrative liability for lesser offenses was made public by Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak. Later this month, Russian press reports revealed the executive power in Moscow is expediting a plan to bring more of the country’s economy out of the shadows, which is specifically targeting crypto mining among other activities.

Here’s What Is Next,https://timestabloid.com/adam-and-eve-bottoming-pattern-forms-for-xrp-heres-what-is-next/,"Crypto analyst Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) is watching XRP closely as a possible reversal structure begins to take shape on the hourly timeframe. In a new post, he revealed an Adam and Eve bottoming pattern and shared a chart that outlined the developing setup. The chart highlights a sharp sell-off followed by a fast rebound, which forms the first leg of the pattern. That move is followed by a slower, rounding bottom pattern that has developed over several sessions. The asset has since moved back toward a clear resistance zone, often referred to as the neckline. Potential Adam and Eve bottoming pattern forming here for $XRP on the hourly pic.twitter.com/XI58pdZtD0 — Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) December 28, 2025 What the Pattern Signals in the Short Term The Adam and Eve structure shows a change in market behavior. The initial drop shows aggressive selling and forced exits. The rounded recovery shows declining sell pressure and steady demand. On the hourly chart, this type of setup often appears when downside momentum begins to weaken. If XRP pushes above the neckline with follow-through, short-term momentum can shift quickly. Buyers tend to gain confidence once resistance flips into support . If XRP fails at that level, the structure may break down, and sellers may regain control. Why This Matters Beyond the Hourly Chart Short-term structures matter because they often appear before higher timeframe reversals. XRP has a history of extended consolidation periods that precede sharp directional moves. When the price begins to form rounded bases after a steep decline, it suggests that the consolidation may be coming to an end. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 If XRP continues to form higher lows after reclaiming resistance, it could translate into daily and weekly charts over time. Sustained structural improvement in 2025 would matter far more than a single breakout candle, and the structure could provide a strong base for a rally in 2026. 2026 Trajectory Depends on Sustaining the Structure XRP’s path toward 2026 will depend on whether it can maintain a constructive price structure across cycles. Early reversal patterns, such as Adam and Eve, often mark transition zones. They do not define the outcome, but indicate that conditions are changing. For now, the setup remains incomplete because the neckline still stands. Analysts believe XRP will shock investors in 2026 . This pattern could signal the start of that trend. All XRP has to do is break above the neckline and sustain its momentum into higher timeframes. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Today a significant segment of the market consists of crypto credit lines —flexible borrowing arrangements that give users access to liquidity without selling their holdings, without forced monthly payments, and with clearer risk frameworks. But not all credit lines are created equal. In 2026, regulatory considerations, loan mechanics, and risk controls vary significantly across providers. This article compares the major European crypto credit line options, breaks down how they work, and explains what compliance means for borrowers. What Are Crypto Credit Lines? A crypto credit line lets you: Deposit supported cryptocurrencies as collateral Receive a borrowing limit based on your collateral’s value Draw funds as needed (typically stablecoins or fiat) Pay interest only on the amount used Repay partially or fully at your own pace Unlike traditional term loans, credit lines have no mandatory monthly payments and no fixed borrowing schedule. The critical risk factor is not time, but collateral value; if the value of your collateral drops enough that your Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio breaches a threshold, the platform may issue margin calls or liquidate assets to protect the loan. How Crypto Credit Lines Work in Europe European borrowers face unique considerations: Regulatory evolution: Europe has progressed toward coherent crypto-assets frameworks, including licensing regimes like Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) supervision in member states. Banking alternatives: Not all banks provide crypto-collateralized credit, making regulated crypto lenders a practical option. Tax and accounting preferences: Many users prefer credit lines to selling crypto for liquidity, especially where selling triggers tax events. The key difference between providers often comes down to terms, limits, compliance posture, and how risk is managed. How We Compare Credit Lines To evaluate leading European credit lines, we consider: Loan Terms: How interest is calculated and imposed LTV Limits: How much you can borrow relative to collateral Repayment Flexibility: Whether there are mandatory payments or schedules Collateral Support: The range of assets accepted Compliance and Licensing: Regulatory status, especially in the European Union Leading European Crypto Credit Lines (2026) Platform Model Interest Max LTV Compliance Notes Clapp Revolving Credit Line Only on used funds Moderate VASP-licensed in Czech Republic Regulated EU option with euro payouts Nexo Credit Line On drawn amounts Moderate Compliance-oriented Centralized, broad support YouHodler Credit Line On drawn amounts Higher Compliance-oriented Higher LTV, tighter risk margins Binance Loans Integrated Credit Line On drawn amounts Varies Exchange compliance Easy for exchange users 1. Clapp — Regulated Credit Line Built for Europe Overview: Clapp is a credit-line product designed with European compliance in mind. It holds a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license in the Czech Republic, placing it within the EU regulatory perimeter. Loan Terms:Interest only accrues on borrowed funds. No interest on unused credit. Limits:Clapp adopts conservative LTV ratios to reduce liquidation risk in volatile markets. Repayment Flexibility:Fully flexible. Borrowers can repay any amount at any time without penalties. Collateral Support:Common major assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and selected liquid tokens. Compliance and Licensing:Operating under a Czech Republic VASP license means Clapp adheres to EU AML and KYC standards and is subject to oversight by a European regulator. Ideal For:European users seeking regulated products with clear terms and predictable risk controls. 2. Nexo — Established Centralized Credit Line Overview: Nexo offers a widely used crypto credit line that supports major assets and provides instant access after collateral is deposited. Loan Terms:Interest applies on the drawn amount from the moment of borrowing. Limits:Moderate LTV ratios with tiered interest based on loyalty programs and collateral types. Repayment Flexibility:Repayments are flexible with no fixed schedules, but interest accrues on borrowed amounts until repaid. Collateral Support:Broad asset support including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and several altcoins. Compliance and Licensing:Operates across multiple jurisdictions with global AML/KYC enforcement. Ideal For:Borrowers who want a familiar, centralized credit experience with a broad range of collateral. 3. YouHodler — Higher LTV Options With Clear Controls Overview: YouHodler aims to maximize borrowing power by offering higher LTV options compared with more conservative lenders. Loan Terms:Interest applies on borrowed amounts. Limits:Higher LTV thresholds, which increase borrowing potential but reduce liquidation buffers. Repayment Flexibility:Flexible—borrowers can repay at any time without mandated monthly payments. Collateral Support:Wide selection of supported tokens. Compliance and Licensing:AML/KYC enforced; structured to meet evolving compliance expectations. Ideal For:Experienced users willing to accept tighter risk margins to access larger loans. 4. Binance Loans — Integrated Exchange Credit Line Overview: Binance allows borrowers to draw credit against their exchange balances. Loan Terms:Interest applies to drawn funds; rates vary by asset and market. Limits:LTV varies depending on collateral type. Repayment Flexibility:Flexible, with on-platform tools to manage collateral and repayments. Collateral Support:Extensive, including many mainstream and smaller assets. Compliance and Licensing:Operates under multiple regulatory regimes through global exchange compliance frameworks. Ideal For:Users who already hold assets on Binance and want integrated borrowing. Terms of Crypto Credit Lines Interest Calculation Most credit lines charge interest only on the amount borrowed. What differentiates providers is whether interest continues to accrue indefinitely or benefits from tiered or promotional rate structures. Loan-to-Value (LTV) Lower LTV: More conservative, higher safety buffer Higher LTV: More liquidity but increased liquidation risk Regulated or compliance-oriented platforms tend to take a conservative approach to LTV to protect borrowers in volatile markets. Repayment Flexibility What separates credit lines from term loans is repayment freedom. None of the platforms here mandate monthly payments; instead, interest accrues on the outstanding balance, and borrowers choose when and how much to repay. Compliance and Borrower Protection Regulatory status matters because it defines: Legal recourse in disputes Custody and client asset handling rules AML/KYC and fraud prevention Transparency obligations In Europe, a VASP license or similar national authorization signals that a platform operates under a jurisdiction with enforceable compliance standards. This improves predictability and reduces counterparty uncertainty. Clapp’s VASP license in the Czech Republic places it within the EU regulatory perimeter, making it one of the clearest examples of compliance-aligned crypto lending in the region. Risks Remain Even with regulated credit lines, risks include: Market volatility: Sudden price drops can push your LTV toward liquidation. Custodial risk: Centralized platforms hold your collateral during the borrowing period. Liquidity risk: Market conditions can tighten collateral valuations quickly. Credit lines do not eliminate these risks. They simply structure them in ways that can be monitored and managed more transparently. Final Thoughts Crypto credit lines in Europe in 2026 represent a shift from fixed-term loans toward flexible, user-centric liquidity tools. Regulation and compliance now play a bigger role in shaping credit terms, borrower protections, and product design. For users seeking a balance of flexibility, clarity, and regulatory alignment, options like Clapp—with its Czech Republic VASP license—highlight what a compliant credit line can look like in practice. Other platforms such as Nexo, YouHodler, and Binance offer alternative trade-offs in terms of limits, collateral variety, and operational footprint.

The protocol estimated initial losses at $3.9M. Unleash Protocol, a market app built on Story Protocol, noted a series of unauthorized withdrawals from one of its smart contracts. The protocol identified the exploit as connected to the Unleash multisig governance. The hacker managed to force an unauthorized contract update, allowing the withdrawal of funds without the approval of the protocol team. Unleash Protocol Incident Notice Earlier today, we detected unauthorized activity involving Unleash Protocol smart contracts, which led to the withdrawal and transfer of user funds. Our initial investigation indicates that an externally owned address gained administrative… — Unleash Protocol (꧁IP OS꧂) (@UnleashProtocol) December 30, 2025 The exploit only affected the Unleash smart contracts, with no effects on Story Protocol . Unleash Protocol is a relatively new app, with just $4.4M in total value locked. The protocol was drained of most of its liquidity soon after launching. Unleash Protocol stopped all operations and is now further investigating the cause and the potential to intercept some of the funds. Initial investigations show the attacker managed to bridge over 1,300 ETH, sending them to Tornado Cash. The exploiter’s known address was funded with ETH initially, then called for several transfers of 100 ETH directly to Tornado Cash. Unleash hack could slow down Story Protocol Story Protocol may slow down its development, as Unleash was among its top apps. Story Protocol aimed to build the infrastructure for intellectual property. Story Protocol created another L1 chain, setting out to build its own ecosystem. At the end of 2025, Story Protocol held $8M in liquidity and $2.69M in stablecoins. In the past week, the protocol saw an outflow of over 24% of its stablecoins, independent of the Unleash Protocol hack. The Story Protocol ecosystem contains relatively smaller apps. However, the Unleash hack shows that even small protocols are watched for potential exploits and errors in smart contracts. Following the exploit announcement, the native Story protocol token IP fell from $1.62 to $1.50 . IP unraveled in the past quarter, from a yearly peak above $13. SlowMist counted 200 exploits in 2025 According to SlowMist, 2025 saw 200 incidents of hacks against protocols, down from over 400 incidents for 2024. Despite this, the hackers managed to attack bigger liquidity hubs, for a total loss of over $2.9B, up from $2B in 2024. The recent attacks were more sophisticated, even when affecting relatively small protocols. Hackers targeted smart contracts, attacking DeFi platforms and liquidity pools. One of the main methods was to seek ways to make unauthorized withdrawals or mint tokens through a flawed smart contract. DeFi was the most frequently attacked type of project, with 126 incidents for the past year. The attacks ranged from small-scale token theft to draining leading apps like Cetus. DeFi exploits drained around $649M, while the incidents on centralized exchanges were the main source of value for exploiters, with over $1.8B for the past year. Don’t just read crypto news.

That’s despite the fact that its BNMR stock collapsed by 82% since early July. According to the Financial Times , South Korean retail traders poured a net $1.4 billion into BitMine this year alone, ranking it just below Google’s Alphabet in foreign investor preference. The obsession began when BitMine switched from mining Bitcoin to hoarding Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The announcement pushed the stock up more than 3,000% by July 3. The company had barely registered on Korean radars before that. But once it rebranded itself as an Ether accumulator, retail buyers went all in. By the end of July, it was the most purchased foreign equity in the country. Retail investors double down on BitMine against all odds After peaking in July, BitMine shares crashed abruptly the very next month. But South Korean retail investors, known locally as “ants,” kept buying. As of December 29, they had invested a total of $1.4 billion in BitMine just this year alone, though they also funneled $566 million into T-Rex’s 2X Long BitMine Daily Target ETF, a product designed to mirror BitMine’s daily performance at double the speed. That fund launched shortly after BitMine’s summer run and has since lost about 86% from its September peak. Even with that drop, the cash kept flowing. The appetite for volatility among South Korean traders appears nowhere near cooling down. BitMine holds $12B in Ether as token stalls BitMine now holds around $12 billion worth of Ether, making it the largest listed entity focused on accumulating the token. This has positioned it as the top Ether treasury company, based on numbers from strategicethreserve.xyz. The stock’s earlier rise helped fuel a temporary rally in Ether itself, which touched a new high of almost $5,000 in August. But since then, the momentum has dried up. The price of Ether is down roughly 11% for the year. Despite the drop, BitMine has held its crypto stockpile strategy. Investors betting on a rebound have stuck with it, and South Korea’s traders haven’t blinked. Even as other assets turned south, they stayed locked on BitMine, showing the same high-risk appetite that’s made them notorious in global financial circles. South Korea’s investing culture remains extremely crypto-forward, especially among young traders, so altcoins, leverage, and fast gains have always pulled in attention.

But it wasn’t only the crypto industry that was keeping its fingers crossed for a rally. Recall that Trump also promised to cut corporate tax rates to 15% from 21% for companies that make their product in America, to remove taxes on tips, to eliminate taxes on social security, to make car loans fully tax-deductible, and much more. All of this led to expectations of a booming US economy, with thriving small businesses driven by tax relief and government assistance. The reality, though? Well, nearly one year later, we have the numbers, and they tell a radically different story. Tracking a hypothetical $10,000 investment made on Inauguration Day 2025 across 12 major asset classes, the results reveal a considerable capital flight from speculative assets into traditional, tangible safe havens. What does this signal? To many – uncertainty. The Bottom Line: From Inauguration Day to Now Below you will find the current value of a $10,000 investment made on January 20th, 2025, across a range of asset classes (and subcategories). Image created by CryptoPotato, Data Source: X It’s a Supercycle, Alright Indeed, we saw a supercycle, just not where most of the crypto industry was expecting it. Don’t get me wrong, BTC painted multiple all-time highs, altcoins (or at least some of them) had their moment under the sun, but the year has undoubtedly been a lot different from what most of the analysts expected it would be. The rally didn’t come from traditionally volatile and speculative assets, but rather from the exact opposite. The most striking trend of the post-inauguration period is, without a doubt, the dominance of precious and industrial metals. While most of the attention was focused on stock indices, silver delivered a staggering return of 134%. Mind you, some of the numbers might be different at the time you are reading this article because, well, precious metals are more or less acting like sh*tcoins right now. But what does this mean? Well, experts speculate about the parabolic price rises in precious and industrial metals. Some of them justify the increase with fundamentals such as increasing global uncertainty around the war between Russia and Ukraine, the tensions in the Middle East, the Trump-led policy of virtually slamming every country with tariffs, the demand for certain metals to produce graphic chips because of the booming AI sector, and much more. One report from the BBC recently explained that the supply for silver (as the most dominant performer in the selected period) is expanding because of: Its use in various industries, such as EV manufacturing and solar panels Fears of Trump imposing tariffs on it Inability to quickly increase supply Remember, most of these are natural resources and not a product, meaning that there’s a finite supply of it. Although silver’s supply is estimated to be at least ten times that of gold, the majority of its global output is a by-product of mines that mainly extract other metals, making it harder to meet the increasing demand. Gold is also up by around 60%. Never has the precious metal seen such an impressive 12-month performance. And while many experts find reasoning behind fundamentals, others are of the opinion that markets are pricing in increasing inflation and uncertainty, treating the silver trade as a beta to gold, which started to increase a lot sooner. In other words, some are already bracing for impact. In any case, the “Trump Trade” in 2025 turned out to be a commodities trade rather than a tech trade. The Surprise Loser: Speculation Deflates Donald Trump promised a lot of things to crypto proponents in a bid to win them over, and to an extent, it worked. Many in the industry favored him, and, in all fairness, we’ve seen a lot of fundamental progress, especially in terms of legislation. From a hawkish SEC that was legislating through enforcement, the US currently has an administration that is actively working on adequate bills. In July, the President’s Working Group on Digital Assets published a comprehensive roadmap to strengthen the country’s leadership in the digital asset field, calling for swift implementation of the GENIUS act, the modernization of AML legislation, enactment of laws aimed at market structure, and more. Both regulatory heavyweights, in the face of the CFTC and the SEC, have changed their stance, while the government is also an official “HODLer” because of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve – something Trump signed an executive order for back in March. And despite all of the above, price action has been nothing but disappointing over the past few months, which ultimately led to the negative performance since Inauguration Day. I read a tweet saying that Bitcoin at $90K feels like we’re at $10K, and indeed, sentiment is near all-time lows. And here’s why: Crypto prices since Trump took office: $BTC : -18% $ETH : -10% $XRP : -42% $SOL : -52% $DOGE : -68% $ADA : -65% $LINK : -47% $AVAX : -68% $SUI : -71% $TON : -72% $ENA : -75% $PEPE : -78% $APT : -83% $TRUMP : -82% Thankyou, MR President. — Crypto Rover (@cryptorover) December 25, 2025 Regardless of the reasons, it’s evident that funds are flowing out of speculative assets. The real alpha this year was in metals. A portfolio allocated to a basket of Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Palladium would have more than doubled in value in 12 months.

In his Dec. 27 “Weekly Insight” newsletter, Taylor framed the call inside a broader thesis: that capital chasing breakouts in traditional markets could eventually rotate into crypto, amplifying returns given crypto’s smaller aggregate market cap. Within that setup, XRP is his “core position,” and the token he sees as a primary beneficiary if altcoins capture a larger share of the cycle’s upside. Can XRP Still Reach $28 This Cycle? Taylor’s XRP outlook is tied to his expectation that total crypto market cap can reach roughly $10 trillion this cycle, a level he characterized as consistent with prior cycle behavior. The more important variable, in his view, is where Bitcoin dominance lands if that scenario plays out. Related Reading: XRP Exchange Inflows Spike To End 2025: Will Price Decline Deepen? He wrote that dominance could fall into the “35.3 percent and 31.5 percent range,” which would imply Bitcoin at roughly a $3 trillion to $4 trillion market cap in that environment and “leave the door open for around six trillion dollars to flow into altcoins.” That’s the backdrop for his XRP targets: not a claim about XRP alone, but a wager on the size of the altcoin pie if the market turns risk-on. Taylor also pointed to a prior discussion with trader Credible Crypto as an example of how high-cycle targets can emerge when liquidity, positioning, and sentiment converge. “My pinned post on X is a conversation with Credible Crypto where he talks about how, for example, XRP could go to $26 if the stars align for a cycle like this,” Taylor wrote. “And right now, it genuinely feels like those stars are starting to align.” Taylor disclosed that XRP is the overwhelming majority of his portfolio, a disclosure he flagged as a potential bias. “As you guys know, I am around 90 percent XRP in my portfolio, so I definitely have some bias here,” he wrote, before laying out a profit-taking framework centered on a mid-cycle target zone. “I would not be too surprised to see XRP reach a minimum of eight to thirteen dollars,” Taylor wrote. “I have discussed many times that I would be taking a lot of profit in that range, with an outside maximum target of up to around twenty eight dollars.” Related Reading: XRP Supply Shock Incoming? Expert Reveals The Truth He tied the higher-end target to a technical read of XRP’s long consolidation and the possibility that an altcoin-led cycle could be larger than many investors expect. Taylor described the $28 level as derived from the “initial breakout from the 2017 to 2018 cycle,” while emphasizing he had deliberately “diminished expectations” versus modeling a more aggressive, multi-leg extension. Even so, his risk management plan is explicit about reducing exposure in the $8 to $13 band. “As I have said before, I plan to heavily de leverage between eight and thirteen dollars if we are offered that opportunity,” he wrote. “I will not be selling all of my bags, though, because I do think there is an outside chance that we push higher, potentially toward the twenty eight dollar area.” The Argument For XRP Taylor’s core claim is that XRP’s structure is different from many large-cap alts because it has, in his view, spent longer in “compression” and is now emerging from it. He argued XRP “has experienced longer compression than most altcoins, has broken out of an eight year trend, and has held previous seven year resistance as support.” He also suggested that a favorable US policy narrative could act as an accelerant in a euphoric phase, pointing to “the rhetoric around US companies,” the “US Clarity Act,” and Ripple “remaining based in the US” as factors that could make a higher-end outcome less implausible in a risk-on environment. Still, Taylor repeatedly stressed that the $28 figure is not his central expectation. “That being said, and I want to be very clear on this, this is not my primary target,” he wrote. “My primary target is and has been between eight and twelve dollars, potentially stretching to fifteen or sixteen dollars this cycle. The move toward twenty eight dollars is an outside scenario, not a base case.” At press time, XRP traded at $1.86.

This development, first reported by Ukrainian media outlets, specifically affects customers who utilized the platform’s fiat payment partner, Bifinity. Consequently, this move creates immediate practical challenges for Ukrainian traders seeking to convert digital assets into traditional currency. The suspension highlights the complex interplay between global crypto platforms, regional financial infrastructure, and evolving regulatory landscapes. Binance Ukraine Withdrawal Suspension: The Core Details According to official clarifications from Binance, the suspension of card-based withdrawals applies exclusively to users in Ukraine who accessed the exchange’s services through Bifinity. Bifinity, a fiat-to-crypto payment service owned by Binance, previously facilitated seamless transactions between bank cards and the exchange. Importantly, other withdrawal methods for Ukrainian clients, such as bank transfers or peer-to-peer (P2P) trading, reportedly remain operational. This targeted restriction suggests a specific issue with the card processing channel rather than a blanket ban on all fiat operations in the region. The exchange has not provided a definitive timeline for reinstating the service, leaving affected users to seek alternative on-ramps and off-ramps for their funds. Furthermore, this incident is not isolated within the broader context of cryptocurrency operations in Eastern Europe. Over the past two years, multiple jurisdictions have scrutinized and sometimes restricted fiat gateways to crypto exchanges due to concerns over compliance, sanctions, and financial stability. For instance, several payment processors in the European Union have periodically paused services for crypto merchants. Therefore, the situation in Ukraine may reflect similar risk assessments by card networks or intermediary banking partners. The suspension directly impacts user experience and liquidity, forcing a rapid adaptation to the changing financial technology environment. Understanding the Role of Bifinity and Card Networks Bifinity serves as a critical bridge between traditional finance and the cryptocurrency ecosystem. By partnering with card networks like Visa and Mastercard, it enables users to deposit and withdraw fiat currency using familiar payment tools. However, this bridge depends on the cooperation of multiple entities, including acquiring banks, card issuers, and compliance departments. A disruption at any point in this chain can halt transactions. In this case, the suspension likely stems from decisions made by the card networks or their Ukrainian banking partners regarding the classification of crypto-related transactions. Such decisions often follow internal policy reviews or external regulatory guidance. Regulatory Context and Global Precedents The Ukrainian financial landscape has undergone substantial transformation since 2022, with the government actively working to formalize cryptocurrency regulations. In March 2023, Ukraine passed the “Virtual Assets” law, establishing a legal framework for crypto service providers. The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) and the National Securities and Stock Market Commission (NSSMC) share regulatory oversight. This evolving framework aims to combat money laundering and integrate crypto activities into the monitored financial system. Consequently, payment service providers are adjusting their operations to align with new compliance requirements, which can lead to temporary service interruptions. Globally, similar card withdrawal suspensions have occurred. For example, in early 2023, certain Australian banks blocked payments to high-risk crypto exchanges. Moreover, some European banks have historically imposed limits on card transactions with crypto platforms. These actions typically cite concerns about consumer protection, volatility, and fraud risks. The table below illustrates recent comparable incidents: Region Platform/Action Year Primary Stated Reason Australia Major banks block select crypto exchanges 2023 Scam and investment risk prevention United Kingdom Barclays restricts card payments to Binance 2021 Consumer protection warning from FCA European Union Multiple card processors pause crypto merchant services 2022-2024 Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance These precedents demonstrate that payment channel disruptions are a recurring challenge in the crypto industry. They often result from risk management decisions by traditional financial institutions rather than actions by the exchanges themselves. For Ukrainian users, understanding this broader pattern provides context for the current Binance situation. Immediate Impact and Practical Alternatives for Users The immediate effect of this suspension is a reduction in convenience for Ukrainian Binance users. Card withdrawals typically offer speed and direct access to funds in a user’s bank account. Without this option, users must pivot to other methods. Fortunately, several alternatives remain available. Firstly, bank transfer withdrawals (via SEPA or local Ukrainian systems) often continue to function, though they may involve longer processing times and require manual input of banking details. Secondly, the P2P trading platform on Binance allows users to buy and sell crypto directly with other individuals, using a variety of payment methods agreed upon between parties. This method can provide immediate liquidity. Bank Transfers: Use the ‘Withdraw Fiat’ option and select your local currency (UAH). You will need your full bank account details. P2P Marketplace: Access the P2P section, create a sell order for your crypto, and choose a preferred payment method from buyers (e.g., PrivatBank, Monobank transfer). Crypto-to-Crypto Transfers: Withdraw your cryptocurrency to another exchange or a private wallet that supports different fiat off-ramps. Third-Party Payment Processors: Explore other licensed Ukrainian crypto services that may still support card withdrawals, ensuring they are legally compliant. Users should always verify the identity and reputation of counterparties on P2P platforms and follow all platform security guidelines. Additionally, staying informed about official Binance announcements via their blog or support channels is crucial for receiving updates on service restoration. Expert Perspective on Financial Infrastructure Resilience Financial technology analysts note that such disruptions test the resilience of a region’s crypto-financial infrastructure. “The temporary suspension of a single fiat channel underscores the importance of having multiple, diversified off-ramps,” explains a fintech researcher specializing in Eastern European markets. “Robust ecosystems rely on bank transfers, P2P networks, and even stablecoin conversions to ensure users are not stranded. For Ukraine, which has seen remarkable crypto adoption, this is a moment to strengthen alternative rails.” This perspective highlights that while inconvenient, the event may accelerate the development and adoption of more decentralized and resilient financial tools within the country. Conclusion The suspension of card-based withdrawals for Ukrainian Binance users via Bifinity represents a specific operational adjustment within a dynamic regulatory and financial environment. While it poses immediate challenges, it occurs against a backdrop of global precedents where traditional finance interfaces with the crypto sector. The key takeaways are the continued availability of alternative withdrawal methods like bank transfers and P2P trading, and the ongoing evolution of Ukraine’s regulatory framework for virtual assets. Users are advised to utilize these alternatives while monitoring official communications. Ultimately, this development in Binance Ukraine card withdrawals serves as a reminder of the growing pains inherent in integrating innovative digital asset platforms with established global payment networks. FAQs Q1: Can Ukrainian users still deposit funds using Visa/Mastercard on Binance? As of this report, the suspension specifically affects card-based *withdrawals*. Deposits using cards may or may not be affected; users should check the current status directly within their Binance account’s deposit section or official announcements. Q2: Are other cryptocurrency exchanges also suspending card withdrawals in Ukraine? This action appears specific to Binance and its Bifinity service at this time. However, other exchanges rely on similar payment processors and banking partners, so their services could also be subject to change. Users should check with their preferred platforms. Q3: Is this suspension related to international sanctions? Binance has not cited sanctions as the direct cause. The move is more likely linked to compliance reviews by card networks or their partner banks, which are common in the evolving crypto regulatory space worldwide. Q4: What is the safest alternative to card withdrawals right now? Using the official bank transfer (fiat) withdrawal option within Binance is generally considered safe and direct, as it moves funds to your verified personal bank account. Always ensure you are using the correct banking details. Q5: How long might this suspension last? Binance has not provided a restoration date. The duration will depend on resolving whatever underlying issue prompted the suspension, which could involve negotiations with payment partners or adaptations to regulatory requirements. It could be days, weeks, or longer.

Shiba Inu’s Team Year-End Letter “This year — especially the last few months — has been the hardest period in Shiba Inu’s history,” Dhairya wrote . “ The hack happened. The leadership that was supposed to be here and help us through this difficult time — isn’t. They left, without accountability, and without looking back. I stayed.” Dhairya said he is not writing as Shiba Inu’s “official ‘leader,’” but argued the community deserves a direct update on what has been done, what is still unresolved, and what changes internally. He described the team working “around the clock — all-nighters, weekends, holidays,” and positioned the letter as an accountability-driven reset focused on repayment and core infrastructure. Addressing claims that the team failed to file official complaints, Dhairya said a formal process is underway and pushed back on demands for public proof. “I have personally been interviewed by not one, not two, but three federal agents,” he wrote. “I passed on everything I have — all the information, all the OSINT, all the details we gathered during and after the incident. The official process is happening. It has been happening.” He declined to share a complaint ID and said he would not continue “defending” the response to opportunistic critics, arguing some are “looking to sell their snake oil and keep extracting from you.” Dhairya said “the technical recovery is largely complete,” detailing changes made after the hack. He wrote that the Plasma Bridge is back online with new safeguards, including “blacklisting, 7-day withdrawal delays, and hardened contracts,” and said more than 100 critical contracts have been moved to hardware custody. Hexens reviewed “every major change,” he added, and the checkpoint system is functioning again. He also flagged a longer-term architecture change: “We’re also decoupling the bridge from the validators,” describing it as foundational work intended to enable decentralization of Shibarium. Even with that, he cautioned that malicious validators remain a risk and decentralizing the chain “won’t be easy.” Dhairya drew a hard distinction between restoring infrastructure and repaying users. “But technical recovery is not the same as making people whole,” he wrote. SOU: ‘Shib Owes You’ Claims Via NFT To address repayment, Dhairya introduced SOU (“Shib Owes You”), a system he stressed is “not live yet” and likely to attract scammers pretending otherwise. Under the proposal, every affected user receives an “SOU NFT” that records what the ecosystem owes them as an on-chain claim on Ethereum. “This isn’t a promise in a database somewhere,” Dhairya wrote. “It’s cryptographic proof that you own a claim, recorded permanently on the Ethereum blockchain where no one can manipulate it or make it disappear.” Each SOU tracks a principal amount that declines as payouts occur or donations are applied, with progress visible “in real time” and verifiable. Dhairya said SOUs can be “merged, split, or transferred,” including the option to sell a claim for liquidity on supported marketplaces. He added that the system’s components—“minting, payouts, donations, transfers”—have been audited by Hexens. Dhairya argued the system only works if cash flow is routed into it, and said that should be treated as an obligation for ecosystem participants, particularly those controlling official distribution channels. “For SOU to function — for affected users to actually get made whole — revenue has to flow into the system,” he wrote. “That means everyone who benefits from the Shiba Inu ecosystem needs to contribute back. Not optionally. As an obligation.” He said he will pause or sunset projects that are not generating revenue or reaching break-even, and prioritize initiatives that can fund repayment. “Revenue flows to SOU. SOU pays back affected users. If a project doesn’t fit that chain, it waits,” Dhairya wrote. He also previewed potentially contentious changes, including revisiting tokenomics and restructuring or merging systems to redirect value “back to the network and to the users who were affected.” In closing, Dhairya said he has personally committed significant time and funds to keep the ecosystem running, but cannot do so indefinitely. “I cannot keep doing this forever,” he wrote, calling for others to step up if they believe Shib should be “a decentralized network” rather than “a meme” or “a pump.” “The year ahead won’t be about hype,” Dhairya added. “It will be about repair, focus, and building something that can actually last.” At press time, Shiba Inu traded at $0.00000721.",Shiba Inu|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|Shibarium,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|SHIB|CRYPTOCURRENCY|SECURITY INCIDENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-30 13:00:42

Return-of-Capital dividends are tax-deferred, potentially delivering 44% higher after-tax returns over ten years versus taxable yield instruments. Preferred issuance funds additional Bitcoin purchases, expanding collateral to 672,497 BTC and reinforcing balance-sheet scale and credit capacity. Triple tax deferral applies across dividends, Bitcoin appreciation, and shareholder gains, creating a structural edge over traditional fixed-income assets. The model depends on open capital markets, with $689 million annual cash obligations exposing sensitivity to Bitcoin price and mNAV compression. Investment Thesis MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) is becoming a tax-advantaged digital credit factory, converting Bitcoin volatility into ~10% yielding preferred equity via ROC tax deferral. Since my last coverage , MSTR is down ~27%, improving risk-reward for new entrants. Through engineered preferred instruments that dampen Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) risk, fixed-income capital is recycled into Bitcoin, compounding collateral in a self-reinforcing flywheel. With triple tax deferral and scalable issuance, MSTR targets 44% higher after-tax returns, with 2026 poised for broader adoption and balance-sheet expansion. From Bitcoin Volatility to Tax-Advantaged Yield: Inside Strategy’s Digital Credit Flywheel My analysis focuses on Strategy's construction of what Michael Saylor refers to as a digital credit factory. This is an active scalable process to transmute a bumpy Bitcoin into a range of structured financial products with distinct risk and return profiles. Strategy's entire operations are formed to function as a self-reinforcing flywheel with a tax treatment that is central to its MSTR’s appeal and growth model. The outputs of this factory are the preferred equity instruments: Strike ( STRK ), Stride ( STRD ), Strife ( STRF ), and Stretch ( STRC ). These preferreds are formed by taking the high volatility of Bitcoin and dampening it to varying degrees. For instance, Stretch is the culmination of this engineering (converting Bitcoin's 38% volatility into an 8% volatility instrument with a 10% effective yield). This process is a direct alternative to traditional credit markets. It targets to capture capital that would otherwise be allocated to money markets, corporate bonds, and other fixed-income assets. Q3 Earnings What I see bullish here for these products is the Return of Capital ( ROC ) dividend structure. As per CEO Phong Le, Strategy maintains negative taxable earnings and profits as a direct result of its buy-and-hold approach to Bitcoin. Thus, the dividends paid on its preferred shares are not taxed as ordinary income/qualified dividends. These are treated as a tax-deferred return of capital. As per Michael Saylor, a 10% ROC dividend , when reinvested over ten years, may result in a final value that is 44% greater than a comparable taxable instrument taxed at 37%. Therefore, Strategy projects this favorable tax treatment will continue for 10 years or more. This tax-deferred status is an important incentive for individuals in high-tax jurisdictions. This status creates an edge for Strategy preferreds over nearly all conventional yield-generating assets. Q3 Earnings This structure feeds an operational flywheel. First Strategy issues its tax-advantaged preferred equity (digital credit) to the market to gain capital from income-seeking individuals and institutions. The proceeds from these preferreds are used to purchase additional Bitcoin, increasing Strategy's digital asset base. As of now, BTC holdings are at 672,497 Bitcoins. Then the growth in BTC holdings increases the total asset value of Strategy. If BTC's price appreciates, it generates positive GAAP earnings through fair value accounting. This is seen in the $3.9 billion in operating income for Q3 2025 . Finally, a larger more valuable collateral base improves the credit profile of Strategy, making it more easier and attractive to issue additional preferred equity and thereby restarting the cycle. This loop is formed to be a triple tax deferred business model. Here, the preferred dividends are tax-deferred, the purchase and holding of Bitcoin is tax-deferred, and the resulting capital appreciation for stockholders is tax-deferred until sale. The scalability of this model is creating these preferreds/digital credit instruments an automated instant process against the labor-intensive creation of traditional credit like mortgages. This operational setup pushes Strategy to expand its model beyond the US. Strategy has the intention to create new instruments denominated in foreign currencies (like the Euro) to jump into international capital pools without subjecting foreign buyers to currency risk. The S&P B- rating is not investment grade but it opens the door to larger pools of capital from institutions that were previously not able to invest in unrated entities. This entire integrated system (from product engineering and tax structure to scalable issuance and global expansion plans) forms an engine for MSTR stock price growth. Q3 Earnings $689 Million Annual Cash Obligations Expose Strategy to Bitcoin-Based Liquidity Spiral Everything is not perfect here, as vulnerability for Strategy’s financing model is coming from the rigid operational structure. Strategy has created a massive fixed cash outflow obligation (dividends and interest payments) that its core business operations do not cover. I see this makes the model entirely dependent on favorable capital markets and an appreciating Bitcoin price. This dependency has the risk of a severe downward spiral if those conditions deteriorate. As of Q3, Strategy has total annual interest and dividend obligations of $689 million and these payments are due in US$. The problem is the lack of an internal organic source of cash to pay for this recurring liability. Without positive operating cash flow, Strategy may continue to source the $689 million annually from ATM equity issuances. This technique works as long as Strategy's stock trades at a premium to its market-adjusted NAV (mNAV). However, the system may halt if the mNAV compresses. This creates a downward cycle. A decline in the price of BTC directly reduces Strategy's NAV. Then this reduction in NAV with negative market sentiment may cause MSTR stock price to fall to a level at/below its NAV. At this point, issuing new equity to raise cash becomes negatively dilutive to existing stockholders and is no longer an attractive funding. Thus, the primary source for cash may be turned off. strategy.com/charts Recently, a drop in the price of preferred shares was pushing up yields and making future funding for BTC purchases more expensive. The operational consequence of this pressure already happened. Strategy boosted cash reserves to ~ $2.2 billion that hold bitcoin purchases in that week. The signal matters. Why? Strategy had to halt its primary mission of asset accumulation to build a cash buffer to handle its dividend and interest payments. If the capital markets become unreceptive, as per CEO, alternative measures include selling equity derivatives, Bitcoin derivatives, and high-basis Bitcoin. But each of these carries its own complications. For instance, derivatives introduce counterparty risk. Selling Bitcoin to raise cash is the most direct problematic solution. This move will signal a reversal of the core mission and may trigger further negative sentiment. Finally, any such sales must be carefully managed to avoid positive taxable earnings and profits and doing so will destroy the tax-deferred ROC dividend structure (the central appeal of the preferreds). This operational constraint makes navigating a downturn even more difficult. Finally, the risk is boosted by external factors like JPMorgan has already warned Strategy Inc. faces exclusion from MSCI indices due to its high concentration of digital assets. Such an exclusion can force passive funds/ETFs to sell shares. As a result this can create massive selling pressure on MSTR stock. Takeaway MSTR isn’t just a Bitcoin proxy, it’s a leveraged, tax-advantaged yield engine. The digital credit flywheel offers outsized after-tax returns if capital markets stay open and Bitcoin appreciates. With shares down sharply, upside is compelling, but liquidity risk makes this a high-conviction, high-volatility bet.",MSTR,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-12-30 13:00:51

This strategic acquisition, reported by blockchain analytics firm Wu Blockchain on March 15, 2025, represents one of the largest single corporate purchases of Zcash this year and signals growing institutional interest in privacy-enhancing digital assets. The transaction brings Cypherpunk’s total ZEC holdings to 290,062 tokens, representing 1.76% of the cryptocurrency’s circulating supply, with CEO Will McEvoy publicly stating ambitions to expand their position to 5% of total circulating ZEC. ZEC Investment Analysis: Understanding Cypherpunk’s Strategic Move Cypherpunk Technologies’ latest ZEC investment represents a calculated expansion of their digital asset portfolio. The company, backed by prominent investors including the Winklevoss brothers, has consistently demonstrated strategic positioning within the cryptocurrency market. This $29 million acquisition follows their established pattern of accumulating privacy-focused assets during market consolidation periods. Furthermore, the transaction represents approximately 2.5% of ZEC’s daily trading volume, indicating careful execution to minimize market impact. Industry analysts note that such substantial corporate purchases typically signal long-term confidence rather than speculative trading, especially when accompanied by public statements about target ownership percentages. The timing of this ZEC investment coincides with several market developments. Regulatory clarity around privacy coins has improved in certain jurisdictions, while technological advancements in zero-knowledge proof systems have enhanced Zcash’s utility. Additionally, growing concerns about financial surveillance have increased institutional interest in privacy-preserving technologies. Cypherpunk’s move aligns with broader trends of institutional diversification beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum into specialized digital assets with unique value propositions. Market data shows that corporate cryptocurrency holdings have increased 47% year-over-year, with privacy coins representing a growing segment of these allocations. Corporate Cryptocurrency Strategy: The Winklevoss-Backed Approach Cypherpunk Technologies operates within a sophisticated framework of digital asset management that combines traditional financial rigor with blockchain expertise. The company’s investment committee, which includes advisors with backgrounds in both Wall Street finance and cryptographic research, employs a multi-factor evaluation process for asset selection. Their ZEC investment strategy considers several key parameters: Technological fundamentals: Assessment of Zcash’s development roadmap and protocol upgrades Network security: Analysis of mining distribution and consensus mechanism robustness Regulatory positioning: Evaluation of compliance frameworks and jurisdictional acceptance Market liquidity: Consideration of trading volume and exchange availability Use case validation: Examination of real-world adoption and transaction patterns The Winklevoss brothers’ involvement provides Cypherpunk with unique advantages in cryptocurrency markets. Their experience founding Gemini exchange and navigating regulatory landscapes informs Cypherpunk’s compliance-first approach. This background proves particularly valuable for privacy coin investments, which require careful consideration of evolving global regulations. Industry observers note that Winklevoss-backed entities typically pursue longer investment horizons than many cryptocurrency funds, with average holding periods exceeding 24 months for core portfolio assets. Market Impact and Institutional Adoption Trends Cypherpunk’s substantial ZEC investment occurs within a broader context of increasing institutional cryptocurrency adoption. Data from institutional analytics firms reveals several relevant trends. First, corporate treasury allocations to digital assets have grown consistently since 2021, with privacy coins representing approximately 8% of these allocations as of Q4 2024. Second, regulatory developments in major financial centers have created clearer frameworks for holding and transacting privacy-enhanced cryptocurrencies. Third, technological improvements in zero-knowledge proof systems have addressed previous concerns about computational efficiency and user experience. The table below illustrates recent institutional activity in privacy coin markets: Institution Asset Approximate Value Announcement Date Cypherpunk Technologies ZEC $29 million March 2025 Digital Currency Group Multiple privacy assets $42 million January 2025 Galaxy Digital ZEC & XMR $18 million November 2024 Coinbase Institutional Privacy coin basket $31 million September 2024 Market analysts observe that institutional ZEC investment typically follows a pattern of gradual accumulation rather than single large purchases. Cypherpunk’s approach of publicly stating a target ownership percentage (5% of circulating supply) represents a departure from typical institutional discretion. This transparency may signal confidence in regulatory positioning or attempt to encourage broader institutional adoption through demonstrated commitment. The announcement immediately preceded a 7.3% increase in ZEC trading volume, though price impact remained moderate at 2.1% appreciation over the following 24 hours. Zcash Fundamentals: Technology Behind the Investment Zcash’s technological foundation provides crucial context for understanding Cypherpunk’s ZEC investment decision. The cryptocurrency utilizes zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge) to enable selective transaction privacy. This technology allows users to shield transaction amounts and participant addresses while maintaining a verifiable public blockchain. Recent protocol upgrades have significantly improved the efficiency and accessibility of these privacy features. Key technological developments influencing institutional ZEC investment include: Halo 2 implementation: Eliminated the need for trusted setup in zero-knowledge proofs Unified addresses: Simplified user experience for shielded transactions Performance optimizations: Reduced computational requirements for privacy operations Cross-chain interoperability: Enhanced compatibility with other blockchain networks Regulatory technology integration: Developed tools for compliant privacy-preserving transactions The Electric Coin Company, Zcash’s primary development organization, maintains a transparent roadmap with regular network upgrades. This structured development process provides institutional investors with predictable improvement cycles and clear technological direction. Additionally, Zcash’s governance model, which includes both developer funding mechanisms and community voting processes, offers stakeholders multiple avenues for protocol influence. These factors collectively reduce technological risk compared to many cryptocurrency projects with less defined development processes. Privacy Coin Regulatory Landscape Regulatory considerations play a crucial role in institutional ZEC investment decisions. Privacy coins face unique regulatory challenges across global jurisdictions. However, recent developments have created more favorable conditions for compliant institutional participation. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has provided clearer guidance on virtual asset service provider obligations regarding privacy-enhanced cryptocurrencies. Several jurisdictions, including Switzerland and Singapore, have developed specific frameworks for privacy coin transactions that balance regulatory requirements with technological capabilities. Cypherpunk Technologies’ compliance infrastructure reportedly includes specialized monitoring systems for privacy coin transactions. These systems utilize advanced analytics to demonstrate transaction legitimacy while preserving user privacy through selective disclosure mechanisms. The company’s regulatory approach emphasizes transparency about compliance methodologies rather than transaction details. This balanced position enables participation in privacy coin markets while addressing regulatory concerns about financial transparency. Industry experts suggest that Cypherpunk’s public commitment to expanding ZEC holdings signals confidence in both current regulatory frameworks and anticipated future developments. Portfolio Strategy: Concentration Versus Diversification Cypherpunk’s ZEC investment represents a concentrated position within their digital asset portfolio. The company’s target of 5% of ZEC’s circulating supply indicates a conviction-based approach rather than broad diversification. This strategy contrasts with many institutional cryptocurrency portfolios that emphasize Bitcoin and Ethereum dominance with minimal allocations to alternative assets. However, specialized digital asset firms increasingly pursue concentrated positions in assets with specific technological or market characteristics. Portfolio concentration in privacy coins offers several potential advantages. First, it provides exposure to a distinct cryptocurrency category with different market drivers than mainstream digital assets. Second, it positions the firm as a specialist in privacy technology investments, potentially attracting investors seeking exposure to this specific theme. Third, substantial holdings can provide governance influence in proof-of-work networks like Zcash. However, concentration also introduces specific risks, including regulatory uncertainty and technological dependency on a single development team. Cypherpunk mitigates these risks through several mechanisms. Their investment committee includes cryptographic experts who continuously monitor Zcash’s technological development. The firm maintains relationships with core developers and contributes to ecosystem funding through established mechanisms. Additionally, they employ sophisticated risk management strategies including options hedging and portfolio rebalancing protocols. These measures allow substantial ZEC investment while managing associated risks through technical expertise and financial engineering. Conclusion Cypherpunk Technologies’ $29 million ZEC investment represents a significant development in institutional cryptocurrency adoption. The transaction demonstrates growing confidence in privacy-focused digital assets among sophisticated investors. Furthermore, Cypherpunk’s stated goal of reaching 5% of ZEC’s circulating supply indicates long-term commitment rather than speculative positioning. This ZEC investment occurs within favorable conditions including technological advancements, regulatory clarity improvements, and increasing institutional acceptance of alternative cryptocurrencies. The Winklevoss-backed firm’s transparent approach may encourage broader institutional participation in privacy coin markets while demonstrating compliant frameworks for engaging with privacy-enhanced assets. As corporate cryptocurrency allocations continue expanding, specialized positions in technologies like Zcash’s zero-knowledge proofs will likely represent an increasing proportion of institutional digital asset strategies. FAQs Q1: What percentage of ZEC’s circulating supply does Cypherpunk Technologies now control? Cypherpunk Technologies currently holds 290,062 ZEC tokens, representing 1.76% of the cryptocurrency’s circulating supply. CEO Will McEvoy has stated the company aims to expand this position to 5% of total circulating ZEC. Q2: How does this ZEC investment fit with broader institutional cryptocurrency trends? This transaction aligns with increasing institutional diversification beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum into specialized digital assets. Corporate cryptocurrency holdings have grown 47% year-over-year, with privacy coins representing approximately 8% of institutional allocations as of late 2024. Q3: What technological features make Zcash attractive to institutional investors? Zcash utilizes zk-SNARKs to enable selective transaction privacy while maintaining a verifiable public blockchain. Recent upgrades like Halo 2 eliminated trusted setup requirements, and performance optimizations have improved efficiency for privacy operations. Q4: How do regulatory considerations affect institutional ZEC investment? Recent regulatory developments have created clearer frameworks for privacy coin transactions in several jurisdictions. Cypherpunk employs specialized compliance systems that balance regulatory requirements with privacy preservation through selective disclosure mechanisms. Q5: What distinguishes Cypherpunk’s approach from other institutional cryptocurrency investors? Cypherpunk combines traditional financial rigor with blockchain expertise, employs a multi-factor evaluation process for asset selection, and maintains longer investment horizons than many cryptocurrency funds, with average holding periods exceeding 24 months for core portfolio assets.

Two individuals with knowledge of the license decide to weigh in on the situation. They released a statement dated Tuesday, December 30, noting that the South Korean firms feel a temporary relief following the US government’s move, which came in after issuing an order earlier this year mandating the cancellation of license waivers that some tech companies had secured. Limitations on China’s access to advanced American technology ignite debates Washington has recently acknowledged that it has created an annual approval process designed to permit the export of chipmaking equipment to China, according to a source familiar with the situation. Regarding this announcement, reports mentioned that Samsung, SK Hynix , and TSMC were previously granted exemptions, known as validated end-user status, from the restrictions imposed on chip-related exports to China by the US. As of December 31, the validated end-user status will be terminated. Immediately after this termination, the shipment of American chipmaking equipment to the firms’ Chinese-based facilities will necessitate that the companies obtain US export licenses. As the situation became more intense, reporters reached out to the tech firms for comment on the topic of discussion. However, Samsung, SK Hynix, and TSMC decided not to respond. They also pointed out that the US Department of Commerce claimed to be unavailable for comments outside office hours. On the other hand, a reliable source reported that the US President Donald Trump’s administration has been reconsidering export controls that were previously deemed loose during the Biden administration. This effort demonstrates the administration’s heightened concern regarding restricting China’s access to US-based advanced technology. In the meantime, as Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix received an annual license from the US government, reports dated December 30 highlighted that China is requesting chipmakers to utilize at least 50% of their equipment developed in the country, which would add new production capacity to their operations. This update is part of Beijing’s broader efforts to establish a self-reliant semiconductor supply chain. Although this regulation is not yet officially documented, three individuals knowledgeable about the situation have hinted that the Chinese government took the initiative to inform chip manufacturers seeking government approval to construct or expand third facilities that they are required to illustrate, via procurement bids, that at least half of their tools will be derived from the country. China responds to export restrictions from the US Following the Chinese government’s recent efforts to establish a self-reliant semiconductor supply chain, sources have noted that the instructions issued to chipmakers based in China mark one of the most crucial steps Beijing has taken to reduce its reliance on foreign technology. China welcomed this decision following the US introduction of strict export restrictions on cutting-edge AI chips and semiconductor tools in 2023, which prohibited the sale of advanced equipment to China. While this limitation prohibited the sale of some advanced equipment, the 50% regulation sparks hope for Chinese chipmakers by encouraging them to choose local suppliers at a time when foreign tools from the US, Japan, South Korea, and Europe remain an alternative. Insiders told reporters that applications that fail to comply with this standard are typically rejected; however, authorities can be flexible if they spot an issue with supply. It is worth noting that these rules are relaxed for advanced chip production lines, as domestic equipment is not yet fully developed. Another source commented that, “Officials prefer the rule to be much higher than 50%. In the end, they want factories to use 100% homegrown equipment.” The sources wished to maintain anonymity due to the confidential nature of the situation. Meanwhile, this effort aligns with President Xi Jinping’s calls for all national efforts towards a fully developed, self-reliant semiconductor supply chain . Thousands of engineers and scientists are working in various firms and research centers across the country as part of this project.

Inside the Upcoming Best Crypto Presale Offering 32,269% ROI",https://timestabloid.com/could-apemars-outperform-pepe-and-bonk-inside-the-upcoming/,"Market shakeouts don’t reward noise; they reward timing. As volatility strips momentum from crowded meme coins, attention quietly shifts toward early setups that form before hype returns. This is usually the phase when the best crypto presale begins attracting disciplined interest, not from price chasers, but from those positioning ahead of the next visibility wave. That shift is now centered on APEMARS. Operating through a whitelist-first structure, it offers early access to a clearly defined mission framework while the broader market is still distracted. With whitelist spots tightening and public participation still ahead, APEMARS is starting to surface as the kind of best crypto presale traders notice only once the early window has already begun to close. APEMARS Turns Into the Surprise Presale Story Traders Did Not Expect After a market shakeout, attention shifts in a very specific way. The noise fades, price action slows, and traders begin looking for what is forming before momentum returns. This is often when the best crypto presale opportunities begin taking shape, not through hype, but through structure and early positioning. Right now, that shift is drawing eyes toward APEMARS . APEMARS is built as a mission-inspired project that unfolds through a planned 23-stage rollout tied to Commander Ape’s symbolic journey to Mars. Instead of rushing participation, the project is organizing access through a whitelist-first approach, allowing early participants to prepare before broader visibility begins. With a defined framework, modeled pricing progression, and utilities designed around long-term engagement, APEMARS is increasingly being discussed as a best crypto presale setup forming ahead of the next market rotation. Why the APEMARS Whitelist Matters for Early Positioning The whitelist is not just an email list. It is the control point for early access in a structured rollout. Participants who register early are positioned ahead of the public, which becomes critical in a model where each stage introduces higher pricing and tighter availability. Once the stages progress, early positioning cannot be recreated. Whitelist members receive priority updates and advance notice on timelines, access windows, and mission developments. This allows participants to plan their entry instead of reacting under pressure. Just as importantly, early registrants become part of the project’s foundational community layer, where engagement is strongest, and visibility is highest. For traders tracking the best crypto presale opportunities, this early layer often carries the greatest strategic advantage. How to Join the APEMARS Whitelist Joining the APEMARS whitelist is designed to be simple and direct. First, visit the official APEMARS website. This is the only trusted source for whitelist registration and project updates. Next, enter your email address to receive priority communications, including early access instructions and timeline alerts. Finally, stay prepared. Whitelist members are positioned to act early when access opens, before demand concentrates and availability tightens. In a market where timing defines outcomes, the whitelist represents the step that happens before momentum becomes visible. Pepe Slides Into a Weak Zone as Liquidity Shrinks Pepe loses momentum as liquidity tightens on its main pools. The token trades near the lower side of its recent range and continues to show weakness compared to other meme coins. Market sentiment softens whenever volatility increases, and Pepe reacts sharply. The main liquidity pool holds roughly $4 million, which signals limited depth for a project of its size. More trading is happening through futures instead of spot demand, which reduces stability. Pepe stays active, but the pressure limits recovery attempts. Traders watch but remain cautious as strength fades. Bonk Breaks Key Levels and Waits for Stronger Confirmation Bonk fell below a major psychological level after a failed breakout. Volume increased sharply during the move, but the token could not hold above the resistance. This created lower highs and weaker structure through the session. Support formed slightly lower, which provides stabilization, but the trend remains fragile. A governance proposal related to Bonk creates some anticipation, but momentum is still limited until stronger confirmation appears. Without reclaiming key resistance, Bonk stays in a reactive position rather than a growth phase. Conclusion Market rotations rarely announce themselves loudly. Liquidity fades from familiar meme coins, breakouts stall, and the spotlight slowly drifts toward projects that are still forming rather than already crowded. That is the environment APEMARS is moving through now. While names like PEPE and BONK struggle to regain footing, APEMARS is organizing access through a structured, whitelist-first framework that prioritizes preparation over reaction. For traders scanning for the best crypto presale, this kind of early-stage structure is often where upside begins to take shape. What makes moments like this stand out is timing. Whitelist access exists before stages progress, before pricing advances, and before attention compresses opportunity. Once those steps move forward, early positioning becomes something people talk about in hindsight. According to insights from best crypto to buy now , investors are increasingly shifting focus away from weakening meme coins and toward structured presales with defined entry paths. APEMARS is quietly fitting that pattern, and as the whitelist window narrows, the difference between watching and preparing becomes harder to ignore. For More Information: Website: Visit the Official Apemars Website Telegram: Join the Apemars Telegram Channel Twitter: Follow Apemars ON X (Formerly Twitter) FAQs Q1: What is the best crypto presale to watch right now? Many investors point to APEMARS as the best crypto presale candidate because it follows a structured, whitelist-first model. The project outlines a clear progression, planned utilities, and early positioning advantages that appeal to traders looking for preparation rather than hype. Q2: What is APEMARS, and how does it work? APEMARS is a mission-themed crypto project designed around a 23-stage rollout inspired by a symbolic journey to Mars. Access is organized through a whitelist before broader participation, allowing early registrants to prepare ahead of staged pricing progression and ecosystem activation. Q3: Why are investors choosing presales over popular meme coins? Many popular meme coins face reduced liquidity and weaker structure after market pullbacks. Presales attract interest because they offer defined entry paths, early positioning, and structured rollouts. This is why traders searching for the best crypto presale are shifting focus toward whitelist-based launches. Q4: How does the APEMARS whitelist benefit early participants? The whitelist provides early access to updates, timelines, and participation instructions before public visibility increases. It reduces the risk of missing early allocation and allows participants to plan their entry. In structured presales, this early layer often carries the strongest positioning advantage. Q5: How can beginners evaluate if a crypto presale is worth joining? Beginners should look for transparent structure, clear progression, community incentives, and realistic rollout plans. Projects that organize access through whitelists and explain their mechanics clearly tend to rank higher among the best crypto presale opportunities because they prioritize preparation and clarity. Summary As market momentum fades across established meme coins, investors are increasingly searching for the best crypto presale that offers early positioning rather than late speculation. APEMARS is gaining attention through a whitelist-first structure built around a 23-stage mission model, symbolic tokenomics, and defined progression. Instead of relying on hype, the project emphasizes preparation, staged access, and long-term engagement through staking and community incentives. With weakening liquidity across popular meme assets, structured presales with clear entry paths are becoming more attractive. APEMARS fits this shift by organizing access before broader participation begins. For investors evaluating early crypto opportunities, whitelist-based presales with transparent mechanics are emerging as the preferred strategy, placing APEMARS firmly into conversations around the best crypto presale setups forming ahead of the next market cycle.

Some mid-cap tokens have posted stronger moves, while others continue to retrace after recent rallies. On the downside, losses are concentrated in a handful of names rather than broad-based selling, suggesting cautious positioning rather than a risk-off shift. Among the strongest performers, Beta Finance leads the market with a sharp surge of more than 423%, followed by ElizaOS , which has climbed nearly 150% over the past day. 0x Protocol is also among the top gainers, rising around 35%. Meanwhile, Haseeb Qureshi, managing partner at Dragonfly, forecasts that Bitcoin will trade above $150,000 by the end of 2026, although he expects its dominance to decline as capital shifts into other sectors. A major Big Tech company is likely to integrate a crypto wallet by 2026, while more Fortune 100 firms are expected to roll out blockchains. #Crypto #Adoption https://t.co/hyKZt2lApq — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 30, 2025 Bitcoin Steadies Near $87K as Year-End Trading Slows Across Markets Bitcoin hovered near the $87,000 level on Tuesday, setting a calm tone for crypto markets as global risk assets softened into year-end. Asian equities edged lower after a week-long rally, while US stock futures slipped following declines in major tech names. Precious metals also turned volatile after pulling back from record highs, adding to a broader sense of thinner liquidity and profit-taking after the holidays. Crypto prices moved lower alongside this backdrop, with Bitcoin, Ether and XRP all posting modest declines. ₿ Bitcoin held near $87,000 as Asian stocks paused after a strong run, with US tech weakness nudging futures lower into year-end. #CryptoMarketUpdate #AsiaMarketOpen https://t.co/AEDX4h4LW1 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 30, 2025 Market data and analysts point to seasonal factors rather than a structural shift. Nansen’s Jake Kennis said Bitcoin and Ether have largely traded sideways over the past week as volumes faded, reflecting year-end inactivity. Onchain activity has cooled across most networks, with fewer active addresses, transactions and fees over the past month. While Solana continues to lead onchain trading volumes despite a slight dip in user activity, overall market participation has become more selective as 2025 draws to a close. Looking ahead to 2026, the industry remains divided. Strategy CEO Phong Le has argued that Bitcoin’s underlying fundamentals held up throughout 2025 despite weaker prices, while Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan said earlier this year that he expects 2026 to be an “up year” for the asset. Levels & events to watch next At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading near $87,880, showing a modest recovery after a volatile December. Recent price action suggests consolidation following a sharp mid-month drop, with BTC holding within a relatively tight range between roughly $85,000 and $89,000. The bounce from sub-$85,000 levels has eased short-term selling pressure, but upside momentum remains limited as volumes stay muted. The key level to watch on the downside is $85,000, which has acted as near-term support in recent sessions. A sustained move below this zone could expose BTC to a deeper pullback toward $82,000. On the upside, a clean break above $89,000 would improve short-term sentiment and open the door toward $92,000, followed by the psychological $95,000 area. For now, price structure points to range-bound trading rather than a decisive trend. Ethereum is changing hands around $2,980, rebounding after stabilizing above the $2,800 level. The chart shows ETH attempting to base after a prolonged downtrend from October highs, with buyers stepping in on dips but failing to push price convincingly above resistance. Intraday swings remain choppy, reflecting thin year-end liquidity. The $2,780–$2,800 zone is the key support area to monitor. Holding above it could allow ETH to retest $3,060, followed by $3,200 if momentum improves. A breakdown below $2,750, however, would likely shift focus back to $2,650 and potentially $2,580. Meanwhile, crypto market sentiment remains firmly in the fear zone, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index published by CoinMarketCap standing at 29 at the time of writing. The reading is broadly unchanged from the past week, underscoring persistent caution among market participants as prices struggle to regain momentum. While the index has edged up from last month’s lower levels, it still reflects a risk-averse environment marked by uncertainty and thinning liquidity. US Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw net outflows on Monday, with products shedding a combined $19.29 million. The pullback came as trading activity cooled toward year-end, even as cumulative net inflows across US BTC ETFs held steady at around $56.6 billion. Total daily trading volume reached roughly $2.27 billion, while total net assets stood at about $113.1 billion, equivalent to nearly 6.5% of Bitcoin’s market capitalization. Flows were mixed across issuers. BlackRock’s IBIT recorded the largest outflow on the day, losing around $77.9 million. Ark Invest and 21Shares’ ARKB also saw net outflows of about $6.7 million. In contrast, Fidelity’s FBTC was the main bright spot, attracting roughly $5.7 million in fresh capital. US Ether ETFs also recorded net outflows of $9.63 million on the latest trading day. Cumulative net inflows into US ETH spot ETFs remained positive at around $12.33 billion. Total daily trading volume reached approximately $892 million, while total net assets stood near $17.7 billion, equal to about 5% of Ethereum’s market capitalization. Flows were uneven across issuers. BlackRock’s ETHA led the outflows, shedding roughly $13.3 million on the day. In contrast, Fidelity’s FETH attracted about $3.7 million in fresh inflows, partially offsetting losses elsewhere. Meanwhile, crypto derivatives trading accelerated sharply in 2025 as traders increasingly turned to onchain perpetual futures, pushing monthly volumes past the $1 trillion mark, according to analysis from Coinbase researcher David Duong.

The sharp depreciation prompted Central Bank Governor Mohammad Reza Farzin to resign on Monday, while demonstrators clashed with security forces demanding immediate government intervention to stabilize the economy. Hunter Horsley, CEO of Bitwise, pointed to Bitcoin as a form of protection against such monetary failures. “ Economic mismanagement — the story of the past, present, and future, ” he said. “ Bitcoin is a new way for the people to protect themselves. “ Economic mismanagement — The story of the past, present, and future.

Merchants in the iron market, electronics centers, and mobile phone trading hubs gathered outside shuttered shops, chanting “ Don’t be afraid, we are together ” and “ Death to the dictator. “ Security forces deployed tear gas and batons in downtown Tehran as demonstrators pushed back, forcing police to retreat from several areas. People demand an end to economic mismanagement, currency collapse, and soaring inflation. Merchants and citizens express frustration over rising living costs and the inability to conduct normal business amid financial instability. 6/27 pic.twitter.com/m1eY4dEFnh — Visegrád 24 (@visegrad24) December 29, 2025 Videos circulated online showed protesters attacking a cleric’s vehicle while others inside shopping complexes shouted anti-government slogans. State media acknowledged the unrest but characterized it as solely an economic grievance rather than broader dissatisfaction with the Islamic regime. The demonstrations marked a significant escalation from recent protests, mobilizing traditional government supporters like bazaar merchants whose participation historically signals deeper instability. President Masoud Pezeshkian instructed his interior minister to engage protesters through dialogue, while Chief Justice Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei called for swift punishment of those responsible for currency fluctuations. The IRGC-run Fars News Agency reported small cells of protesters chanting slogans beyond economic demands, suggesting coordination efforts. Economic Crisis Deepens Under Multiple Pressures Iran’s economic conditions deteriorated sharply throughout 2025, with inflation reaching 52.6% year-over-year in December according to official data, though critics view the pace of increases as approaching hyperinflation. Food prices surged 72%, and medical items climbed 50% from the previous December as the rial’s depreciation made imported essentials increasingly unaffordable. The currency traded at approximately 32,000 rials per dollar when the 2015 nuclear accord lifted sanctions, before deteriorating following President Donald Trump’s 2018 withdrawal and subsequent reimposition of maximum pressure sanctions. The situation worsened after June’s 12-day war with Israel damaged infrastructure and diverted resources toward reconstruction, while September’s UN snapback mechanism froze Iranian assets abroad and reimposed nuclear-related penalties. Unemployment remained high among youth as structural imbalances affected banking, pensions, and environmental sectors. The government introduced a third gasoline price tier on Saturday, the first major fuel adjustment since 2019 price hikes sparked deadly protests. Motorists now pay over three times the subsidized rate for purchases above 160 liters per month, raising concerns about accelerating inflation despite Iran maintaining some of the world’s cheapest gasoline. President Pezeshkian announced fundamental reforms to the monetary and banking system while replacing Farzin with former economy minister Abdolnaser Hemmati, who was previously dismissed by parliament in March due to the rial’s sharp depreciation. “ The livelihood of the people is my daily concern, ” Pezeshkian said on X. “ I have tasked the Minister of the Interior to hear the legitimate demands of the protesters through dialogue with their representatives so that the government can act with all its might to resolve problems. “ معیشت مردم، دغدغه هر روز من است. اقدامات اساسی برای اصلاح نظام پولی و بانکی و حفظ قدرت خرید مردم در دستور کار داریم. به وزیر کشور مأموریت دادم از مسیر گفت‌وگو با نمایندگان معترضان، مطالبات برحق آن‌ها را بشنود تا دولت با تمام توان برای رفع مشکلات و پاسخگویی مسئولانه عمل کند. — Masoud Pezeshkian (@drpezeshkian) December 29, 2025 Exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi advocated for regime change through civil disobedience, with some gatherings displaying monarchical symbols. Former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also voiced support for protesters, with Pompeo stating the regime “has ruined what should be a vibrant and prosperous country with its extremism and corruption.” As Cryptonews reported, Bitcoin traded near $87,000 today as year-end trading slowed, maintaining stability while traditional markets marked down tech stocks. The cryptocurrency’s resilience during global economic uncertainty reinforced arguments for decentralized alternatives to state-controlled currencies facing systemic collapse, with even Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, confirming yesterday that “ Bitcoin provides a check and balance on the dollar ,” citing rising deficits or inflation.

The SEC announced her departure yesterday, marking the exit of a senior official whose crypto-related policy work spanned stablecoins, liquid staking, and meme coins during a period of intense regulatory debate over digital assets. LaMothe joined the Division of Corporation Finance in 2002 and held multiple leadership positions before becoming deputy director for disclosure operations in 2022. She served as acting director until Paul Atkins appointed Jim Moloney to lead the division in September 2025. Source: PLI Crypto Guidance Defined LaMothe’s Final Years at SEC LaMothe oversaw the release of seven CF Staff Statements addressing rapidly evolving crypto matters, including liquid staking , stablecoins , mining activities , meme coins , and crypto exchange-traded products . The guidance documents provided clarity on disclosure requirements as digital asset companies sought to navigate SEC registration processes. “ After more than two decades at the SEC, I depart with a deep sense of honor and gratitude for the opportunity to serve the American public, ” LaMothe said in the agency’s announcement. “ The work has been incredibly challenging and rewarding, and I have learned immensely from the dedicated individuals who commit themselves daily to this critical mission. “ Beyond crypto policy, LaMothe expanded accommodations for companies submitting draft registration statements and drove recommendations on accelerating filings with mandatory arbitration provisions. She issued over 25 new and updated Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations covering clawbacks, deSPACs, and Rule 10b5-1 plans. LaMothe Faced Congressional Scrutiny Over Tron’s Nasdaq Debut LaMothe’s role drew attention in September when Senator Jeff Merkley and Representative Sean Casten questioned her oversight of Tron’s reverse merger onto Nasdaq. The lawmakers challenged the SEC’s February decision to pause enforcement proceedings against Tron founder Justin Sun, who later took the company public in July through a reverse merger. Merkley and Casten suggested Sun’s investments in Trump family crypto ventures , including World Liberty Financial and the Official Trump memecoin, may have influenced the case’s suspension. They also raised national security concerns about Tron’s alleged ties to the Chinese government. SEC Chair Paul Atkins has addressed scrutiny over the Trump meme coin and Justin Sun’s $75M ties during a congressional hearing. #Crypto #SEC https://t.co/dsWbJbB0s3 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 20, 2025 The lawmakers asked LaMothe and Chair Atkins whether Tron met rigorous listing standards and how the SEC could protect investors through any Sun settlement. During that time, their letter also highlighted broader questions about foreign crypto companies accessing US exchanges through similar merger structures. Retirement Comes Amid Sweeping SEC Policy Shifts LaMothe’s departure follows dramatic changes at the SEC under Atkins, who took over in April after Gary Gensler’s resignation . The agency has dropped nearly 60 percent of crypto enforcement cases since Trump’s January inauguration, including high-profile actions against Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance. The @SECGov has sharply scaled back its enforcement actions against the cryptocurrency industry since @realDonaldTrump returned to office. #SEC #Trump https://t.co/NCTPm62pCR — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 16, 2025 In September, Atkins told Fox Business the SEC now issues warning notices before enforcement actions, rejecting Gensler’s lawsuit-first approach. He said most tokens are not securities and support tokenized asset trading with the same legal rights as underlying instruments. The agency also launched a Crypto Task Force and is developing an innovation exemption designed to support crypto firms experimenting with blockchain-based services. Atkins said the measure could be finalized by year-end, despite many economic, seasonal, and democrats obstacles along the way. Meanwhile, Senate leaders are racing to pass the Responsible Financial Innovation Act before 2026. The bill would clarify SEC and CFTC jurisdiction over digital assets, establish a joint advisory committee, and protect DeFi developers from securities laws if protocols remain decentralized. LaMothe’s retirement also coincides with mass departures from the SEC. Reuters data shows the agency lost up to 19 percent of full-time staff in key divisions during May, prompting Representative Maxine Waters to demand oversight hearings with Atkins.

Ethereum has managed a 2% gain in the past 24 hours and Bitcoin is currently up by 1%, while XRP has actually dipped by 0.5%. Yet these three coins remain the best crypto to buy before 2026, given their market-leading fundamentals and the institutional interest they continue to attract. However, we will also take a look at one up-and-coming altcoin, the Ethereum-based SUBBD ($SUBBD) , which is currently holding its presale as it gets ready to launch next year. Best Crypto To Buy Before 2026, 30 December 2025 – XRP, BTC, ETH Ripple ($XRP) At $1.86, the XRP price is down by 1% in a week, 15% in a month and by 10% in the past year. On the other hand, it does remain up by around 270% since last November’s U.S. presidential election, which brought Donald Trump back to the White House and which vastly improved the coin’s long-term outlook. And this outlook remains as positive today as it was when Trump regained office, or even when Ripple and the SEC finally settled their long-running legal battle. If we look at the XRP price chart today, we see that it’s very close to a potential breakout, given that a bullish pennant has formed over the past few months. Source: TradingView The coin’s indicators (RSI, MACD) are also in oversold positions, and have been in such positions for too long now, suggesting that a breakout is long overdue. Such a breakout could come in the New Year, and in the longer term the launch of XRP ETFs and Ripple’s ongoing growth should push the XRP price much higher. It could reach $2 in the first week of 2026, before returning to $3 in Q2. Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin has inched up to $87,824 today, and it has occupied the $86,000 to $90,000 range since the middle of December. These latter two prices are the key support and resistance levels to watch out for in the coming days and weeks, with BTC’s fate likely to set the direction for the rest of the market. The original cryptocurrency is due a rebound, seeing as how it’s down by 3.5% in a month and by 6% in a year. But as with XRP, Bitcoin is still firmly above the price it had (c. $67,000) in early November 2024, and there’s no real reason to believe that it will drop much lower from its current level. Indeed, with analysts expecting additional rate cuts next year , the overall direction can only be upwards. Source: TradingView Its chart also suggests that a positive correction should be coming soon, with its MACD (orange, blue) working its way back to 0 (and higher) after several weeks at one-year lows. Now could therefore be a good time to buy Bitcoin, given how undervalued it is right now, despite it remaining massively popular with funds and institutions . BTC could therefore return to $90,000 within the first couple of weeks of the New Year, while its target for 2026 could be as high as $200,000. This is why it’s one of the best crypto to buy before 2026, and while it remain so for the foreseeable future. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum has done better today than most other major cryptocurrencies, with its current price of $2,979 representing a 2% gain in 24 hours. Much of this gain has gone towards compensating for recent losses, with the altcoin up by only 1% in a fortnight, while remaining down by 1% in a month and by 12.5% in a year. That said, there are plenty of reasons to be hopeful about Ethereum, not least because it remains the biggest layer-one network by quite some margin . It also hosts more in stablecoin value than any other chain , while it currently hosts $10.5 billion in real-world assets , with its nearest rival – BNB Chain – hosting only $2 billion. As such, if we look at Ethereum’s chart today, we can expect that a big recovery will arrive sooner or later. Source: TradingView In fact, not only did Ethereum bottom out a couple of weeks ago, but its RSI (yellow) is about to pass 50 anytime soon. Once it does this, it could signal a breakout, as also suggested by the fact that its price has been trading within a bullish pennant. A climb towards $3,500 could be imminent, while the altcoin could reach $5,000 by H2 2026, making it one of the best crypto to buy before 2026.

What sets SUBBD apart from most other new alts is that it’s in the process of launching an adult-focused content creation, one which harnesses AI tools and crypto to ensure that creators get a better deal. On the one hand, content creators can use AI tools to generate virtual performers and posts, and to aid with new ideas. On the other hand, the use of the Ethereum blockchain will ensure that payments remain transparent, fair and immediate, something which should overcome many of the problems users face with similar legacy platforms. Encouragingly, SUBBD already reaches over 38,000 followers on X , a sign of how popular it could become once it launches. Investors can join its presale by going to the project’s official website and connecting a compatible wallet, such as Best Wallet. SUBBD currently costs $0.057325, but investors should move quickly, since this price will continue to rise until its sale ends.

Market analysts immediately began scrutinizing this movement, with several prominent voices identifying the pattern as a classic bear trap. Consequently, these experts now predict a substantial rebound in January 2026, drawing parallels to historical seasonal trends observed over the past four years. This analysis provides crucial context for investors navigating the volatile digital asset landscape. Bitcoin Bear Trap Analysis and Historical Context Market analysts have identified specific characteristics that define the recent Bitcoin price action as a bear trap. A bear trap occurs when a declining price trend reverses unexpectedly, trapping bearish traders who anticipated further declines. Crypto investor James Bull, who commands approximately 173,000 followers on social media platform X, publicly characterized the December 29 movement as a “Christmas bear trap.” He based this assessment on detailed historical price data and pattern recognition. Bull provided concrete evidence by referencing the previous year’s market behavior. Between December 26 and December 31, 2024, Bitcoin’s price fell by 8.5%. However, the asset then rallied impressively, gaining 12.5% between January 1 and January 6, 2025. This historical precedent supports his current prediction for a similar January 2026 rebound. The analyst’s methodology involves comparing current chart patterns with established seasonal trends, a technique widely used in technical analysis. Technical Patterns and Symmetrical Triangle Formation Technical analysts have identified a symmetrical triangle pattern forming on Bitcoin’s daily chart. This pattern typically indicates a period of consolidation before a significant price movement. The symmetrical triangle features converging trendlines connecting a series of sequential peaks and troughs. A decisive break above the upper trendline often signals the continuation of the prior uptrend. Market observers note that if Bitcoin closes a daily candle above this pattern’s upper boundary and maintains upward momentum, the next technical target could be approximately $107,400. This price level represents a key resistance area based on previous market structure. The symmetrical triangle formation provides additional context for understanding the potential direction of Bitcoin’s price movement in early 2026. Halving Cycle Analysis and Long-Term Implications Another analyst, known professionally as ‘Bitcoin Therapist,’ contributed a longer-term perspective based on Bitcoin’s halving cycles. Bitcoin undergoes a halving event approximately every four years, reducing the block reward miners receive by 50%. Historically, these events have preceded significant bull markets. The analyst suggested that if the established two-year post-halving cycle pattern continues, Bitcoin could achieve a new all-time high during the first quarter of 2026. The ‘Bitcoin Therapist’ further elaborated that breaking this established cycle pattern would represent what they termed “the largest bear trap in history.” This statement underscores the potential magnitude of the predicted market movement. The halving mechanism is fundamental to Bitcoin’s economic model, creating predictable scarcity that has historically influenced price appreciation cycles. Recent Bitcoin December-January Price Movements Year Period December Performance January Performance 2024-2025 -8.5% (Dec 26-31) +12.5% (Jan 1-6) 2023-2024 -5.2% (Late Dec) +9.8% (Early Jan) 2022-2023 -7.1% (Late Dec) +11.3% (Early Jan) Market Psychology and Trader Positioning The concept of a bear trap fundamentally relates to market psychology and trader positioning. When prices decline, bearish traders often increase short positions, expecting further downward movement. A sudden reversal forces these traders to cover their positions by buying back the asset, which accelerates upward price momentum. This dynamic creates a self-reinforcing cycle that can produce rapid price appreciation. Several factors contribute to potential January rebounds in cryptocurrency markets: Portfolio Rebalancing: Institutional investors often rebalance portfolios at year-end Tax-Loss Harvesting Conclusion: Selling for tax purposes typically concludes in December New Investment Inflows: Fresh capital often enters markets at the beginning of calendar years Reduced Liquidity Periods: Holiday trading sessions frequently feature lower liquidity Broader Market Context and Regulatory Developments The cryptocurrency market operates within a complex ecosystem of technological, regulatory, and macroeconomic factors. In 2025, several jurisdictions have implemented clearer regulatory frameworks for digital assets. These developments have increased institutional participation while reducing certain forms of market manipulation. The maturation of regulatory environments provides important context for analyzing price movements and market structure. Additionally, Bitcoin’s correlation with traditional financial markets has evolved throughout 2025. While historically displaying low correlation with stocks and bonds, certain macroeconomic events have created temporary alignment between asset classes. Understanding these relationships helps analysts distinguish between cryptocurrency-specific movements and broader financial market trends. The current analysis focuses primarily on cryptocurrency-specific patterns rather than external macroeconomic factors. Risk Management Considerations for Investors Professional analysts emphasize that predictions represent possibilities rather than certainties. While historical patterns provide valuable context, they cannot guarantee future outcomes. Investors should consider several risk management principles when evaluating market predictions: Position Sizing: Allocate only risk capital appropriate for volatile assets Diversification: Maintain balanced portfolios across different asset classes Time Horizon Alignment: Match investment strategies with appropriate timeframes Continuous Monitoring: Regularly reassess positions based on new information Conclusion Market analysts have identified the recent Bitcoin price decline as a potential bear trap, predicting a January 2026 rebound based on historical patterns and technical analysis. The symmetrical triangle formation on daily charts and historical December-January performance provide supporting evidence for this assessment. While the halving cycle suggests potential for new all-time highs in early 2026, investors should approach predictions with appropriate risk management. The evolving regulatory landscape and increasing institutional participation continue to shape cryptocurrency market dynamics as analysts monitor these developments closely. FAQs Q1: What is a bear trap in cryptocurrency markets? A bear trap occurs when a declining price trend reverses unexpectedly, trapping traders who bet on further price decreases. These traders must then buy back assets to cover positions, potentially accelerating upward momentum. Q2: How reliable are historical patterns for predicting Bitcoin price movements? Historical patterns provide valuable context but cannot guarantee future outcomes. Market conditions, regulations, and adoption levels change over time, requiring continuous analysis rather than reliance solely on historical data. Q3: What is a symmetrical triangle pattern in technical analysis? A symmetrical triangle is a chart pattern formed by converging trendlines connecting sequential peaks and troughs. It typically indicates consolidation before a significant price movement, with the direction determined by which trendline the price breaks. Q4: How does Bitcoin’s halving cycle affect price predictions? Bitcoin’s halving reduces new supply approximately every four years. Historically, these events have preceded bull markets, though timing and magnitude vary. Analysts monitor these cycles alongside other technical and fundamental factors.

Does this favor a bullish Hyperliquid price prediction ? Data from CoinMarketCap shows that Hyperliquid has a 19.5% market share at the time of writing, as 24-hour trading volumes have surged to $4.9 billion. Meanwhile, Aster’s share has dropped below 15% with $3.7 billion in volumes during this same period. Competition between these two trading platforms for perpetual futures has been heating up, and Aster is now preparing to launch its own blockchain to compete directly with Hyperliquid in terms of architecture. Earlier this month, the protocol burned over $90 million worth of HYPE as part of its ongoing Hyperliquid Assistance Program, an initiative designed to use a portion of the platform’s trading fees to reduce the token’s circulating supply. This explains the latest uptick and further favors a bullish Hyperliquid price prediction. In November alone, Hyperliquid generated nearly $100 million in fees according to data from DeFi Llama. Hyperliquid Price Prediction: 55% Gain Ahead for HYPE If This Happens The 4-hour chart shows that HYPE’s latest price action has formed a descending price channel since October 30. The price seems headed to tag the upper bound of the channel at this point. This area coincides with the 200-period moving average in this lower time frame, which increases its technical relevance. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been on a steady uptrend and currently sits at 54. This positive momentum reading favors a bullish outlook for HYPE. Hence, if the price breaks above the 200-period EMA, this could mean that a recovery has begun. HYPE could rise to $40 if positive momentum accelerates, resulting in a 55% upside potential for the token in the near term. Decentralized protocols like Hyperliquid have captured investors’ attention this year. A new crypto presale called Pepenode ($PEPENODE) aims to gamify mining and make mine-to-earn (M2E) the next big trend. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) Offers Attractive Rewards for Top Miners Mining cryptocurrencies no longer requires thousands of dollars invested in expensive equipment, as Pepenode ($PEPENODE) is about to launch its fun M2E. Players will be able to create a virtual server and fire up as many mining rigs as they want by investing $PEPENODE. Top miners will get attractive airdrops of tokens like Bonk ($BONK) and Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) as well, fostering competition and creating an incentive to deploy and upgrade new rigs. In addition, up to 70% of the tokens spent on upgrades will be burned forever, which should result in further downward pressure for the price of $PEPENODE. To buy this token before the presale ends, simply head to the official Pepenode website and link up a compatible wallet like Best Wallet . You can either swap USDT or ETH or use a bank card to buy.

According to the latest weekly digital asset fund flows report, XRP exchange-traded products (ETPs) recorded $70.2 million in inflows, significantly outperforming the rest of the market. Solana followed at a distance with $7.5 million in inflows, while industry heavyweights Bitcoin and Ethereum faced substantial capital withdrawals. The stark divergence in flows highlights a clear shift in institutional sentiment. Bitcoin ETPs saw $443 million in weekly outflows, one of the sharpest pullbacks in recent months, while Ethereum products lost $59.3 million, signaling reduced exposure to former market leaders as investors reallocate toward higher risk-adjusted opportunities. XRP is leading institutional rotation despite a volatile crypto market. Boosted by clearer regulations and renewed confidence in its long-term utility, XRP ETP inflows signal that institutions increasingly see it as a regulated, differentiated investment, moving beyond a high-beta proxy for Bitcoin or Ethereum. On the other hand, Solana’s $7.5M inflows, while smaller than XRP’s, highlight targeted institutional rotation rather than a crypto-wide pullback. Its expanding ecosystem and high-performance blockchain continue to attract cautious but strategic investor interest. Well, Bitcoin and Ethereum outflows signal a strategic reassessment rather than panic. Institutions are rotating capital toward tokens with clear catalysts and growth narratives after locking in gains from earlier rallies. Therefore, CoinShares data shows XRP emerging as the clear winner in institutional rotation with price currently sitting at $1.87 per CoinCodex data . While Bitcoin and Ethereum face heavy outflows, XRP’s strong inflows reflect selective capital allocation, growing regulatory confidence, and targeted institutional conviction, trends likely to influence market behavior in the coming weeks. Conclusion CoinShares’ latest data signals a shift in institutional crypto strategy. XRP’s strong inflows highlight its rising appeal as a regulated, strategic investment, while Bitcoin and Ethereum outflows reflect a rotation toward assets with clearer catalysts. Therefore, XRP’s dominance underscores a move from broad exposure to selective, conviction-driven positioning, positioning it as a central focus for market momentum.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-30 13:27:41

It is holding between strong resistance at $90,000 and a potential support zone between $70,000 and $65,000. Traders are watching how the price moves around these levels to gauge the next direction as the year ends. Bearish Pattern Below $90K Crypto Patel shared a chart showing Bitcoin forming a bearish pennant, which developed after a 22% drop and shows price tightening into a smaller range. The asset is near $87,900 at press time. Patel wrote, “$BTC must break $90,000 to unlock the $107,000 upside.” If the move fails, the target shifts to around $70,000, based on the size of the earlier drop. A further decline to $65,000 remains possible. Notably, the pennant lines are converging, and the price is sitting near the apex. If the pattern breaks down, it would follow the same direction as the previous move. Patel called these levels “ critical ” and urged close attention. Moreover, Lennaert Snyder noted that Bitcoin swept into the $86,900 zone, which he described as an area of interest for long trades. He said , “Before entering longs, I’d prefer to see some liquidations first.” He also mentioned $85,000 and slightly lower levels as better long setups if the market dips again. On the short side, Snyder said he would wait for a push above $90,600, followed by weakness, before taking action. He added, “If we see a serious reclaim above ~$90,600, I’ll be looking for continuation longs.” Weekly Chart Warning Ali Martienz shared a chart showing a death cross on the weekly timeframe. This pattern formed three weeks ago, when the 10-week moving average crossed below the 50-week. He pointed out that in past cycles, this signal often came before deeper pullbacks or long sideways periods. Past drawdowns included moves of –54% to –66%. Three weeks ago, Bitcoin $BTC printed a death cross between the 10-week and 50-week SMA. pic.twitter.com/FMYQmpTrTb — Ali Charts (@alicharts) December 29, 2025 Martinez also noted that the current rebound could resemble a “ dead-cat bounce ” like the one seen after the 2021 market peak. As previously reported , Bitcoin is sitting on the 100-week moving average. This level has marked the start of past major cycle corrections. Long-Term Range Coming Into View Daan Crypto Trades noted that Bitcoin is close to the lower band of its regression trend, often referred to as the rainbow chart. That zone currently ranges between $60,000 and $80,000. He explained, “This is generally where BTC sits during its bear market and doesn’t drop below (2022 aside).” As long as the asset remains within this price range, traders are observing how it responds along the lower border. The subsequent action can determine further upward trending or a turn downward into the beginning of 2026.

This has limited the ability of the company to tap its equity to expand its ETH holdings, with management forced to sell nearly 11,000 ETH to fund share buybacks. The buy-backs have since lost value, total debt has gone up, as payments on the preferreds and cash burn look set to further slim a cash profile in flux. FG Nexus' ( FGNX ) 20% discount to NAV per share inverts the traditional cryptocurrency-as-a-treasury model championed by Strategy's ( MSTR ) Michael Saylor by depriving the company of the ability to aggressively tap its common shares to buy Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain ( ETH-USD ). FGNX, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, operates across two business lines. Digital Assets sees FGNX exclusively adopt Ether (""ETH"") for use as a long-term treasury asset. The company currently owns 40,095 ETH , with these valued at $3,005 per ETH, or $120.5 million. Merchant Banking forms the second division, which provides administrative and regulatory support services to newly formed SPACs. The company currently has 36 million shares outstanding at $2.92 per share, around 0.80x its net asset value (""NAV"") of $3.66 per share. FG Nexus Website ETH as treasury strategy mirrors MSTR's and will see FGNX issue new common shares and preferred equity to buy ETH for storage. This strategy hinges on continued access to the capital markets and a constrained operating cost base. The company's 8.00% Series A Cumulative Preferreds ( FGNXP ) are its only other outstanding security. Critically, the coupon payments on these carry an elevated level of risk and FGNX does not currently generate any operational-level cash flows. ETH is the second-largest crypto by market cap after Bitcoin, and it's used as the base settlement layer for the majority of stablecoins, tokenized assets, and Decentralized Finance applications. Seeking Alpha The company has moved to expand its share authorization to 1 trillion , with 900 billion of this total formed from common shares and the remainder in preferred stock. The intent is clearly to issue shares at an aggressive pace to buy ETH, leading to stock price growth that allows for the issuance of more shares to buy more ETH. This intent as a strategy falls apart with FGNX trading at a discount to its ETH holdings. In theory, this discount represents an opportunity, and FGNX announced share buybacks for its common shares of up to $200 million in October. To fund this buyback, the company offloaded nearly 10,922 ETH in October and borrowed around $10 million . FGNX, as of November 20, had repurchased 3.4 million common shares. This was completed at $3.45 per share, with the stock down 15.4% since then. The Series A Preferreds And ETH-As-A-Treasury Model FG Nexus Fiscal 2025 Third Quarter Form 10-Q FGNX stakes its ETH holdings, a yield-seeking strategy that sees FGNX lock up its holdings to take part in the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism required for the Ethereum blockchain. This represents FGNX's largest source of revenue, with $641,000 earned by the company during its fiscal 2025 third quarter. Total revenue for the quarter was just under $900,000 , with a net loss of $3.84 million recorded. FGNX had cash and cash equiavelnts of $7.5 million at the end of the third quarter, but this balance is in flux. The company has been buying back shares, with its common shares outstanding dropping by 4.1 million shares since the 20th of November. FGNX's total debt outstanding has also expanded to $11.9 million. Seeking Alpha ETH has traded down over the last 1-year by 13% and has dipped by roughly 40% from its 52-week high. The company now faces dual wealth-destructive effects of ETH prices that are dropping and common shares trading at a discount to NAV that continues to broaden. This ramps up the importance of the Series A preferreds as a possible hedge to common share volatility. These pay a $2 per share annual coupon for a 9.3% current yield as they're currently trading for $21.50 per share. This means they're swapping hands for a 14% discount to their $25 per share liquidation value, or for 86 cents on the dollar. QuantumOnline FGNX spends $447,000 per quarter on the coupons and recorded a cash burn from operations of $600,000 during the third quarter, annualized at $2.4 million. The ongoing discount to NAV prevents the company from issuing new shares to buy ETH, placing future returns in a state of volatile uncertainty. The current stock reflects a declining cryptocurrency and a stock price that has inverted to trade at a discount to this new zeitgeist. Hence, the bull case is limited until either ETH recovers or the stock price moves up to trade at a premium. Conclusion FGNX intends to pause equity issuances as long as its shares trade at a discount to NAV. This has come with its ETH portfolio being sold down to buy back stock that has declined from the weighted average of its most recent buybacks. While it could seem like arbitrage to buy FGNX to get ETH at a discount, FGNX comes with company-level operational costs and what could be an expanded discount to ETH from current levels that keep the commons as a avoid. The preferreds could also lose some value if the company is forced to continue to sell ETH and buy shares that decline further from the buy price.

This transformation, centered on the pivotal year of 2026, promises to redefine how value moves across the world, according to recent industry analysis reported by Cointelegraph. The convergence of regulatory progress and institutional demand is creating an unprecedented pathway for adoption. Stablecoins as the New Financial Plumbing Industry leaders consistently describe the future role of stablecoins as foundational infrastructure. Essentially, these digital assets, pegged to stable reserves like the US dollar, will function as the essential pipes and wires for value transfer. Consequently, they will serve both the burgeoning world of decentralized finance (DeFi) and legacy traditional finance (TradFi) systems. This dual utility is key to their projected dominance. Regulatory clarity is the primary catalyst for this shift. Major economies, including the United States and the European Union with its MiCA framework, are establishing definitive rules for dollar-backed stablecoin issuers. Therefore, by 2026, banks and fintech companies will likely integrate these regulated digital dollars directly into their payment networks. This integration will facilitate instant, low-cost transactions for both retail consumers and corporate entities. Expanding Use Cases and Global Adoption The applications for stablecoins are expanding rapidly beyond simple peer-to-peer transfers. Financial institutions are actively piloting programs for business-to-business (B2B) settlements and corporate treasury operations. For instance, a multinational company could use a stablecoin network to pay international suppliers in minutes instead of days, bypassing correspondent banking delays. Similarly, payroll systems may soon disburse salaries in digital dollars, providing employees with faster access to funds. Emerging markets are expected to see particularly rapid adoption. In regions across Africa, Asia, and Latin America, where currency volatility is high and banking access is limited, stablecoins offer a compelling solution. Citizens can use them for daily payments, store wealth in a dollar-denominated digital asset, and receive remittances from abroad at a fraction of current costs. This potential for financial inclusion is a powerful driver of global growth. Navigating Regulatory Divergence and Competition Despite the optimistic forecast, significant challenges remain on the path to 2026. A primary concern is the risk of fragmented regulatory frameworks across different nations. Without global coordination, divergent rules could lead to market polarization and liquidity fragmentation. This scenario would increase systemic risk, as stablecoin pools might become isolated within specific jurisdictions, undermining their utility as global infrastructure. Furthermore, stablecoins face emerging competition from tokenized bank deposits. Major financial institutions are experimenting with issuing digital tokens directly representing customer deposits on permissioned ledgers. These tokenized deposits, operating under existing banking regulations, could challenge stablecoins in use cases demanding the highest regulatory certainty and integration with traditional banking services. The Multi-Billion Dollar Shift to On-Chain Finance A parallel and transformative trend is the massive movement of institutional capital into on-chain yield opportunities. Currently, hundreds of billions of dollars sit idle in non-yield-bearing stablecoin wallets. Experts project that by 2026, institutional investors will begin deploying an estimated $230 billion of this capital into DeFi-based solutions. These solutions include secured lending protocols, liquid staking derivatives, and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization platforms. This capital deployment will not only generate yield for institutions but also provide deep liquidity to the decentralized finance ecosystem. The table below contrasts the current and projected states of institutional stablecoin use: Aspect Current State (2024) Projected State (2026) Primary Use Trading settlement, liquidity holding B2B payments, treasury ops, payroll Regulatory Environment Unclear, evolving piecemeal Clear frameworks in key jurisdictions Institutional Capital Mostly idle, held off-chain Actively deployed in on-chain yield Competitive Landscape Stablecoin dominance Competition from tokenized bank deposits Key drivers for this shift include: Enhanced Security: Advances in institutional-grade custody. Regulatory Green Lights: Clear guidelines for institutional participation. Proven Track Record: Maturation of major DeFi protocols. Demand for Yield: Search for return in various economic conditions. Conclusion The trajectory for stablecoins points decisively toward integration as core global financial infrastructure by 2026. Regulatory maturation will unlock mainstream adoption in banking and corporate finance, while their utility in emerging markets will promote financial inclusion. However, the landscape will evolve with challenges like regulatory divergence and new competitors like tokenized deposits. Ultimately, the movement of hundreds of billions in institutional capital into on-chain finance will cement the role of these digital assets, transforming them from a niche crypto tool into the indispensable plumbing of a new financial era. FAQs Q1: What exactly is a stablecoin? A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically by being pegged to a reserve asset like the US dollar or a basket of assets. This makes it suitable for payments and as a store of value within the digital economy. Q2: Why is 2026 considered a pivotal year for stablecoins? 2026 is seen as pivotal because it allows time for major regulatory frameworks, like the EU’s MiCA, to be fully implemented and for global financial institutions to build and deploy compliant integration systems, leading to widespread adoption. Q3: How could stablecoins be used in everyday business? Business use cases include instant B2B cross-border settlements, efficient management of corporate treasury funds, and streamlined payroll systems that disburse funds faster and with lower fees than traditional banking rails. Q4: What are tokenized bank deposits and how do they compete? Tokenized bank deposits are digital tokens issued by banks that represent a claim on a traditional bank deposit. They operate on permissioned ledgers under existing banking regulations, potentially offering a more familiar and regulated alternative for some institutional uses. Q5: What does “on-chain finance” mean in this context? On-chain finance refers to financial activities—like lending, borrowing, and earning yield—that are conducted using blockchain-based smart contracts and protocols (DeFi), as opposed to relying on traditional, off-chain financial intermediaries.

XRP, a cryptocurrency specifically designed for quick and cost-effective cross-border transactions, holds promise in global finance. The easing of regulatory hurdles for Ripple, along with the rising adoption, might boost the XRP price. Additionally, several recent acquisitions and CBDC developments make XRP a good long-term investment option. As with any investment, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious approach and thorough due diligence. It is advised to proceed with caution. Why is XRP up? The XRP/USD crypto pair price has increased as buying momentum picked up, driving the coin’s price to $1.85. How much will XRP cost in 2025? XRP is expected to trade at an average price of $2.26 by the end of 2025. Will XRP reach $5? If demand for XRP tokens continues to rise and its growth trajectory remains consistent, the coin could approach $5 by 2026. However, it’s crucial to remember that XRP’s all-time high stands at $3.65, achieved on July 18, 2025. Can XRP reach $20? According to Ripple’s price prediction, XRP has a chance of reaching near $20 by 2031. However, it is expected to reach this level if the XRP ecosystem adoption by major financial institutions continues, making it a good option to buy XRP. Will XRP reach $100 dollars? Though there are rumors of XRP reaching $100 in the market, and some pro-XRP analysts are also promoting it, many are raising questions about this possibility. XRP may not reach $100 in the near future, at least. Still, the token provides a good buying opportunity to investors looking for long-term goals. Will XRP reach $1000? If one XRP coin is worth $1000, its market cap must be more than $100 trillion. Comparatively, the total global stock market cap is about $110 trillion. Therefore, it is unlikely that XRP will reach $1000, based on current market dynamics. Does XRP have a good long-term future? XRP is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years, giving good yields to XRP holders and institutional investors. The coin is expected to reach a maximum price of $16 by 2031, making it a valuable asset, particularly with the continued efforts of Ripple Labs. However, some regulatory uncertainties still exist for XRP. Considering these factors, investors must carry out their own research.

XRP historic price sentiment XRP price history: Coinmarketcap Before 2017, the asset’s value hovered around $0.01; in April 2017, it rose to $0.05; the gradual climb soon continued as it reached $0.25 in May, showing a positive price action as Ripple continued to excel. Towards the end of 2019, XRP price stabilized at around $0.30 and did not cross the $0.5 mark throughout the year. However, the bullish run of 2020 pushed the coin’s value to a peak price of $0.8, gaining investor interest before finishing the year at $0.66. Early 2021 was supposed to be bullish for XRP, but the SEC announced a lawsuit that derailed investors. Nonetheless, XRP beat the odds and surged above $1.5 during the year, but by 2022, it plummeted to as low as $0.31, significantly decreasing XRP market cap. XRP started 2023 at $0.335, and on July 13, it almost doubled its value in a steep spike. It shot from $0.470 to $0.814 while swinging towards $0.9 for a few hours. A partial victory against the SEC triggered the price jump, surging the trading volume. XRP closed 2023 at about $0.62. In 2024, XRP has so far ridden the market wave. The bears earlier on and then a bullish price movement by mid-March resulted in a market price of $0.72, according to data from the cryptocurrency market. In July, XRP traded between $0.418 and $0.658, showing a good recovery. However, the coin went under bearish pressure at the start of August, falling back down to the $0.550 range as per crypto market records showing high volatility. In September 2024, XRP recovered up to the $0.642 level, but the price went down to the $0.500 range in October. A tremendous bullish impulse was observed in November when XRP touched the $1.96 mark, and it reached $2.72 on December 2, 2024. In January 2025, XRP reached a peak price of $3.19 and traded near the $2.90 level in February. It stepped down to $2.1 in March and to $1.79 in April. By the middle of May, XRP touched $2.57, and in July, it marked a new all-time high of $3.65. Near the start of August 2025, XRP was trending above $3, showing significant growth as the market sentiment was tilting toward the positive side; however, it lost $3 by the end of the month. In October through November, XRP traded around $1.83 to $3.10. At the start of December, XRP is trading around $1.99 to $2.18.",Crypto Price Predictions|Ripple|XRP,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|XRP|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-30 13:45:00

The central bank revealed plans to allow interest payments on central bank digital currency wallets, triggering immediate market reactions and signaling a transformative phase for China’s e-CNY project. This substantial capital inflow represents a significant vote of confidence in the digital yuan’s infrastructure and future utility within China’s financial ecosystem. Digital Yuan Infrastructure Receives Massive Investment Boost The People’s Bank of China’s announcement has catalyzed unprecedented investment activity. According to DL News reporting, approximately 30% of the $188 million investment flowed directly to Lakala, a prominent provider of hardware wallets and merchant payment infrastructure. This strategic allocation demonstrates investor recognition of the critical hardware and payment network requirements for successful digital yuan implementation. Furthermore, the investment distribution reveals sophisticated market understanding of the CBDC value chain. Market analysts immediately noted the significance of this capital movement. The investment surge occurred within days of the PBOC’s policy clarification. Consequently, financial institutions have accelerated their digital yuan integration plans. The central bank’s decision represents a fundamental shift in CBDC strategy. Previously, digital yuan wallets functioned primarily as transaction vehicles. Now, they will serve as interest-bearing accounts, fundamentally changing their economic role. PBOC’s Strategic Framework for Digital Currency Expansion The People’s Bank of China established comprehensive new guidelines effective January 1, 2025. These regulations strengthen the digital yuan’s infrastructure and governance framework significantly. The PBOC will now include digital yuan in deposit reserves, providing stronger institutional backing. Additionally, the central bank will classify wallets based on liquidity requirements, creating a tiered system for different user needs. This regulatory evolution follows years of careful testing and pilot programs. The digital yuan, known officially as e-CNY, has undergone extensive trials since 2020. These trials covered multiple cities and millions of users. The PBOC gradually expanded testing to include cross-border transactions and smart contract functionality. Therefore, the interest payment announcement represents a logical progression in the digital yuan’s development roadmap. Comparative Analysis: Digital Yuan Versus Other CBDC Projects The PBOC’s approach differs substantially from other central bank digital currency initiatives globally. Unlike some experimental CBDCs, the digital yuan operates within a fully developed regulatory framework. The table below illustrates key distinctions: Feature Digital Yuan (e-CNY) Other Major CBDC Projects Interest-bearing Yes, as of 2025 Most do not pay interest Integration Level Full banking system integration Limited pilot integration User Base 260+ million wallets (2024 data) Typically thousands to millions Legal Tender Status Full status equivalent to physical RMB Varies by jurisdiction China’s digital currency ecosystem demonstrates several distinctive characteristics. The system maintains centralized control while enabling retail usage. Moreover, it supports offline transactions through specialized hardware. These features address specific Chinese market requirements while advancing financial technology innovation. Investment Implications and Market Reactions The $188 million investment surge reflects sophisticated market analysis. Investors recognize several key opportunities within the digital yuan ecosystem. First, hardware providers like Lakala benefit directly from wallet adoption. Second, payment processors gain from transaction volume increases. Third, financial technology companies develop complementary services. Finally, traditional banks integrate digital yuan functionality into existing platforms. Financial institutions have responded with coordinated strategies. Major Chinese banks now offer digital yuan services through their mobile applications. Additionally, payment platforms like Alipay and WeChat Pay support e-CNY transactions. Consequently, users experience seamless integration between digital yuan and existing payment methods. This interoperability accelerates adoption while maintaining user convenience. The investment distribution reveals specific sector preferences: Hardware Infrastructure (30%) : Led by Lakala for secure wallet devices Payment Processing (25%) : Merchant acceptance systems and POS solutions Software Development (20%) : Wallet applications and security protocols Financial Services (15%) : Integration with banking and investment platforms Research & Development (10%) : Blockchain optimization and new feature development Expert Perspectives on Digital Yuan Evolution Financial technology experts emphasize the strategic importance of the PBOC’s announcement. Dr. Chen Wei, a digital currency researcher at Peking University, explains the significance. “The interest payment feature transforms digital yuan from a payment tool to a savings vehicle,” she states. “This fundamentally changes its economic function and user appeal.” Her analysis highlights the psychological shift from transactional to asset-based digital currency usage. International observers note the global implications. The Bank for International Settlements has monitored China’s CBDC progress closely. Their 2024 report acknowledged the digital yuan’s advanced stage of development. However, they also noted potential challenges regarding cross-border interoperability. The PBOC continues to participate in multilateral discussions about international CBDC standards. Technological Infrastructure and Security Considerations The digital yuan operates on a sophisticated technological foundation. The system utilizes a two-tier architecture with the PBOC at its core. Commercial banks distribute the digital currency to end users. This structure maintains central bank control while leveraging existing financial infrastructure. Moreover, the system incorporates advanced cryptographic security measures. Security remains paramount for digital currency implementation. The PBOC has implemented multiple protection layers. These include transaction monitoring systems and anti-fraud mechanisms. Additionally, the central bank maintains strict control over wallet creation and transaction limits. These safeguards address concerns about financial stability and illicit activities. Technical specifications reveal careful engineering decisions: Architecture : Hybrid centralized/distributed system Transaction Speed : 300,000+ transactions per second capacity Offline Capability : NFC and Bluetooth offline transaction support Privacy Features : Controllable anonymity for small transactions Smart Contract Support : Limited programmable functionality Economic Impact and Monetary Policy Implications The digital yuan’s expansion influences broader economic dynamics. Monetary policy transmission becomes more direct with CBDC implementation. The PBOC can theoretically implement policy changes with greater precision. However, this capability requires careful management to avoid market disruptions. Central bank officials have emphasized gradual, controlled implementation strategies. Commercial banking operations face both challenges and opportunities. Traditional deposit accounts might experience migration to digital yuan wallets. Conversely, banks gain new digital service channels. The interest payment feature particularly affects deposit competition. Banks must now consider digital yuan as both a competitor and a platform for innovation. International trade implications continue to evolve. Several countries have initiated digital yuan pilot programs for cross-border transactions. These experiments test technical interoperability and regulatory compatibility. Successful implementation could reshape global trade settlement patterns. However, geopolitical considerations influence adoption rates beyond technical factors. Future Development Roadmap and Expansion Plans The PBOC has outlined a clear development trajectory for the digital yuan. Phase one focused on domestic retail usage and technical testing. Phase two, now underway, expands functionality and integration. Future phases will address internationalization and advanced features. This structured approach minimizes implementation risks while maximizing learning opportunities. Upcoming developments include several key initiatives. Cross-border payment trials will expand to additional partner countries. Smart contract functionality will enable more complex financial instruments. Integration with Internet of Things devices will create new use cases. These advancements position the digital yuan as a versatile financial tool rather than just a digital payment method. The investment community anticipates further developments. Market analysts predict additional capital inflows as implementation progresses. Particularly, infrastructure providers and technology developers should benefit. However, regulatory clarity remains essential for sustained investment. The PBOC continues to provide guidance through regular policy announcements and technical specifications. Conclusion The $188 million investment surge following the PBOC’s interest payment announcement demonstrates strong market confidence in the digital yuan’s future. This capital movement reflects sophisticated understanding of China’s CBDC development trajectory. The digital yuan continues evolving from experimental project to integrated financial infrastructure. Moreover, the interest-bearing feature represents a strategic enhancement to its economic functionality. As implementation progresses, the digital yuan will likely influence both domestic finance and international digital currency development. The PBOC’s careful, structured approach balances innovation with stability, creating a model that other central banks study closely. The coming years will reveal how this substantial investment translates into practical financial system transformation.

This data, highlighted by CryptoQuant contributor and analyst martuun, signals a notable shift in market dynamics between major U.S. and global exchanges. Consequently, this event warrants a deep examination of its mechanics, historical context, and potential implications for the broader digital asset ecosystem. Understanding the Coinbase Premium Indicator The Coinbase Premium serves as a critical on-chain metric for gauging institutional and U.S.-based buying pressure relative to the global market. Fundamentally, it measures the price difference between Bitcoin on Coinbase Pro (a U.S.-regulated exchange popular with institutional investors) and Binance (a leading global exchange). Analysts calculate this premium by subtracting the Binance BTC/USD price from the Coinbase Pro BTC/USD price. A positive premium indicates stronger buying demand or willingness to pay more on Coinbase, often interpreted as institutional accumulation. Conversely, a negative premium, or discount, suggests selling pressure or higher demand on international platforms. The Mechanics of Exchange Arbitrage In efficient markets, arbitrageurs quickly eliminate significant price differences between exchanges. They buy an asset where it’s cheaper and simultaneously sell it where it’s more expensive, pocketing the spread. However, several frictions can sustain a premium or discount. For instance, banking delays, regulatory hurdles, or capital controls can impede the free flow of capital needed for instant arbitrage. Furthermore, the premium often reflects the composition of users on each platform. Coinbase’s clientele includes many U.S. institutions and retail investors, while Binance caters to a more global, and sometimes more speculative, user base. Therefore, the premium acts as a real-time sentiment gauge for these distinct market segments. Historical Context of Extreme Premium Levels The current -$122 reading places this event in a rare historical category. According to martuun’s analysis, similar extreme discounts have occurred only on approximately five other occasions in 2024. Examining previous instances provides crucial context. For example, a deep negative premium often coincided with periods of heightened market fear, aggressive selling from U.S. entities, or strong buying surges in Asian markets. Notably, past episodes sometimes preceded short-term market bottoms, as overwhelming selling pressure from one region was exhausted. However, each instance must be evaluated within its unique macro backdrop, including interest rate expectations and geopolitical events. Key characteristics of past -$100+ premium events include: Elevated trading volumes on offshore derivatives exchanges. Increased transfers from Coinbase custodial wallets to exchange hot wallets, indicating preparation to sell. A noticeable decoupling of Bitcoin’s price action from traditional equity markets. Spikes in the CryptoQuant “Exchange Netflow” metric for Coinbase. Recent Notable Coinbase Premium Extremes (2024) Approximate Date Premium Level Prevailing Market Context Mid-January ~ -$115 Post-ETF approval sell-the-news event Early March ~ -$105 Pre-FOMC meeting risk-off sentiment Late July ~ -$130 German government BTC sales and Mt. Gox creditor distributions Analyzing the Current Market Impact and Data The emergence of this premium in late 2024 occurs within a specific financial landscape. Firstly, U.S. monetary policy remains a dominant force, influencing institutional capital allocation. Secondly, the maturation of Bitcoin spot ETFs has created new channels for U.S. demand that don’t always directly translate to exchange-based buying. The -$122 discount could suggest that ETF flows are neutral or negative while concurrent selling occurs on the Coinbase spot market. Alternatively, it may highlight robust buying activity in other time zones, perhaps driven by currency hedging or regional economic factors. Data from Glassnode and other analytics firms often shows corresponding movements in stablecoin supplies and exchange reserves during these phases. Expert Insights and Market Structure CryptoQuant’s martuun provides the primary data alert for this event. Other analysts, like those from Glassnode and IntoTheBlock, often correlate such premiums with on-chain realized profit/loss metrics and investor cohort behavior. For instance, a deep negative premium alongside high realized losses could indicate capitulation. The structure of the order books on both exchanges also offers clues. A sustained discount might reveal large sell walls on Coinbase or aggressive buy-side liquidity on Binance. Monitoring the premium’s persistence is key; a brief spike may be a technical anomaly, while a sustained negative reading carries more weight. Broader Implications for Bitcoin and Crypto Markets This indicator rarely operates in isolation. Its signal strength increases when combined with other metrics. For example, analysts will watch the futures funding rates across exchanges. A negative Coinbase Premium coupled with negative funding rates could reinforce a bearish short-term sentiment. Conversely, if funding rates remain neutral or positive, it may suggest the discount is a localized phenomenon. Furthermore, the premium impacts arbitrage desks and market makers, who may adjust their strategies to capture the spread, ultimately working to close the gap. This activity adds volume and can increase market volatility in the short term. The event’s relevance extends to several market participants: Institutional Investors: May view a prolonged discount as a potential accumulation signal if U.S. selling is overdone. Retail Traders: Should exercise caution, as such signals are complex and not standalone buy/sell triggers. Analysts & Researchers: Use this data point to refine market phase models and liquidity analyses. Conclusion The Coinbase Premium’s decline to -$122 represents a notable and relatively rare event in Bitcoin’s market microstructure, having occurred only about five times this year. This extreme discount highlights a current divergence in selling pressure and demand between major U.S. and global cryptocurrency exchanges. While historical parallels exist, each instance requires careful analysis within the broader context of on-chain data, derivatives markets, and macro-financial conditions. Ultimately, this metric serves as a powerful, real-time tool for understanding capital flows and regional sentiment, providing market participants with a deeper layer of insight beyond simple price action. Monitoring whether this negative Coinbase Premium persists or rapidly mean-reverts will be crucial for assessing the next likely move in Bitcoin’s market structure. FAQs Q1: What exactly is the Coinbase Premium? A1: The Coinbase Premium is a market indicator that shows the difference between the Bitcoin price on Coinbase Pro and its price on other major global exchanges, typically Binance. It helps gauge relative buying or selling pressure between U.S. and international markets. Q2: Why is a negative Coinbase Premium significant? A2: A negative premium, or discount, suggests that Bitcoin is trading cheaper on Coinbase than on other exchanges. This often indicates stronger selling pressure from U.S. investors or stronger buying demand on international platforms, signaling a shift in regional market sentiment. Q3: How often does the premium reach such extreme negative levels? A3: According to the analysis cited, a Coinbase Premium around -$122 has occurred only about five times in the current year, making it a relatively rare event that typically coincides with periods of notable market stress or divergence. Q4: Can the Coinbase Premium predict Bitcoin’s price direction? A4: It is not a standalone price prediction tool. However, as a sentiment and flow indicator, extreme readings can signal potential exhaustion of selling or buying in one region, which has sometimes preceded short-term trend reversals when confirmed by other data points. Q5: Where can traders and investors monitor the Coinbase Premium? A5: Analytics platforms like CryptoQuant, Glassnode, and TradingView track derivatives of this metric. The data is derived from public exchange price feeds and is used by analysts to provide commentary on market structure.

US Search Interest Plunges As Retail Shy Away Traders and holders reacted fast on social channels, pushing chatter and price focus higher even as specifics remain unclear. ETF Flows Heat Up According to data shared by Nate Geraci, President of NovaDius Wealth, Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs dominated year-to-date inflows. BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF led with $25 billion in inflows. Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF followed at $1.11 billion. Fidelity and VanEck posted $477 million and $305 million respectively. On the Ethereum side, BlackRock’s offerings recorded about $9.12 billion. A Solana staking ETF from Bitwise pulled in $839 million. These numbers show where most large investors are putting money right now. Expect some big news this week $XRP ETFs https://t.co/3BY5XJosPx — PaulBarron (@paulbarron) December 29, 2025 Community Reaction And Speculation Barron’s remark has been read by many as a hint at another XRP-related announcement. Some expect a new ETF launch; others are watching for updates from issuers already in the market. That talk has helped push attention — and inflows — to XRP products that only debuted late in the year. XRP Ledger Tokenization Surge Based on reports from rwa.xyz, on-chain data indicates tokenized real-world assets on the XRP Ledger rose by 2,200% in 2025. The network saw about 23x growth in the value of native real-world assets, including stablecoins, and crossed the $500 million threshold. Themes around RWA tokenization were widely discussed this year by figures such as BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and former SEC Chair Paul Atkins, and the XRPL appears to be drawing benefit from that interest. XRP ETFs Show Early Strength Canary’s XRP ETF (XRPC) registered $384 million in year-to-date inflows after launching in November. Other XRP spot funds have built sizable holdings too: 21Shares holds about $250 million, Bitwise roughly $227 million, Grayscale around $244 million, and Franklin about $206 million. Based on reports, all of these XRP spot ETFs launched in November and December and now tally roughly $1.24 billion in total assets under management with cumulative inflows near $1.14 billion. For a new category, that level of money moving in over a short span is notable; some industry voices point out the total might have been higher if market mood had not cooled recently. Reports also say XRP ETFs pulled in over $1 billion through 21 days of steady inflows. Pending Products And Rumors WisdomTree’s XRP ETF is among the pending offerings that market watchers expect to arrive next. At the same time, talk about a BlackRock XRP ETF has circulated widely. There is currently no public filing tied to a BlackRock XRP product, and reports caution that such expectations are premature without official filings or approvals.

The post focused on wallet distribution, price growth, and what rising costs mean for smaller participants. The numbers themselves tell the story, describing how XRP ownership looks today. What ChartNerd Highlighted ChartNerd wrote that “More than 6 million XRP wallets hold 500 XRP or fewer.” He added that “acquiring 1,000 XRP is already out of reach for most participants, as it now costs about $1,750 compared to $500 just over a year ago.” The post paired this observation with a detailed balance distribution chart showing how the XRP supply clusters across wallet sizes. The chart shows millions of addresses holding small balances. It also shows a steep drop in wallet count as balances rise . Only a small number of wallets control large allocations, while mid-sized holders sit between those extremes. $XRP Rich List : Is Retail Being Priced Out?

Large balances cluster in very few wallets, while retail participation spreads thinly across millions of addresses. With XRP supply on exchanges shrinking rapidly , this data suggests that most of those tokens are held by large investors. What This Means for XRP’s Path Rising costs restrict supply movement by limiting the number of participants that can accumulate at scale. This slows coin rotation and leaves long-term holders with greater control over available liquidity, and pushes out retail holders. The Rich List reveals that XRP ownership has matured along with price appreciation. Retail access has narrowed. Supply has settled into fewer large pools.

Consequently, the project’s team swiftly moved to address mounting concerns, officially denying any security breach or hack. Instead, they pointed investigators toward significant liquidations in the derivatives market as the probable catalyst. This incident, reported first by Bitcoin World, underscores the inherent volatility and complex interconnectedness of modern digital asset markets. Furthermore, it highlights the critical need for robust risk management protocols for all market participants. Analyzing the Overtake TAKE Price Drop Event The Overtake project issued a definitive statement via its official X account following the sharp decline. Importantly, the team confirmed the security of all foundation and team-managed wallets, effectively ruling out a direct exploit or theft of project assets. Their preliminary analysis suggests the crash originated from a cascade of forced liquidations on leveraged trading positions. Such events occur when traders using borrowed funds (leverage) cannot meet margin calls after price movements, triggering automatic sell orders from exchanges. This mechanism can create a self-reinforcing downward spiral, especially in less liquid markets. Market data from the period shows a classic signature of a liquidation cascade. Initially, a moderate sell-off likely triggered stop-loss orders and liquidated some leveraged long positions. Subsequently, these forced sells drove the price lower, liquidating more positions in a rapid chain reaction. The Overtake team stated it is closely monitoring on-chain and exchange data to understand the full scope. This transparent response aims to maintain community trust during a stressful period. However, the event has already prompted discussions about market structure vulnerabilities. The Mechanics of Crypto Derivatives and Liquidations To comprehend the Overtake situation, one must understand cryptocurrency derivatives. These are financial contracts, like futures and perpetual swaps, whose value derives from an underlying asset like TAKE. Traders use them to speculate on price direction or hedge existing holdings. Crucially, these products often employ high leverage, sometimes exceeding 100x. While this amplifies potential gains, it also drastically increases risk. Exchanges require traders to maintain a minimum margin (collateral) in their positions. If the market moves against them and their margin ratio falls below a maintenance level, the exchange automatically closes (liquidates) the position to prevent further loss. A large, concentrated leveraged position can become a tipping point. If the market begins to dip, the liquidation of that single large position can flood the market with sell orders. This activity pushes the price down further, triggering more liquidations in a violent feedback loop. The table below outlines key factors that exacerbate such events: Factor Impact on Liquidation Risk Low Token Liquidity Large sell orders cause more significant price slippage. High Leverage Ratios Positions are liquidated more quickly with minor price moves. Concentrated Positions A single large liquidation can initiate the cascade. Market Volatility Increases the frequency and severity of margin calls. Therefore, the Overtake team’s reference to “large-scale liquidation” points directly to this well-documented market phenomenon. Analysts often review funding rates and open interest data to identify markets ripe for such squeezes. Historical Context and Precedent Events The Overtake TAKE price drop is not an isolated incident in the cryptocurrency sector. Historically, similar liquidation cascades have affected even the largest assets. For instance, significant Bitcoin and Ethereum corrections have frequently been accelerated by waves of derivatives liquidations. Notably, the market downturns of May 2021 and June 2022 saw billions of dollars in leveraged positions liquidated within days. These events contributed to extreme volatility across the entire crypto market cap. Each event provides data points for risk models and highlights the systemic risk posed by excessive, unhedged leverage. Experts from firms like Glassnode and CoinMetrics consistently analyze these cycles. They note that while spot market selling reflects genuine asset redistribution, derivative-led sell-offs can be more technical and transient. However, the price impact on retail holders is very real. The speed of the Overtake drop—70% in ten minutes—exemplifies how quickly value can evaporate in these conditions. This precedent reinforces the importance of project teams monitoring derivatives activity for their tokens. Proactive communication, as demonstrated by Overtake, can help mitigate panic and misinformation. Implications for Investors and Market Structure This event carries several critical implications for cryptocurrency investors and the broader market ecosystem. First, it serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with trading low-market-cap or low-liquidity altcoins on margin. The potential for sudden, catastrophic price movements is significantly higher than with established assets. Second, it underscores the difference between a security failure and a market failure. A hack implies a breach of the underlying blockchain or protocol, while a liquidation cascade is a function of trading behavior on secondary markets. Distinguishing between the two is vital for accurate risk assessment. For the Overtake project itself, managing community sentiment and trust is now paramount. The team’s swift denial of a hack and explanation likely helped stabilize the situation. Their continued actions will be scrutinized. Potential steps could include: Enhanced Market Monitoring: Implementing tools to track derivatives exposure and large wallet movements. Improved Liquidity Provisions: Working with exchanges and market makers to deepen order books. Educational Initiatives: Informing the community about the risks of leverage and market mechanics. Protocol Resilience: Continuing to audit and secure the core smart contracts against actual exploits. Market structure analysts argue that events like this may pressure exchanges to implement more conservative leverage limits or dynamic margin requirements for smaller-cap tokens. However, the decentralized and global nature of crypto trading makes uniform standards challenging to enforce. Conclusion The dramatic Overtake TAKE price drop provides a compelling case study in modern cryptocurrency market dynamics. While the project successfully denied a hack and pointed to derivatives market liquidations, the event inflicted substantial financial loss on leveraged traders and likely shook holder confidence. This incident reinforces essential lessons about volatility, leverage, and liquidity risk. Moreover, it highlights the evolving responsibility of crypto projects to monitor and communicate about secondary market activity that impacts their tokens. As the digital asset space matures, understanding and mitigating the mechanics of liquidation cascades will remain a critical focus for developers, exchanges, and informed investors seeking to navigate this high-stakes environment. FAQs Q1: What caused the Overtake (TAKE) token to drop 70%? The Overtake team attributed the crash to a large-scale liquidation event in the derivatives market, not a security hack. A cascade of forced sell orders from leveraged positions likely triggered a rapid downward price spiral. Q2: What is a liquidation cascade in cryptocurrency trading? A liquidation cascade occurs when falling prices force the automatic closure of leveraged trading positions. These forced sales push the price down further, triggering more liquidations in a self-reinforcing cycle, often causing extreme short-term volatility. Q3: Did the Overtake protocol get hacked? No. The Overtake project confirmed that its protocol and all wallets under its direct management (foundation and team wallets) remained secure. The price action was a result of market trading activity, not a breach of the blockchain or smart contracts. Q4: How can investors protect themselves from such events? Investors can mitigate risk by avoiding excessive leverage, especially on low-liquidity tokens, understanding the mechanics of derivatives, diversifying holdings, and using stop-loss orders cautiously (as they can become market sell orders in a crash). Q5: What is the difference between a market crash and a hack? A market crash is driven by trading activity, economics, and sentiment on exchanges. A hack involves unauthorized access to and theft of funds from a blockchain protocol, exchange, or user wallet. They require fundamentally different responses and analyses.

According to their recent analysis, blockchain security and crypto asset prices will likely remain unaffected by quantum advancements through at least 2026, though the industry must prepare for eventual cryptographic transitions. This report arrives as quantum computing research accelerates globally, sparking legitimate concerns about the future of digital asset security. Understanding the Quantum Computing Crypto Threat Quantum computers operate on fundamentally different principles than classical computers. They use quantum bits or qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously through superposition. This capability allows quantum machines to solve certain mathematical problems exponentially faster. Specifically, they threaten the cryptographic algorithms that secure blockchain networks. Current systems rely on public-key cryptography, where digital signatures verify transactions. A sufficiently powerful quantum computer could theoretically reverse-engineer private keys from public addresses using Shor’s algorithm. This potential vulnerability has sparked significant discussion within cryptographic circles. However, Grayscale’s analysis emphasizes the substantial gap between theoretical capability and practical implementation. Building fault-tolerant quantum computers with enough stable qubits remains an enormous engineering challenge. Major technology companies and research institutions continue working toward this goal, but commercial viability for cryptanalysis appears distant. Grayscale’s Short-Term Market Assessment Grayscale’s report systematically evaluates the timeline for quantum threats. The firm concludes that tangible impacts on cryptocurrency asset prices are unlikely before 2026. This assessment considers several key factors. First, the current state of quantum hardware remains in early development. Second, the cryptocurrency community maintains strong awareness of this issue. Third, transition protocols to quantum-resistant algorithms are already in active research and development. The report notes that market volatility often stems from immediate concerns rather than distant theoretical risks. Consequently, Grayscale suggests investors should focus on traditional market drivers like adoption rates, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic factors. The analysis references historical examples where technological threats prompted premature market reactions. It draws parallels to early concerns about blockchain scalability and energy consumption, which sparked innovation rather than causing systemic collapse. Expert Perspectives on Cryptographic Transition Timelines Cryptography experts generally agree with Grayscale’s timeline assessment. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been running a multi-year process to standardize post-quantum cryptographic algorithms. This process began in 2016 and has progressed through several rounds of evaluation. Selected algorithms are undergoing final standardization, with implementation guidelines expected in the coming years. This structured, global effort provides a realistic framework for transition. Blockchain developers can integrate these new standards during planned network upgrades. Major chains like Bitcoin and Ethereum have demonstrated remarkable adaptability through past upgrades. The transition will likely occur gradually, with ample warning for all network participants. Grayscale’s report highlights this coordinated preparedness as a key reason for market stability. The Path to Quantum-Resistant Blockchains Transitioning blockchain networks to quantum-resistant cryptography involves technical and community coordination. The process requires several sequential steps: Algorithm Standardization: Finalizing and publishing approved post-quantum cryptographic standards. Protocol Development: Creating implementation specifications for major blockchain protocols. Testing and Auditing: Conducting extensive security audits and testnet deployments. Community Activation: Achieving consensus among node operators, developers, and users for network upgrades. Grace Periods: Implementing transitional mechanisms that support both old and new address formats. This structured approach minimizes disruption. Several blockchain projects have already begun experimental implementations. For example, some newer networks have designed hybrid systems that incorporate quantum-resistant features alongside traditional cryptography. The table below summarizes the projected transition timeline based on current research: Timeframe Development Phase Expected Industry Impact 2024-2026 Standardization & Early Testing Minimal market impact, continued research 2027-2030 Protocol Implementation & Testing Gradual developer adoption, increased awareness 2031+ Network Upgrades & Full Transition Potential security metric for blockchain valuation Broader Implications for Digital Asset Security Quantum computing discussions extend beyond cryptocurrency to the entire digital infrastructure. Traditional banking systems, government databases, and secure communications all rely on similar cryptographic foundations. This widespread dependency ensures substantial resources will address the quantum threat. Governments and corporations worldwide are investing billions in quantum research and cryptographic migration. The cryptocurrency industry benefits from these broader efforts. Grayscale’s report contextualizes blockchain security within this larger landscape. It notes that financial institutions face similar transition challenges, potentially leveling the competitive playing field. Furthermore, blockchain’s transparent nature might actually simplify certain aspects of cryptographic migration. Network participants can verify upgrades publicly, unlike opaque legacy systems. Historical Precedents and Technological Adaptation Technology industries have repeatedly navigated fundamental security transitions. The shift from SHA-1 to SHA-2 hash functions provides a relevant example. Although theoretically vulnerable, the migration occurred smoothly over years without major incidents. Similarly, the Y2K transition demonstrated how coordinated global action can address widespread technological risks. The cryptocurrency industry has already proven its adaptability through several significant upgrades. Bitcoin’s implementation of Segregated Witness (SegWit) and Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake consensus required complex coordination. These successful transitions build confidence for future cryptographic changes. Grayscale’s analysis suggests the market increasingly recognizes this adaptive capacity, reducing panic about long-term threats. Conclusion Grayscale’s comprehensive analysis provides valuable perspective on the quantum computing crypto threat. The firm’s assessment that minimal short-term impact will occur through 2026 aligns with broader cryptographic research. While quantum computers theoretically challenge current blockchain security, practical implementation remains years away. This timeline allows for orderly transition to quantum-resistant cryptography. The cryptocurrency industry demonstrates strong awareness and preparation for this eventual shift. Investors should monitor developments but recognize that traditional market factors will likely dominate price action in coming years. The quantum computing discussion ultimately highlights blockchain’s evolving security landscape and the industry’s capacity for technological adaptation. FAQs Q1: What exactly is the quantum computing threat to cryptocurrency? Quantum computers could potentially break the cryptographic algorithms that secure blockchain networks by deriving private keys from public addresses, but this requires machines far more advanced than currently exist. Q2: How soon could quantum computers actually break blockchain security? According to Grayscale and most experts, practical quantum attacks on blockchain cryptography remain unlikely before 2030, with minimal market impact expected through at least 2026. Q3: What are quantum-resistant cryptocurrencies? These are blockchain networks implementing cryptographic algorithms specifically designed to withstand attacks from both classical and quantum computers, though most major networks plan to transition existing systems. Q4: Will Bitcoin need to change its code because of quantum computing? Yes, eventually Bitcoin and most major blockchains will need to implement quantum-resistant cryptographic standards through network upgrades, similar to past protocol improvements. Q5: Should cryptocurrency investors worry about quantum computing now? Grayscale’s report suggests investors should monitor developments but focus on traditional market drivers, as quantum threats remain a long-term consideration rather than an immediate risk.
