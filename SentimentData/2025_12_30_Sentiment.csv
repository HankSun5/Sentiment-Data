The ranking Democratic member of the House Financial Services Committee specifically targets the SEC’s decision to suspend enforcement actions against several prominent crypto firms. This development raises crucial questions about regulatory consistency and investor protection in the rapidly evolving digital asset space. SEC Crypto Enforcement Under Congressional Scrutiny Representative Waters’ formal letter to Committee Chairman French Hill reveals substantial concerns about regulatory enforcement patterns. The SEC has reportedly suspended or dropped actions against multiple companies and individuals accused of securities law violations. Notably, this list includes major industry players like Coinbase, Binance, and entrepreneur Justin Sun. Waters asserts the committee has failed to properly investigate why the SEC abandoned these actions. Furthermore, she questions how the regulatory body plans to prevent future fraud and market manipulation without consistent enforcement. The cryptocurrency industry has experienced dramatic regulatory shifts throughout the 2020s. Initially, the SEC under Chairman Gary Gensler pursued an aggressive enforcement strategy. However, recent court decisions and political pressure have created a more complex landscape. Consequently, regulatory agencies now face difficult decisions about resource allocation and legal strategy. Waters’ criticism emerges against this backdrop of changing regulatory priorities and increasing industry lobbying efforts. Historical Context of Cryptocurrency Regulation Understanding this controversy requires examining the SEC’s evolving stance on digital assets. The agency first asserted jurisdiction over certain cryptocurrencies as securities following the 2017 DAO Report. Subsequently, enforcement actions increased significantly during the 2021-2023 period. The SEC filed numerous cases alleging unregistered securities offerings and fraudulent activities. However, several high-profile legal setbacks have recently influenced the commission’s approach. Key Legal Decisions Impacting SEC Strategy Recent court rulings have substantially affected the SEC’s enforcement capabilities. For instance, the Ripple Labs decision created important distinctions between institutional and retail sales of XRP. Additionally, the Grayscale Bitcoin ETF approval signaled shifting judicial perspectives on cryptocurrency products. These legal developments have forced regulatory agencies to reassess their litigation strategies. Meanwhile, Congress continues debating comprehensive digital asset legislation that could clarify jurisdictional boundaries. The following table illustrates major SEC enforcement actions against cryptocurrency firms since 2020: Year Company/Individual Alleged Violation Current Status 2020 Telegram Unregistered $1.7B ICO Settled 2023 Coinbase Operating unregistered exchange Ongoing litigation 2023 Binance Multiple securities violations Partial settlements 2023 Justin Sun Fraud and market manipulation Dropped according to Waters Potential Impacts on Market Participants Reduced SEC enforcement could create significant consequences for various market participants. Retail investors might face increased risks without regulatory oversight. Meanwhile, legitimate cryptocurrency businesses could encounter unfair competition from non-compliant operators. The situation also raises questions about international regulatory coordination. Other jurisdictions might interpret reduced U.S. enforcement as signaling different standards. Industry experts express mixed reactions to these developments. Some legal scholars argue selective enforcement undermines regulatory credibility. Others suggest strategic retreats might allow better resource allocation. However, most agree that regulatory clarity remains essential for long-term industry growth. The current uncertainty potentially hinders institutional adoption and technological innovation. Investor Protection Considerations Representative Waters emphasizes investor protection concerns throughout her critique. She references previous cryptocurrency collapses that caused substantial investor losses. Without consistent enforcement, similar situations could potentially reoccur. The congresswoman specifically questions how the SEC plans to address: Market manipulation in decentralized and centralized exchanges Transparency requirements for cryptocurrency offerings Custody standards for digital asset storage Disclosure practices for project teams and promoters Political and Legislative Implications This controversy occurs during ongoing congressional debates about cryptocurrency regulation. Multiple legislative proposals currently address digital asset classification and regulatory jurisdiction. Waters’ letter adds urgency to these discussions. It also highlights partisan differences regarding financial regulation approaches. Democratic lawmakers generally favor stronger consumer protections. Meanwhile, Republican members often emphasize innovation and market development. The House Financial Services Committee plays a crucial role in shaping financial policy. Its oversight function includes monitoring regulatory agency performance. Waters’ criticism suggests potential committee investigations into SEC decision-making. Such inquiries could examine internal communications and resource allocation decisions. They might also consider political influences on enforcement priorities. Broader Regulatory Landscape Analysis The SEC represents just one component of the U.S. cryptocurrency regulatory framework. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission claims jurisdiction over certain digital assets as commodities. Additionally, banking regulators oversee cryptocurrency custody and banking relationships. State authorities maintain their own licensing and enforcement mechanisms. This fragmented approach creates complexity for market participants and regulators alike. International regulatory developments further complicate the situation. The European Union recently implemented comprehensive Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation. Asian jurisdictions have adopted diverse approaches ranging from restrictive to supportive. Global coordination remains limited despite cross-border nature of cryptocurrency markets. Inconsistent enforcement across jurisdictions could create regulatory arbitrage opportunities. Conclusion Representative Maxine Waters’ critique of SEC crypto enforcement actions highlights significant regulatory challenges. The suspension of cases against major industry participants raises questions about consistency and effectiveness. This development occurs amidst evolving legal precedents and ongoing legislative debates. Ultimately, regulatory clarity and consistent enforcement remain essential for market stability and investor protection. The cryptocurrency industry continues navigating complex regulatory waters while seeking legitimate pathways for innovation and growth. FAQs Q1: Why is Representative Waters criticizing the SEC? Representative Waters criticizes the SEC for suspending or dropping enforcement actions against cryptocurrency firms accused of securities violations. She believes this reduces investor protections and requires congressional investigation. Q2: Which companies does Waters mention in her criticism? Her letter specifically references Coinbase, Binance, and entrepreneur Justin Sun as examples where the SEC has reportedly halted enforcement actions. Q3: What committee does Representative Waters serve on? She serves as the ranking Democratic member of the House Financial Services Committee, which oversees financial regulation including SEC activities. Q4: How might reduced enforcement affect cryptocurrency investors? Reduced enforcement could potentially increase risks for investors through less oversight of market manipulation, fraud, and disclosure violations in the cryptocurrency space. Q5: What broader implications does this criticism have? This development highlights ongoing debates about cryptocurrency regulation, jurisdictional boundaries between agencies, and the appropriate balance between innovation and investor protection.

However, its price dropped by 0.5% at $0.1254, signifying a considerable number of selling activities. The technical analysis indicates a bearish trend that may continue to press down the price. There is also another indicator that shows DOGE could be oversold, and this is at times an indicator of an approaching bounce. There has been a lack of interest from prominent investors, despite DOGE being part of an ETF and various companies holding DOGE within their portfolios. Dogecoin Undergoes Technical Pressure A significant discrepancy is presently evident in the case of DOGE: the volume of trading has increased, while the market price has not. This seems to be an indicator of high trading volume but low market price. The graph shown is negative; this is disappointing for the traders, as they expected a positive closing result at the end of the year. Year to date, Dogecoin is down by 61% in value despite the positive event of the launch of ETFs. The price of DOGE is strongly correlated to the price of Bitcoin. This means that if the price of Bitcoin improves, the price of DOGE will also go up. Mutuum Finance: A Leading Cryptocurrency for Investments As massive capital exits high-risk meme coins, investors are looking at better-sounding projects. Among the best available is that of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ; it has an transparent presale process and functional technology. The presale has managed to raise $19.5 million from more than 18,600 investors. It is in Phase 6, which is 99% sold out. The pricing of the tokens is $0.035, indicating a 250% jump from phase one price. Speculative purchases might have seen a gain of about 420% during launch at $0.06. This makes MUTM a cheap cryptocurrency with promising prospects. With the end of Phase 6, Phase 7 begins immediately with a higher price of $0.04, indicating a 20% jump. This chance of purchase at a cheap price is short-lived. Dual-System Design – Durability Mutuum Finance uses two different loan platforms. The first one pools money for mainstream assets like ETH, while the other one allows customers to design their own loan programs for other assets. Clients receive exclusive loyalty tokens with which interest is accrued automatically. Mutuum Finance’s two-level system makes it more flexible compared to its rivals and thus the best crypto to invest in. One of the major considerations for the platform is security.Certik has carried out a major security audit, scoring MUTM highly. A bug bounty scheme worth $50,000 has been implemented. This has been done to satisfy the institutional investors. The first version of the platform is to be launched on a test network by the end of 2025. Buying MUTM is also easy, with direct credit/debit card purchases possible without restriction. There is also a $100,000 giveaway , where ten individuals win, in addition to a leaderboard from which $500 is given to the top trader each day. The Pending Opportunity at the Lowest Price With issues faced by Dogecoin, investments are moving towards platforms such as Mutuum Finance, due to their potential for development and not mere speculative endeavors. Phase 6 has been 99% sold out, thus a last chance exists for its purchase at $0.035 before price increments kick in.

Will Dogecoin follow its lead? At press time, spot silver was holding near $76 after pulling back from the earlier record high of $83.62, with the metal up roughly 181% year-to-date in 2025, an outsized move for the precious-metal. The rally is attributed to a mix of macro and market-structure drivers including expectations for easier US monetary policy in 2026, strong industrial and investment demand, persistent supply shortfalls, and silver’s recent designation as a US “critical mineral,” which added a policy-sensitive supply narrative to an already tight market. The ‘Silver Fractal’ Pitch For Dogecoin That silver move is now being used as a visual analog in crypto. X analyst Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) posted a side-by-side TradingView comparison suggesting Dogecoin’s 6-month chart resembles silver’s 3-day structure from three weeks ago, implying DOGE could be positioned for a similarly persistent advance if the fractal holds. In the shared DOGE 6-month panel, Cantonese Cat shows a large selloff candle and frames it as a potential cyclical low. Based on the silver comparison, the interpretation is not “DOGE pumps next week,” but “DOGE trends for years.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Triangle Formation Breakdown Spells Trouble As 15% Move Nears – Time To Be Cautious? In the proposed fractal path, the current 6-month candle would mark the bottom, followed by eight additional 6-month candles spanning roughly four years where seven are green and only one is red. The lone red candle is mapped as the third in the sequence, implying the first half of 2027 could be a down half-year even within an overarching uptrend. If the pattern were to track silver “exactly,” the projected cycle peak would land in the second half of 2029, with a peak price “above $11” in that window. Related Reading: Dogecoin Is Repeating Its 2020 Accumulation Cycle, Analyst Says How It Fits His Earlier Wave Framework The comparison follows Cantonese Cat’s earlier Dec. 20 post outlining a longer-horizon DOGE roadmap on the weekly chart. “We’ve already had a 13 month bear market for DOGE, with my working hypothesis of this being likely a wave 2 correction prior to wave 3 explosion,” the analyst wrote. The accompanying weekly DOGE chart labels the prior advance as “Wave 1” and the subsequent decline as “Wave 2,” with a descending trendline drawn across the multi-year structure. The Dec. 20 weekly snapshot shows DOGE around $0.13160 with retracement levels including 0.382 at about $0.11771, and 0.236 at about $0.08427, with the base (“0”) around $0.04909. Above the current price, the analysis maps 0.5 at about $0.15422 as the next resistance, followed by 0.618 at about $0.20205, 0.707 at about $0.24770, 0.786 at about $0.29681, and 0.886 at about $0.37315, before the 1.0 level near $0.48442. Above the prior high, the same map plots extension targets often used in Elliott Wave projection frameworks, labeled near 1.272 ($0.90288), 1.414 ($1.24968), 1.618 ($1.99344), 2 ($4.77927), and 2.272 ($8.90771). The implication is conditional: the extensions matter only if DOGE completes the corrective phase and reclaims the prior impulse high.

56565152,649365,1767045624,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56565152.jpeg,XRP ETFs Set To Trigger A Supply Squeeze? Here’s How Much Coins Are Left On Exchanges,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-etfs-trigger-supply-squeeze/,"XRP ETF activity is pushing the asset into a phase where market structure increasingly outweighs market sentiment, as exchange-held supply continues to contract while institutional access expands. Analysts are now examining whether sustained ETF absorption could function as a long-term demand sink, tightening liquid supply and reshaping the mechanics of price discovery. Shrinking Supply? Institutional Absorption Of XRP ETFs Accelerates A market commentator on X has drawn attention to a sharp and sustained decline in XRP balances held across centralized exchanges, pointing to a structural change in how the asset is being absorbed and held. According to the figures cited, XRP ETFs have removed approximately 750 million XRP from exchanges within a matter of weeks, leaving an estimated 1.5 billion XRP remaining in liquid exchange reserves . This pace of absorption places exchange-held supply on a visibly contracting trajectory. The same X account shared an on-chain chart that visually substantiates the decline in exchange-held XRP. The data shows total balances across centralized exchanges trending steadily lower throughout 2025. Notably, this contraction occurs while price action remains relatively contained, indicating that supply is being withdrawn from exchanges without provoking sharp directional moves. This separation between declining liquidity and stable pricing points to deliberate, conviction-driven absorption, consistent with long-term institutional positioning . ETF-held XRP, by design, functions as locked capital rather than short-term liquidity. Once absorbed into exchange-traded products and institutional custody structures, tokens are effectively sidelined from day-to-day trading activity. This creates a largely one-directional supply dynamic , reducing the amount of XRP available to respond to new demand. On-chain data visualized in the chart supports this interpretation, showing consistent outflows that persist through both local price peaks and pullbacks. Regulatory developments further contextualize this trend. The market commentator explicitly links the tightening supply to the Clarity Act , which provides a framework for compliant institutional participation. With clearer legal treatment, XRP becomes suitable for long-term balance sheet exposure and operational use. Why 2026 Is Emerging As A Structural Inflection Point The supply narrative gains additional weight when viewed through a forward-looking lens. Projections pointing to early 2026 as a potential supply shock window are based not on aggressive acceleration, but on simple continuation. At the current rate of ETF-driven absorption, exchange balances could approach critically thin levels, creating a low-float market structure where marginal demand exerts disproportionate influence on price. The chart underscores this risk. As exchange-held XRP compresses toward historically low territory, the remaining liquid supply increasingly defines price discovery. In such conditions, price formation shifts away from speculative churn and toward liquidity mechanics, where availability, custody constraints, and institutional flows dominate outcomes. Taken together, falling exchange balances , sustained ETF absorption , and the regulatory clarity introduced by the Clarity Act all point to a market steadily tightening. Should these conditions persist into early 2026, XRP’s next major phase is likely to be shaped by scarcity and institutional liquidity dynamics, establishing a structural inflection point for the asset.",XRP|ripple|ripple news|XRP ETF|XRP ETFs|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-29 22:00:24

Her departure follows a period of substantial regulatory clarification for the digital asset industry. Consequently, market participants now reflect on her contributions. LaMothe notably spearheaded critical staff statements that provided much-needed guidance on contentious issues. These included the regulatory status of memecoins and the complex framework surrounding staking services. SEC Crypto Regulation Under Cicely LaMothe’s Stewardship Cicely LaMothe’s tenure at the SEC coincided with a period of intense scrutiny and rapid evolution within the cryptocurrency sector. Her role placed her at the forefront of interpreting how existing securities laws applied to novel digital assets. Therefore, her work directly influenced compliance strategies for countless blockchain projects and financial institutions. The Division of Corporation Finance, which she helped lead, plays a crucial role in reviewing corporate filings and providing interpretive guidance. Under her direction, the division tackled some of the most ambiguous areas in fintech. Moreover, her approach was characterized by a methodical analysis of the Howey Test and other legal benchmarks. This legal test determines whether an asset qualifies as an investment contract, and thus a security. LaMothe’s team applied this framework to various crypto offerings, seeking to draw clear lines in a often-murky landscape. Her statements did not create new law but offered the SEC staff’s authoritative interpretation of existing statutes. This guidance became essential reading for legal teams and developers alike. Clarifying the Memecoin Securities Debate One of LaMothe’s most cited contributions was the 2024 staff statement on memecoins. This guidance addressed a growing market segment fueled by social media trends and community engagement. The statement clarified that simply being a meme-based digital asset does not automatically classify it as a security. Instead, the determination hinges on the economic realities surrounding its creation and distribution. The staff outlined several key factors that would trigger securities laws: Expectation of Profits: Primarily from the efforts of a centralized development team or promoter. Fundraising Function: If the token launch primarily served to raise capital for project development. Ongoing Promotional Activities: Systematic efforts by creators to influence the asset’s market price. This framework provided relief to many community-driven joke tokens while maintaining the SEC’s enforcement posture against fraudulent initial coin offerings (ICOs) disguised as memes. As a result, the statement helped segment the market between genuine community tokens and unregistered securities offerings. Impact on Market Practices and Legal Precedents The memecoin guidance had immediate real-world effects. Following its publication, several projects revised their marketing materials and token distribution models to align with the stated principles. Legal experts referenced the document in advisory opinions and even in court filings as indicative of the SEC’s contemporary thinking. However, the statement also drew criticism from some who argued it did not go far enough in providing safe harbors. Despite this, it stands as a foundational text in the ongoing dialogue between regulators and the crypto community. Outlining the SEC’s Position on Crypto Staking Another landmark guidance led by LaMothe addressed the regulatory treatment of staking-as-a-service programs. Staking, a process where users lock up tokens to support network operations and earn rewards, presented a novel challenge. The SEC staff statement analyzed whether these programs constituted investment contracts. It focused on the role of the service provider and the promises made to participants. The guidance emphasized that centralized staking services, where users surrender control of their assets to a third party expecting returns from that entity’s efforts, likely fall under securities regulations. Conversely, decentralized, non-custodial staking by individuals for network validation presented a different analysis. This distinction proved crucial for both large exchanges offering staking products and for proof-of-stake blockchain networks themselves. Key Elements in SEC’s Staking Guidance Analysis Factor Likely a Security Less Likely a Security Asset Control Custodial (user gives keys to provider) Non-custodial (user retains control) Profit Source Promised returns from provider’s efforts Protocol-defined rewards for network service Marketing Emphasis Advertised as an investment product Framed as a network participation tool The Broader Context of Regulatory Evolution LaMothe’s work occurred during a transformative era for financial regulation. The SEC, under multiple chairmen, grappled with balancing investor protection with technological innovation. Her staff statements served as interim navigational aids while Congress debated comprehensive crypto legislation. These documents filled a regulatory gap, providing stakeholders with actionable insights despite the absence of final rules. Furthermore, her departure coincides with increased institutional adoption of digital assets. Major banks and asset managers now engage with cryptocurrencies, making clear regulatory signals more vital than ever. The precedents set during her term will likely influence the SEC’s posture for years. They also establish a benchmark for how future regulators may approach similar technological disruptions in finance. Expert Perspectives on the Legacy Legal scholars and former SEC officials have weighed in on the significance of this transition. Professor Alan Michaels of Georgetown Law noted, ‘Staff interpretations like those led by LaMothe provide critical market stability. They offer a window into the agency’s enforcement priorities without the full force of a rulemaking.’ Meanwhile, industry advocates have expressed hope that her successor will continue a policy of engaged clarification. The balance between firm enforcement and productive guidance remains a central challenge for the Division of Corporation Finance. Conclusion Cicely LaMothe’s completion of her term at the SEC marks the end of a consequential chapter in SEC crypto regulation. Her leadership in authoring guidance on memecoins and staking provided essential clarity during a period of significant uncertainty. These staff statements helped shape legal strategies, compliance frameworks, and market structures within the digital asset ecosystem. As the regulatory landscape continues to evolve, the foundations laid during her tenure will serve as critical reference points. The search for her successor now becomes a focal point for an industry keenly aware of the importance of regulatory dialogue and thoughtful oversight. FAQs Q1: What was Cicely LaMothe’s role at the SEC? As Deputy Director of the Division of Corporation Finance, she helped oversee the review of corporate filings and was instrumental in developing staff interpretive guidance on applying securities laws to new financial technologies, including cryptocurrency. Q2: What did the SEC staff statement on memecoins clarify? The statement clarified that a memecoin is not automatically a security. The determination depends on factors like whether investors have an expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others, such as a central development team actively promoting the asset. Q3: How did the guidance define the SEC’s position on staking? It distinguished between custodial staking-as-a-service programs, which likely constitute investment contracts (securities), and non-custodial staking performed by individuals directly on a blockchain network, which may not. Q4: Are these staff statements legally binding law? No, they are not formal rules or laws. They are interpretive guidance that explains how the SEC staff views certain activities under existing statutes. However, they strongly indicate areas of enforcement focus and are highly influential. Q5: What happens to this guidance now that LaMothe has left? The staff statements remain published SEC guidance unless formally rescinded or superseded by new commission rules, court rulings, or subsequent staff interpretations. They continue to inform the market and SEC enforcement approaches.

This declaration, made during a press briefing at the White House, immediately sent ripples through financial markets and policy circles. The President notably added that the possibility of firing Powell remains on the table, raising fundamental questions about Federal Reserve independence. This announcement comes at a critical juncture for the U.S. economy, with inflation concerns and interest rate decisions hanging in the balance. Federal Reserve Chair Appointment Enters Critical Phase The Federal Reserve Chair position represents one of the most powerful economic roles globally. Consequently, the occupant directly influences interest rates, employment levels, and price stability. President Trump’s January timeline for announcing Powell’s successor creates immediate uncertainty. Historically, Fed chairs serve four-year terms, with Powell’s current term technically expiring in February 2026. However, presidents typically announce reappointments or new nominations well in advance. This accelerated timeline suggests significant political considerations. Market analysts immediately began speculating about potential candidates. Furthermore, they examined the implications for monetary policy continuity. The Federal Reserve has maintained a delicate balance recently. It has fought inflation while attempting to avoid triggering a recession. Any perceived political interference in this process could undermine market confidence. International observers also watch closely, as Fed decisions affect global capital flows and exchange rates. Historical Context of Federal Reserve Independence The Federal Reserve operates with statutory independence from direct political control. This principle, established over decades, allows the central bank to make difficult decisions without short-term political pressure. Presidents have occasionally criticized Fed chairs, but direct threats of removal remain rare. The Federal Reserve Act states that governors, including the chair, may only be removed “for cause.” Legal experts debate what constitutes sufficient cause, creating a gray area. Previous presidents have faced similar tensions with the Fed. President Lyndon Johnson reportedly confronted Fed Chair William McChesney Martin over rate hikes. President Richard Nixon pressured Arthur Burns during the 1970s. However, no modern president has publicly discussed firing a sitting Fed chair. This precedent makes Trump’s comments particularly noteworthy. The institutional relationship between the White House and the Fed faces a potential stress test. Economic Implications of Leadership Uncertainty Financial markets dislike uncertainty above almost all else. The prospect of a Fed chair change injects volatility into bond markets, currency valuations, and equity prices. Investors must now consider multiple scenarios. Will President Trump nominate a dovish candidate favoring lower rates? Alternatively, might he choose a hawkish inflation fighter? Each possibility carries different implications for borrowing costs and economic growth. The timing coincides with several economic challenges. Inflation remains above the Fed’s 2% target in many sectors. Meanwhile, economic growth shows signs of moderation. The Fed’s dual mandate requires balancing maximum employment with price stability. A leadership change could signal a shift in priorities between these sometimes competing goals. Businesses planning investments and hiring decisions may pause until clarity emerges. Potential Candidates for Federal Reserve Leadership Several names circulate in policy discussions as potential successors. Each candidate brings different philosophies and backgrounds. The selection will signal the administration’s economic policy direction for the coming years. Current Fed Governors: Several sitting Federal Reserve Board members understand the institution’s complexities. Their experience could ensure continuity during transition periods. Academic Economists: Presidents sometimes select renowned economists from leading universities. These candidates typically possess deep theoretical knowledge but may lack political experience. Financial Sector Executives: Leaders from banking or investment firms offer practical market experience. However, they may face scrutiny over potential conflicts of interest. International Candidates: While unusual, some past administrations considered economists with strong international credentials, particularly during global economic crises. Recent Federal Reserve Chairs and Their Tenures Chair Years Served Appointing President Key Challenge Jerome Powell 2018-Present Donald Trump Post-pandemic inflation surge Janet Yellen 2014-2018 Barack Obama Normalizing rates after financial crisis Ben Bernanke 2006-2014 George W. Bush 2008 global financial crisis Alan Greenspan 1987-2006 Ronald Reagan Dot-com bubble and 9/11 aftermath Legal and Constitutional Considerations The Federal Reserve Act provides limited guidance on chair removal. Section 10 states that governors shall hold office for fourteen years unless “removed for cause by the President.” Legal scholars debate whether policy disagreements constitute sufficient cause. Most interpretations suggest removal requires malfeasance, neglect of duty, or criminal conduct. A president attempting removal over policy differences would likely face immediate legal challenges. Congressional reaction will prove crucial. Many legislators from both parties value Fed independence. They might resist perceived political interference through hearings or legislation. The Senate confirms Fed chair nominees, giving senators substantial influence. A controversial nominee could face difficult confirmation hearings. These political dynamics create checks and balances in the appointment process. Global Reactions and Market Responses International central banks monitor Fed leadership closely. The U.S. dollar serves as the world’s primary reserve currency. Therefore, Federal Reserve decisions affect economies everywhere. Foreign officials generally prefer stability and predictability from their American counterparts. Surprise changes could disrupt coordinated international policy efforts. Financial markets reacted immediately to the announcement. The dollar experienced volatility against major currencies. Treasury yields showed unusual movements as bond traders adjusted expectations. Equity markets displayed sector-specific reactions, with rate-sensitive industries like real estate and utilities showing particular sensitivity. These market responses demonstrate the Fed chair’s global significance. Conclusion President Trump’s announcement regarding the Federal Reserve Chair position creates significant economic and institutional uncertainty. The January timeline for naming a potential successor to Jerome Powell, coupled with remarks about possible removal, tests traditional boundaries between politics and central banking. This situation unfolds against a complex economic backdrop requiring careful monetary stewardship. The coming months will reveal whether institutional norms withstand political pressure. Ultimately, the Federal Reserve’s ability to maintain price stability and support maximum employment may depend on navigating this leadership transition while preserving its operational independence. The decision about the next Federal Reserve Chair will undoubtedly shape economic policy for years beyond this administration. FAQs Q1: Can the President actually fire the Federal Reserve Chair? The Federal Reserve Act states that governors, including the chair, may only be removed “for cause.” Legal interpretations generally limit this to misconduct or neglect of duty, not policy disagreements. Any attempt to remove a chair over policy would likely face immediate legal challenges. Q2: When does Jerome Powell’s current term as Fed Chair end? Powell’s current four-year term as Chair technically expires in February 2026. However, his term as a Federal Reserve Board governor continues until 2028, allowing him to remain on the Board even if not serving as Chair. Q3: Why is Federal Reserve independence important? Central bank independence allows monetary policy decisions based on economic data rather than short-term political considerations. This independence helps control inflation, maintain financial stability, and build long-term market confidence in the currency. Q4: How might financial markets react to a Fed Chair change? Markets typically experience increased volatility during leadership uncertainty. Bond yields, currency values, and stock prices may fluctuate as investors assess the policy direction of potential successors. Rate-sensitive sectors often show particular sensitivity. Q5: What happens if the Senate rejects a Fed Chair nominee? The President would need to submit a new nominee. During the confirmation process, the Vice Chair or another Board member would likely serve as acting chair. This interim period could extend if multiple nominees face rejection or withdrawal.

The scale and concentration of this liquidity, much of it sitting idle, have sharpened focus on whether the market is primed for its next major move once sentiment flips. $69B in Stablecoins Cluster on Binance as Liquidity Waits CryptoQuant contributor Crazzyblockk wrote on December 29 that exchange-held stablecoin reserves stand at $69 billion, representing about 22% of the entire stablecoin market. Binance alone holds $49 billion, or roughly 71% of all exchange-based stablecoin buying power, making it the single largest pool of deployable capital in crypto. Crazzyblockk’s analysis also revealed a striking gap between venues, with OKX following with around $10 billion, while Bybit holds close to $3 billion. Together, the top three exchanges control about 94% of exchange stablecoin reserves, with the market watcher describing this concentration as crypto’s largest liquidity pool to date. December data shows capital has not rushed in yet. Some $8 billion in stablecoins left exchanges during the month, including $3 billion from Bybit and about $2 billion from Binance, while OKX stayed near the $10 billion mark. But even after these outflows, Binance still holds close to 15% of the entire global stablecoin supply. CryptoQuant’s view is that such reserves matter most when sentiment changes. Exchanges with deeper pools can deploy capital first, and with over two-thirds of exchange liquidity on Binance, much of the initial buying pressure would likely pass through a single venue if risk appetite returns. Crazzyblockk added that on-chain activity has dropped by about 40%, while whales accumulated around 20,000 BTC and futures open interest expanded by $2 billion, leaving everything in place for a market move except the trigger. Market Signals Mixed as Bitcoin Struggles Near Resistance Bitcoin rebounded earlier today to around $90,000, up about 2% in 24 hours, before meeting resistance. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) reclaimed $3,000, while major altcoins such as BNB and XRP also bounced, suggesting short-term relief across the market. Still, experts remain split. One of them, CW, noted that retail traders and whales were buying at the same time, particularly on Binance, while Ali Martinez warned the move could be another short-lived rebound, pointing to negative capital flows and continued spot ETF outflows. Analyst nino added another layer of caution using derivatives data. According to them, Bitcoin futures funding rates are quite high across 72-hour averages, a sign that leverage has not fully reset. Without that cooling, the market may struggle to sustain a stronger recovery. Looking ahead, macro expectations for 2026, including easier monetary policy and possible capital rotation into risk assets, have kept longer-term optimism alive. However, for now, the record stablecoin stockpile shows capital is ready, but patience is still the dominant trade until a clearer catalyst appears.

The incident has led to concerns across the crypto industry around browser-based wallets and the growing risks faced by retail-heavy communities. As one of the largest and most active ecosystems in crypto, members of the Shiba Inu community have found themselves at the center of discussions on the failure that exposed many crypto holders. Trust Wallet Extension Exploit Raises Alarm Across SHIB Community The breach in question refers to a compromised version of the Trust Wallet Chrome browser extension, specifically version 2.68. Code embedded in the update allowed attackers to access wallets and drain funds without users realizing what was happening. Several cryptocurrencies were affected, and the precise breakdown of losses by asset is currently unclear. Even so, the incident has drawn particular attention inside the Shiba Inu community due to the sheer size of its holder base and the widespread use of browser wallets among SHIB investors. Warnings quickly circulated within the SHIB ecosystem. For instance, the Susbarium | Shibarium Trustwatch account issued a public alert on the social media platform X , encouraging users to immediately disable extension version 2.68 and update to version 2.69 from the official Chrome Web Store. The notice also clarified that mobile users and other extension versions were unaffected, helping to narrow the scope of concern and reduce panic. These warnings aligned with official updates from the Trust Wallet team, which acknowledged the breach and moved quickly to contain it. What Comes Next After The Trust Wallet Breach? As the immediate fallout from the Trust Wallet browser extension breach settles, the next thing is resolution and accountability. In terms of the scale of damage, Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao stated that the breach resulted in about $7 million in losses across affected Trust Wallet accounts. Trust Wallet subsequently announced that it would reimburse all victims of the security incident. Further insight came from Eowyn Chen, CEO of Trust Wallet, who shared a December 28 update addressing the ongoing investigation. Chen acknowledged the disruption caused by the incident and noted that the team was prioritizing accuracy over speed in the compensation process. According to Chen, Trust Wallet has so far identified 2,596 affected wallet addresses. However, the company has received around 5,000 reimbursement claims, revealing a large number of false or duplicate submissions. The episode is another reminder that infrastructure risks can impact even the most established projects in the crypto space. Particularly, the situation revived memories of earlier security incidents tied to the Shiba Inu ecosystem. The most recent example was in September 2025, when the Shibarium bridge was exploited through a flash loan attack that resulted in losses estimated at about $4.1 million worth of assets, including ETH, SHIB, and KNINE.",Shiba Inu|binance|Changpeng Zhao|Chrome Web Store|Eowyn Chen|KNINE|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|Shibarium Trustwatch|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT|Susbarium|Trust Wallet,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|SHIB|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY|SECURITY INCIDENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-29 23:00:33

Bulls are struggling to find reliable support as price action weakens, and recent attempts at stabilization have failed to attract sustained demand. The loss of this psychological and structural level has left XRP vulnerable, with traders increasingly positioning defensively amid broader uncertainty across the altcoin market. Related Reading: Why $100,000 Is Bitcoin’s Most Important Resistance Level According to analysis shared by Darkfost, selling pressure on XRP has intensified materially over recent weeks. The data shows that the current move is not a minor pullback, but part of a deeper corrective phase. XRP has declined by roughly 50% from its cycle peak near $3.66, falling toward the $1.85 region. This magnitude of decline reflects a clear shift in market behavior, as earlier optimism has given way to risk reduction and capital preservation. Darkfost’s assessment suggests that the increase in selling is driven by a combination of profit-taking from older positions and capitulation from more recent buyers who entered at higher levels. As the price moves further away from prior highs, confidence has deteriorated, reinforcing the downside momentum. Exchange Inflows Highlight Rising Sell-Side Pressure Darkfost further explains that the recent surge in selling pressure becomes especially clear when examining XRP inflows to exchanges, with Binance standing out as the primary focal point. As the exchange that concentrates the largest share of XRP trading volume, Binance often serves as an early indicator of shifting market intent. Rising inflows to exchanges are commonly interpreted as a signal that holders are preparing to sell, particularly when the increase is sudden and sustained. After several weeks of relatively calm conditions, characterized by stable and moderate inflows, this pattern changed sharply around December 15. Since then, XRP transfers to Binance have accelerated, with daily inflows consistently ranging between 35 million XRP and a pronounced spike of roughly 116 million XRP recorded on December 19. This marks a clear break from the prior holding-oriented behavior observed through much of October and November. The shift in inflow dynamics suggests a change in investor psychology. Longer-term holders appear to be taking profits after XRP’s strong run earlier in the cycle, while more recent entrants are increasingly capitulating and selling at a loss as the price continues to slide. This combination amplifies downside pressure and reinforces the current corrective trend. As long as elevated exchange inflows persist, conditions for accumulation remain unfavorable. Without a meaningful slowdown in deposits, XRP is likely to struggle to form a durable base, increasing the risk that the correction extends further in both time and depth. Related Reading: Trust Wallet Exploit Drains $7M: Hundreds Of Users Affected XRP Price Action Details: Testing Demand XRP continues to trade under clear technical pressure, with price hovering near the $1.87–$1.90 zone after a prolonged downtrend on the daily chart. The structure shows a decisive loss of bullish control following the rejection from the $3.00–$3.50 region earlier in the year. Since that peak, XRP has consistently printed lower highs and lower lows, confirming a bearish market structure that remains intact. From a trend perspective, the price is trading below all major moving averages. The short-term moving average has turned sharply lower and now acts as immediate dynamic resistance, while the medium- and long-term averages are also sloping downward, reinforcing the broader bearish bias. Each recent attempt at a relief bounce has failed below these averages, suggesting that sellers continue to dominate rallies. Related Reading: Bitcoin and Ethereum Coinbase Inflows Collapse While Binance Retains Relative Activity – Details The $1.80–$1.85 region is now a critical support area. This zone has absorbed several tests in recent weeks, indicating short-term demand, but the lack of a strong rebound highlights weak buying conviction. A clean break below this level would expose XRP to a deeper retracement toward the $1.50 region, where historical demand previously emerged. Unless XRP can reclaim the $2.10–$2.20 range and hold above it, the path of least resistance remains to the downside, with risks skewed toward further consolidation or continuation of the correction.

According to a definitive report from analytics firm Delphi Digital, GameFi investment has collapsed by more than 55% this year compared to 2024. This dramatic decline signals a profound shift for an industry grappling with unmet expectations and cooling investor enthusiasm. However, within this challenging landscape, a new hybrid model—termed Web2.5—is demonstrating resilient, quiet growth by integrating blockchain technology more subtly into traditional gaming frameworks. GameFi Investment Faces a Severe 2025 Contraction Delphi Digital’s comprehensive market analysis reveals a sobering picture for GameFi funding. The firm meticulously tracks venture capital, private equity, and token launch investments specifically targeting blockchain-based games and gaming infrastructure. Their 2025 year-to-date data shows a contraction exceeding 55%, a figure that underscores a significant market correction. This decline follows several years of explosive growth where billions flowed into play-to-earn models and metaverse projects. Consequently, the current downturn represents not just a cyclical dip but a fundamental reassessment of the sector’s value proposition and timeline for mainstream adoption. Several interrelated factors drive this investment pullback. First, macroeconomic pressures on the broader cryptocurrency market have reduced risk capital availability. Second, regulatory uncertainty surrounding digital assets continues to deter institutional investors. Finally, and most critically, the performance of launched titles has failed to meet lofty expectations. Many highly funded projects promised revolutionary economies but delivered clunky experiences or unsustainable tokenomics. This execution gap has led to investor fatigue and a more cautious due diligence process. The Underperformance of Anticipated Titles The cooling enthusiasm that Delphi Digital notes stems directly from a series of high-profile disappointments. Several blockchain games that secured nine-figure investments in 2023 and 2024 launched to middling reviews and poor player retention in 2025. Analysts point to common pitfalls: Economic Imbalance: Play-to-earn mechanics often prioritized speculative asset accumulation over fun, leading to inflationary death spirals. Technical Hurdles: Complex wallet integrations and high transaction fees created barriers for non-crypto-native gamers. Quality Gap: Gameplay and graphics frequently lagged behind established Web2 titles, failing to justify the added blockchain complexity. This pattern of underperformance triggered a loss of confidence. Venture firms that once raced to back any project with “GameFi” in its pitch deck now demand proven studios, demonstrable gameplay loops, and sustainable monetization plans. The era of funding whitepapers and concept art has decisively ended. The market now rewards substance over speculation, forcing developers to focus on core gaming fundamentals before layering on blockchain elements. Expert Analysis: A Necessary Market Correction Industry veterans frame this downturn as an inevitable and healthy consolidation. “The 55% drop in GameFi investment is a brutal but necessary reset,” notes a senior analyst from a competing crypto research firm who requested anonymity for candid commentary. “It filters out projects that were purely financial instruments disguised as games. The capital remaining is smarter, more patient, and focused on long-term player engagement rather than short-term token pumps. This painful process ultimately strengthens the ecosystem’s foundation for future growth.” This perspective aligns with historical tech cycles, where hype-driven bubbles precede periods of focused, utility-driven development. The Quiet Ascent of Web2.5 Gaming Models Amidst the GameFi sector’s struggles, Delphi Digital highlights a counter-trend: the steady growth of Web2.5 games. This emerging category represents a pragmatic middle ground. Web2.5 games are primarily high-quality, traditional video games that selectively incorporate blockchain technology for specific use cases—not as their core revenue driver. Examples include: Using non-fungible tokens (NFTs) for verifiable, tradable cosmetic items like skins or costumes, leaving core gameplay unaffected. Implementing decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to allow portable player profiles and reputations across multiple games. Employing smart contracts for transparent, community-governed prize pools in esports tournaments. This approach avoids the pitfalls of full “play-to-earn” by making blockchain an optional, background feature that enhances rather than defines the experience. Major traditional gaming studios, previously skeptical of crypto, are now experimenting with these limited integrations. Their vast resources, design expertise, and existing player bases give Web2.5 initiatives a significant advantage over native GameFi startups. Consequently, investment, while quieter, is flowing toward these hybrid experiments from both crypto-native funds and traditional gaming venture arms. GameFi vs. Web2.5 Investment & Focus (2025) Model Primary Investment Trend Core Focus Example Feature Traditional GameFi Sharp Decline (-55%) In-game economy & asset speculation Earning tokens through gameplay Web2.5 Hybrid Quiet Growth Player experience & optional utility Tradable cosmetic NFT items Broader Impacts on the Cryptocurrency Ecosystem The GameFi investment slump creates ripple effects across the broader crypto industry. Layer-1 and Layer-2 blockchains that prioritized gaming as a key use case now face reduced developer activity and user acquisition on their networks. Native gaming tokens have seen valuations plummet, impacting decentralized exchanges and lending protocols that listed them. Furthermore, the metaverse vision, often intertwined with GameFi, has lost a primary driver of user engagement and virtual land sales. This contraction forces infrastructure projects to diversify their application focus beyond gaming, potentially accelerating development in decentralized finance (DeFi), social media, and supply chain solutions. However, the situation is not uniformly negative. The capital and developer talent leaving speculative GameFi projects are migrating to more robust sectors. Skilled game designers are applying their craft in Web2.5 environments. Blockchain engineers are refining scalability solutions that benefit all decentralized applications. This redistribution of resources, while painful in the short term, may increase the overall maturity and resilience of the Web3 space. The market is effectively reallocating human and financial capital to areas with clearer paths to utility and adoption. Conclusion The 55% decline in GameFi investment during 2025 marks a pivotal moment for blockchain gaming. Delphi Digital’s data confirms a difficult year defined by underperforming titles and cooled enthusiasm. This downturn represents a necessary market correction that shifts focus from financial speculation to genuine player value and sustainable design. Simultaneously, the quiet growth of Web2.5 models offers a pragmatic path forward, blending the proven strengths of traditional gaming with selective blockchain enhancements. The future of gaming on the blockchain now depends less on grandiose economic promises and more on seamless, enjoyable experiences that leverage decentralized technology where it truly adds value. The GameFi sector’s brutal reset may ultimately forge a stronger, more credible industry. FAQs Q1: What does a 55% drop in GameFi investment actually mean? A1: It means the total amount of money (from venture capital, grants, token sales, etc.) invested in blockchain gaming projects in 2025 is less than half of what it was in 2024. This indicates a major loss of confidence and a shift toward more cautious, selective funding. Q2: What are Web2.5 games, and how do they differ from GameFi? A2: Web2.5 games are primarily traditional, high-quality video games that optionally use blockchain for specific features—like verifiable item ownership—without making crypto economics the core gameplay loop. GameFi typically makes earning and trading crypto assets the central activity. Q3: Why did so many anticipated GameFi titles underperform? A3: Common reasons include prioritizing complex tokenomics over fun gameplay, technical barriers for users, unsustainable “play-to-earn” economies that inflated quickly, and a general quality gap compared to top-tier non-blockchain games. Q4: Is the GameFi sector dead after this report? A4: No, it is not dead but undergoing a severe correction and maturation phase. Investment is becoming more discerning, focusing on projects with strong gameplay fundamentals and realistic blockchain integration, rather than speculative concepts. Q5: How does this affect the average cryptocurrency investor or gamer? A5: For gamers, it may mean fewer pure “play-to-earn” launches but higher-quality hybrid experiences. For investors, it signals extreme caution with gaming tokens and a need to scrutinize a project’s actual gameplay and user adoption, not just its token model.

The token reached a high of $3.66 in July 2025, leading many analysts to predict significant upward potential. However, price action since then has been weaker than expected, raising the question: if the most optimistic calls do not materialize, what could a conservative outcome look like by 2035? Unrealized Bullish Forecasts Earlier in the year, when XRP hovered around $3.15, several market watchers presented ambitious targets. Mario Nawfal suggested that a move to $10 was possible if Bitcoin reached $225,000 by the end of 2025. Around the same period, Carl Moon speculated that XRP could rise as high as $30 under extremely favorable conditions. As of now, those projections remain unmet. The asset has fallen by about 44% from its July peak to $1.86 , indicating that broad optimism does not always translate into immediate price appreciation. With the year closing out below bullish expectations, some investors have shifted focus to evaluating conservative outcomes further into the future. Examining Downside Scenarios Through 2035 To assess potential lower-bound valuations, Google Gemini was consulted for a worst-case forecast. The model proposed that XRP could reach approximately $8 by 2035 even under restricted growth conditions. This would represent about a fourfold increase from current pricing, modest when compared to multi-digit predictions, but still notable given current market pressure. Gemini outlined several elements that could limit expansion. These include competition from central bank digital currencies, continued reliance on legacy payment systems like SWIFT , unresolved debates regarding decentralization, and macroeconomic instability. Limited institutional integration or slow adoption could also suppress performance. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Still, Gemini acknowledged that XRP is unlikely to remain at present levels indefinitely. It argued that progress in regulatory clarity following the SEC case and continued RippleNet usage, especially in emerging markets, may support gradual appreciation. Under the $8 outcome, XRP would retain a role within specific financial segments without becoming a dominant global settlement asset. Contrasting Forecasts Views among analysts differ widely. Researchers at Bitget presented an even more restrained outlook, proposing $3.8 as a potential floor and $5.55 as an upper limit by 2035. Their projected ceiling remains below Gemini’s worst-case scenario, illustrating how conservative some forecasts have become. Conversely, projections from Telegaon position XRP much higher. Their estimates suggest that by 2035, XRP could trade within a range of $35.47 to $40.29, assuming favourable adoption and macro conditions. This view maintains confidence in XRP’s long-term potential, although it depends on strong institutional integration and global expansion. While projections for XRP’s future vary widely, the estimates show that its performance over the next decade will largely depend on adoption, regulation, and real-world integration. Conservative models still indicate moderate growth by 2035, while more optimistic outlooks leave room for substantial appreciation if institutional usage increases.

Market analyst Dominic Basulto from The Motley Fool believes that despite the persistent challenges seen in the fourth quarter of the year, Bitcoin could soar to $150,000 by 2026, fueled by the newly established US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Is $150,000 Possible For Bitcoin? Historical context supports Basulto’s prediction; Bitcoin’s performance over the years has shown significant recovery potential, with 2015 marking its worst bull market year at just a 36% gain. Significantly, in seven of its years, Bitcoin has achieved triple-digit percentage returns. The analyst suggests that 2026 may resemble 2019, a year when Bitcoin appreciated by 95% following the dismal performance in 2018, when it plummeted by 74%. Related Reading: XRP Supply Shock Incoming? Expert Reveals The Truth In 2019, several catalysts, such as heightened global economic uncertainty and a surge in institutional interest, propelled Bitcoin upwards—situations that appear similar to current conditions. Institutional investors are increasingly adding BTC to their portfolios, driven by spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Meanwhile, concerns over global tariffs and macroeconomic instability in the US continue to resonate among investors, setting the stage for potential bullish movement. However, Basulto emphasizes that Bitcoin can only reach the $150,000 milestone if it is perceived as a long-term store of value. If investors view it merely as another high-risk asset, they may choose to favor physical gold over digital gold, which has seen a record-breaking year. The crux of his argument centers on one pivotal factor that could significantly impact Bitcoin’s price: a notable increase in purchases by the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. What Happens If Nations Stockpile BTC? Basulto claims that if the US government were to start buying substantial quantities of Bitcoin, it could trigger a global arms race among other countries keen to create their own strategic BTC reserves. According to the analyst, such purchases from national reserves could dramatically inflate Bitcoin’s price, likely surpassing the impact of corporate treasury companies that have already amassed close to 5% of the world’s circulating BTC supply. Related Reading: Investment Firm CEO Drops Utility Bomb On XRP, Is Community Hype A Detriment? Although reaching the $150,000 mark may seem ambitious given Bitcoin’s recent performance, more aggressive predictions exist for 2026. For instance, JPMorgan Chase has forecasted a potential price of $170,000, while Wall Street strategist Tom Lee from Fundstrat has suggested that BTC might even hit $250,000 next year. While a variety of factors must align for BTC to reclaim its status as digital gold, the possibility of elevated prices hinges on strategic actions by both the US government and institutional investors. Basulto concluded that if the leading cryptocurrency can consolidate its position and the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve gains traction, the predicted price of $150,000 could be achieved by next year. At the time of writing, BTC’s price retraced towards $87,330 following an early Monday move above $90,500.

56568587,649304,1767052852,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56568587.jpeg,Bitcoin Sees Post-Capitulation Conditions Align: Selling Pressure Falls 80%,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-sees-post-capitulation-conditions-align/,"Bitcoin continues to trade below the $90,000 level after multiple failed attempts to break higher since December 14, reinforcing a growing sense of caution across the market. Each rejection near this psychological threshold has added weight to the bearish narrative, with an increasing number of analysts now warning that Bitcoin may be entering a prolonged corrective phase in the year ahead. Despite this muted price action, on-chain data suggests a more nuanced picture beneath the surface. Top analyst Axel Adler recently shared a chart tracking Bitcoin realized losses using a seven-day moving average and a z-score framework, highlighting a clear transition from November’s extreme capitulation to a period of normalization in December. This metric measures the volume of losses realized when coins move, with the z-score used to identify stress extremes within the market. November marked the peak of selling pressure. On November 21–22, the realized loss z-score surged to between 8.7 and 10.9, with daily losses exceeding $5 billion. In comparison, the late-December spike on December 26, which reached a z-score near 1.6, appears relatively minor. More importantly, weekly realized losses have collapsed from roughly $2.4 billion at the peak to around $0.5 billion, returning to levels last seen in September and October. According to Adler, this sharp decline points to structural seller exhaustion rather than a temporary lull. Historically, markets often stabilize after such conditions, suggesting that while the price remains weak, downside pressure may be fading. Bitcoin Indicator Signals Fading Downside Pressure Adler’s report also highlights Bitcoin’s Net Realized Profit/Loss (P/L) metric, smoothed using a seven-day moving average, offering further insight into the market’s internal dynamics. This indicator tracks the balance between realized profits and realized losses over time. When the value is negative, losses dominate and capital is being destroyed; when positive, profit-taking outweighs loss realization. Currently, Bitcoin’s net realized P/L remains in negative territory, confirming that the market has not fully exited a risk-off regime. However, the direction of travel is notable. Over the final week of December, the depth of negative net P/L shrank by nearly half, signaling a meaningful reduction in loss intensity. Importantly, this improvement has unfolded without a strong price recovery, suggesting that the change is driven by seller exhaustion rather than an artificial price squeeze or short-term speculation. According to Adler, this behavior is structurally significant. When net realized P/L trends upward toward the zero line, it reflects a transition phase in which forced selling subsides, and marginal supply weakens. Historically, a sustained move back into positive territory has coincided with the early stages of local market recoveries. Taken together, the realized loss and net P/L charts present a consistent narrative. November appears to have absorbed the majority of weak hands, December functioned as an absorption and stabilization phase, and January could represent a potential inflection point—provided new demand begins to enter the market. Price Remains Range-Bounded Bitcoin remains locked in a tight consolidation below the $90,000 level, as shown on the 4-hour chart, reflecting persistent indecision after repeated failed breakout attempts. Price is currently trading near $87,600, holding within a narrow range that has defined market behavior throughout the second half of December. This structure highlights a balance between buyers defending local support and sellers consistently fading rallies. From a technical standpoint, Bitcoin is trading below the declining 200-period moving average, which continues to act as a key dynamic resistance near the $89,000–$90,000 zone. The 100-period moving average has flattened and is closely aligned with price, signaling a lack of momentum in either direction. Meanwhile, the shorter-term moving average has rolled over, reinforcing the short-term bearish bias and confirming that upside attempts are being absorbed. The price action since mid-December shows a clear compression pattern, with lower highs forming beneath resistance and higher lows developing above the $86,000–$87,000 support region. This tightening range suggests that volatility is being suppressed, often preceding a decisive move. Structurally, the $86,000 level remains critical. A clean breakdown below this support could open the door to a deeper retracement toward the low $80,000s. Conversely, reclaiming and holding above $90,000 would invalidate the current bearish structure and signal renewed upside momentum.

This pivotal development, reported from Seoul, South Korea, in early 2025, highlights a dramatic retreat from homegrown innovation, directly challenging the country’s ambitions as a global crypto hub. The trend underscores a broader industry pivot toward international assets, driven primarily by an increasingly cautious regulatory environment that now stifles local entrepreneurial spirit. Upbit’s 2025 Listing Data Reveals a Domestic Drought An analysis of Upbit’s 2025 activity reveals a stark numerical imbalance. The exchange, commanding an estimated 70% market share in South Korea, introduced 54 new cryptocurrencies to its trading platforms this year. However, only one of these assets, Story (IP), originated from a South Korean development team. This solitary ‘Kimchi coin’—a colloquial term for domestic crypto projects—stands in sharp contrast to the 53 other new listings, which primarily feature established global tokens and projects from regions with clearer regulatory frameworks. Concurrently, the delisting data further emphasizes the trend. Upbit removed ten cryptocurrencies from its exchange in 2025. Significantly, seven of those ten delisted projects were South Korean in origin. This dual action of minimal new inclusions and targeted removals has drastically reduced the overall presence and visibility of local blockchain ventures on the nation’s most critical trading venue. Consequently, retail and institutional investors now find a platform increasingly curated with international options, reshaping investment flows and market dynamics. The Regulatory Catalyst Behind Upbit’s Conservative Stance The primary driver for this conservative listing policy is a direct response to heightened government scrutiny and regulatory pressure. Following the implementation of the Travel Rule and stricter anti-money laundering (AML) guidelines, South Korean exchanges like Upbit now operate under a ‘regulatory microscope’. These platforms face severe penalties for listing assets that later encounter legal or security issues. Therefore, exchanges have adopted profoundly risk-averse internal policies to ensure compliance and maintain their operating licenses. This regulatory uncertainty creates a significant barrier for local projects. Unlike international tokens with longer track records on global exchanges, new South Korean ‘Kimchi coins’ must navigate a gauntlet of pre-listing reviews that scrutinize everything from tokenomics and team backgrounds to whitepaper claims and utility. The table below contrasts the typical listing evaluation criteria for domestic versus international projects on major South Korean exchanges as of 2025: Evaluation Criteria Domestic ‘Kimchi Coin’ Project Established International Project Regulatory History Check Extensive audit of Korean FIU compliance Review of major global exchange listings Team Due Diligence Deep background checks on all Korean members Focus on core developers and public figures Legal Opinion Requirement Mandatory from a Korean law firm Often waived if listed on top-5 global exchanges Market Provenance Must prove novel utility for Korean market Accepted based on global trading volume & liquidity This disparate process means domestic startups incur higher costs and face longer delays, making them less competitive for precious exchange listing slots. The result is a chilling effect where entrepreneurs either pivot their projects to target international markets first or abandon blockchain initiatives altogether. Industry Experts Decry the Innovation Exodus Industry leaders and analysts are vocal about the long-term consequences. “We are witnessing a capital and brain drain,” stated a senior blockchain analyst at a Seoul-based fintech research firm, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive regulatory climate. “When a local giant like Upbit lists one domestic project against dozens of foreign ones, it sends a clear signal to venture capitalists and developers. The message is that the path to success for a Korean Web3 company now bypasses the Korean market entirely.” This sentiment is echoed by developers. Many point to the 2017-2018 boom period, where ‘Kimchi coins’ often led market rallies, as a contrast to today’s environment. The current framework prioritizes investor protection to such a degree that it inadvertently stifles the very innovation needed for the sector to mature. Experts argue that without clear, innovation-friendly regulations—such as the proposed Digital Asset Basic Act which remains delayed in the National Assembly—South Korea risks ceding its early-mover advantage to jurisdictions like Japan, Singapore, and the European Union, which are advancing comprehensive crypto asset frameworks. Comparative Global Landscape and South Korea’s Position Globally, the approach to exchange listings varies significantly, placing South Korea’s current stance in clear relief. In markets like the United Arab Emirates and Switzerland, regulatory ‘sandboxes’ allow projects to launch and test under supervised conditions. Meanwhile, Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) maintains a rigorous but transparent approval process for all crypto exchanges and listed coins, providing certainty for businesses. South Korea’s current model, by comparison, is often described as ‘reactive regulation’. Key characteristics include: Ex-ante Uncertainty: Rules are often clarified only after issues arise, leaving exchanges to preemptively restrict listings. Banking Barrier: The reliance on real-name verified bank accounts for crypto trading creates a bottleneck controlled by traditional finance institutions wary of regulatory reprisal. Enforcement Focus: Recent years have seen high-profile enforcement actions against exchange executives, further incentivizing extreme caution over market growth. This environment has not only affected listings but also broader blockchain infrastructure development. Major Korean conglomerates (chaebols) that once explored ambitious blockchain projects have scaled back their public-facing initiatives, opting instead for private, permissioned enterprise solutions that attract less regulatory attention. The Ripple Effects on Investors and the Market For the average South Korean crypto investor, Upbit’s listing trend has tangible impacts. The diversification of portfolios is now skewed toward international assets, exposing investors to different market cycles and geopolitical risks. Furthermore, the lack of local projects means fewer opportunities to invest in familiar companies or concepts rooted in the Korean economy and culture. Market data shows a correlation between listing policies and trading volumes. Pairs involving the few remaining major ‘Kimchi coins’ have seen volatility spikes, as they become concentrated assets within a shrinking domestic pool. Conversely, liquidity for major global tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum on Korean exchanges has deepened, aligning prices more closely with international benchmarks and reducing the infamous ‘Kimchi premium’—a phenomenon where crypto prices in Korea once traded significantly higher than elsewhere. Conclusion The revelation that Upbit listed only one South Korean ‘Kimchi coin’ among 54 new assets in 2025 is more than a statistical anomaly; it is a critical indicator of the state of the nation’s blockchain industry. This trend, fueled by risk-averse policies stemming from regulatory uncertainty, has significantly diminished the platform for domestic innovation. While investor protection remains paramount, the current imbalance threatens to export South Korea’s crypto talent and entrepreneurial energy. The onus now falls on policymakers to provide the clear, forward-looking framework that exchanges and startups desperately need. The future of South Korea’s position in the global digital asset landscape hinges on resolving this regulatory impasse and rediscovering a balance between safety and innovation. FAQs Q1: What is a ‘Kimchi coin’? A ‘Kimchi coin’ is a slang term used within South Korea to refer to cryptocurrency projects that are developed domestically by Korean teams and primarily launched on Korean exchanges. Q2: Why is Upbit’s listing policy so important for South Korea? Upbit holds an estimated 70% market share of cryptocurrency trading in South Korea. Its listing decisions directly control which assets millions of Korean investors can access, making it a gatekeeper that shapes the entire domestic market. Q3: What specific regulations are causing exchanges to be risk-averse? Key regulations include the strict enforcement of the Financial Action Task Force’s Travel Rule (which mandates sharing sender/receiver information), stringent anti-money laundering (AML) requirements, and the potential for severe penalties if a listed token is later deemed non-compliant or involved in a scandal. Q4: Has the ‘Kimchi premium’ disappeared due to these trends? The ‘Kimchi premium’—the historical price gap where cryptocurrencies traded higher in Korea—has significantly narrowed and stabilized. This is partly due to markets becoming more efficient and Korean liquidity being dominated by global assets whose prices are set on international venues. Q5: Are other South Korean exchanges following the same trend as Upbit? Yes, other major exchanges like Bithumb and Korbit have adopted similarly cautious listing policies. The entire sector operates under the same regulatory umbrella, leading to a consolidated industry-wide shift away from listing speculative domestic projects.

This critical sentiment gauge, a composite of volatility, social data, and market metrics, provides a stark, quantitative snapshot of prevailing investor psychology. Consequently, understanding its current reading and historical context becomes essential for navigating today’s complex digital asset landscape. Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 24 The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, maintained by data provider Alternative, currently sits at 24. This represents a marginal one-point increase from the previous day’s reading. However, the index remains deep within its ‘extreme fear’ band, which encompasses scores from 0 to 25. The tool operates on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 signifies maximum fear and 100 indicates maximum greed. It synthesizes data from six core components to generate its daily score. For instance, market volatility and trading volume/momentum each contribute 25% to the final calculation. Meanwhile, social media sentiment and survey data each account for 15%. Finally, Bitcoin’s dominance share of the total crypto market cap and trends in Google search interest for ‘Bitcoin’ each make up 10% of the index. This multi-faceted methodology aims to move beyond pure price action. It captures the emotional and behavioral drivers that often precede major market movements. The current score of 24, therefore, signals more than just falling prices. It reflects high volatility, potentially declining trading volumes, negative social media chatter, and reduced mainstream search interest. Historically, prolonged periods in ‘extreme fear’ have often preceded significant market bottoms, though this pattern is not a guaranteed predictor. Market analysts consistently monitor this divergence between price and sentiment for potential turning points. Historical Context and Market Sentiment Analysis Placing the current reading of 24 into a historical framework reveals its significance. The index has experienced dramatic swings since its inception. For example, it peaked near 95 during the bull market euphoria of late 2021. Conversely, it plummeted to single digits during major crises like the COVID-19 market crash of March 2020 and the collapse of the Terra-Luna ecosystem in May 2022. The present ‘extreme fear’ reading, while concerning, is not unprecedented. It suggests a market environment similar to other major corrective phases in cryptocurrency history. Several concurrent factors typically contribute to such a low sentiment reading. Firstly, increased price volatility, especially sharp downward movements, directly impacts the index’s calculation. Secondly, a decline in spot trading volume can indicate a lack of buyer conviction. Thirdly, negative sentiment on platforms like Twitter and Reddit amplifies the fear narrative. Furthermore, a rising Bitcoin dominance rate often occurs during risk-off periods as capital flees from altcoins to the perceived relative safety of Bitcoin. The table below illustrates typical index ranges and their common market interpretations: Index Range Sentiment Label Common Market Characteristics 0-25 Extreme Fear High volatility, panic selling, negative news cycle. 26-46 Fear Cautious trading, consolidation, uncertainty. 47-53 Neutral Balanced momentum, low directional conviction. 54-74 Greed Increasing FOMO, strong bullish trends. 75-100 Extreme Greed Speculative frenzy, potential market top. Expert Perspectives on Prolonged Fear Financial behavioral analysts often reference the Fear & Greed Index as a contrarian indicator. Dr. Elara Vance, a behavioral economist specializing in digital assets, notes, ‘Sustained periods of extreme fear, like the current 24 reading, frequently create conditions for value accumulation. However, investors must distinguish between systemic fear driven by structural issues and cyclical fear within a healthy market correction. The index’s components help with that analysis.’ Meanwhile, veteran traders caution against using the index in isolation. They emphasize combining sentiment data with on-chain analytics, such as exchange flow data and holder composition, to form a more complete picture. The current environment suggests a market dominated by short-term speculators exiting, while long-term holders may be accumulating, a classic sign of a fear phase. The Mechanics and Impact of Market Sentiment The calculation of the index relies on verifiable, real-time data streams. The 25% weight given to volatility compares current Bitcoin price swings to historical averages. Similarly, the 25% market volume/momentum component analyzes trading volume and the strength of recent price movements. The social media analysis scans posts for sentiment and volume, while surveys provide a direct pulse of community outlook. The 10% weight for Bitcoin dominance measures its market share relative to all other cryptocurrencies. Finally, Google Trends data for ‘Bitcoin’ searches indicates mainstream attention levels. A low score across most of these metrics, as seen now, creates a reinforcing loop of negative sentiment that can suppress prices independently of fundamental news. This sentiment impacts market behavior in tangible ways. For instance, developers may see reduced engagement on their platforms. Additionally, project funding rounds can become more challenging. Retail investors often delay entry plans during such phases. Conversely, institutional players with longer time horizons may view this as a strategic accumulation window. The market’s structure itself can change, with derivatives markets seeing shifts in funding rates and open interest. Therefore, the index acts as a barometer for the overall health and risk appetite within the crypto ecosystem, influencing decisions far beyond simple buy or sell orders. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 24 offers a clear, data-driven signal that investor sentiment remains severely negative, categorizing the market in a state of extreme fear. This analysis stems from a composite of volatility, volume, social data, and search trends. While historically such depths of fear have sometimes marked cyclical lows, they also reflect real market stress and risk aversion. Navigating this environment requires a focus on fundamentals, robust risk management, and an understanding that market sentiment is a powerful, yet fleeting, force. Monitoring the index’s trajectory from this extreme fear zone will provide critical clues about the market’s next psychological phase. FAQs Q1: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 24 mean? A score of 24 places the market sentiment firmly in the ‘Extreme Fear’ category (0-25). This indicates high levels of investor anxiety, typically accompanied by elevated volatility, negative social media sentiment, and potential panic selling. Q2: How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index calculated? The index is calculated using six factors: volatility (25%), market volume/momentum (25%), social media sentiment (15%), surveys (15%), Bitcoin’s market dominance (10%), and Google search trends for ‘Bitcoin’ (10%). Q3: Is extreme fear a good time to buy cryptocurrency? Historically, prolonged periods of extreme fear have sometimes preceded market recoveries, leading some to view them as potential buying opportunities for long-term investors. However, it is not a timing tool and should be used alongside fundamental and technical analysis. Q4: How often does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index update? The index is typically updated once per day, reflecting a composite of data from the previous 24-hour period. Q5: Has the index been lower than 24 before? Yes. The index has fallen into single digits during major market crises, such as the March 2020 COVID-19 crash and the May 2022 Terra-Luna collapse, indicating even more severe fear than the current level.

In a Monday post on X, Alex Smirnov, founder of bridge provider deBridge, confirmed there would be “no rollback” and no reorganization of the blockchain under the updated recovery plan. Flow also released a technical implementation plan, noting that accounts impacted by the exploit have been temporarily restricted and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) operations are currently read-only as part of phase one. “There will be no chain reorganization,” said Flow. “All legitimate transactions that occurred prior to the halt remain valid and will not require resubmission or reconciliation.” The implementation plan initially faced pushback from many users due to concerns about the network’s decentralization and security. According to Smirnov, the plan, which included a rollback of the Flow chain, was a “rushed decision” that could trigger “financial damage far beyond the impact of the original exploit. FLOW plummets as exploit shakes market confidence The exploit was carried out on December 27, when an adversary exploited a flaw in Flow’s execution layer and siphoned approximately $3.9 million in assets from the network via multiple cross-chain bridges, before the validators launched measures to stop the incident. The breach, however, did affect their trust and confidence in the security and governance of the network, the Foundation and its forensic partner, FindLabs, said, adding that existing user balances were not accessed. Sentiment in the markets shifted instantly in response to the incident. The network’s native token, FLOW, slumped as the exploit and proposed recovery plan turned headlines. The price of the token plummeted by over 50% on a single day, briefly dipping to new lows of around $0.079 on platforms like Binance, before stabilizing to some extent later, according to market data. The token has underperformed wider market gains, even as other assets, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, clawed back ground. At a time when Bitcoin climbed above $90,000, and Ethereum rebounded past $3,000, respectively, FLOW continued to lag, highlighting the persistent fear of investors. Flow opts for phased restart after controversial rollback proposal Initially, the Foundation considered rolling back the blockchain to a checkpoint before the exploit, a controversial move that would have erased transactions submitted during a specific timeframe and required users to resubmit their activity. That rollback idea sparked fierce backlash from validators, bridge operators, developers, and other ecosystem participants. Implementation of the remediation plan could take several days, according to the timeline provided by Flow. Following Phase One, the blockchain is expected to relaunch its non-EVM chain, Cadence, and resume operations between the bridge and exchange. “[Flow’s] response required genuine collaboration between parties under high stress,” said Find Labs, the team behind Flow block explorer Flowscan, in a Monday X post. “It takes serious stewardship to be responsive to ecosystem feedback, yet be ready to make the hard choices at the right time.” Analysts sa y that wh ile the incident underscores challenges facing Layer‑1 networks in managing breaches without compromising decentralization, the revised plan may help restore confidence by preserving valid transactions and avoiding disruptive chain reorganizations.

This critical metric, published by the leading data aggregator CoinMarketCap, serves as a barometer for market sentiment and capital rotation. Consequently, it provides essential insights for portfolio strategy and risk assessment. The index’s stagnation suggests a cautious investor environment, where capital largely favors the perceived safety of Bitcoin over the higher-risk, higher-reward potential of alternative cryptocurrencies. Decoding the Altcoin Season Index The Altcoin Season Index offers a quantitative snapshot of market dynamics. Specifically, CoinMarketCap calculates this figure by analyzing the 90-day price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. However, the calculation deliberately excludes stablecoins and wrapped assets to focus purely on speculative performance. The core mechanism involves a direct comparison against Bitcoin’s returns over the same period. An official “altcoin season” is only declared when at least 75% of these top assets outperform Bitcoin, which would push the index score above 75. Therefore, the current score of 19 sits far from this threshold, underscoring Bitcoin’s relative strength. Calculation Method: Compares 90-day performance of top 100 coins (ex-stablecoins) vs. Bitcoin. Season Threshold: A score above 75 signals the start of an altcoin season. Current Reading: A score of 19 reflects strong Bitcoin dominance and weak altcoin momentum. Historical Context and Market Cycles Understanding the index’s current position requires examining past cryptocurrency cycles. Historically, bull markets often begin with Bitcoin leading the charge, followed by capital flowing into large-capitalization altcoins, and finally into smaller-cap projects. The index effectively tracks this capital rotation. For instance, during the 2021 bull run, the index repeatedly surged above 75, confirming powerful altcoin seasons. In contrast, prolonged periods below 25, like the present, typically align with bear markets or consolidation phases where investors seek refuge in Bitcoin. This pattern highlights the index’s utility as a cyclical indicator rather than a short-term trading signal. Expert Analysis on the Current Stalemate Market analysts point to several macroeconomic and sector-specific factors explaining the index’s low reading. Firstly, anticipation of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) flows and the upcoming Bitcoin halving event in 2024 have concentrated attention and institutional capital on Bitcoin. Secondly, regulatory uncertainty surrounding many altcoin projects has increased perceived risk. Furthermore, data from blockchain analytics firms shows that capital inflows into decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) ecosystems—key drivers of past altcoin seasons—have plateaued. This confluence of factors creates a holding pattern, reflected precisely in the static index value of 19. The Impact on Trader and Investor Strategies The steady index reading directly influences market participant behavior. For conservative investors, a low index reinforces a strategy of overweighting Bitcoin in portfolios. Conversely, venture capital and dedicated altcoin funds may view this as an accumulation phase, seeking undervalued projects before a potential rotation. Retail traders often use the index as a contrarian indicator; however, experts caution against this alone. They recommend combining the index with on-chain data, such as Bitcoin dominance charts and exchange flow metrics, for a more comprehensive view. The table below summarizes typical market phases correlated with index ranges. Index Range Market Phase Typical Characteristic 0-25 Bitcoin Dominance Capital flight to safety; altcoin weakness. 26-74 Transition / Neutral Mixed performance; capital begins testing altcoins. 75-100 Altcoin Season Widespread altcoin outperformance; high risk appetite. Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index holding at 19 provides a clear, data-driven message about the current cryptocurrency market structure. It confirms a period of consolidation and Bitcoin-centric investment. While not predictive of an immediate shift, this metric is a vital tool for gauging market sentiment and the relative strength of alternative cryptocurrencies. Monitoring for a sustained move above the 25-30 level will be crucial for signals of changing dynamics. For now, the index underscores a market in waiting, where patience and disciplined analysis remain paramount for all participants. FAQs Q1: What does an Altcoin Season Index score of 19 mean? It indicates that Bitcoin is significantly outperforming the majority of top altcoins over the past 90 days. The market is far from meeting the 75% threshold required to declare an “altcoin season.” Q2: Who calculates the Altcoin Season Index and how often is it updated? CoinMarketCap calculates and publishes the index. It is typically updated daily, tracking the rolling 90-day performance window. Q3: Can the index predict the start of an altcoin bull run? While not a perfect predictor, a sustained rise above 50 often precedes or coincides with periods where altcoins collectively begin to outperform Bitcoin, signaling shifting market momentum. Q4: Why are stablecoins excluded from the index calculation? Stablecoins are pegged to fiat currencies and designed not to fluctuate in price. Including them would distort the performance comparison against volatile assets like Bitcoin and other altcoins. Q5: Should I only invest in Bitcoin when the index is low? Not necessarily. The index is one tool among many. A low index may present accumulation opportunities in fundamentally strong altcoins for long-term investors, though it does signal higher relative risk in the short term.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $2.98 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $5.02. Tezos started strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.4909 Market cap $528.81M Trading volume (24-hour) $19.41M Circulating supply 1.07B XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3505 on December 7, 2018 24-hour high $0.5091 24-hour low $0.4916 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 4.54% (Medium) 50-day SMA $0.5032 14-Day RSI 56.01 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 24 (Extreme Fear) Green days 12/30 (40%) 200-day SMA $0.6661 Tezos price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: Tezos is digesting gains just under $0.50 after a strong breakout. Momentum is cooling but not broken, with $0.47–$0.48 acting as the key support zone. A daily close above $0.50 would be the trigger for renewed upside. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart On the 1-day timeframe as of Dec 30, 2025, Tezos trades around $0.49, consolidating just below the upper Bollinger Band near $0.51–$0.52 after a strong expansion move from the $0.45–$0.46 base. The price has reclaimed the mid-band around $0.47, which now acts as the first dynamic support and aligns with the prior consolidation zone. XTZUSDT 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView Additionally, the MACD has flipped positive, accompanied by widening histogram bars, confirming that bullish momentum remains present. Although the last candles exhibit smaller bodies, this suggests short-term exhaustion rather than a reversal. OBV remains elevated, suggesting the rally was backed by genuine participation. However, it’s also slightly flat, which indicates that the market is deciding whether it has sufficient strength for continuation. A clean daily close above $0.50 would reopen upside toward $0.52, while failure to hold $0.47 risks a deeper pullback toward $0.44–$0.45. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart On the 4-hour chart, price has rolled over from the $0.51 local high and is now compressing around $0.49, sitting on the faster Alligator averages while still above the longer-term baseline near $0.48. This structure reflects a healthy retracement within an uptrend rather than an outright breakdown. XTZUSDT 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView The CMF remains positive, showing capital inflows have not meaningfully reversed, but the Balance of Power slipping slightly negative signals sellers are gaining short-term control. As long as $0.48 holds, the structure favors sideways to higher resolution. If XTZ loses this level, it would likely accelerate a move toward $0.46, where buyers previously stepped in aggressively. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.5745 SELL SMA 5 $0.5414 SELL SMA 10 $0.5122 SELL SMA 21 $0.4991 SELL SMA 50 $0.5032 SELL SMA 100 $0.5684 SELL SMA 200 $0.6661 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.4824 BUY EMA 5 $0.5056 SELL EMA 10 $0.5608 SELL EMA 21 $0.6404 SELL EMA 50 $0.7047 SELL EMA 100 $0.7076 SELL EMA 200 $0.7280 SELL What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? Based on both charts, XTZ appears more likely to consolidate briefly before attempting another push higher, provided the $0.47–$0.48 range continues to hold. A failure there would shift focus back to deeper support rather than immediate continuation. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs, so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $1.5 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications.

Buyers returned in September, driving the price to $0.7015, and momentum carried into November with a peak of $1.856. The rally extended to December, when XTZ reached $1.909 before corrections brought the year-end close to $1.286.

It can be seen that a significant number of XRP investors have been forced to sell their holdings at a loss rather than waiting for it to recover. Transaction volumes on the XRP network are also down. The cryptocurrency must break above $2.10 to avoid having a negative year, but there is currently an underlying trend against it. At the same time, money is flowing out from larger, inactive assets to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . This is a project that is considered to be the cheap cryptocurrency currently available, with expected growth of around 55x from its presale price. Weakness of XRP The actions of the participants in the Ripple community have changed. Typically, serious investors have held on to their investments even in the face of falling prices, but now they have started selling, but at a loss, and this is a sign of a higher degree of risk aversion. Although XRP had positive periods in 2023 and another positive period in 2024, the year 2025 seems to present a very different scenario. There is a definite decrease in the community activity, which shows a lack of interaction in the network. Moreover, the current price needs to stay above $1.85 to prevent a possible movement to the level of $1.70. A breakout above the levels of $1.94 and then above $2.00 is a condition for the start of a recovery. Mutuum Finance Presale: Final Chance at a Low Price Outflow from slower assets has been beneficial in DeFi projects with concrete roadmaps. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has become one of the best options by involving an open and multi-phased presales process. It has already raised $19.5 million with over 18,600 participants. MUTM currently find ourselves in Phase 6, with tokens retailing at $0.035 every one. This particular phase is 99% sold out. This marks the final chance to invest at this rate before increasing tokens to $0.040 in Phase 7. At $0.06 as the initial offering price, the initial investors will be able to make approximately 420% profit. Two Way Lending Framework Mutuum Finance stands out for its dual approach to lending. The first aspect uses common pools for top cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, while the second aspect allows peer-to-peer trading for meme coins. It gives users as much flexibility as possible. Users are issued distinct tokens that gather interest as time goes by. The system also uses its own fees to buy back the MUTM tokens, ensuring a stable market for them. This kind of system makes it a very safe investment option for individuals looking for growth based on real usage rather than hyped benefits. Strong Security Measures in Place to Encourage Confidence However, security does not take a back seat. Mutuum Finance is in the process of having its codes audited by leading security auditors Halborn. To add to that, they have a bug bounty program worth $50,000. These factors are essential as Mutuum Finance wishes to attract genuine investors, who have to see robust safety measures in place before opting to invest in any new venture. It is yet another factor that makes Mutuum Finance an attractive venture for risk-averse investors to invest in the Defi crypto world. Increased Institutional Investment As XRP is performing poorly and activity is dwindling, smart investors are diversifying their portfolios to other projects that have strong bases. Mutuum Finance presents a clear and defined growth prospect with their presale phase ongoing. The time frame to invest at a price of $0.035 is quickly closing down.

In a post on X, Farina described this threshold as essential for meaningful exposure to potential future price growth. Establishing a Meaningful Position Farina’s recommendation focuses on scale and flexibility. At current prices just below $2 per XRP , holding 1,000 tokens represents an investment of roughly $2,000. While modest in absolute terms, Farina argues that this position provides enough leverage to take partial profits while maintaining exposure to additional gains as XRP’s market value rises. He maintains that smaller holdings may limit the investor’s capacity to benefit significantly from price appreciation. Community Trends Reinforce the Benchmark Data on wallet distribution lends weight to Farina’s argument. Among the 7.44 million XRP wallets in existence, only a small fraction hold more than 1,000 tokens. For reference, wallets holding between 500 and 1,000 XRP number 256,435, while those with 500 or fewer XRP exceed six million. This disparity highlights a concentration of larger positions within a limited group of holders. As XRP’s price increases, the cost of acquiring 1,000 tokens rises correspondingly. In October 2024, an investor could accumulate 1,000 XRP for under $500, whereas today the same holding approaches $2,000. The combination of rising prices and concentrated holdings has contributed to the perception of 1,000 XRP as a strategic milestone. Future Price Projections Support the Recommendation Farina’s guidance is tied to expectations for XRP’s long-term price trajectory. Advocates suggest that if XRP reaches $10 to $20, a 1,000-XRP position could be valued at $10,000 to $20,000. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 More aggressive projections, extending to triple-digit valuations, would substantially increase the financial impact, with a 1,000-XRP holding reaching hundreds of thousands of dollars at $100 per coin. Farina views early accumulation as a way to position for potential high-growth scenarios, including speculative multi-digit price targets over an extended period. Despite this bullish outlook, some analysts caution that reaching higher XRP price targets depends on adoption and market dynamics that may take years to materialize. Critics also highlight the potential for investors to take profits at lower levels rather than waiting for extreme valuations. Farina acknowledges these risks but frames his recommendation as a strategic approach for those willing to hold and wait for the potential expansion of XRP’s role in financial systems. Ultimately, Farina positions holding at least 1,000 XRP as a deliberate strategy to gain meaningful exposure while maintaining flexibility in managing positions over time. His advice underscores a conviction in XRP’s long-term potential, suggesting that investors who can commit to this threshold may be better positioned to capture future gains in the evolving crypto landscape.

Times Square Display Reveals 589 Bulbs According to behind-the-scenes footage and local broadcast clips, the four numerals installed above One Times Square were outfitted with a total of 589 energy-efficient LED bulbs. The figures were highlighted in video posts shared by local outlets and social feeds covering New Year preparations. The numerals stand about seven feet tall and were shown being tested in place ahead of midnight. XRP Community Notes The Coincidence Reports have disclosed that XRP holders quickly spotted the 589 count and began sharing screenshots, short clips, and commentary across social platforms. One widely viewed post asked, “589 lights for 2026 in NYC. What are the chances,” and that message was amplified by several XRP-focused accounts. The number 589 is a recurring motif in XRP social circles, and that background fed the fast spread of the content. https://t.co/b1n6aCX5Od — Caroline D. Pham (@CarolineDPham) December 28, 2025 A High-Profile Social Reaction Based on posts tracked by crypto outlets, Caroline Pham — who served as Acting Chair of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission and is now MoonPay’s chief legal officer — reacted to the Times Square footage with rocket emojis on social media. She did not make a public statement linking the display to XRP, but her reaction was noted by community members and reported by crypto news sites. Guess how many LED bulbs the 2026 New Year’s Eve sign has in Times Square this year… pic.twitter.com/dVqpoJPM5n — NotFinancialAdvice.Crypto (@NFAdotcrypto) December 27, 2025 What This Means For Markets And Messaging This moment appears to be driven by community interest rather than by any formal marketing tie between Times Square organizers and crypto firms. Major news coverage of the New Year setup focused on the event logistics and lighting; mainstream outlets did not report any official endorsement or link to XRP. The social attention did, however, generate a spike in shares and comments within crypto circles, as users posted memes, videos, and theories. How Observers Are Framing It Many posts framed the coincidence as playful symbolism rather than a signal with financial meaning. Analysts and journalists who follow crypto culture warn readers that such coincidences should not be treated as financial guidance. Based on the coverage so far, the item is best read as social media noise that reflects how online communities find patterns and share them rapidly. No Official Endorsement From Organizers Reports have made clear that Times Square event teams and broadcast partners did not announce any connection to XRP or other tokens. The 589 LED total was presented as a production detail for viewers and photographers, not as a coded message. That separation between event facts and online interpretation is central to how this story has played out.

Repeated attempts to reclaim higher ground have been rejected, reinforcing a cautious outlook among traders. As broader market sentiment remains fragile, a growing number of analysts are warning that LINK could face additional downside before a meaningful recovery takes shape. Related Reading: Trust Wallet Exploit Drains $7M: Hundreds Of Users Affected Despite the weak price action, on-chain data tells a more nuanced story. Analyst at CryptoQuant, known as CryptoOnchain, reports that recent market data reveals a compelling convergence between on-chain metrics and technical structure, pointing to growing accumulation activity at current levels. While price remains compressed, underlying behavior suggests that larger market participants may be positioning quietly rather than exiting. This divergence between declining price and improving on-chain signals is often observed during transitional phases of the market, when selling pressure begins to fade, but confidence has not yet returned. According to CryptoOnchain, indicators tracking exchange flows and holder behavior show signs of significant buying interest emerging beneath the surface, even as LINK struggles to attract speculative demand. Exchange Outflows and Long-Term Support Point to Accumulation The analysis highlights a notable shift in Chainlink’s on-chain and technical dynamics, starting with exchange netflows. According to the Binance Altcoins Token Netflow 7-day chart, Chainlink has seen a substantial withdrawal from Binance over the past week, with total outflows approaching $50 million. This magnitude stands out when compared with other large-cap altcoins such as Uniswap (UNI) or The Sandbox (SAND), which have not experienced similar capital movements over the same period. In on-chain analysis, large and sustained exchange outflows are commonly interpreted as a reduction in immediate selling pressure. Rather than preparing to sell, holders appear to be moving LINK into self-custody or long-term storage, signaling a shift toward holding behavior. This type of activity is often associated with accumulation phases, particularly when it occurs during periods of weak price action. At the same time, the technical structure reinforces the on-chain signal. The LINK/USDT daily chart shows price resting directly on a long-term bullish trendline that has acted as dynamic support since 2020. Historically, this level has consistently attracted demand and limited deeper drawdowns during corrective phases. The convergence of heavy exchange outflows and a retest of major historical support sends a strong signal of smart money accumulation. It suggests that larger investors view current levels as a strategic entry zone. Defending this support remains critical, as holding it would preserve Chainlink’s long-term bullish structure and increase the probability of a future trend reversal. Related Reading: Why $100,000 Is Bitcoin’s Most Important Resistance Level LINK Testing Structural Demand Chainlink (LINK) continues to trade under pressure, with price hovering around the $12.50 level on the 3-day chart after an extended corrective phase. The structure shows a clear loss of bullish momentum following repeated rejections from the $20–$25 region earlier in the cycle. Since that peak, LINK has established a sequence of lower highs, confirming a medium-term downtrend that remains intact. From a technical perspective, LINK is currently trading below its short- and medium-term moving averages, which have rolled over and are now acting as dynamic resistance. The 50-period moving average sits well above the current price, reinforcing the idea that recent rebounds have been corrective rather than impulsive. The longer-term moving average, however, is flattening near current levels, suggesting that selling pressure may be slowing as price approaches a historically important zone. Related Reading: Ethereum Bearish Structure Meets Bullish Supply Signal – What Happens Next The $12–$13 range stands out as a key support area. This level has acted as a pivot multiple times over the past two years, repeatedly attracting demand during periods of broader market weakness. The fact that LINK is consolidating rather than breaking down aggressively suggests that sellers are losing momentum. Volume behavior supports this view. While sell-offs earlier in the year were accompanied by sharp volume spikes, recent price action shows reduced participation, indicating distribution may be giving way to stabilization. For LINK to signal a meaningful trend reversal, bulls must reclaim the $15–$16 zone.
