41301602,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=688626,1741388400,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41301602.jpeg,Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Targets $4 In 2025 To Surpass Leading DeFi Giant Ripple (XRP),https://www.cryptopolitan.com/mutuum-finance-mutm-targets-4-in-2025-to-surpass-leading-defi-giant-ripple-xrp/,"The crypto market shows growing interest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) because its existing presale phase achieved $2.3 million and accumulated more than 4,300 token owners. The project currently operates during its second phase of pre-sale at $0.015 while investors have an exceptional opportunity to acquire tokens at this price point before upcoming price increases push the token value to $0.02. Early MUTM participants would have earned a 300% return on their investment through presale prices before reaching the anticipated $0.06 official exchange value. After the launch date MUTM will rise dramatically according to expert estimations amounting to $4 by 2025 while surpassing the market position of Ripple (XRP). Mutuum Finance (MUTM): A DeFi Powerhouse in the Making The decentralized finance platform Mutuum Finance (MUTM) functions as much more than a typical token since it operates to reshape lending and borrowing systems through DeFi capabilities. MUTM provides valuable practical applicability which allows users to generate passive income through its distinct borrowing solution. As part of the unique mtTokens system on the platform users can execute assets such as ETH or DAI to acquire interest-generating tokens. The worth of these tokens increases with time so users get a steady cash flow from their investments and still have easy access to funds. The successful outcome of the presale demonstrates that investors see huge potential in MUTM. Demand for the second phase increases while initial stocks sold out rapidly among investors. The project draws investors through its organized token structure that implements a mechanism for token purchasing combined with distribution. The distribution system purchases platform-derived funds to obtain MUTM tokens from exchanges before distributing them back to stakeholders to maintain steady buying assets. Through this method investors receive benefits for maintaining their investment position and enhanced price stability goes hand in hand with investor retention. Ripple (XRP) Facing Challenges Amid Market Volatility The rising value of MUTM Finance continues while the unpredictable market conditions of Ripple (XRP) occur. According to CasiTrades the XRP cryptocurrency will decline to $1.50 after breaking its essential support level at $2.42. Several experts believe XRP will achieve $30 by May 2025 yet its market stability remains inconsistent. Many influential cryptocurrencies face multiple risks which emerge from regulatory hurdles and wild market price movements. MUTM distinguishes itself from other entities by delivering operational financial services through methods that provide sustainability at every stage of transformation. Stability within this lending system comes from its excess collateral mechanism and its ability to adjust interest rates for investors through two separate rates. The main reason that sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart from its competitors Mutuum Finance (MUTM) was built to fulfill extended-term goals. The presale schedule of Mutuum Finance ensures investors obtain large profits because token prices increase during different stages of the process. The current price of $0.015 gives investors the potential to make 300% profit when MUTM lists at $0.06. MUTM experts forecast a remarkable price increase to $4 during the next five years which translates to a 26500% return on investment. P2P lending on the platform helps users directly agree on their terms for loans. The platform provides a beneficial function when users need to borrow meme coins because standard lending pools typically offer limited access to these specific assets. The $100,000 MUTM giveaway from Mutuum Finance creates an investment time pressure and boosts total participant numbers. The cryptocurrency platform Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to dominate the decentralized finance market through its combination of trailblazing technology and functional services and capital expansion potential. The MUTM presale builds momentum as the project moves toward surpassing Ripple (XRP) and other established giants in the market. The current presale phase presents a limited-time opportunity to invest at the lowest price, with the potential for substantial gains as the project evolves. For investors seeking a high-yield, real-utility token, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a compelling choice. Don’t miss out on the chance to be part of this groundbreaking project, secure your tokens today before the next price increase.

41301412,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=708607,1741388445,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,"Bitcoin Price Crash Incoming? Why A Fall To $63,000 Is Possible If This Resistance Holds",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crash-incoming/,"The recent Bitcoin price crash below $90,000 came as a shock to the broader crypto community, especially amid expectations of a continued bull market rally. Despite the volatility and ongoing declines, a crypto analyst projects an even greater crash, suggesting that Bitcoin could fall as low as $63,000 if a certain resistance level holds. TradingView crypto analyst Alixjey has declared that the Bitcoin price must break past $99,500 to continue moving higher. He highlights that if this resistance holds and Bitcoin fails to break it, the pioneer cryptocurrency will likely face a steeper price decline to new lows of $63,000. The last time Bitcoin was around the $60,000 range was during its massive price rally in 2024 after the launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Considering that Bitcoin has risen as high as $104,000 at one point this year, a crash toward $60,000 would be a devastating blow to investors and its market. Bitcoin Price Crash Imminent The TradingView analyst shared a chart suggesting that Bitcoin could rise as high as $106,000 or drop toward the $60,000 to $65,000 range if it fails to break resistance. This price drop is highlighted as a strong buying and accumulation opportunity for long-term investors, as it presents a low entry point into the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin 77% Correction To $25,000, Will History Repeat Itself During its price highs, many retail investors were likely unable to buy Bitcoin due to its increasing cost. Most accumulations were from whales who had purchased millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin in one swoop. Alixjey has also labeled his projected $60,000 – $65,000 downturn as the last chance to re-enter the Bitcoin market, emphasizing that it was a prime HODLing point for potential profits in Q3 and Q4 of 2025. This implies that the analyst anticipates a price rebound in Bitcoin later in the year. Moving on, the TradingView expert highlighted two liquidity levels in the 4-hour timeframe that are likely to be cleared soon. He also acknowledged that he was solely bearish on Bitcoin’s price outlook, indicating that his projected short-term pullback will not be invalidated unless the cryptocurrency crosses the resistance between $94,000 and $98,000. Other factors that could contribute to Bitcoin’s already heightened volatility are the Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) data. AlixJey predicts that once released, this data could lead to high volatility in both stocks and crypto. He urges investors and traders to be cautious, as major economic reports often influence market movements. Analyst Sees Upside Potential After BTC Crashes Due to Bitcoin’s recent declines, many analysts have shared bearish projections of the cryptocurrency, expecting a severe price correction before a potential recovery. One such analyst is Herbert Sim, the Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) of AICean. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Suffers Bearish Deviation After Filling CME Gap, Is This Good Or Bad? Sim projects that Bitcoin will crash to new lows, especially with the recent approval of a crypto reserve in the United States (US). He expects a crash to $40,000 but highlights that it will be short-lived, spanning from weeks, months, and possibly years. However, the AICean CMO suggested that investors who can HODL for the long-term are likely to see more profits once BTC rebounds from bearish trends.

The world of artificial intelligence is not just evolving in code and algorithms, but also in the halls of US lawmakers. We’re barely into 2025, and the legislative landscape around AI is already exploding. If you thought 2024 was busy with AI developments, think again. The sheer volume of US AI bills being introduced this year is nothing short of astonishing. Unprecedented Wave of US AI Bills: What’s Driving the Surge? According to MultiState, a consulting firm tracking these developments, a staggering 781 US AI bills are already pending in the US as of early March 2025. Let that sink in. This number eclipses the total of 743 AI bills proposed throughout the entirety of 2024. And to put it in even starker perspective, 2023 saw fewer than 200 such bills. We’re witnessing an unprecedented legislative frenzy around AI. just 66 days into 2025 and the number of artificial intelligence bills pending in the US now officially exceeds the total for ALL of 2024. 2024: 743 AI bills total for the year 2025: 781 AI bills in just 66 days pic.twitter.com/xrYPVDYgR1 — Adam Thierer (@AdamThierer) March 7, 2025 This legislative surge can be largely attributed to a vacuum at the federal level. The absence of a comprehensive national AI legislation framework, akin to the EU’s AI Act, is pushing individual states and lawmakers to take matters into their own hands. Congress has, so far, struggled to coalesce around a unified approach, leaving a patchwork of proposed regulations across the nation. Federal Inaction Fuels State-Level AI Regulation Spree Why is federal action on AI governance proving so elusive? Several factors are likely at play: Political Gridlock: Partisan divides in Congress make consensus on complex tech policy issues notoriously difficult. Industry Lobbying: The AI industry, with its diverse range of stakeholders, likely has varied and sometimes conflicting lobbying priorities, further complicating federal action. Lack of Urgency (Perceived): Despite the rapid advancements in AI, some lawmakers may not yet perceive the societal or economic urgency for comprehensive federal regulation, especially compared to more immediate political concerns. The Trump administration’s approach, while aiming to foster AI development, hasn’t translated into strong federal AI regulation . President Trump’s executive order in January focused on promoting AI innovation and removing ideological bias, but it stopped short of endorsing or pushing for major Congressional legislation. This hands-off approach from the executive branch further empowers state-level initiatives. What Does This Mean for the Future of AI and Crypto? For the crypto world, heavily intertwined with technological innovation and often utilizing AI in various applications, this explosion of 2025 AI bills has significant implications. Here’s what you need to consider: Compliance Complexity: A fragmented regulatory landscape across different states could create a compliance nightmare for crypto companies utilizing AI. Navigating 781+ potential laws is far more complex than dealing with a unified federal framework. Innovation Chilling Effect?: Overly restrictive or inconsistent state-level regulations could stifle AI innovation within the US, potentially pushing development and talent overseas. This could indirectly impact crypto projects reliant on cutting-edge AI. Opportunities for Clarity: Conversely, this flurry of legislative activity presents an opportunity for the crypto and AI industries to engage with lawmakers and shape regulations that are both responsible and innovation-friendly. Proactive engagement is crucial. Navigating the AI Regulatory Maze: Key Takeaways The sheer volume of pending AI legislation is a clear signal: AI is no longer a futuristic concept; it’s a present-day reality demanding immediate policy attention. Here are some key takeaways: Aspect Implication Volume of Bills Indicates urgency and widespread concern about AI, but also potential for regulatory fragmentation. Federal Inaction Drives state-level activity, leading to a potentially inconsistent and complex regulatory environment. Industry Engagement Needed Crypto and AI sectors must actively participate in legislative discussions to ensure balanced and effective regulations. Global Regulatory Landscape US developments should be viewed in the context of global AI regulation efforts (e.g., EU AI Act) to understand broader trends. The coming months will be critical in shaping the regulatory contours of AI in the US. For those in the crypto space, staying informed and engaged with these legislative developments is no longer optional – it’s essential for navigating the evolving landscape.

""It's only been, what, 50 days or something like that, and it's already created enough of a tailwind that we feel more confident in investing in the United States and growing our business here,"" Armstrong told CoinDesk. He said the hiring would take place this year. Coinbase, specifically, watched the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission completely abandon its pivotal enforcement action against the leading U.S. crypto platform. The company had been fighting the expensive legal dispute in federal courts over fundamental questions in regulatory jurisdiction over digital assets. That question is now in Congress' hands rather than continuing as a court fight and a drag on Coinbase's resources. Armstrong was among dozens of people crowded into the White House's State Dining Room for the first crypto summit with the White House, leading regulators and senior Republican members of Congress. The big news coming into the meeting was Trump's executive order the night before that called for the establishment of a bitcoin (BTC) reserve, which Armstrong endorsed. ""You can't really have a better holder of this asset than the United States government,"" he said. ""It's becoming a core piece of the financial system, and I think it's going to be a part of every diversified portfolio over time."" Coinbase was a pivotal player during the 2024 election, putting tens of millions of dollars toward the crypto-focused political action committee Fairshake. He said Coinbase will keep backing the super PAC, which did ""an incredible job"" in boosting pro-crypto candidates. Bo Hines, the executive director of the President’s Working Group on Digital Assets, told CoinDesk that Friday's summit represented Trump's commitment to the industry. ""The president made a promise that he's going to make this country the crypto capital of the planet, and we're well on our way in delivering that promise,"" he said in an interview after the close of the summit, in which the crypto reserve ideas played a significant part. ""We were just with 30 or so of the greatest luminaries in the space, and I think everyone was tremendously pleased,"" he said. In answer to industry concerns that the bitcoin reserve isn't initially organized to include new investment, he pointed out that the secretaries of the U.S. Treasury and Commerce departments are ordered to weigh methods of buying bitcoins without burdening taxpayers, and ""both of them are excited to look into ways to do it.""",Policy|Coinbase|Donald Trump|Hiring|Regulation,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BTC|FIAT|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-07 23:06:58

Investors who strategically place their investments in skyrocketing crypto assets make significant gains in a short duration. Dogecoin and BinoFi are among the projects that analysts have flagged could face an imminent surge in price. According to experts, Dogecoin has the potential to double before the year ends. However, BinoFi stands out as the most promising project that could easily turn $3k into $500k within a short duration. BinoFi is a new DeFi protocol whose presale offers investors a chance to invest in BINO tokens at discounted rates. The presale is currently in its first phase pricing and each BINO token is sold at $0.02. BINO is the utility and governance token of the hybrid exchange platform. Traders and investors interacting with crypto assets on BinoFi’s hybrid exchange will earn staking rewards, and accrue discounted trading fees using BINO tokens. Dogecoin price prediction Crypto experts have concluded that Dogecoin and BinoFi are on track to reward investors this year with each project hosting significant potential to explode to the upside. Dogecoin has recently been crashing as U.S. crypto reserve hype fades. According to data from Coinglass, Dogecoin has witnessed liquidations worth $10 million in long positions and $1.39 million in short positions in the last 24 hours. Analysts have predicted that the downward movement is a temporary pullback and that the crypto asset will soon resume its uptrend trajectory towards new all-time highs. Some Dogecoin whales have begun offloading their DOGE holdings and channeling investments in BinoFi’s ongoing presale. BinoFi is pioneering a first-to-market hybrid exchange to facilitate trading activities by creating suitable conditions for investors and frequent market participants. The move mimics Dogecoin's first first-to-market advantage which positioned the project as the first memecoin to enter the crypto scene. BinoFi could mimic Dogecoin's success or perform even better than the memecoin in the long run due to the project’s high utility and application. One important feature that sets BinoFi apart is its cross-chain trading capacity. The technological upgrade makes interoperability simpler and more efficient which is something the Web3 community is constantly trying to solve. The cross-chain element will facilitate asset transfer from one blockchain to another without traders and market participants sourcing risky third parties or using wrapped tokens. Will BinoFi’s BINO reach $1 in 2025? BinoFi’s presale is performing better than what developers had anticipated. The project has met high demand in the industry as retail and institutional players pile in for a slice of the cake. Although the current price of BINO tokens is only $0.02, experts anticipate a 5,000% upsurge in 2025 that will drive BINO tokens past the $1 mark. Dogecoin will need to grow its market capitalization to a $1.4 trillion market cap for its investors to witness the same level of growth. The growth is not impossible but highly unlikely especially with macro headwinds intensifying the ongoing crypto market sell-off. BinoFi’s presale is the best investment vehicle for long-term investors looking for massive gains.

According to Arkham Intelligence, on 7 March 2025, the wallets received $77.5 million in Bitcoin and transferred this amount to three new addresses. This is the first time since the platform suddenly vanished in April 2016 that funds have been moved. ANCIENT DARKNET MARKET WAKES UP AFTER 9 YEARS WITH OVER $400M $BTC Wallets belonging to Nucleus Marketplace woke up this morning after 9 years of inactivity, transferring $77.5M worth of Bitcoin to 3 new wallets. Nucleus Marketplace wallets still hold $365M BTC. New addresses:… pic.twitter.com/JtPXBK8Aec — Arkham (@arkham) March 7, 2025 Nucleus Marketplace was an online marketplace active from 2014 to 2016 that used Bitcoin to sell various prohibited products, such as drugs and other products. It abruptly vanished in rather murky circumstances, which ignited discussions of an exit scam or a hack. Before it disappeared, it was said to hold more than 5,000 BTC, valued at over $2.25 million at that time. As such, these remaining funds are estimated to be worth $365 million due to the appreciation of Bitcoin. According to the blockchain explorers, some of the addresses involved in the transactions include 1GGe3, which was last active in April 2016. The three new wallets this money is being sent to are “bc1qm8,” “bc1qm0,” and “bc1qsh.” Speculations on the resurgence The activation of this wallet has raised issues regarding the individuals behind it, as well as the motive for those operations. The individuals can be the original admins, police, hackers or anyone else who could have access to the private keys. Some have joked that the funds might be going to the newly launched strategic Bitcoin reserve in the United States. In the new executive order, Bitcoin received from criminal activities will be used in the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. However, the nature or purpose of the transactions is still unknown. One user on X noted , “Right.. Just before the Summit.” In the ongoing White House crypto summit, President Trump has echoed dissatisfaction with the government’s approach to Bitcoin.

41301960,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=138269,1741389354,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Threatening AI Agents: Signal President Exposes Profound AI Privacy Risks,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/agentic-ai-privacy-security-risks/,"Are you ready to hand over your digital life to AI? Signal President Meredith Whittaker has issued a stark warning about agentic AI, painting a picture where convenience clashes head-on with critical AI privacy and security. At SXSW, Whittaker didn’t mince words, describing the burgeoning field of AI agents as potentially putting “your brain in a jar.” For crypto enthusiasts and tech-savvy individuals who value decentralization and data control, Whittaker’s concerns about agentic AI should resonate deeply. Let’s dive into why this advocate for secure communication is sounding the alarm on these seemingly helpful AI assistants. The Allure and the Abyss of Agentic AI: Understanding the Security Risks Imagine an AI that manages your daily digital grind – from booking concert tickets to coordinating with friends. Sounds like a dream, right? This is the promise of agentic AI . These intelligent systems are designed to act on your behalf, learning your preferences and automating tasks across the web. Whittaker illustrates this with a vivid example: Task Automation: AI agents can look up concerts, purchase tickets, add events to your calendar, and even message your friends about plans. Seamless Convenience: The goal is a hands-free digital experience, where the AI handles the mundane, freeing up your time. However, this convenience comes at a steep price, according to Whittaker. To perform these actions, agentic AI needs unprecedented access to your personal data and systems. This is where the security risks begin to surface. Deep Dive into the Privacy Issues: Why Agentic AI Raises Red Flags Whittaker meticulously breaks down the level of access agentic AI requires, revealing a concerning landscape of potential privacy issues : Access Point Privacy Implication Web Browser Control AI needs to navigate and operate your browser, potentially monitoring browsing history and online behavior. Financial Data Access Access to credit card information for purchases exposes sensitive financial details. Calendar and Messaging App Integration Access to personal schedules and communications reveals private conversations and plans. System-Wide Permissions “Root-like” access across your devices and databases means potentially unrestricted data visibility. Cloud Processing Data likely processed on remote servers, raising concerns about data storage, jurisdiction, and potential breaches. Whittaker emphasizes that this level of access, often “in the clear” due to encryption limitations in current models, creates significant privacy issues . The data needed to power these sophisticated agentic AI systems is unlikely to be processed locally on your device. Instead, it’s almost certainly transmitted to cloud servers, amplifying the security risks and potential for data exploitation. The Blood-Brain Barrier Breach: Agentic AI and Data Confluence Whittaker uses a powerful metaphor to describe the architectural shift agentic AI represents: breaching the “blood-brain barrier” between the application layer and the operating system layer. What does this mean in practical terms? Data Muddying: Agentic AI blurs the lines between separate services, conjoining data from various applications into a single, accessible pool. Privacy Undermining: If privacy-focused apps like Signal integrate with agentic AI, the very privacy they offer could be compromised as the AI needs access to message content. Surveillance Model Amplification: Whittaker connects the rise of agentic AI to the existing “bigger is better AI paradigm,” built on mass data collection and surveillance, warning of further privacy erosion. Her concerns echo broader anxieties within the cryptocurrency and privacy communities about centralized data control and the potential for misuse of personal information. The promise of a “magic genie bot” shouldn’t blind us to the underlying security risks and privacy issues inherent in agentic AI . Actionable Insights: Navigating the Agentic AI Landscape So, what can you do to stay informed and protect your AI privacy as agentic AI evolves? Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date on the developments in agentic AI and the ongoing discussions around its implications. Question Integration: Be critical of applications and services proposing agentic AI features, especially concerning data access and processing. Prioritize Privacy Tools: Continue to support and utilize privacy-focused technologies and platforms that minimize data collection and maximize user control. Advocate for Regulation: Engage in conversations and advocate for responsible AI development and regulations that prioritize user privacy and data security. Conclusion: A Call for Caution in the Age of Agentic AI Meredith Whittaker’s warning serves as a crucial reality check amidst the hype surrounding agentic AI . While the allure of AI assistants managing our digital lives is strong, the potential security risks and privacy issues are equally profound. As we venture further into the age of AI, maintaining a critical perspective and prioritizing user privacy will be paramount. The future of AI privacy and security depends on informed choices and proactive measures to ensure convenience doesn’t come at the cost of fundamental rights.

The technology applications automate executions including actions and transactions in a blockchain transaction. These contracts facilitate trusted transactions and agreements between pseudonymous buyers to auto-execute when certain predetermined conditions are met. Some of the largest smart contracting platforms include Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano. Although these projects have growth potential, investors have discovered a new DeFi gem that could yield better returns this year. Smart contracts shape how traders interact with crypto assets Smart contracts have now cemented their use cases and applications in the crypto arena through projects like Solana and Cardano. These automated technology applications have become part and parcel of everyday activities for crypto participants, traders, and investors. Meanwhile, BinoFi is taking the crypto industry on a different trajectory by introducing a unique product that DeFi users should find interesting. BinoFi developers plan to unveil a one-of-one cryptocurrency exchange. And no, this will not be your typical centralized platform like Binance or decentralized exchange like Uniswap. BinoFi’s crypto exchange is a hybrid crypto exchange platform with improved features from both centralized and decentralized exchanges. The platform has unveiled a presale that is distributing BINO tokens to investors at the rate of $0.02 per token. The presale is barely days old but has analysts speaking about its undervalued state. Many believe the project will experience an upsurge after going live once all 20 presale phases are completed. What makes the presale unique is the ICO organization. BinoFi’s presale has organized gradual price increases in each phase to ensure both early adopters and long-term holders can benefit from it. The presale also promotes fair distribution of the crypto assets to earn the trust of retail traders. The team guarantees that the project does not have any private sales and that 100% is public sale to prevent manipulation from larger players and institutions. The team has also set measures in place to encourage ICO participants to hold their crypto assets even after launch. ICO participants have a chance to stake their BINO holdings immediately after the Token Generation Event (TGE) for an early staking bonus. BinoFi ICO participants qualify to join BinoFi DAO The ICO participants will also be eligible to join the BinoFi DAO for governance and decision-making on major issues influencing the protocol. Holding BINO tokens will also unlock exclusive trading benefits for users. Traders will get up to 50% discounts on trading fees from just holding BINO tokens. BinoFi aspires to be a self-sustaining ecosystem with inbuilt revenue sources that make it more resilient to harsh crypto conditions. The protocol’s primary revenue streams will emanate from trading fees through its hybrid crypto exchange platform. BINO is among the few projects that have shown interest in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI). AI-powered trading tools provide a premium revenue stream that could serve both retail and institutional investors. The BinoFi team is developing AI Trade Bots, Institutional API & HFT tools, and AI-driven Market Sentiment and insights providers. Users will be required to pay a monthly subscription fee for pro-level trading automation & insights, fees will be used in the buy-back and burn of BINO tokens, liquidity and community rewards.

The body, which comprises the securities regulators in all the US states, Canadian provinces, and Mexico, described it as a “critical threat.” According to its press release , it developed a list of major risks facing retail investors by surveying securities regulators in the US and Canada and examining what they spent the most time investigating. The survey showed that most of the scams used marketing tactics that manipulated investors’ emotions. While most scams involved marketing digital assets and AI investments, NASAA observed that the scammers used traditional social media platforms to target their victims. In terms of the prevalence of use, Facebook had 31.7%, text-based platforms like WhatsApp and Instagram had 31.3%, short-form video platforms such as Instagram reels and TikTok had 19%, while long-form video platforms like Vimeo and YouTube had 14.1%. As the Association noted, scams are prevalent on digital platforms because they are effective in reaching a wide audience as quickly as possible. This allowed these scammers to have access to a wide group of victims. AI functioned as both a scam tool and a tactic Meanwhile, the group also observed that scammers are increasingly relying on artificial intelligence tools to create content and graphics and deepfake audio and videos. It expects this to increase in 2025 and highlights the market for it. It wrote: “The bad actors are creating and selling AI-powered trading bots, selling equity in companies, purportedly developing an AI model, or perpetrating account takeover scams.” Beyond using it as a tool, NASAA noted that scammers are also promoting AI-related financial instruments. According to the president of the Association, Leslie Van Buskirk, AI technology’s rapid growth has given scammers new tools to steal from users Buskirk said: “AI investing is the latest technology to make waves in the investing landscape and fraudsters are pitching new investments that often have nothing to do with the latest tech developments and instead play on fear of missing out or get rich quick schemes along with other heightened emotions.” In order to protect investors from these scams, state securities administrators believe that registration at the state level is essential. The NASAA enforcement section committee co-chair Amanda Senn noted that investors need to confirm the registration status of anyone promoting a financial institution to them on the internet or social media before they invest. Crypto-related scams and losses continue to happen The statement from NASAA only confirms earlier opinions from other regulators, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), about the prevalence of financial scams connected to digital assets. Last month, the FBI revealed that it has saved almost $300 million in crypto-related investment fraud for thousands of victims. Interestingly, scams are not the only challenge that retail investors face. Even those who avoid investing in fraudulent crypto assets and buy real ones are still at risk of losing their funds to phishing attacks, hacks, and other security compromises like the Bybit hack that resulted in the loss of more than $1.4 billion worth of Ethereum. Onchain transaction data showing phishing attack (Source: Scam Sniffer on X) Today, ScamSniffer reported that a victim lost over $117,000 in two phishing attacks. The attacker used the Permit2 phishing signature to steal the funds without the victim’s knowledge. Unsurprisingly, most of these phishing links are also scam promotions on social media.

Whispers are turning into announcements as leading cryptocurrency exchange Kraken reportedly sets its sights on a public offering. According to a recent report from Bloomberg, amplified by Unfolded on X, Kraken is aiming for a Q1 2026 Initial Public Offering (IPO). This exciting development positions Kraken alongside other major crypto players like Gemini, Bullish, and Circle, all considered frontrunners in the race to become publicly traded crypto companies. Let’s dive into what this Kraken IPO could mean for the crypto landscape and for you as an investor. Why is a Kraken IPO a Big Deal for the Crypto Space? A Kraken IPO isn’t just another company going public; it’s a potential watershed moment for the entire cryptocurrency industry. For years, the crypto market has been viewed by some as a nascent, volatile, and somewhat fringe financial sector. However, the increasing maturity of companies like Kraken and their pursuit of IPOs signals a significant shift towards mainstream acceptance and institutional legitimacy. Here’s why this is such a pivotal development: Validation of the Crypto Industry: A successful crypto IPO by a major exchange like Kraken would send a powerful message to traditional financial markets and regulators. It would demonstrate that cryptocurrency businesses can achieve the scale, stability, and transparency required to operate as public companies. Increased Investor Confidence: Publicly traded companies are subject to stringent regulatory oversight and reporting requirements. This added layer of accountability could boost investor confidence in the crypto market, attracting both retail and institutional investors who may have been hesitant to enter the space before. Access to Capital for Growth: An IPO provides Kraken with access to significant capital. This influx of funds can be strategically deployed to fuel further expansion, enhance technology infrastructure, develop innovative products and services, and potentially acquire other companies in the crypto ecosystem. Enhanced Brand Recognition and Trust: Becoming a public company can significantly elevate Kraken’s brand profile and build trust among users. Public scrutiny and reporting can foster greater transparency and accountability, which are crucial for long-term success in the competitive crypto exchange market. What Does Q1 2026 Target Mean for the Kraken Exchange IPO Timeline? While Q1 2026 might seem like a distant target, it’s important to understand that preparing for a cryptocurrency IPO is a complex and time-consuming process. Several factors influence the timeline, and Q1 2026 likely represents a carefully considered target date. Here’s a breakdown of potential steps and considerations: Phase Activities Timeline Considerations Pre-IPO Planning & Preparation Legal and regulatory compliance Financial audits and reporting Corporate governance structure enhancement Underwriter selection Drafting of prospectus Can take 12-18 months or longer depending on complexity and regulatory requirements. Regulatory Review & Approval SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) review in the US (if applicable) or relevant regulatory body in chosen jurisdiction. Addressing regulatory queries and revisions. Varies depending on regulatory workload and complexity of the filing. Can take several months. Marketing & Roadshow Investor presentations and roadshows to gauge interest. Refinement of IPO pricing and share allocation strategy. Typically a few weeks leading up to the IPO date. Market conditions and investor sentiment play a crucial role. IPO Launch & Trading Pricing of shares and IPO launch. Commencement of trading on a stock exchange. Final step, dependent on successful completion of previous phases. The Q1 2026 timeframe suggests that Kraken is already well into the pre-IPO planning phase and is aiming for a launch window that allows sufficient time for regulatory approvals and market conditions to align favorably. It’s crucial to remember that IPO timelines are not set in stone and can be subject to delays based on various internal and external factors. What Challenges Might Kraken Face on its Path to a Crypto IPO? While the prospect of a Kraken exchange IPO is exciting, the path to becoming a publicly traded crypto company is not without its hurdles. Kraken, like other crypto firms considering this route, will need to navigate a complex landscape of challenges: Regulatory Scrutiny: The cryptocurrency industry is still under intense regulatory scrutiny globally. Kraken will need to demonstrate robust compliance frameworks and address any potential regulatory concerns to gain approval for its IPO. This includes navigating varying regulations across different jurisdictions if they operate internationally. Market Volatility: The crypto market is known for its volatility. This inherent volatility could impact investor sentiment and Kraken’s valuation during the IPO process. Maintaining consistent performance and demonstrating resilience in the face of market fluctuations will be key. Competition: The crypto exchange market is highly competitive. Kraken competes with numerous established players and emerging platforms. They will need to clearly articulate their competitive advantages and growth strategies to attract investors in the public market. Public Market Demands: Operating as a public company comes with increased demands for transparency, quarterly reporting, and shareholder accountability. Kraken will need to adapt its operational structure and culture to meet these new requirements and manage investor expectations effectively. Beyond Kraken: Why are Other Crypto Companies Eyeing IPOs? The report highlighting Kraken’s IPO ambitions also mentions Gemini, Bullish, and Circle as potential crypto companies IPO candidates. This trend of crypto firms exploring public listings reflects a broader evolution within the industry. Several factors are driving this movement: Maturity of the Crypto Market: The crypto market has matured significantly over the past decade. Companies like Kraken, Gemini, Bullish, and Circle have grown into substantial businesses with established user bases, revenue streams, and operational infrastructure. They are reaching a stage where an IPO becomes a logical next step for growth and expansion. Investor Demand: There is growing investor appetite for exposure to the cryptocurrency market through traditional investment vehicles. IPOs of reputable crypto companies offer a way for both institutional and retail investors to gain access to this asset class within a regulated and familiar framework. Capital Raising Opportunities: As mentioned earlier, IPOs provide significant capital infusion. This capital is crucial for crypto companies to invest in innovation, expand their services, and scale their operations to meet the growing demand for crypto products and services. Legitimacy and Mainstream Adoption: Public listings contribute to the overall legitimacy and mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. They signal that crypto is moving beyond the fringes and becoming an integral part of the global financial system. Actionable Insights: What Should Crypto Investors Watch For? The potential crypto IPO wave, spearheaded by companies like Kraken, presents exciting opportunities and developments for crypto investors. Here are some actionable insights to keep in mind: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on news and updates regarding Kraken’s IPO plans and the IPO landscape for other crypto companies. Follow reputable crypto news sources and financial media outlets for the latest developments. Due Diligence is Key: If you are considering investing in crypto company IPOs, conduct thorough due diligence. Understand the company’s business model, financial performance, regulatory compliance, and competitive positioning. Don’t invest based on hype alone. Understand IPO Risks: IPOs can be volatile investments, especially in a relatively new and dynamic sector like cryptocurrency. Be aware of the risks involved and invest according to your risk tolerance and investment goals. Long-Term Perspective: Consider crypto company IPOs as long-term investments. The crypto market is still evolving, and the long-term potential of these companies will depend on their ability to adapt, innovate, and navigate the evolving regulatory landscape. Conclusion: A Transformative Moment for Crypto? Kraken’s reported plans for a Kraken IPO in Q1 2026 are more than just company news; they represent a potentially transformative moment for the cryptocurrency industry. As major crypto exchanges like Kraken move towards public listings, they are paving the way for greater mainstream acceptance, increased investor confidence, and accelerated growth of the crypto market. While challenges remain, the momentum is building, and the coming years could witness a significant evolution in how the world perceives and interacts with cryptocurrencies. The cryptocurrency IPO trend is one to watch closely, as it could reshape the financial landscape and unlock new opportunities in the digital asset space.

Newcomers in the industry are better off doubling down on utility projects such as BinoFi while minimizing exposure to crypto assets driven by hype, hope, and trending memes. Memecoin investors were taken by storm after U.S. President Donald Trump entered the space with a memecoin project that has since cost 500,000 investors to lose money. Trump’s memecoin flops as investors eye a new utility project U.S. president and crypto advocate Donald Trump launched his memecoin, OFFICIAL TRUMP days before his inauguration ceremony. The project became an instant hit amassing over $5 billion in market capitalization hours after launch. Early investors greatly benefited from the hype. However, more than 500,000 investors have lost money after the memecoin plummeted. According to data from crypto price aggregator CoinMarketCap, the memecoin is down 82% from its all-time high. OFFICIAL TRUMP's investors are now shifting their focus to BinoFi in an attempt to recover some of their lost funds. BinoFi has proven itself to be a market leader in crypto exchange activities. Unlike memecoins, BinoFi has the real-world utility of supporting the crypto market with exchange-related services and modern trading solutions. BinoFi’s presale is currently underway and investors are rushing before BINO prices surge. Memecoin investors need to take a breather by switching to high-return utility alternatives like BinoFi as they wait for their preferred niche to stabilize. Memecoin activity cools off as BinoFi prepares for a 1200% surge According to data from CoinGecko, memecoin activity has cooled off as investors remain wary of imminent market drops and bad launches. Smart investors have chosen to buy BinoFi’s presale instead of sitting on the sidelines. BinoFi’s presale offers investors a chance to capitalize on an utility project before everyone else joins the bandwagon. The project’s presale has just unveiled its first presale phase where investors rush to get a slice of the cake. BINO tokens are currently available for purchase for only $0.02. The team has set a launch price of $0.3 which automatically makes investments made during the current phase surge by 1,200% when the launch happens. The presale’s demand is increasing day by day and the team expects the ICO to sell out before the dates they had initially planned. Buying BinoFi now presents a similar opportunity to buying Bitcoin in 2009. The BinoFi infrastructure is based on a DeFi crypto exchange platform offering traders unique perks from both centralized and decentralized exchanges. The project seeks to close the gaps by merging the two exchange features. Users will enjoy the security and self-custody of decentralized exchanges while simultaneously exploiting deep liquidity from centralized exchange liquidity pools. BinoFi will create the next wave of millionaires Unlike memecoins that lack utility, BinoFi has unveiled the first-ever hybrid crypto exchange with a purpose-driven ecosystem powered by BINO tokens. The tokens will be used in governance through BinoFi’s decentralized autonomous organization. This implies that BINO holders will automatically qualify to vote and take part in decision-making activities affecting the DeFi protocol.

Former President Donald Trump is reportedly making a bold move, pushing hard for stablecoin legislation to be passed in the United States Congress before the upcoming August recess. This news, initially reported by Unfolded on X, has sent ripples through the digital asset community, sparking both excitement and anticipation. But what exactly does this mean for you, the average crypto enthusiast, investor, or someone just dipping their toes into the world of digital currencies? Let’s dive into the details and unpack what this urgent push for stablecoin regulation could entail. Why is Stablecoin Legislation Suddenly a Priority? The timing of this push from Trump raises some crucial questions. Why now? And why stablecoins specifically? Stablecoins , cryptocurrencies pegged to a stable reserve asset like the US dollar, have become increasingly vital to the crypto ecosystem. They act as a bridge between traditional finance and the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, offering stability for trading, lending, and everyday transactions within the digital economy. Here’s why stablecoin regulation is gaining momentum: Growing Market Cap and Adoption: The stablecoin market has exploded in recent years, with major players like Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC) commanding billions in market capitalization. This growth has caught the attention of regulators globally, concerned about systemic risks and consumer protection. Regulatory Scrutiny Intensifies: Global regulatory bodies like the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and national agencies like the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have been increasingly vocal about the need to regulate stablecoins. Concerns range from money laundering and illicit finance to the potential impact on monetary policy. Political Will and Election Year Dynamics: With the US presidential elections on the horizon, Trump ‘s involvement could be politically motivated. Positioning himself as pro-innovation while also addressing regulatory concerns could be a strategic move to appeal to various voter demographics. Crypto has become a surprisingly hot topic in the current political landscape. Industry Lobbying Efforts: The cryptocurrency industry itself has been actively lobbying for clear and consistent crypto regulation , including for stablecoins. Clarity in regulation can foster innovation and attract more institutional investment, benefiting the industry as a whole. Decoding Trump’s Stance on Crypto Regulation While traditionally perceived as skeptical towards cryptocurrencies, Donald Trump’s recent statements and actions suggest a potential shift in his approach. His administration previously saw some level of regulatory ambiguity around digital assets. However, this new push for stablecoin legislation could indicate a more proactive stance. Is this a genuine interest in fostering responsible innovation, or is it a politically calculated move? Consider these points to understand the nuances of Trump’s potential position: Aspect Potential Interpretation Push for Legislation Before August Recess Indicates urgency and a desire for quick action, possibly to score political points or address immediate economic concerns. Focus on Stablecoins Suggests a targeted approach, recognizing stablecoins as a critical and relatively less volatile segment of the crypto market compared to more speculative cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Alignment with Industry Needs Could signal a willingness to work with the crypto industry to create a regulatory framework that is both effective and innovation-friendly. Potential for Future Crypto Policy Stablecoin legislation could be a stepping stone towards broader crypto regulation in the US, setting a precedent for how other digital assets are treated. What Could Stablecoin Legislation Look Like? The specifics of the potential stablecoin legislation are still unclear, but we can anticipate some key areas it might address: Issuer Licensing and Registration: Legislation could mandate that stablecoin issuers obtain licenses and register with regulatory bodies, ensuring accountability and oversight. Reserve Requirements and Audits: To maintain stability and investor confidence, laws might require stablecoin issuers to hold sufficient reserves backing their tokens, subject to regular audits and transparency requirements. Consumer Protection Measures: Legislation could include provisions to protect consumers from fraud, market manipulation, and other risks associated with stablecoins, similar to protections in traditional finance. Interoperability and Payment Systems: Laws could aim to integrate stablecoins into existing payment systems and promote interoperability with traditional financial infrastructure, fostering wider adoption and utility. Clarity on Regulatory Jurisdiction: Defining which agencies (like the SEC, CFTC, or a newly formed crypto-specific regulator) have jurisdiction over stablecoins will be crucial for regulatory clarity and industry compliance. Impact on the Digital Assets Market and Beyond The passage of comprehensive stablecoin legislation could have far-reaching consequences for the digital assets market and the broader financial landscape: Increased Legitimacy and Institutional Adoption: Clear regulation can legitimize the stablecoin market, attracting more institutional investors and mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. Market Stability and Reduced Volatility: Robust regulatory frameworks can enhance the stability of stablecoins, making them more reliable for payments, trading, and other financial activities. Innovation and Growth in the Crypto Sector: Regulatory clarity can foster innovation by providing a clear roadmap for crypto businesses to operate and grow within the US. Potential for CBDCs: Some argue that regulating stablecoins is a necessary step before the US considers launching its own Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), as it establishes a regulatory framework for digital currencies. Global Regulatory Influence: US stablecoin legislation could set a global precedent, influencing how other countries regulate digital assets and shaping the future of the international crypto landscape. What Should Crypto Enthusiasts Do Now? This development is a call to action for the crypto community. Here’s what you can do to stay informed and potentially influence the outcome: Stay Updated: Follow reputable crypto news sources and regulatory updates closely. Monitor developments in Congress and statements from key policymakers. Engage with Industry Advocacy Groups: Support organizations that are advocating for sensible crypto regulation and engage in discussions about the best way forward. Contact Your Representatives: Reach out to your elected officials to express your views on stablecoin regulation and the importance of fostering innovation in the crypto space. Educate Yourself and Others: Understand the nuances of stablecoins, their benefits, and potential risks. Share accurate information and help dispel misinformation. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Crypto? Trump’s push for stablecoin legislation before the August recess marks a potentially pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry. Whether this initiative stems from genuine conviction, political strategy, or a combination of both, the outcome could significantly shape the future of digital assets in the United States and globally. The coming weeks will be crucial in observing how this unfolds and what concrete legislative steps are taken. One thing is clear: the conversation around crypto regulation is intensifying, and stablecoins are squarely in the spotlight. Stay tuned, the crypto landscape is about to get even more interesting!

The market reaction has kept ETH pinned below $2,142, struggling to establish a bullish recovery as sellers remain in control. Ethereum price dropped below $2,100 on Friday, amid inflation readings in US NFP Ethereum’s price decline below $2,100 on Friday underscores bearish dominance, exacerbated by heightened macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from the latest US NFP report . The payroll data, which came in hotter than expected, showing rising unemployment which raised concerns over persistent inflation, strengthening the case for a hawkish Federal Reserve stance. Ethereum Price Analysis: 4-hourly Chart Bears eyeing $2,000 on 4-Hour Chart Ethereum price remains under downward pressure on the 4-hour chart after failing to break past the $2,319 resistance level. The rejection at this key price ceiling has reinforced bearish momentum, with the latest candlesticks showing increased selling pressure near the $2,156 pivot. A confluence of technical indicators signals potential downside risk toward the $2,000 psychological support level. The Donchian Channel (DC) highlights the recent price contraction, with the upper boundary at $2,319 and the lower support band at $1,993. Ethereum Price Analysis: 4-hourly Chart The failed breakout attempt near the upper band suggests that bulls lack the strength to sustain a move higher, leaving the door open for further declines. The price action is currently hovering around the middle DC line, signaling indecision, but with a tilt toward the downside as volume spikes on red candles. Bearish momentum is further evident in the breakdown from the highlighted price cluster, where Ethereum shed 7.53% over six consecutive 4-hour candles. The red zone illustrates a liquidity flush, likely triggering stop-loss cascades from leveraged long positions, adding to the selling pressure. If the $2,156 support fails, Ethereum could slide toward $2,000, aligning with the lower Donchian boundary. On the flip side, a reclaim of $2,200 could reignite bullish sentiment and set up another test of the $2,319 resistance. Ethereum Price Forecast: Daily time frame chart Bulls Struggles Below $2,142—Will $2,009 Support Hold? Ethereum price forecast signals continue to lean bearish on the 24-hour chart, struggling to hold above the $2,142 level after facing strong resistance at $2,258. The latest daily candle reflects increased selling pressure, with ETH losing 2.73% in the session, confirming persistent bearish sentiment. The Keltner Channel (KC) highlights this downside momentum, as the price remains close to the lower band at $2,009, signaling the potential for further declines if the current support structure collapses. Ethereum Price Analysis: 24-hourly Chart A clear downward trajectory is evident as ETH price has remained below the middle KC line of $2,417, reinforcing the bearish control of market structure. The sharp -7.53% drop over a single daily candle suggests that leverage liquidations could be playing a role in accelerating the selloff. If Ethereum fails to defend $2,100, a deeper retracement toward the $2,009 support appears likely, where buyers might attempt to reestablish control. Despite the bearish setup, a bounce from current levels could shift momentum in favor of the bulls. If Ethereum reclaims $2,200 and sustains a move above the $2,258 resistance, it could target the $2,417 mid-KC level, with an extended rally opening the door for a potential retest of $2,825. However, with volatility increasing and bears dominating, Ethereum risks further downside unless demand steps in decisively. Ethereum Price Outlook Today Ethereum’s technical landscape reflects conflicting signals balance between bearish macroeconomic pressures and potential short-term rebounds. The 24-hour chart highlights key support at $2,009, while the 4-hour ETH price chart signals immediate downside risks following the rejection at $2,319.

41302966,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=138275,1741391114,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Trump’s Bold Bitcoin Stance: US Government to Become a Crypto Hoarder?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-bitcoin-us-government/,"In a surprising turn of events that has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency world, former U.S. President Donald Trump made a powerful declaration at the White House Crypto Summit: “I will never sell Bitcoin.” This statement marks a significant shift in the U.S. government’s approach to digital assets, particularly Bitcoin , and has ignited discussions across the globe. For crypto enthusiasts and investors alike, this news is nothing short of monumental. But what exactly does this mean, and how will it reshape the future of Bitcoin and the U.S.’s role in the crypto ecosystem? Why Trump’s Bitcoin Announcement at the Crypto Summit is Monumental? Imagine the scene: the White House Crypto Summit, a gathering of industry leaders, policymakers, and innovators. Donald Trump , a figure known for his impactful pronouncements, steps up to the podium and states unequivocally, “I will never sell Bitcoin .” This wasn’t just a casual remark; it was a deliberate and strategic announcement with far-reaching implications. Here’s why this moment is being hailed as monumental: Shift in Government Policy: For years, the U.S. government, like many others, has been navigating the complexities of cryptocurrency regulation and management. The fact that a former U.S. President, with potential future political ambitions, is making such a pro- Bitcoin statement signals a potential paradigm shift in how the U.S. government views and handles digital assets. End to Bitcoin Sales: Trump specifically mentioned that the U.S. federal government had seized a substantial amount of Bitcoin – around 200,000 BTC – through legal actions. While a significant portion was reportedly sold under the Biden administration, Trump declared an end to this practice. This effectively removes a potentially large and unpredictable source of selling pressure from the Bitcoin market. New Accumulation Strategy: Perhaps the most intriguing part of Trump’s statement is his assertion that the Treasury and Department of Commerce will actively seek “new ways to accumulate more Bitcoin without burdening taxpayers.” This suggests a proactive approach to Bitcoin adoption by the U.S. government, moving beyond simply seizing and selling to strategically holding and potentially increasing its Bitcoin holding . The US Government’s Bitcoin Stash: From Seller to Holder? The narrative around the U.S. government and Bitcoin has been largely about seizures and subsequent sales. Understanding the context of this shift from seller to potential holder is crucial: Aspect Previous Policy (Pre-Trump’s Announcement) New Policy (Post-Trump’s Announcement) Bitcoin Seizure Government agencies seize Bitcoin through law enforcement actions. Continues (as part of law enforcement). Bitcoin Disposal Majority of seized Bitcoin was sold, particularly during the Biden administration. Cessation of Bitcoin sales from seized holdings, starting from the announcement date. Bitcoin Strategy No clear strategy for holding or leveraging seized Bitcoin beyond liquidation. Active strategy to explore accumulating more Bitcoin without taxpayer burden. Market Impact Sales of seized Bitcoin could contribute to market volatility and downward pressure. Holding seized Bitcoin and potential accumulation could reduce selling pressure and signal long-term confidence. This table highlights the transformative nature of Trump’s declaration. The U.S. government, once a consistent seller, is now signaling a potential transition to a Bitcoin holding strategy. This change in stance could have profound effects on market dynamics and investor sentiment. Trump’s Bitcoin Strategy: What Does ‘Accumulate Without Burdening Taxpayers’ Mean? Trump’s statement about accumulating Bitcoin “without burdening taxpayers” raises intriguing questions. How exactly might the U.S. government achieve this? Here are a few possibilities: Continued Seizures: Law enforcement seizures will likely remain a primary source of Bitcoin acquisition. By simply holding onto seized Bitcoin instead of selling, the government’s holdings will naturally increase over time as criminal activities involving crypto continue to be addressed. Strategic Investments (Indirectly): While direct taxpayer-funded purchases might be politically sensitive, the government could explore indirect methods. For example, revenue generated from fines, penalties, or asset forfeitures related to crypto crimes could be strategically reinvested into acquiring Bitcoin . Public-Private Partnerships: The government could potentially collaborate with private sector entities in the crypto space. This might involve partnerships that allow the government to earn or acquire Bitcoin through various mechanisms, without direct budgetary allocations. Mining Revenue (Hypothetical & Unlikely): Although less probable given current U.S. policy, in a more radical scenario, the government could even explore the possibility of utilizing seized crypto mining equipment or engaging in mining activities using forfeited energy resources. However, this is highly speculative and faces significant political and regulatory hurdles. The exact methods remain to be seen, but Trump’s commitment to Bitcoin accumulation is clear. This proactive approach signals a deeper engagement with the cryptocurrency space and a potential recognition of Bitcoin’s strategic importance. Is This a Game Changer for Bitcoin Adoption? The implications of the U.S. government becoming a significant Bitcoin holder are far-reaching and could indeed be a game changer for Bitcoin adoption globally: Validation and Legitimacy: When a major world power like the U.S. government signals its intention to hold Bitcoin , it lends significant validation to the asset class. This can help to overcome skepticism and encourage broader institutional and retail adoption. Reduced Market Volatility (Potentially): By removing the U.S. government as a potential seller, and perhaps even becoming a buyer, the supply-demand dynamics of Bitcoin could be positively influenced. Reduced selling pressure and increased demand could potentially lead to greater price stability and upward momentum over time. Increased Institutional Interest: Institutional investors often look to government policies and regulatory signals when making investment decisions. A pro- Bitcoin stance from the U.S. government could further incentivize institutional investment in Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Geopolitical Implications: In a world increasingly shaped by digital technologies, nations are vying for leadership in the crypto space. The U.S. government embracing Bitcoin could position the U.S. as a more crypto-friendly nation, potentially attracting talent, innovation, and investment in the blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors. Challenges and Considerations of the US Government Holding Bitcoin While the prospect of the U.S. government holding Bitcoin is exciting for many, it’s important to acknowledge the challenges and considerations that come with such a significant move: Security and Custody: Securing a large Bitcoin holding is a complex undertaking. The government would need to implement robust security measures to protect against theft, hacking, and loss of private keys. Custody solutions, potentially involving hardware wallets and multi-signature setups, would be crucial. Regulatory Clarity: While Trump’s announcement is a strong signal, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. remains evolving. Clear and consistent regulations are needed to provide a stable framework for government Bitcoin holding and operations. Volatility Management: Bitcoin’s price volatility is a well-known characteristic. The government would need to develop strategies to manage the potential fluctuations in the value of its Bitcoin holding , especially for accounting and financial reporting purposes. Transparency and Accountability: Public scrutiny and accountability are paramount when it comes to government assets. Mechanisms for transparency regarding the government’s Bitcoin holding , transactions, and management practices would be essential to maintain public trust. Despite these challenges, Trump’s declaration marks a potentially transformative moment for Bitcoin and the U.S. government’s relationship with cryptocurrency. The shift from seller to holder could usher in a new era of government engagement with digital assets, with significant implications for the future of finance and technology. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Bitcoin and US Crypto Policy? Donald Trump’s announcement at the White House Crypto Summit – “I will never sell Bitcoin ” – is more than just a headline; it’s a powerful signal of a potential sea change in U.S. cryptocurrency policy. By committing to holding seized Bitcoin and exploring ways to accumulate more, the U.S. government could be on the verge of becoming a significant player in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

This has spurred a debate about cypherpunk values. When it became clear that the Lazarus Group hackers were swapping their stolen ETH for bitcoins on THORChain, an immediate vote to halt ETH to BTC swaps was passed, and then almost immediately reverted by other voters. THORChain made $5.5 million from its role as the main conduit for North Korean hackers laundering their ill-gotten gains, according to THORChain Explorer. The protocol saw $5.9 billion in swap volume in the 10 days from Feb. 22 through March 3. After 10 days, the hackers managed to launder all of the nearly 500,000 ether they stole into bitcoin.

The political winds are shifting, and the crypto landscape might be on the verge of a seismic change. Former U.S. President Donald Trump has thrown down the gauntlet, declaring an end to what he terms President Biden’s ‘war on crypto.’ This isn’t just political rhetoric; it’s a direct challenge to the current regulatory environment that many in the digital asset space view as stifling innovation and growth. Let’s dive into what Trump’s bold statements mean for the future of crypto regulation and, more importantly, for your investments. Decoding Trump’s Crypto Promise: What Does ‘Ending the War’ Really Mean? During his Crypto Summit speech, Trump didn’t mince words. He directly addressed the concerns of many in the crypto industry regarding regulatory pressure. He specifically called out ‘Chokepoint 2.0,’ a term that has become synonymous with the alleged strategy of regulators to indirectly target the crypto industry by pressuring banks to cut off services to crypto businesses. According to CoinDesk reports, this pressure has manifested in banks closing accounts of crypto firms and entrepreneurs, effectively creating roadblocks for fund transfers to and from cryptocurrency exchanges. Trump’s promise to ‘end the war’ and roll back ‘Chokepoint 2.0’ suggests a significant shift in approach. But what exactly could this entail? Here’s a breakdown of potential implications: Easing Regulatory Pressure: Trump’s administration could instruct regulatory bodies like the SEC and FinCEN to adopt a less aggressive stance towards the crypto industry. This could mean fewer enforcement actions and a more collaborative approach to rule-making. Unblocking Banking Access for Crypto Businesses: Rolling back ‘Chokepoint 2.0’ implies actively working to ensure crypto businesses have fair access to banking services. This could involve clarifying regulations for banks or even enacting policies that prevent discriminatory practices against crypto firms. Fostering Innovation: By reducing regulatory hurdles and improving banking access, Trump’s policies could aim to create a more favorable environment for crypto innovation and growth within the U.S. Crypto Regulation Under Biden: Understanding the ‘War’ To fully grasp the significance of Trump’s promise, it’s crucial to understand the context of the current regulatory landscape under President Biden. While the Biden administration hasn’t explicitly declared a ‘war on crypto,’ many in the industry feel that recent regulatory actions and pronouncements have been overly restrictive and even hostile. Here are some key aspects of the current crypto regulation environment often cited as evidence of this ‘war’: SEC Enforcement Actions: The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), under Chair Gary Gensler, has taken a firm stance, asserting jurisdiction over a wide range of crypto assets, deeming many as securities. This has led to numerous enforcement actions against crypto companies for alleged securities violations. Operation Chokepoint 2.0 Accusations: As Trump mentioned, the ‘Chokepoint 2.0’ accusation centers around the idea that regulators are using banks to indirectly control the crypto industry. Critics argue that this tactic stifles legitimate crypto businesses and pushes innovation offshore. Lack of Regulatory Clarity: A persistent complaint from the crypto industry is the lack of clear and consistent regulatory guidelines. This uncertainty makes it difficult for businesses to operate compliantly and discourages investment. Treasury Department Scrutiny: The Treasury Department, particularly through FinCEN and OFAC, has also increased its focus on crypto, emphasizing anti-money laundering (AML) and sanctions compliance, sometimes leading to stringent requirements and enforcement. The Potential Benefits of a Crypto-Friendly Trump Administration for Crypto Businesses If Trump’s promise translates into concrete policy changes, the benefits for crypto businesses could be substantial. Imagine a scenario where regulatory burdens are eased, and banking access is normalized. What could this unlock? Reduced Compliance Costs: Less aggressive regulation and clearer guidelines could significantly reduce the compliance costs for crypto companies, freeing up resources for innovation and growth. Increased Investment and Capital Flow: A more welcoming regulatory environment could attract greater investment into the crypto space, both from institutional investors and venture capital. Easier banking access would also facilitate smoother capital flow within the industry. Job Creation and Economic Growth: A thriving crypto sector, fueled by reduced regulatory friction, could lead to significant job creation in areas like software development, cybersecurity, and financial services. This, in turn, could contribute to broader economic growth. Innovation and Technological Advancement: With less fear of regulatory crackdowns, crypto businesses would be more incentivized to innovate and develop new blockchain-based technologies and applications, potentially benefiting various sectors beyond finance. Navigating the Challenges: Will Trump’s Promise Be Fully Realized? While Trump’s promise offers a beacon of hope for the crypto community, it’s crucial to approach it with a balanced perspective. Political promises are often easier made than kept, and the regulatory landscape is complex and influenced by numerous factors. Here are some potential challenges and considerations: Regulatory Inertia: Changing the course of regulatory bodies is not an overnight process. Even with a change in administration, regulatory agencies have established processes and priorities that can be slow to shift. Political and Public Sentiment: Public and political sentiment towards crypto can be volatile. Negative events or scandals in the crypto space could easily derail efforts to ease regulation, regardless of political promises. Global Regulatory Landscape: Crypto regulation is increasingly becoming a global issue. Even if the U.S. adopts a more crypto-friendly approach, international regulations and compliance requirements will still play a significant role for global crypto businesses. The Role of Congress: While presidential actions can influence regulatory agencies, significant and lasting changes in crypto regulation often require legislative action from Congress. The political makeup of Congress and bipartisan support for crypto-friendly legislation will be crucial. Actionable Insights: What Should Crypto Investors and Businesses Do Now? Trump’s statements have injected a dose of optimism into the crypto market. But what practical steps should crypto investors and businesses take in response? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on political developments and regulatory announcements related to crypto. Follow reputable news sources and industry publications to stay ahead of the curve. Engage with Policymakers: Support industry advocacy groups and initiatives that are working to educate policymakers about the benefits of crypto and advocate for sensible regulation. Prepare for Potential Regulatory Shifts: Businesses should review their compliance strategies and be prepared to adapt to potential changes in regulations, whether they become more lenient or stringent. Diversify and Manage Risk: While Trump’s promise is encouraging, the crypto market remains volatile. Diversification and prudent risk management are always essential investment strategies. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Crypto Regulation? Donald Trump’s pledge to end the ‘war on crypto’ marks a potentially pivotal moment for the digital asset industry. His focus on rolling back ‘Chokepoint 2.0’ and easing regulatory pressure resonates deeply with crypto businesses and investors who have long felt stifled by the current environment. While the path forward is uncertain and challenges remain, Trump’s bold promise injects a renewed sense of hope and anticipation into the crypto space. Whether this translates into a true ‘new dawn’ for crypto regulation remains to be seen, but the conversation has undoubtedly shifted, and the potential for significant change is now firmly on the table.

41303674,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=138285,1741392353,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Fierce AI Race: Microsoft Intensifies Efforts to Rival OpenAI’s Dominance,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/microsoft-ai-openai-competition-heats/,"The tech world is witnessing a fascinating power struggle as Microsoft, a long-time partner of OpenAI, is reportedly escalating its artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives. This strategic pivot signals a bold move by Microsoft to not just collaborate, but to directly compete with OpenAI, especially in powering its innovative products like the Copilot bot. For those in the cryptocurrency space, this intense competition mirrors the rapid innovation and rivalry we see in blockchain technologies, where companies constantly push boundaries to lead the next wave of technological advancement. Let’s dive into the details of Microsoft’s ambitious AI strategy and what it means for the future of technology. Why is Microsoft Stepping Up its AI Development Game? Microsoft’s increased focus on in-house AI development stems from a combination of strategic necessity and perhaps, a bit of competitive friction. Recent reports suggest that OpenAI has been less forthcoming with technical specifics about its advanced models, creating some tension in the relationship with Microsoft, despite the latter’s significant $14 billion investment. This has seemingly spurred Microsoft to become more self-reliant and explore diverse avenues for its AI ambitions. Here’s a breakdown of Microsoft’s multi-pronged approach: Building Proprietary AI Models: Microsoft has reportedly developed its own ‘reasoning’ AI models, internally benchmarked against OpenAI’s o1 and o3-mini models. This indicates a serious commitment to creating AI capabilities that are on par with, or even surpass, those of OpenAI. MAI Family of Models: Beyond individual models, Microsoft has also created a family of AI models known as MAI, directly competitive with OpenAI’s offerings. The potential plan to offer these models through an API later this year could position Microsoft as a significant player in the AI model marketplace, offering alternatives to businesses and developers. Exploring Alternative AI Partnerships: To diversify its AI resources, Microsoft is reportedly testing models from various leading AI companies like xAI (Elon Musk’s AI venture), Meta, Anthropic, and DeepSeek. This strategic move suggests Microsoft is hedging its bets, ensuring it isn’t solely reliant on OpenAI’s technology for critical products like Copilot. Strategic Talent Acquisition: The hiring of Mustafa Suleyman, co-founder of DeepMind and Inflection, to spearhead Microsoft’s AI efforts is a clear indication of the company’s seriousness. Suleyman’s expertise and leadership are expected to be pivotal in driving Microsoft’s ambitious AI agenda. OpenAI Competition : A Sign of a Maturing AI Landscape? The evolving relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI, from close collaboration to apparent OpenAI competition , highlights a significant trend in the AI industry. As AI technology matures and becomes more central to business strategies, companies are increasingly seeking control and diversification in their AI capabilities. This competition is not necessarily a negative development; in fact, it can be a catalyst for innovation, pushing both Microsoft and OpenAI to develop even more advanced and beneficial AI technologies. Just as competition in the cryptocurrency space drives innovation in blockchain and decentralized technologies, this rivalry in AI is likely to accelerate progress and broaden the applications of AI across various sectors. What Does This Mean for Microsoft AI and the Tech Industry? Microsoft’s intensified Microsoft AI efforts have several potential implications: Enhanced Copilot and Future Products: By exploring diverse AI models, Microsoft aims to enhance the capabilities of Copilot and future AI-powered products. This could lead to more sophisticated features, improved performance, and greater adaptability to user needs. A More Competitive AI Market: Microsoft’s entry as a direct competitor in AI models could disrupt the current market dynamics, potentially leading to more choices and competitive pricing for businesses seeking AI solutions. Accelerated Innovation: The race between Microsoft and OpenAI, along with other major tech players, is likely to fuel rapid innovation in AI. We can expect faster advancements in model performance, efficiency, and application across industries. Potential Shifts in AI Partnerships: Microsoft’s diversification strategy could signal a broader trend of tech giants seeking multiple AI partnerships and building in-house capabilities to reduce reliance on single providers. Navigating the Future of AI Models : Challenges and Opportunities While Microsoft’s ambitious move presents exciting opportunities, it also comes with challenges: Challenges Opportunities Ensuring seamless integration of diverse AI models into existing products and services. Creating more robust and versatile AI-powered solutions by leveraging the strengths of different models. Managing potential complexities of working with multiple AI providers and in-house development teams. Building a more resilient and adaptable AI infrastructure, less vulnerable to disruptions from a single provider. Maintaining ethical standards and responsible AI development across a broader range of models and partnerships. Fostering a more diverse and inclusive AI ecosystem by engaging with a wider range of AI developers and technologies. Conclusion: The AI Competition is Just Getting Started Microsoft’s ramped-up AI efforts signify a pivotal moment in the tech industry. The AI competition is intensifying, with major players vying for dominance in this transformative technology. For observers in the cryptocurrency world and beyond, this escalating rivalry promises accelerated innovation, diverse AI solutions, and a future where AI is even more deeply integrated into our daily lives and technologies. As Microsoft and OpenAI push the boundaries of AI, the entire tech landscape is set to benefit from this dynamic and evolving competition.

This Thursday, President Trump directed for the establishment of a Bitcoin reserve and digital asset stockpile for the other currencies with crypto seized during legal proceedings. David Sacks believes the government has about 200000 BTC from its seizures White House Czar David Sacks insisted that a crypto audit is necessary given how they’ve never done one. According to Sacks, the government has captured over 400,000 Bitcoins in criminal and civil proceedings over the last ten years. He believes the government is still in control of about half of that. However, he says they cannot be certain of the total crypto holdings since they’ve never done a proper audit. According to Arkham Intelligence, the United States owns roughly $17.5 billion in Bitcoin and about $400 million worth of other digital assets in known digital wallets. Meanwhile, Trump’s executive order mandates that the Treasury and Commerce Departments find “budget-neutral strategies” to acquire Bitcoin for the reserve, limiting them to forfeited assets for now. The US government will also have seized crypto build its separate digital asset stockpile to avoid incurring extra costs in acquisitions. Sacks added, “With the reserve, the goal is long-term preservation. With the stockpile, the goal is responsible stewardship.” Nevertheless, he has compared the BTC reserve and the separate digital asset stockpile to “a digital Fort Knox for cryptocurrency,” likening it to the Kentucky military base that holds part of the country’s gold reserves. However, some crypto analysts and enthusiasts expected Trump to take bolder steps in asset acquisition and are slightly disappointed that the reserve holdings are limited to only seized assets. For instance, Charles Edwards of the Capriole Fund, a Bitcoin and digital asset hedge fund, stated that no active Bitcoin purchases mean that the reserve is just a “fancy title” for already existing assets within the government’s control. Trump will meet some key crypto leaders soon President Donald Trump insisted that he wanted to make the US the global crypto capital, and signing this executive order to create a BTC reserve was a step forward for the crypto industry. So far, the crypto industry has also seen impressive changes in regulations and across regulatory agencies where Trump appointed key crypto supporters. For instance, the Securities and Exchanges Commission has dropped or paused over 10 cases, including its case against crypto exchange Coinbase. Before Trump authorised the formation of a working group that would recommend and develop policies for cryptocurrencies, the group was also supposed to propose strategies for the government to establish crypto strategic reserves. Coinbase Global Inc. CEO Brian Armstrong, Strategy CEO Michael Saylor and Vlad Tenev of Robinhood Markets Inc. are scheduled to meet with Trump, Sacks and Bo Hines to discuss more pro-crypto policies.

While Cardano continues to focus on scalability and sustainability, offering a strong foundation for decentralized applications, Lightchain AI is quickly emerging as a major competitor. Priced at just $0.006 during its presale and already raising $16.9 million, Lightchain AI combines blockchain technology with artificial intelligence, offering decentralized, scalable solutions with real-world applications. As Lightchain AI’s presale gains momentum, it could potentially surpass both ADA and DOGE in growth, making it a top contender for 2025. Cardano Price Prediction for 2025- Can ADA Reach $13? As of February 27, 2025, Cardano (ADA) is trading at approximately $0.65. Analysts predict that by the end of 2025, ADA's price could range between $0.698 and $0.812, with an average around $0.753. Reaching $13 would require a substantial increase of over 1,900% from its current price. While some analysts, like Dan Gambardello, have speculated about such a possibility, these views are considered highly optimistic and not widely supported. Given the current market trends and projections, a $13 price point for ADA by the end of 2025 appears highly unlikely. Investors should approach such predictions with caution and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions. How Dogecoin (DOGE) and Lightchain AI Are Competing for the Top Spot Dogecoin (DOGE) and Lightchain AI are competing for the top spot in the crypto space, but each takes a very different approach. DOGE’s popularity stems from its meme status and community-driven growth, while Lightchain AI is focused on innovation through the integration of artificial intelligence with blockchain. Lightchain AI stands out by mitigating bias in AI models through decentralized contributions, ensuring fairness and inclusivity in decision-making. The platform also emphasizes distributing control through decentralized governance, allowing token holders to vote on key decisions and shape the future of the project. Additionally, interoperability with other blockchain networks allows Lightchain AI to seamlessly integrate with various ecosystems, expanding its reach. These unique features, combined with strong tokenomics, position Lightchain AI to potentially surpass DOGE in both utility and growth in the near future. Why Lightchain AI Could Be Major Player in 2025 As blockchain technology evolves and artificial intelligence takes center stage, their integration is shaping the future of innovation. Enter Lightchain AI —a platform redefining scalability and sustainability in the blockchain space. With industries increasingly adopting blockchain and AI, the opportunities for Lightchain AI are skyrocketing. This growing momentum could drive widespread adoption, boosting demand for its platform and its native token. While some cryptocurrencies, like ADA, may face challenges reaching ambitious targets like $13 by 2025, Lightchain AI is carving out its own path. Its cutting-edge solutions and rising popularity position it as a potential game-changer in the crypto market. Don’t miss your chance to get in early.

The agency emphasized that it permits a range of activities with crypto, and it confirms and reaffirms those activities. It also rescinds guidance from 2021 that banks found burdensome and discriminatory. The OCC’s Interpretive Letter 1183 of March 7 is the first to be issued under Acting Comptroller of the Currency Rodney Hood, who was appointed to his post on Feb. 11. Hood is quoted in a press release as saying that the letter ensures “Bank activities are treated consistently by the OCC, regardless of the underlying technology.” Hood further said he would “continue to work diligently to ensure regulations are effective and not excessive.” The OCC’s letter is about letters Interpretive Letter 1183 begins by saying Letter 1179 has been rescinded. That letter required national banks to notify their supervisory office if they intend to engage in any of the activities permitted in other letters. The supervisory office would then evaluate the banks’ adequacy and reply in writing to object to the proposed activities or confirm its nonobjection. That letter was issued in November 2021 under Hood’s predecessor acting comptroller Michael Hsu. The OCC has gained supervisory experience and realized those measures are no longer necessary, the new letter said. The rescission should reduce banks’ burden, encourage responsible innovation and enhance transparency. It also ensures that bank activities are treated consistently, regardless of the underlying technology. In 2020 and 2021, the OCC issued letters concerning banks providing crypto asset custody ( 1170 ), the use of dollar deposits to back stablecoins ( 1172 ) and the use of public blockchains to verify payments ( 1174 ). All of those letters were issued while Brian Brooks was comptroller. Brooks was a former Coinbase chief legal officer. Now the OCC will examine the activities described in those letters, Letter 1183 said. The letter backpedals on joint policy The press release for the new letter stated that the OCC has also withdrawn its participation in the joint statement on crypto asset risks. That document was issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the OCC in January 2023. The joint statement came on the heels of the collapse of FTX and the rest of the events of the crypto winter. “It is important that risks related to the crypto-asset sector that cannot be mitigated or controlled do not migrate to the banking system,” it said. It went on to list eight specific risks. Banks can provide services to customers of any type, the statement read, but “based on the agencies’ current understanding and experience to date, the agencies believe that issuing or holding as principal crypto-assets … is highly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices.” It’s still early for jubilation Caitlin Long, founder and CEO of crypto-native Custodia Bank and a long-time critic of banking regulation as it applies to crypto, was reticent in her praise of the new OCC letter. “Amid all the jubilation about the OCC news, #OperationChokePoint2.0 isn’t over until: 1. Fed & FDIC also rescind their anti-#crypto guidance, which is still in effect (Fed & FDIC were far more detrimental to crypto banking than OCC) & 2. @custodiabank has its Fed master account,” Long wrote on X. The OCC regulates national banks, while the Federal Reserve regulates state banks (which are otherwise overseen by state agencies and cannot open branches out of state). The FDIC regulates commercial banks, which are a subset of both state and national banks. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The United States is signaling a major policy U-turn. After a period of intense regulatory scrutiny, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has declared an end to the crypto crackdown , paving the way for a more innovation-friendly environment for digital assets. This groundbreaking announcement, delivered at the White House Crypto Summit, suggests a significant change in approach that could reshape the future of cryptocurrency in America and its global influence. Are you ready to explore what this means for you, for the market, and for the future of finance? Why the Sudden Shift Away From Crypto Crackdown? For months, the crypto industry has navigated a complex web of regulations, often feeling like authorities were putting the brakes on innovation. Secretary Bessent’s speech signals a clear departure from this stance. He openly criticized past policies, acknowledging that a heavy-handed crypto crackdown approach was actually hindering progress and pushing innovation overseas. This is a crucial admission and a welcome change for many in the digital asset space. But what exactly prompted this change of heart? Recognizing Stifled Innovation: The Treasury Secretary explicitly stated that previous regulatory measures were ‘stifling innovation.’ This suggests a growing understanding within the government that overly strict rules can push groundbreaking technologies and businesses away from the U.S. President Trump’s Pro-Tech Stance: The announcement is closely aligned with President Trump’s publicly declared pro-technology stance. This political backing gives weight to the policy shift and suggests a long-term commitment to fostering innovation in the digital realm. Global Competitiveness Concerns: It’s likely the U.S. is also considering its global standing. Other nations are actively embracing and regulating crypto, creating hubs for digital asset innovation. A continued crypto crackdown risked the U.S. falling behind in this crucial technological race. Stablecoins: The Unsung Heroes in Maintaining US Dollar Dominance A key highlight of Secretary Bessent’s announcement was the emphasis on stablecoins . He specifically identified them as crucial for maintaining the U.S. dollar’s global dominance in the evolving financial landscape. This is a powerful endorsement of stablecoins and their potential. But why are stablecoins so important in this context? Stablecoins , cryptocurrencies pegged to a stable reserve asset like the US dollar, bridge the gap between traditional finance and the volatile crypto world. They offer the speed and efficiency of blockchain technology while maintaining price stability. Secretary Bessent seems to recognize that: Global Transactions: Stablecoins facilitate faster and cheaper international transactions, potentially strengthening the dollar’s role in global commerce. Digital Dollar Infrastructure: They can be seen as a stepping stone towards a potential central bank digital currency (CBDC) or at least a key component of a future digital dollar ecosystem. Innovation Hub: By supporting stablecoins, the U.S. can become a hub for stablecoin innovation, attracting businesses and talent in this rapidly growing sector. What Does This Mean for Digital Assets? The shift away from a crypto crackdown and towards a more supportive regulatory framework has profound implications for the entire digital assets ecosystem. It’s not just about stablecoins; it’s about creating a fertile ground for all types of crypto innovation. Here’s what we can expect: Area Potential Impact Innovation Expect a surge in crypto startups and projects within the U.S. as regulatory uncertainty decreases. Investment Increased institutional and retail investment in digital assets as the market matures and gains legitimacy. Adoption Wider adoption of cryptocurrencies for payments, investments, and various applications as regulatory hurdles are eased. Job Creation Growth in the crypto industry will lead to new job opportunities in technology, finance, and related sectors. Navigating the New Crypto Regulation Landscape While the announcement signals an end to the crypto crackdown , it doesn’t mean a complete absence of crypto regulation . Instead, it suggests a move towards smarter, more innovation-friendly rules. What should businesses and individuals in the crypto space be prepared for? Clarity, Not Absence of Rules: Expect regulations to become clearer and more targeted, focusing on consumer protection and preventing illicit activities without stifling innovation. Collaboration: The government may seek more collaboration with the crypto industry to develop effective and balanced regulatory frameworks. Focus on Key Areas: Regulation might prioritize areas like stablecoins, exchanges, and DeFi to ensure market stability and investor confidence. Actionable Insights: Preparing for a Crypto-Friendly Future This policy shift presents significant opportunities. Here are some actionable insights to consider: For Businesses: If you’ve been hesitant to launch or expand your crypto business in the U.S. due to regulatory concerns, now might be the time to reconsider. Explore opportunities for innovation and growth within a more supportive environment. For Investors: Stay informed about evolving regulations and market developments. A clearer regulatory landscape could lead to increased market stability and new investment opportunities in digital assets . For Individuals: Educate yourself about cryptocurrencies and stablecoins . Understand their potential benefits and risks as they become more integrated into the financial system. A New Dawn for Crypto in the USA? Secretary Bessent’s announcement is a watershed moment. It signifies a potential turning point in the U.S. approach to cryptocurrency, moving from a period of intense scrutiny to one of cautious embrace. By ending the crypto crackdown and recognizing the strategic importance of digital assets and stablecoins , the U.S. is signaling its intent to remain a leader in technological innovation and global finance. This shift could unleash a wave of innovation, investment, and adoption, shaping the future of money and the internet as we know it. The journey ahead will still require careful navigation and collaboration, but the direction is undeniably more promising for the crypto industry in the United States.

His analysis builds on detailed wave counts, multiple Fibonacci extension targets, and critical moving averages, offering a granular look at the BTC’s near- and mid-term possibilities. What’s Next For Bitcoin? Big Mike’s chart displays a complex Elliott Wave structure consisting of five main impulse waves and interspersed corrective sub-waves. A key area labeled near $72,895 corresponds to wave (c)(iv), representing a major potential bottom if the market breaks below $78,000 and continues lower. Notable corrective waves around $85,000 to $95,000 appear to have formed a larger consolidation phase, which he regards as a precursor to the next directional move. The chart also pinpoints an upside pathway from roughly $95,000, projecting impulse waves (3), (4), and (5) that extend into the $100,000–$140,000 zone. Related Reading: Historic Bitcoin Buy Signal: DXY’s Collapse Signals A Bigger Bull Run Fibonacci extension targets appear at approximately $114,693 (1.618 extension) which could be the target for wave (3), followed by a corrective move to $102,000 before starting wave 5 which aims for $137,727 (2.618 extension), or even a final leg near $150,000 aligns with wave c(3). Moving averages in the $72,000–$90,000 range underscore the significance of support near $78,000–$72,895, while an upper band around $90,000–$95,000 represents a crucial resistance corridor. The analyst observes a descending wedge formation from mid-February to early March, spanning $95,000 down to $85,000, and notes that an upside breakout could herald a renewed push into six-figure territory. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Price Range Could Be The Bulls’ Final Defense Line, Report Says Volume profiles indicate subdued participation during recent corrective phases, alongside a neutral Stochastic RSI reading that suggests momentum could shift decisively depending on which price threshold gives way first. Big Mike emphasizes two critical lines in the sand: “BTC above $95k will trigger the move quickly towards my target of $130-$140k. Below $78k and we test $72k, then run to $140k.” From his perspective, both a direct break above $95,000 and a deeper dip to $72,895 ultimately converge on the same upside target near $130,000–$140,000. At press time, BTC traded at $90,053.

While XRP has had its ups and downs, new and exciting projects are emerging, offering unique value propositions that could drive substantial growth. For those who missed the boat on XRP or are looking to diversify their portfolios, there are several promising cryptocurrencies with strong growth potential. These tokens bring innovative technologies, real-world use cases, and vibrant communities to the table, making them top contenders in the ever-expanding crypto space. In this article, we’ll explore the top 5 best cryptocurrencies to buy now, each with its own unique features and the potential to generate significant returns in the coming years. How Ripple (XRP) Fared and Why You Should Consider Other Cryptocurrencies Ripple (XRP) has experienced significant ups and downs since its inception, with legal battles and regulatory challenges weighing heavily on its performance. Despite its initial success and widespread adoption by financial institutions, XRP has faced roadblocks, especially with the ongoing SEC lawsuit, which has hindered its growth and limited its market potential. While XRP was once considered a top contender in the crypto space, these challenges have led many investors to reconsider their positions. As a result, diversifying into other cryptocurrencies with more promising long-term prospects has become increasingly attractive. There are now numerous alternative projects that offer unique use cases, solid roadmaps, and innovative technologies, making them worthy contenders for investment. In this article, we explore five such cryptocurrencies that could help you recover missed opportunities and potentially deliver greater returns. 5 Currencies to Look out for Besides Ripple (XRP) As Ripple (XRP) faces regulatory challenges, investors are increasingly looking to diversify their portfolios with other promising cryptocurrencies that offer unique features and growth potential. One such option is Lightchain AI (LCAI) , which blends artificial intelligence with blockchain, creating a decentralized platform for AI-powered applications. Cardano (ADA) is another strong contender, offering a scalable and sustainable proof-of-stake network that continues to attract developers and investors. Solana (SOL) stands out for its high-speed, low-cost blockchain, ideal for decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi projects. Polkadot (DOT) provides interoperability between blockchains, positioning it as a key player in the multi-chain future of crypto. Lastly, Chainlink (LINK) remains a valuable asset due to its decentralized oracle network, which bridges the gap between smart contracts and real-world data. These cryptocurrencies offer diverse opportunities for growth beyond Ripple, making them worth considering in 2025. Which One Should You Buy If You Still Want Ripple (XRP)? If you're still interested in investing in a cryptocurrency with strong potential in the cross-border payments space like Ripple (XRP), Lightchain AI (LCAI) is a great alternative to consider.

Armstrong made the statement following the White House Crypto Summit, where he and other industry leaders met with government officials to discuss crypto regulation policies. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong Announces 1,000 New U.S. Jobs After attending the White House Crypto Summit, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong took to X (formerly Twitter) to reveal the company’s hiring plans. He stated that the regulatory landscape in the U.S. is improving, allowing the company to expand its workforce. Armstrong credited the shift to President Trump’s leadership and the administration’s efforts to establish clear guidelines for crypto regulation. He emphasized that this new clarity is enabling businesses like Coinbase to strengthen their presence in the U.S. market. Coinbase CEO added, “Historic day at the Whitehouse Digital Asset Summit. Thanks to Trump’s leadership, along with David Sacks, the U.S. now has a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and emerging regulatory clarity. This is directly translating to economic growth in the U.S. For instance, Coinbase plans to hire about 1,000 employees in the U.S. this year as a result of this renewed growth. During the White House crypto summit , Donald Trump announced plans to end Operation Chokepoint 2.0, signaling a shift toward a more supportive regulatory environment. Additionally, Trump emphasized the urgency of stablecoin legislation, aiming to establish clear regulatory guidelines before Congress adjourns for summer. Regulatory Clarity Boosts Crypto Industry Growth The White House Crypto Summit brought together government officials, industry leaders, and regulatory bodies to discuss the future of digital assets. The event marked a shift in the U.S. government’s stance toward the crypto industry, with an emphasis on fostering innovation. One of the major developments discussed was the U.S. government’s decision to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . Armstrong expressed his support for the initiative, stating that the U.S. government holding Bitcoin signals its recognition as a key financial asset. A major factor influencing Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong’s hiring announcement was the US SEC decision to drop its enforcement action against the company. With the case no longer proceeding, crypto businesses now look to Congress for regulatory clarity. Armstrong stated that this development allows Coinbase to focus on business expansion rather than ongoing legal battles. Donald Trump Administration’s Crypto Policy Donald Trump administration has positioned itself as an advocate for the crypto industry, with officials expressing their commitment to making the U.S. a leader in digital assets. Bo Hines, the executive director of the President’s Working Group on Digital Assets, reaffirmed the administration’s goal of establishing the U.S. as the global center for crypto innovation. Hines stated that government agencies, including the Treasury and Commerce departments, are exploring ways to invest in Bitcoin without increasing the financial burden on taxpayers. Industry leaders, including Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, welcomed these policy changes. Meanwhile, VanEck has shared budget-neutral strategies in which the U.S. government could expand its Bitcoin Reserve without taxpayer funding.

Regulatory Clarity- Recent developments suggest a more favorable regulatory environment for XRP, potentially enhancing its adoption and stability. Market Performance- Analysts predict that XRP could reach $5 to $7 in the first half of 2025, driven by Ripple's advancements and increased adoption.

41305139,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=689129,1741394971,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41305139.jpeg,"David Sacks says Trump’s mention of XRP, SOL, and ADA is being overanalyzed",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/sacks-says-xrp-mentions-being-overanalyzed/,"As speculation surrounding President Donald Trump’s recent statement about creating a U.S. cryptocurrency strategic reserve has reached a fever pitch, White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks spoke out. Sacks attempted to reduce expectation and overinterpretation by noting that mentioning these particular altcoins did not mean any government-endorsed option or preference. Many cryptocurrency executives criticized the specific digital assets included in the report as too far-flung from crypto standards of development, institutional adoption, and decentralization seen in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Some analysts suggested that their addition was a sign the government had changed its approach and was preparing to back other blockchain networks. However, Sacks shot down those theories in an interview on Friday. “The president just listed the top five cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, so I think this is one of those moments where people are reading too much into this,” Sacks said. “There’s no secret motive behind it — he just mentioned the biggest names.” The market’s response to Trump’s comment was nonetheless stark. The name drop of XRP, SOL, and ADA resulted in explosive price movements, with some of these assets ripping up close to 70% over the weekend before pulling back. Such price volatility highlighted the outsized impact political statements and policy signals can have on digital asset markets. Federal government can’t account for all its crypto holdings Sacks said a complete audit was still needed to establish the government’s crypto holdings. He had no doubts that the U.S. government owned Bitcoin and thought there was some Ethereum. However, he noted that there was no clear answer to whether it also held other altcoins such as XRP, Solana, or Cardano. Source: Bloomberg That uncertainty is part of what Thursday night’s executive order required: a full tally of all the digital assets the U.S. government currently holds. The United States federal government has over 198,000 BTC holdings, and Bitcoin Treasuries estimate this to be worth around $17 billion at today’s prices. The order also establishes a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile to manage non-Bitcoin digital assets acquired through criminal and civil seizures. However, it explicitly states that the government will not actively purchase additional cryptocurrencies for this stockpile beyond those obtained through legal recoveries. Federal government is not interested in selling its crypto holdings The executive order sets forth a new way of dealing with these digital assets rather than simply playing accountants. While the federal government may opt to sell some of its holdings, Sacks suggested other strategies, such as lending or staking the cryptocurrencies it owns and earning additional returns, could be used. Sacks said the executive order was meant to establish guidelines for responsible asset management. He said that the first step would be a complete audit and that digital assets would be transferred to a more secure account. The Treasury Secretary and their expertise would then administer a diversified portfolio to long-term custodial oversight to maximize the benefit for Americans. He also said the strategy may be as simple as staking certain assets for passive rewards, portfolio rebalancing to lower risk while gaining a larger return, or selling when appropriate. He said the Treasury Department could consider such options if they served the country’s long-term financial interests. With these policy developments playing out, the crypto industry’s eyes are now fixed on a highly publicized summit in Washington, D.C., where President Trump hosts several top Bitcoin and cryptocurrency executives. The discussions are likely to focus on regulatory approaches, market growth, and how blockchain technology is evolving in the U.S. economy. In the meantime, the market conditions are still turbulent. XRP and ADA have lost around 7% in the last 24 hours following their brief rally last weekend (according to The Block’s crypto price data). Solana (SOL), on the other hand, remained relatively more robust, recording a slight decline of 1.3%. The two leading cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, have also suffered; Bitcoin has fallen 2%, while Ethereum has lost 2.7% during the same time frame. As the government’s crypto blueprint continues, traders, investors, and policymakers will watch how these assets are handled in the new U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile and whether other regulatory changes could affect the broader market.

Priced at just $0.006 during its presale, Lightchain AI has already raised $16.9 million, offering a unique combination of blockchain and artificial intelligence that promises scalable, decentralized solutions for real-world applications. While Ethereum continues to lead with its smart contracts and Cardano focuses on scalability and sustainability, Lightchain AI’s innovative approach positions it for explosive growth. As the presale progresses, Lightchain AI may very well become the best altcoin for long-term investors in 2025 and beyond. Comparing Long-Term Potential- Lightchain AI, Ethereum (ETH), and Cardano (ADA) In 2025, Lightchain AI, Ethereum (ETH), and Cardano (ADA) each present distinct long-term investment opportunities. Ethereum (ETH)- As a leading platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, Ethereum continues to drive innovation in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Analysts project ETH could reach $3,500 by the end of 2025, reflecting its established position and ongoing development. Cardano (ADA)- Known for its proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, Cardano emphasizes scalability, security, and sustainability. Price predictions for ADA in 2025 vary, with some forecasts suggesting a range between $0.69 and $2.22, indicating potential for significant growth. Lightchain AI (LCAI)- An emerging cryptocurrency integrating artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, Lightchain AI has garnered attention for its innovative approach. During its presale, LCAI raised over millions, indicating strong investor confidence. Some projections suggest that a $300 investment could potentially grow to $12,300, highlighting its rapid growth and the confidence investors have in its future prospects. While all three projects offer promising prospects, Lightchain AI's innovative integration of AI and blockchain positions it as a potentially high-return investment. However, it's essential to approach such investments with caution, conducting thorough research and considering the inherent risks associated with the cryptocurrency market. Why Lightchain AI Could Be Best Long-Term Hold for Next 4 Years Lightchain AI could be the best long-term hold for the next 4 years due to its unique integration of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. The platform’s scalability is enhanced by Layer 2 solutions and DAG structures, allowing it to handle high transaction volumes without compromising performance. Lightchain AI also focuses on gas optimization, ensuring cost-efficiency and sustainability for users.

Buy LCAI Tokens Now for Long-Term Growth Potential Investing in LCAI tokens now can offer significant long-term growth potential as the platform continues to develop and establish itself in the cryptocurrency market. With a limited supply of 10 billion tokens, scarcity may contribute to price appreciation over time. As Lightchain AI expands its real-world use cases and partnerships, demand for its token could increase, driving up its value. Invest right now and hold onto your LCAI tokens for the next 4 years to potentially see significant returns on your investment. However, as with any investment, it's crucial to conduct due diligence and only invest what you can afford to lose.

The Solana ( SOL ) rival is witnessing price gains amid a new collaboration with World Liberty Financial (WLFI). Says World Liberty Financial co-founder Zak Folkman in a statement , “We chose Sui for its American-born innovation combined with impressive scale and adoption. It is a natural complement to our mission of bringing decentralized finance to more Americans. Given our plans to support foundational DeFi assets in the coming months, collaborating with Sui was an obvious decision.” World Liberty Financial’s website states that Trump is not an officer, director, founder or employee of the firm or any of its affiliates but lists the president as its chief crypto advocate. The website also notes that DT Marks DEFI LLC, a company affiliated with Trump and some of his family members, holds 22.5 billion WLFI tokens and is entitled to receive fees from the project. SUI is currently trading for $2.76, up by 5.18% over the past 24 hours. Leading altcoins hover in the red zone. The smart contract platform Ethereum ( ETH ) is down by 0.58%, while Solana and Cardano ( ADA ) plunged by 1% and 7.41%, respectively.

The suit claims the closures were driven by political bias, targeting the Trump family’s conservative affiliations back in 2021. “Plaintiffs have reason to believe that Capital One’s unilateral decision came about as a result of political and social motivations and Capital One’s unsubstantiated, “woke” beliefs that it needed to distance itself from President Trump and his conservative political views. In essence, Capital One “de-banked” Plaintiffs’ Accounts because Capital One believed that the political tide at the moment favored doing so. In addition to the considerable financial harm that Plaintiffs and their affiliated entities suffered, Capital One’s reckless decision is part of a growing trend by financial institutions in the United States of America to cut off a consumer’s access to banking services if their political views contradict with those of the financial institution. Capital One’s conduct is but one example of a systemic, subversive industry practice that aims to coerce the public to shift and re-align their political views.” The move comes after Trump openly slammed both Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase. At a World Economic Forum session in January, Trump publicly criticized Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. He accused them of denying services to conservatives, urging them to “open your banks” to those who have allegedly been unfairly kicked out of the banking system. Trump’s remarks touch on a broader debate over alleged discrimination in the financial sector. This month, after meeting with Republican lawmakers, Chase’s Dimon said US banks sometimes “push people out of the system” due to vague federal anti-money laundering rules. Dimon denied political or religious bias at Chase, instead blaming regulatory pressures that force compliance-driven account closures.

While Ethereum and Solana remain dominant players in DeFi, smart contracts, and blockchain adoption, a new contender is rapidly gaining traction— Lightchain AI (LCAI). With $17.1 million raised in presale, Lightchain AI has already demonstrated strong investor confidence, and traders believe it could 20x or more as the broader crypto market continues to rally. But how realistic is a 20x surge for Lightchain AI , and how does it compare to Ethereum and Solana’s growth potential? Let’s break it down. Ethereum (ETH) Eyes $7,000 – A Bull Market on the Horizon? Ethereum (ETH) is making waves, currently trading around $2,228.85, with analysts spotting exciting signs of a potential surge to $7,000. Crypto expert Ali Martinez highlights a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, suggesting that if ETH closes above $4,100, it could kickstart a rally toward $7,000. But that’s not all—Ethereum’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio adds to the momentum. Breaking past the 3.2 MVRV band, now hovering near $7,000, could confirm a major move upward. What does the future hold? Projections vary: some predict ETH will hit $6,000–$7,000 by late 2025, while others take a more cautious stance. One thing’s for sure—reaching $7,000 could mark the beginning of a broader bull market, signaling growing adoption and surging investor confidence in Ethereum’s ecosystem. Buckle up, ETH investors—big things may be on the horizon! Solana’s (SOL) Road to $650 - High-Speed Transactions Fuel Growth Solana (SOL) is currently trading at approximately $147.32, with analysts identifying bullish trends that suggest a potential rise to $650. According to Binance analysts, breaking key resistance levels around $500 could open the path toward this target. Known for its high-speed transaction capabilities—processing up to 65,000 transactions per second with low fees—Solana has become a leading choice for decentralized applications and financial services. This efficiency has spurred significant developer interest, further driving growth in its ecosystem. However, reaching the $650 milestone will depend on broader market conditions, technological progress, and continued adoption. While Solana’s transaction speed positions it as a strong contender in the blockchain space, prospective investors are encouraged to conduct thorough research and account for market volatility when making decisions. As Ethereum and Solana continue to gain traction, traders are exploring high-growth opportunities in this expanding market, with Lightchain AI emerging as a standout option. Why Traders Believe Lightchain AI (LCAI) Could 20x in 2025 Ethereum and Solana may have laid the groundwork for blockchain infrastructure, but Lightchain AI (LCAI) is taking things to the next level by seamlessly blending AI with blockchain technology. What really sets LCAI apart ? Its innovative dynamic gas fee system. Instead of one-size-fits-all pricing, fees adjust based on the complexity of AI tasks. The result? A cost-effective, user-friendly platform that's driving rapid adoption and shaking up the decentralized AI landscape. But that’s just the beginning. Lightchain AI has an ambitious roadmap, from prototype development to global expansion. Its cutting-edge parallelized architecture allows multiple AI tasks to run at once, slashing delays and supercharging performance. With these bold innovations, Lightchain AI isn’t just keeping up—it’s leading the charge in the future of decentralized AI. Buckle up, because the next generation of blockchain technology is here.

While Trump’s proposal to include XRP in a U.S. strategic crypto reserve initially ignited a price rally, macroeconomic headwinds and skepticism from key financial institutions have cut gains in half XRP Bulls Struggle to Hold Gains Amid Conflicting Catalysts XRP price grazed the $3 mark on Monday as rallying 40% after Trump included XRP in the Crypto strategic reserver assets last weekend. However, traders digested multiple market-moving developments this week, those gains have been halved. Trump’s push to establish a cryptocurrency strategic reserve, with XRP included alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano generated strong initial momentum at the start of the week. Further optimism came from the easing of tariffs imposed on Mexico and Canada, boosting broader market sentiment. XRP Price Action However, XRP bulls faced resistance as macroeconomic uncertainties dampened risk appetite. The latest U.S. Non-Farm Payroll ( NFP ) report revealed rising unemployment, fueling concerns about persistent inflation and a potentially more hawkish Federal Reserve. As a result, profit-taking emerged near the $3 mark, halting the upside breakout and forcing consolidation around $2.40. The rejection at $3 suggests traders remain wary of overextending bullish positions amid policy uncertainty. Liquidity remains a key factor, with leveraged long positions likely facing liquidations if XRP fails to hold critical support levels. JPMorgan Director Casts Doubt on Strategic Crypto Reserve Approval for Ripple At press time on March 8, Ripple price was trading at $2.40, with a market capitalization of approximately $140 billion. Bull traders anticipate that a break above $3 could push XRP’s market cap toward $200 billion, especially if U.S. Treasury actions align with Trump’s strategic reserve proposal. Ripple (XRP) Market Data, | Source: CoingeckoRipple (XRP) Market Data, | Source: Coingecko However, JPMorgan’s latest report has thrown cold water on Ripple’s ambitious valuation target, highlighting significant hurdles in gaining congressional approval for a U.S. strategic crypto reserve. According to Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, managing director of global market strategy at JPMorgan, the probability of such a reserve materializing remains below 50%. “We don’t believe an approval of a U.S. strategic crypto reserve is the most likely scenario (assuming congressional approval would be needed). So the chance is less than 50% in our mind. And if a U.S. strategic crypto reserve is eventually approved, it would be difficult to include smaller tokens outside Bitcoin and Ethereum, as the inclusion of such tokens would raise more concerns about risk and volatility” – Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, Maanaging director of global market strategy at JPMorgan The report further noted that similar state-level Bitcoin reserve proposals have recently failed in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming due to concerns over volatility and regulatory hurdles. Skepticsm around approval of Trump’s crypto strategic reserve plan added to the bearish sentiment keeping XRP price below the $2.50 mark on the daily candle. As traders await further clarity, XRP’s technical structure suggests a pivotal battle ahead. XRP Price Forecast: Bulls Eye $3, But Rejection Looms Amid Profit-Taking XRP price is showing early signs of bullish exhaustion after failing to hold above $2.60, suggesting a potential retest of lower support levels. The 12-hour chart highlights a clear rejection near $2.99, coinciding with the upper Donchian Channel boundary, signaling strong resistance. Despite the recent breakout, the inability to sustain momentum above this zone raises the likelihood of profit-taking, particularly with the latest 5.84% decline. XRP Price Forecast The MACD histogram, while still in positive territory, has begun fading, hinting at waning bullish momentum. The MACD line remains above the signal line, supporting a bullish case, but the narrowing gap suggests that if selling pressure persists, bears could regain control. Key support is forming near $2.47, aligned with the midline of the Donchian Channel. A decisive break below this level would expose $2.39, a critical pivot where bulls must step in to prevent a slide toward $1.95. Conversely, if XRP price holds above $2.47 and volume picks up, a renewed push toward $2.99 is likely, with $3.20 as the next bullish target. Leverage traders appear active, making sharp wicks and liquidity hunts a key risk in both directions.

Imagine snagging PEPE at a fraction of a cent and watching it skyrocket by over 1,900%, making millionaires overnight. The regret is real, but here’s the twist—you don’t have to miss out again. BTFD Coin (BTFD) is here, and its 3650% moonshot potential is already creating waves! While PEPE’s time has passed for insane early gains, BTFD Coin is the Best New Meme Coin to Join Today, offering what could be the last low-entry chance before it explodes. The Bulls Squad is rallying behind this project, and the presale is already 99% complete at just $0.00016 per coin. Once the presale ends, BTFD will list at $0.0006, meaning investors who get in now can lock in 275% gains instantly, with a projected moon price of $0.006. The question is, will you seize this golden opportunity—or regret it like PEPE all over again? BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Final Presale Dip Before a 3650% Surge BTFD Coin (BTFD) is more than just another meme coin—it’s a movement built on one of the most legendary investment strategies: Buy The Dip. And right now, the dip is here—but not for long. In just a few months, BTFD has sold over 71 billion tokens, raised over $6.27 million, and gained 11,200+ holders. The presale started at just $0.000004 per coin, and now, at $0.00016, it’s still dirt cheap compared to its expected launch price of $0.0006. But the real excitement? Analysts predict a moon price of $0.006, which means—yes, you read that right—a 3650% ROI potential. Let’s break it down. If you invest $2,500 at today’s price of $0.00016, you’ll get 15.6 million BTFD tokens. Once BTFD hits $0.0006 at launch, your investment would triple to $9,375. But if it reaches the $0.006 moon price, your $2,500 turns into $93,750. Now, imagine sitting on the sidelines, watching this play out, just like with PEPE. This is your shot. This is why so many investors believe BTFD Coin is the Best New Meme Coin to Join Today. Bulls Squad: The Core of BTFD’s Success At the heart of BTFD’s explosive growth is the Bulls Squad, a powerhouse community of diamond-handed investors who believe in the long game. These aren’t your average meme coin gamblers; they’re crypto warriors who turn dips into fortunes. And here’s where it gets even better—BTFD isn’t just hype; it’s utility-driven. Play-to-Earn (P2E) Game: Launched on January 1, 2025, it allows players to earn real BTFD tokens while gaming. 90% APY Staking: Holders can stake their tokens and earn massive passive income. Bulls Squad Rewards: The exclusive Bulls Squad initiative could generate a 3650% return, positioning BTFD as the best new meme coin to join today with real profit potential. If you’ve ever looked at Doge, Shiba, or PEPE and wished you got in early—this is your moment. How Investors Missed PEPE and Lost Their Chance at Millions When Pepe Coin (PEPE) first hit the market, almost nobody took it seriously. A silly frog meme? Sounds ridiculous, right? Well, tell that to the early believers who scooped up billions of PEPE tokens for pennies in its first few months. PEPE started at $0.00000005 in April 2023, and by December 2024, it surged past a market cap of $11 billion. Some early buyers turned a few hundred bucks into life-changing wealth. But most people? They hesitated. They ignored it. And they missed out. The same people who laughed at PEPE were now watching from the sidelines as whales raked in insane profits. Even in 2025, PEPE remains a major player, but the explosive early gains are gone. History is repeating itself with BTFD Coin, and this time, you have a second shot at massive returns—if you act fast. That’s why crypto analysts are calling BTFD the Best New Meme Coin to Join Today, as it mirrors PEPE’s early days but with even bigger potential. Why Presales Are the Smartest Crypto Play The crypto market is volatile, and if you’re sick of watching your portfolio take hits from bearish trends, presales are your best bet. They let you buy at the lowest possible price, avoid market fluctuations, and maximize your gains before public trading begins. BTFD Coin has already proven its strength by raising millions, building a thriving community, and securing major crypto partnerships. Once it hits exchanges, expect a FOMO-fueled buying spree—and prices will never be this low again. That’s why seasoned investors agree that BTFD is the Best New Meme Coin to Join Today. Final Call: Will You Seize the Opportunity or Watch from the Sidelines? PEPE was the missed chance of 2023-2024. BTFD is the Best New Meme Coin to Join Today and the biggest presale opportunity of 2025. With only 1% left in Stage 14, the window to buy at $0.00016 is closing fast. When the presale ends, the launch price of $0.0006 is locked in—and after that, the projected $0.006 moon price will separate the winners from the wish they had. The choice is simple. Either join now and secure your spot in the next crypto success story—or risk regretting it as you did with PEPE. Sign up before the BTFD Coin presale ends!

How much could I earn if BTFD hits $0.006? A $2,500 investment today could turn into $93,750 if BTFD reaches its projected moon price. Why is BTFD expected to moon?

The upcoming presale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is causing present-day enthusiasm while its ongoing funding campaign races towards reaching its projected $4 value within eight weeks. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has received $2.3 million from its 4,300 second presale investors at $0.015 which guarantees a 300% return when the cryptocurrency lists on exchanges at $0.06. Dogecoin Navigates Market Turbulence Amid Payment Integration Speculation The crypto market volatility causes Dogecoin to lose 14% of its value while its current trading price sits at $0.18. The speculation continues about Elon Musk potentially adding DOGE payments to X despite market fluctuations because of the recent offer from Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson to upgrade Dogecoin’s network. Through his technical proposal Hoskinson aimed to create payment features and AI applications which mirrored Musk’s initial support for using DOGE to buy Tesla products. Technical assessments of the market show a rounding bottom pattern which indicates a probable 266% price increase to $0.65 when support levels remain strong. The approximate rise in price value for this token remains uncertain because it depends on both market perception and partnership stability. Expert analysts agree recovery will be stable when sell-off activities slow down and payment plans advance physically as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) maintains substantial progress with its pre-sale launches. Ripple Faces Macroeconomic Headwinds Despite Bullish Forecasts Ripple (XRP) has experienced a 12% decline which brought prices down to $2.35 as political engagements with U.S. crypto reserves lost their market impact. The cryptocurrency analyst EGRAG CRYPTO predicts a steady price increase of XRP to reach $30 by May 2025 according to past performance indicators. For this forecast to materialize XRP needs to break through the channel pattern established in 2017 which will demand a 2,500% price increase. XRP faces negative short-term investment signals because of macroeconomic factors and new trade restrictions that show its ability to manage market volatility remains unclear. While regulatory clarity and institutional adoption remain tailwinds, Ripple’s path to triple-digit growth appears fraught with hurdles. Contrastingly, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) avoids such dependencies, leveraging its decentralized lending model to drive demand irrespective of macroeconomic shifts. Mutuum Finance Capitalizes on Presale Momentum and Tokenomics The DeFi platform MUTM stands out among DeFi solutions because it delivers practical use cases for users. Mutuum Finance gains investor interest by offering lending protocols and mtTokens that produce interest on deposits. MUTM tokens are currently available during their second presale stage at $0.015 while they will move to $0.02 in a subsequent pricing step following a predicted price boost of 33%. The project benefits from its buy-and-distribute features since revenue produced buybacks sustain market demand alongside staking rewards that encourage hodlers to maintain their assets. The future listing price of $0.06 for MUTM tokens can lead to a 4000% profits for early investors according to analysts who foresee that MUTM prices could potentially rise to $4. More than 4300 investors have participated in MUTM’s presale because they appreciate its open tokenomics and planned P2P lending capabilities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) achieves its growth through planned tokenomics structures and instant token presale gains rather than pursuing speculative achievement targets like XRP and DOGE. The sell-out pace of phase two accelerates while the project establishes increased investor confidence through its $2.3 million fundraise. The eight-week plan leading to $4 provides MUTM investors with an attractive window when they value actual returns instead of future speculations. The timeout for $0.015 token acquisition during presale is shrinking which produces faster FOMO through increased desire for lucrative returns. Secure MUTM tokens at $0.015 right now as the Mutuum Finance presale phase two will reach its conclusion soon. Take part in the presale on the official website to secure potential 300% profit when the platform launches.

After languishing below $85k for days, Bitcoin climbed past $90k last Monday and briefly flirted with the $95k level. However, crypto’s hot streak was brief, making Trump’s latest statement a “sell on news” event. From $94,770 on March 3, Bitcoin dipped to as low as $82,681 on March 4. Leading altcoins also slumped with BTC, creating a ripple effect across the broader crypto industry. Today, Bitcoin is trading wildly between $84k and $91k, more than 10k below its all-time high. Related Reading: Billionaire Warns Of Financial Turmoil—Will Bitcoin Save Investors? What’s Up With The Bitcoin Drop? Bitcoin gradually recovered from a low of $83,000 last week and bounced back to $92k days before the planned White House Crypto Summit this Friday, March 7th. Trump’s latest pronouncement did not specify how the reserve shall be funded beyond what was already included in the US’ crypto holdings. Instead of clarity, the statement was just a commitment to retain crypto holdings, with no specifics on funding. The president’s disclosure on a possible stockpile spurred conversations and debates among analysts and critics. Many crypto holders and supporters backed the possible inclusion of SOL, XRP, and ADA. Stock broker and financial commentator Peter Schiff shared his thoughts on the plan, saying the US government should limit the assets included in the pile. He specifically identified “seized assets”, so the government should not buy additional SOL, ADA, XRP, and ETH. Other Crypto Experts Remain Supportive Of Bitcoin As Bitcoin and other leading altcoins struggle, other crypto personalities publicly announce their support for the project. For example, Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich argued that even though BTC is retreating, there’s no denying the importance of Trump’s latest executive order. Gerovich stated that this new order authorizes the Secretaries of Commerce and Treasury to draft a strategy for buying Bitcoin without burdening American taxpayers. He stated that the order is more aggressive and provides a plan for acquiring more crypto without affecting the national budget. Possible Paths To Acquire BTC Discussed Gerovich further explains that there are two ways the US government can acquire Bitcoins and set up a strategic stockpile: One, Trump can exercise his presidential power by using the Exchange Stabilization Fund, which has $39 billion in assets. Two, the president can rely on Congressional approval. The second option is in line with Senator Lummis’ Bitcoin Bill, where the US government will acquire 200k Bitcoins annually for five years. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Won’t Stop At $150K’ This Year, Research Firm Chief Says Lummis was one of the first personalities to comment on the latest EO. The senator mentioned that the latest order was just the beginning, and encouraged Congress to pass the Bitcoin bill.

Wild. It’s clear that he’s gotten the message that bitcoin is something altogether different than all other digital assets. He’s proven this not only by what he said at today’s Crypto Summit, but also by signing an executive order (EO) last night that established a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) independently of a Digital Asset stockpile. The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Regarding the SBR, the President said today that the U.S. plans to hold onto the bitcoin it has in its possession, unlike previous administrations who have sold massive sums of it. “Unfortunately, in recent years, the U.S. government has foolishly sold tens of thousands of bitcoin (200,000, by some estimates ) that were worth billions and billions of dollars had they not sold them,” said President Trump. That said, the President also shared that members of his administration will pursue avenues to accumulate bitcoin — at no expense to the American public. “The Treasury and Commerce departments will explore new pathways to accumulate additional bitcoin holdings for the reserve, provided it’s done at no cost to the taxpayers,” he said. “We don’t want any cost to the taxpayers,” he reiterated, highlighting the notion that the U.S. government plans to amass bitcoin in a “budget-neutral” (to borrow language from last night’s EO) manner. Attendees Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick were present at the summit alongside approximately 30 prominent members of the Bitcoin and crypto industry, including Strategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, and BTC Inc. CEO David Bailey. President Trump with nearly three dozen notable members of the Bitcoin and crypto industry. Photo credit: Frank Corva Other members of the Trump administration, including head of Small Business Administration Kelly Loeffler and White House Crypto Czar David Sacks, were also in attendance. Both Sacks and Loeffler praised the pace at which Trump is making progress with Bitcoin and crypto executive orders and legislation. “Your administration is moving at tech [startup] speed,” said Sacks. “It’s actually faster than any startup that I’ve been part of,” added the venture capitalist, well-known for investing in many tech startups over the course of his career. Secretary Lutnick vouched for President Trump’s newfound Bitcoin and crypto knowledge, adding that the President has truly come to embrace the technology. “Blockchain and Bitcoin technology are a key part of [the President’s] thinking,” said Lutnick. “We’re using blockchain. We’re using Bitcoin. We’re going to use digital assets to [push] forward, and Donald Trump is leading the way,” he added. Stablecoins As Money, Bitcoin As Store Of Value Now, before you go and get too excited about Secretary Lutnick talking about “using” bitcoin, please know that with all the bullish bitcoin talk at the event, not a word of bitcoin being used as money was uttered. Instead, it was solely referred to as a savings technology. As far as digital assets that the administration views as money, stablecoins stand alone. And Secretary Bessent reinforced this message, most recently pushed at both the first U.S. Press Conference on Digital Assets and the first Subcommittee on Digital Assets hearing , at the summit. “We are going to put a lot of thought into the stablecoin regime,” said Secretary Bessent. “And as President Trump has directed, we are going to keep the U.S. [dollar] the dominant reserve currency in the world, and we will use stablecoins to do that.” (And before you go cursing Secretary Bessent under your breath as you read this, please note that he also dropped an absolutely banger of a pro-bitcoin one-liner at the event: “President Trump is creating assets for the American people while most past presidents have created debt.”) What Wasn’t Discussed What is more, on a summit preview call with senior White House officials this morning, one of the officials dispelled the rumor that the administration would remove the capital gains tax from crypto sales (which is also applicable when you spend bitcoin or crypto), clearly stating that the administration has no plans to do this and that the topic wouldn’t even be broached at the summit. (It wasn’t.) Something else that wasn’t discussed at the summit was whether or not the U.S. Marshalls have provided the Trump administration with a proper audit of the bitcoin and other digital assets in their custody (last it was reported, they apparently have little idea of what they’re holding ). Also unmentioned was how the government plans to secure the private keys to the bitcoin it keeps in the SBR. (I planned to inquire about the latter, but the members of the press present at the event weren’t permitted to ask questions.) But let’s not get lost in some of the currently minor details here. It Was A Good Day Instead, let’s take a queue from Brian Armstrong, and acknowledge that today was, by many standards, a good day. “It was a pretty historic moment for the crypto industry,” Armstrong told Bitcoin Magazine after the summit had concluded. “President Trump really breathed life back into this industry. A few years ago, it felt like we were under attack, and some folks tried to unlawfully kill the whole industry. What a sea change to be invited into the White House and to have the most pro-crypto president ever,” he added. Armstrong also noted that, next, he wants to see legislation passed to help make concrete some of the positive Bitcoin and crypto initiatives set in motion under the Trump administration. “Congress is making really good progress on this with stablecoin and market structure legislation, and hopefully codifying this Strategic Bitcoin Reserve eventually, as well.” This post White House Draws Line Between Bitcoin And Digital Assets At Its First Crypto Summit, In EO first appeared on Bitcoin Magazine and is written by Frank Corva .",NEWS|FEATURED|Bitcoin Policy|crypto|News|Strategic Bitcoin Reserve|White House,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|FIAT|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Bitcoin Magazine', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinmagazine.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinmagazine,2025-03-08 02:38:56

That’s how much wealth the U.S. could generate over the next decade if it fully embraces Bitcoin, according to the billionaire chairman of Strategy. Self-proclaimed “crypto president” Donald Trump, was listening, along with government officials, industry leaders, and financial executives who were all in attendance to talk about the future of Bitcoin in America. Saylor’s 34-page document, shared directly with Trump and attendees, laid out an entire strategy to restructure the U.S. financial system with crypto at its core. Source: @Saylor on X The main focus here is to make sure Trump’s proposed Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) can erase the national debt, dominate cyberspace, and turn the U.S. into the ultimate financial powerhouse. Saylor told Trump that if the U.S. started buying Bitcoin right now, it could generate $16-81 trillion in wealth for the Treasury by 2045. Within that same timeframe, the SBR could be bringing in over $10 trillion per year—all without selling a single Bitcoin. America could control 25% of all Bitcoins, says Saylor Saylor told Trump that the U.S. must immediately start accumulating Bitcoin through a consistent, programmatic daily purchase strategy. The goal? Control 5-25% of the total Bitcoin supply before 2035, when 99% of all Bitcoin will have been mined. Once locked in, Bitcoin’s fixed supply and long-term price appreciation would turn the reserve into a perpetual wealth engine. “The race to dominate cyberspace has already started,” Saylor warned in his report. “If we don’t lead, someone else will.” His argument was clear: If the U.S. wants to remain a global financial superpower, it must own Bitcoin in massive quantities. ""Welcome to the first-ever White House Digital Asset Summit. Last year, I promised to make America the Bitcoin superpower of the world, AND WE'RE TAKING HISTORIC ACTION TO DELIVER ON THAT PROMISE."" –President Donald J. Trump 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/nqUrHQ1xLl — President Donald J. Trump (@POTUS) March 8, 2025 China, he noted, has already moved aggressively into digital finance. If the U.S. doesn’t act now, it risks losing its economic edge forever. Saylor also made it clear that the U.S. government should never sell its Bitcoin holdings. The plan is simple: Buy. Hold. Repeat. As the supply of new Bitcoin dries up over time, demand will skyrocket, prices will climb, and the U.S. Treasury will be sitting on a goldmine. Saylor suggests a new financial system for an American Bitcoin economy Saylor’s proposal also laid out an entire framework for rebuilding the U.S. financial system around crypto. His plan breaks the term “digital assets” into four categories, making it easier to integrate crypto with traditional markets: Digital Tokens – Corporate-backed assets used for fundraising and innovation. These would allow U.S. companies to raise trillions through tokenized securities, said Saylor. Digital Securities – Tokenized stocks, bonds, and ETFs that would trade on 24/7 global markets, eliminating intermediaries and cutting costs. Digital Currencies – U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins issued by American companies to maintain global financial control, said Saylor. Digital Commodities – Bitcoin, which designed for wealth preservation and long-term value storage. Saylor, who loves Bitcoin more than probably everyone else on the planet, referred to it as “an asset without an issuer, backed by Digital Power, for Capital Preservation & Appreciation.” If followed through, Saylor believes that his framework will add $60-100 trillion to the U.S. economy by the end of the decade. His breakdown is $10 trillion from tokens, $20 trillion from digital securities, $10 trillion from stablecoins, and $20 trillion from Bitcoin. “The dominant Digital Commodity, Bitcoin, will serve as a global standard for capital preservation and appreciation, attracting trillions in capital flows, with the U.S. as the primary beneficiary,” said Saylor in his document. Saylor also called for an immediate and permanent end to hostile policies that are crippling the crypto industry in the U.S. Among his polite demands are: Stop unfair taxation on Bitcoin mining and crypto transactions. Saylor argued that the government should encourage, not punish, mining operations. Force banks to accept crypto businesses. “Debanking crypto firms is a national security risk,” he stated in the document. Give U.S. companies the freedom to issue digital assets without endless regulatory roadblocks. Let digital assets move freely over the internet. The government should not interfere with crypto transactions, Saylor argued. “The government should support, not suppress, Bitcoin and crypto innovation,” Saylor wrote. “If the U.S. takes the lead, capital will flow into the country, jobs will be created, and our economy will thrive.” Trump, who has now fully embraced Bitcoin, was reportedly receptive to Saylor’s vision. His administration has already moved to deregulate parts of the crypto industry and encourage private sector innovation. Saylor’s message only reinforced what Trump has been saying for months: The U.S. must become the Bitcoin superpower of the world. Saylor’s proposal also stressed the geopolitical risks of ignoring Bitcoin. If the U.S. doesn’t take control, China, Russia, and other adversaries will. “This is a matter of national security,” his document warned. “Bitcoin is the most valuable asset in cyberspace. Whoever controls it, controls the future.” The meeting at the White House made one thing clear: The battle for crypto dominance is already underway. With Trump in office and Bitcoin at the center of U.S. financial strategy, the next decade could see a massive economic transformation. $60-100 trillion is at stake, and the only question now is: Will the U.S. move fast enough?

Lucie, the marketing lead for Shiba Inu, addressed concerns within the community, expressing optimism about the token’s long-term success. Never say never SHIB WILL SUCCEED — 𝐋𝐔𝐂𝐈𝐄 (@LucieSHIB) March 3, 2025 SHIB Faces Market Decline Like many cryptocurrencies, SHIB has experienced a significant price drop, reaching a multi-month low of $0.00001228. Although the token has slightly rebounded to $0.00001300, it remains down by 60% from its December 5 peak of $0.000033. The situation is even more pronounced compared to its all-time high of $0.00008845, reflecting an 85.65% decline. Current data indicates that a substantial portion of the token holders are at a loss. Approximately 85.23% of SHIB-holding blockchain addresses, collectively possessing 839.23 trillion tokens (valued at $10.66 billion), are currently in a negative position. Meanwhile, 12.42% of addresses, holding 122.34 trillion SHIB ($1.55 billion), remain in profit. Another 2.34% of holders, with 23.09 trillion tokens, are at breakeven levels. Lucie Reassures Investors Amid Volatility In response to concerns over the token’s performance, Lucie conveyed a message of reassurance to the community. She emphasized her strong belief in SHIB’s long-term potential, asserting that the token will succeed despite current market fluctuations. Lucie did not provide specific reasons for her optimism but has consistently expressed confidence in the ecosystem. She attributes SHIB’s potential future growth to several ongoing initiatives, including Shibarium, ShibaSwap, SHIB: The Metaverse, Shiba Inu games, and the Shib Marketplace. These projects are part of the team’s strategy to transition SHIB from a meme token to a utility-driven asset. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additionally, the team is actively promoting the idea of a Shiba Inu exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. If successful, this initiative could introduce the token to institutional investors, potentially increasing its market adoption. Potential for Recovery Despite recent declines, market analysis suggests that SHIB could end the month with notable gains. Historical data from CryptoRank shows that the asset has experienced an average growth rate of 31.7% in March over the years. In March 2022, SHIB recorded a slight 0.43% increase, while March 2023 saw a 9.65% decline. However, the token rebounded the following year with a substantial 145.2% surge. As of March 2025, SHIB has fallen by 8.56% in the first few days of the month. While past trends indicate potential for recovery, investors are reminded that historical performance does not guarantee future results. Given the volatility of cryptocurrency markets, caution is advised when considering investments in SHIB or similar assets. The Shiba Inu team remains committed to advancing its ecosystem, with ongoing efforts to drive adoption and increase the token’s long-term value. Additionally, they are looking forward to the possibility of being included in the U.S. strategic crypto reserve , which if successful would further enhance the asset’s credibility and global recognition.

Investors of BlockDAG and Solaxy are flocking in to receive 500 free SKYRN coins. It appears that investors can recognize its benefits. Skyren DAO integrates a rewards ecosystem based on staking with tokens that have real world utility. Instead of providing a single time airdrop, SkyrenDAO provides claimants with staking opportunities. They can also participate in governance voting and access premium airdrops. This has resulted in an overwhelming response from the holders of Solaxy and BlockDAG. Why BlockDAG and Solaxy Investors Are interested in SKYRN Solaxy and BlockDAG are known for their scalability and efficiency. Hence, they’re seen as high-value projects. BlockDAG improves the efficiency of the network and transaction throughput. It achieves this via DAG architecture, which allows the parallel processing of transactions. This removes bottlenecks and provides better blockchain performance. Solaxy, on the other hand, is a Layer-2 scaling solution. It is designed to improve congestion and network efficiency in the Solana ecosystem. Hence it automatically improves the transaction speeds and reduces the fees via off-chain processing. Due to this approach, Solaxy is an important tool for projects that require high speed interaction with the blockchain and that too, without congestion. Skyren DAO carries a vision to create a strong ecosystem driven by rewards. It believes that token holders should be able to make passive income via staking and should be able to influence governance decisions. Hence, it has decided to include BlockDAG and Solaxy investors in its Token Surge Event. How BlockDAG and Solaxy Investors Can Claim Their SKYRN Tokens Investors who participated in the BlockDAG or Solaxy presale can claim their 500 SKYRN tokens by following these steps: Go to Skyren.io official website and access the Token Surge Event page. Submit proof of presale participation in BlockDAG or Solaxy. Provide an EVM-compatible wallet address for token distribution. Receive SKYRN tokens instantly once verification is completed. Once claimed, SKYRN can be staked immediately to start earning passive rewards and gain access to exclusive airdrop pools reserved for active platform participants. SKYRN’s token focuses on Staking, Governance, and Airdrops Using the SKYRN token, users can access an ecosystem with structured rewards. The goal is to enable value creation for the long term. Users can stake SKYRN to earn dynamic yields. In these yields, the rate adjusts itself based on the staking volume and participation in the network. This is different from fixed APY models and is an approach the provides higher returns to heavy stakers while also stabilizng liquidity in the ecosystem. Another major benefit is participation in the governance. Holders of the SKYRN token will have a big say in how the platform is run. They can vote on staking rewards along with allocations of new airdrops. Their decisions will also affect major upgrades in the ecosystem. Such a system ensures that the project is run mainly by the community. Airdrop access rounds provide high value tokens to the holders, which is a major utility of SKYRN. It makes sure that users are receiving tokens only from verified and promising blockchain projects. Skyren’s Contributor Keys, a Polygon-based NFT system, further enhance these rewards by boosting staking multipliers, increasing governance influence, and granting VIP access to top-tier airdrops. Crypto League has analyzed Skyren DAO’s staking rewards, governance model, and airdrop system. It has highlighted ways in which the platform ensures long term growth and engagement for investors. Spin The Wheel: Extra Rewards for SKYRN Holders Skyren DAO’s Spin The Wheel feature offers a fun and rewarding way to increase SKYRN holdings. How It Works Every SKYRN purchase earns spin tickets . Spin the wheel for extra SKYRN tokens or staking bonuses . Larger purchases unlock more spins, increasing reward potential . Winners receive instant SKYRN rewards, credited to their wallets .

In its new interpretive letter, the OCC clarified that national banks and federal savings associations are allowed to offer crypto custody services, handle certain stablecoin activities, and operate nodes. “The OCC expects banks to have the same strong risk management controls in place to support novel bank activities as they do for traditional ones,” said Acting Comptroller of the Currency Rodney E. Hood. It remarked that this decision will ease the pressure on banks involved in crypto activities and ensures that these activities are treated consistently by the OCC, regardless of the technology used. On Friday, the OCC withdrew guidance issued during President Joe Biden’s administration, which had imposed extra requirements on banks wanting to engage in certain crypto activities. The previous letters told banks to brief their supervisors on crypto activities beforehand, explain how they would manage risks, and get approval before proceeding with crypto activities. The OCC also removed joint statements from U.S. regulators that had warned banks against engaging with crypto. A 2023 statement didn’t ban crypto business but cautioned that the sector is highly volatile and that any crypto-related activities by banks would face close scrutiny. The announcement came on the same day the White House held a crypto summit, just hours after President Donald Trump signed an executive order creating a strategic reserve for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,FIAT|REGULATION|BTC|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-08 03:28:11

Notably, the cryptocurrency had shown signs of strength earlier this week following a period of decline, but the recovery was short-lived. As of today, Bitcoin slipped below $90,000, marking a 1.8% decrease in the past 24 hours. According to CryptoQuant analyst Crazzyblockk, one key factor contributing to this downward movement appears to be increased selling pressure from large Bitcoin holders. Related Reading: Historic Bitcoin Buy Signal: DXY’s Collapse Signals A Bigger Bull Run Whales and Large Holders Drive Selling Pressure on Binance Crazzyblockk in his latest insight highlights how whales and other large investors on Binance are actively offloading BTC as prices rise. This trend suggests that experienced traders are taking advantage of market optimism to exit their positions, potentially limiting Bitcoin’s short-term upside potential. Whale to Binance Flow Hits 3-Month High at $7.3B Over Last 30 Days “This often happens alongside heavy changes in price and shows that large holders choose Binance as their exchange. Watching whale deposits is important, as their moves can drive the market.” – By @JA_Maartun pic.twitter.com/psD3zuDXf3 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) March 6, 2025 The trend also comes at a time when whale to Binance flow sees a consistent increase. Crazzyblockk’s analysis of on-chain data from Binance particularly indicates that large Bitcoin holders—categorized as fish, sharks, and whales—are selling into market rallies. The data reveals that the larger the holder, the more strategically they distribute their Bitcoin holdings. These entities account for an increasing share of daily sell-side activity on Binance, suggesting that they are actively shaping Bitcoin’s price movements. As Bitcoin’s price trends upward, whale activity on Binance has intensified, with more BTC flowing into the exchange. The report highlights that while retail investors—often referred to as shrimps—have remained relatively inactive, whales and sharks are capitalizing on rising prices to take profits. This consistent distribution from high-value holders has created sustained downward pressure, preventing Bitcoin from making a parabolic move higher. Bitcoin Market Outlook: Can Accumulation Offset Whale Selling? With large holders continuing to offload BTC, the risk remains that any further upside could trigger even more selling pressure, reinforcing resistance levels. This dynamic means that Bitcoin’s price movement could remain constrained unless new accumulation from long-term investors or institutional buyers offsets the selling trend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Signal: $900 Million In BTC Leaves Exchanges Crazzyblockk emphasizes that tracking Binance’s whale activity is crucial for understanding market direction. Since these large holders are not just participants but also price movers, their actions can provide insight into short-term market trends. If whale selling slows and new accumulation picks up, Bitcoin could find support and regain momentum. However, if the current trend continues, further downside pressure remains a possibility.

The company is working with Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, and while no final decision has been made, Bloomberg’s sources reportedly said the IPO could happen this year. The report comes merely hours after the White House crypto summit and two weeks after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officially closed its investigation into Gemini, a probe that had dragged on for 699 days and cost the company tens of millions in legal fees. Cameron confirmed the SEC’s decision in February, posting a photo of the agency’s letter on X. The letter, dated February 24, stated that SEC staff “do not recommend an enforcement action” against Gemini. The probe, which began nearly two years ago, had put a major cloud over Gemini, with the SEC even issuing a Wells Notice 277 days ago, signaling that legal action was on the table. The agency never explained what led to the decision to drop the case, but Gemini’s leadership didn’t hold back their frustration. “It’s wholly unacceptable for an agency like the SEC to bully, harass, and attack a lawful industry and then decide one day to simply say we’re good and walk away,” Cameron wrote. Trump administration’s crypto stance fuels IPO wave Cameron and Tyler were among 30 crypto executives and government officials who attended Donald Trump’s crypto Summit at the White House last night. The event signaled a massive policy shift from the previous administration, as Trump made it clear that his government would be crypto-friendly. On Thursday night, Trump announced that the U.S. would create a Bitcoin national reserve and stockpile other seized crypto assets. The government won’t be using taxpayer money to buy Bitcoin—it will simply hold onto assets that have been confiscated in legal cases. The decision received mixed reactions from the industry. Some investors saw it as a sign of legitimacy for Bitcoin, while others dismissed it as symbolic and unlikely to have real impact. “This is not the aggressive Bitcoin reserve some were pressing for,” Jaret Seiberg, a TD Cowen analyst, said in a note. “We view this as a compromise.” He added that the government is not actually buying crypto, just holding onto what it has seized. Analysts at Compass Point were even less impressed. “An executive order is not legislation, it is an exercise of executive authority, and it is not durable,” Edwin Groshans wrote. He pointed out that without Congress passing a law, Trump’s decision could be easily overturned by a future administration. “To be frank, we view its issuance to be a dud that will not provide support to the value of BTC or any other digital asset, primarily because there is no authorization to purchase BTC,” he added. SEC backs off, crypto companies push forward The SEC’s retreat from aggressive enforcement isn’t limited to Gemini. In recent days, the agency also dropped charges against Coinbase and ended its investigation into Uniswap, signaling a policy shift as Trump’s administration moves to deregulate the crypto industry. For Gemini, the end of the SEC probe clears the way for one of the biggest crypto IPOs to date. The company has more than 500 employees across offices in New York, Seattle, Singapore, London, and Dublin. It has positioned itself as a regulated, compliance-focused alternative to other crypto exchanges, which is why the SEC investigation was such a headache. Cameron and Tyler, who gained fame for their legal fight with Mark Zuckerberg over Facebook, have been strong supporters of Trump’s crypto policies. Both donated Bitcoin beyond the maximum campaign contribution limit and were refunded the excess amount. With the IPO now back on the table, the twins are betting that the crypto market’s recovery—and Trump’s support—will give investors confidence in Gemini’s long-term growth. Bitcoin’s price barely reacted to the executive order, holding steady at $88,000 after a brief dip. Other major cryptocurrencies, including Ether and Solana, inched higher, while XRP and Cardano-linked tokens fell slightly. Despite Trump’s crypto-friendly stance, traditional financial analysts remain skeptical. Noelle Acheson, economist and author of the “Crypto is Macro Now” newsletter, noted that macro conditions are still weighing on crypto markets. “There is nothing on the immediate horizon to suggest relief for the building concern about a slowdown,” she said. She added that investors are still hesitant, despite Trump’s pro-crypto policies. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

Stellar (XLM) is vibing hard lately, crushing a solid 9% price surge within just seven days, even outpacing XRP’s 7% weekly growth. Meanwhile, SEI is catching attention for a monster trading volume spike, hitting a jaw-dropping $6.5 billion in DEX trades—talk about flexing market muscles! These two projects are grabbing headlines and igniting chatter. But while everyone’s glued to Stellar and SEI’s recent moves, another game-changing crypto is quietly brewing beneath the surface— Qubetics ($TICS).

Why the Qubetics Presale Might Be One of the best crypto ICOs to invest Right Now There’s no sugar-coating it—the buzz around the Qubetics presale is intense. At Stage 24, the price sits attractively at just $0.0976 per $TICS, but the clock is ticking because every Sunday at midnight, prices jump by 10%. Already, the presale’s raised over $14.6 million, boasting more than 496 million tokens sold to over 22,400 holders. This isn’t random hype; this is hard evidence that participants see Qubetics as one of the best crypto ICOs to invest . Here’s why these numbers are causing a stir. Imagine a participant puts in just $100 right now—that lands them 1,024 $TICS. When presale wraps up, even if $TICS hits just $0.25, that’s an impressive 155.93% ROI. Now let’s dream bigger—at just $1 per token post-presale, that becomes a dazzling 923.72% ROI. And if this token blasts off to $5? That’s an insane 5,018.58% ROI on that same humble hundred. Numbers don’t lie, and neither do market trends. It’s crystal clear why many community members label Qubetics presale as the best crypto presale—it truly has everything to become one of the best crypto ICOs to invest. Stellar Outshines XRP with a Stellar 9% Weekly Gain Stellar (XLM) recently captured major market attention by posting an impressive 9% weekly price surge, clearly outpacing XRP, which managed only a modest 1.5% gain in the same period. This sudden spike didn’t just happen randomly—it’s tied closely to Stellar’s strategic moves and recent market optimism around its ecosystem developments. At the moment, XLM is trading steadily around $0.1355, reflecting a healthy 1.70% daily price increase, maintaining its positive momentum throughout the week. The crypto community is closely watching Stellar’s technical charts, which now display strong bullish signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 67.31, inching closer to overbought territory but signaling solid buyer strength. Additionally, Stellar’s 200-day moving average (MA) rests firmly below the current trading price, indicating potential for further gains ahead. Trading volume surged as well, indicating increased market confidence, with XLM trading volumes climbing sharply. The growing interest aligns closely with Stellar’s positive price action, marking it as a serious contender among cryptos attracting fresh attention and potential future gains. SEI Records Epic $6.5 Billion DEX Volume—Could a 3x Rally to $0.60 Be Next? SEI Network has suddenly jumped into the crypto spotlight by smashing records with a whopping $6.5 billion in decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume. Crypto traders and community members are all-in, as this record-breaking activity represents a major 41% surge, underscoring SEI’s potential to rally significantly. With analysts now speculating on whether SEI can ride this momentum to reach a potential 3x growth, aiming directly for the $0.60 price mark, excitement around SEI is at an all-time high. Currently hovering around $0.18, SEI has massive room for growth. Considering its significant activity on the decentralized exchange front, analysts believe it could realistically pull off a 233% rally soon. This scenario is especially compelling for traders seeking short-term profits as SEI rapidly gains popularity among decentralized trading enthusiasts. The real question buzzing across the crypto community right now is simple—can SEI sustain this momentum? With traders closely tracking the network’s trading performance and market enthusiasm building by the day, SEI could soon rewrite its own success story, positioning itself as a top token to watch closely. Which Next Big Crypto Could Actually Make You Bank? Stellar’s recent 9% weekly surge has put it firmly in the spotlight, signaling significant growth potential, while SEI’s jaw-dropping $6.5 billion DEX volume positions it perfectly for a massive breakout rally. Yet, the crypto chatter surrounding Qubetics and its groundbreaking tokenization marketplace can’t be ignored—especially when considering the mind-blowing potential returns.

Recently, the whale transaction tracker Whale Alert posted on X (formerly Twitter) that 150 million XRP tokens had been transferred from an unknown wallet. 150,000,000 #XRP (380,084,007 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown wallet https://t.co/vwogddWvFt — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) March 7, 2025 This substantial token transaction is sparking curiosity across the crypto space, raising questions about whether it is the first step toward a dramatic shift in XRP’s price or just another routine move with no impact. Current Price Momentum XRP is currently trading near $2.34 and has experienced a price drop of over 6% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume declined by 15%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. XRP Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, XRP’s recent price drop has brought it to a crucial support level of $2.30, creating a make-or-break situation. Source: Trading View Based on current market sentiment and historical patterns, if the asset manages to hold this level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 20% to reach $2.79 in the coming days. On the other hand, if the price continues to fall, breaches the support level, and closes a four-hour candle below $2.24, there is a strong possibility of a 15% decline, bringing the asset down to $1.90 in the future. At present, XRP is trading below the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe, indicating a downtrend. Most traders and investors use this indicator to make informed decisions. Traders’ Over-Leveraged Levels Besides the make-or-break situation, traders appear to hold a bearish sentiment, strongly betting on a lower price as they believe it won’t rise soon, according to on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Source: Coinglass Data from the XRP exchange liquidation map reveals that traders are over-leveraged at $2.241 on the lower side and $2.6 on the upper side. They have built $46 million worth of long positions and $106 million worth of short positions at these respective levels in the past 24 hours. When combining this on-chain metric with technical analysis, it appears that bears are dominating, and there is a high likelihood that the price will continue to move in a downward trajectory.",Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|MARKET|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-08 04:17:42
41312290,https://timestabloid.com/?p=59593,1741407527,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,10 Reasons SHIB ETF Should Be Listed By BlackRock and Grayscale,https://timestabloid.com/10-reasons-shib-etf-should-be-listed-by-blackrock-and-grayscale/,"A growing movement within the Shiba Inu community advocates for major asset managers, including BlackRock and Grayscale, to introduce an exchange-traded fund (ETF) for SHIB in the U.S. A Shiba Inu-based news channel recently outlined ten key reasons why such an ETF would be a valuable addition to the crypto investment landscape. Increasing Market Demand One of the primary arguments in favor of a SHIB ETF is the strong market demand. Shiba Inu has built a vast and dedicated community, and an ETF could tap into this existing user base, driving significant interest and adoption among retail and institutional investors. Shibarium’s Expanding Ecosystem The launch of Shibarium has strengthened the token’s ecosystem. Since going live in August 2023 , the Layer 2 blockchain has facilitated various applications, including decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain gaming. This growing infrastructure enhances the token’s long-term viability, making it a compelling asset for an ETF. Appeal to Retail Investors Affordability is another key factor for a SHIB ETF. The relatively low cost of the tokens makes them accessible to a broad range of investors, particularly those new to cryptocurrency. If BlackRock or Grayscale were to launch an ETF, it could attract significant retail interest, expanding the reach of crypto-based investment products. Strong Liquidity and Trading Volume The digital asset maintains a high level of liquidity, with billions of dollars in daily trading volume. This liquidity is essential for an ETF, as it ensures smooth market operations and reduces risks related to price manipulation or limited availability. These characteristics make the token a suitable candidate for an ETF offering. Potential for a Diversified Crypto ETF Another advantage would be the ability to bundle multiple assets within the ecosystem. A diversified fund incorporating SHIB alongside ecosystem tokens such as BONE could provide investors with broader exposure to the Shiba Inu network while mitigating risks associated with single-token investments. Alignment with ESG Principles Their commitment to social responsibility aligns with Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investment standards. Through initiatives like the Karma Foundation, the ecosystem has demonstrated a focus on community-driven efforts and sustainability. An ETF incorporating SHIB could attract investors seeking assets that align with socially responsible investment strategies. Global Adoption and Use Cases The token has achieved international adoption, particularly in sectors such as gaming and digital payments. The token’s expanding use cases contribute to its legitimacy as an investment asset and position it well for inclusion in an ETF designed for a global audience. Precedent Set by Existing Crypto ETFs The success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs highlights a growing demand for regulated crypto investment vehicles. These ETFs have attracted substantial capital inflows, demonstrating investor interest in crypto-based funds. A SHIB ETF could follow a similar trajectory, providing an alternative for investors looking to diversify their crypto holdings. Establishing BlackRock and Grayscale as Industry Leaders If BlackRock or Grayscale were to introduce a SHIB ETF, it would reinforce their status as innovators in the digital asset space. Expanding their ETF offerings to include this asset would signal a forward-thinking approach, further strengthening their leadership in the cryptocurrency investment sector. Long-Term Growth Potential The ecosystem’s continuous development and expanding utility suggest strong long-term growth prospects. With its active community, and increasing adoption, the asset presents a viable investment opportunity. An ETF could provide structured exposure to the asset, benefiting both issuers and investors. Despite growing interest, no major asset manager has formally applied for a Shiba Inu ETF in the U.S. However, the community remains optimistic that financial institutions will recognize the potential benefits of the ETF and take steps toward its development. If launched, such a product could boost the asset’s legitimacy while offering investors a regulated way to gain exposure to the asset.

Trump opened the summit with the following remarks: Unfortunately, in recent years, the U.S. Government sold tens of thousands of additional Bitcoin that would have been worth billions of dollars … Never sell your Bitcoin. That’s a phrase they have, I don’t know whether it’s wrong or right. Donald Trump Trump says they will not sell any Bitcoin while promising to eliminate restrictive policies in the industry Joined by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks, Trump addressed more than twenty crypto executives and federal agency reps at the summit, reaffirming his commitment to the crypto industry. During the summit, he stated that he would work to eliminate restrictive crypto policies and hoped lawmakers would submit crypto regulation proposals to his desk before the August recess. Furthermore, he heavily criticized Biden’s administration for imposing stifling crypto policies, arguing that people really suffered under those policies. He also called out the previous administration for softening their stance on the crypto industry only when the election season approached. On Thursday, Trump signed an executive order to establish a BTC reserve and separate digital asset stockpile for the other cryptocurrencies, with the government’s crypto holdings acquired from criminal and civil litigation. From his words at the summit, it seems that none of the government’s Bitcoin, estimated at 200000 BTC, will be sold off, stating that the government will never sell their Bitcoin. However, he said that the Treasury could sell the other assets in the Digital Asset stockpile. He also said that the treasury is still working on more budget-neutral strategies to obtain Bitcoin. Moreover, he likened the crypto race to that of AI, insisting that it’s vital the US takes a lead in the industry just as it has in the AI sector. Trump also claimed that he wanted the US to become the “Bitcoin superpower” of the world. However, contrary to analyst expectations, the president did not address removing taxes on crypto assets at the summit. David Sacks wants the American public to do thorough research before they invest in any crypto assets Sacks told reporters on Friday that Bitcoin is special, seemingly supporting Trump’s decision not to sell the token. He further justified the launch of Trump and his family’s memecoin projects, saying the president’s personal crypto projects are “irrelevant” to the government’s crypto work. Additionally, he stated that the current administration is prioritizing making the country the world capital of crypto, establishing fair and clear regulations, and protecting investors. However, he refrained from trying to persuade Americans to purchase crypto, saying they should research what assets they want to invest in since it is a very volatile industry. He added that the crypto industry is not for everyone. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

The company could go public as soon as this year. The firm, founded by billionaires Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, is partnering with Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, although no final decision has been made on the IPO, the report said. IPO Follows SEC Dropping Investigation Notably, the potential IPO follows the SEC dropping its investigation into Gemini without taking action and the company settling a $5 million lawsuit with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The investigation, which was launched nearly two years ago, primarily focused on allegations that Gemini’s “Earn” program was offering unregistered securities. This program allowed users to lend their crypto assets in exchange for interest, which raised concerns with regulators about whether these activities violated securities laws. Cameron Winkelvoss noted in his X post that the SEC’s retreat “does little to make up for the damage this agency has done to us, our industry, and America.” The SEC ended its probe into Gemini, following similar actions against Uniswap, Robinhood, and OpenSea, and paused litigation against the Tron Foundation and Justin Sun, similar to recent motions in cases against Coinbase and Binance. Crypto IPO’s On The Rise Gemini is one of several crypto firms planning to go public in the U.S. after the SEC scaled back its litigation efforts in the early months of the Trump administration. Besides, in another development, Kraken is also eyeing an IPO by Q1 2026, with other companies like Circle, Bullish, and Blockchain.com also planning U.S. listings. The Winklevoss twins are well-known for their early Bitcoin investment and for leading Gemini, a regulated and secure crypto exchange. They are also strong advocates for establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss were among 30 top crypto leaders at the White House’s Digital Assets Summit on Friday. With President Trump’s administration embracing crypto, the door has swung wide open for IPOs in the industry. In a bold move, Trump also announced plans on Thursday to create a Bitcoin national reserve and stockpile other tokens seized during legal proceedings.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|BTC|FIAT|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-08 04:31:40

As blockchain networks like Ethereum ( ETH ) continue to see exponential growth, layer-two solutions are emerging as a vital component in addressing issues of network congestion and high transaction fees. In this post, we’ll dive into the latest developments in layer-two technology, its impact on blockchain scalability and how it’s paving the way for a more efficient and sustainable future for DeFi (decentralized finance) and beyond. Understanding layer-two solutions Blockchain networks like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum have often been criticized for their limited transaction throughput and scalability. Layer-two solutions aim to solve this problem by providing a secondary framework that operates on top of the main blockchain (layer one), allowing for faster, cheaper and more scalable transactions. There are different types of layer-two solutions, including the following. State channels – These allow two parties to transact off-chain and only settle the final state on the blockchain, reducing congestion. Rollups – Rollups bundle multiple transactions into one, significantly improving transaction speed and lowering fees. Plasma and optimistic rollups – Plasma offers a framework for building scalable applications, while optimistic rollups enable faster execution by assuming transactions are valid until proven otherwise. Layer-two in action – Ethereum’s road to scalability Ethereum – one of the most popular blockchain networks – has been at the forefront of layer-two innovation. The Ethereum network has struggled with high gas fees and slow transaction times due to its PoW (proof-of-work) consensus mechanism. However, Ethereum 2.0 and the integration of layer-two solutions, such as Optimism ( OP ) and Arbitrum ( ARB ), have shown tremendous promise in scaling Ethereum without compromising security. These layer-two solutions are helping to reduce Ethereum’s gas fees by processing transactions off-chain and only committing essential data to the Ethereum mainnet, making Ethereum more accessible to users across the globe. In fact, as Ethereum embraces a hybrid model of layer-one and layer-two, it’s enabling DApps (decentralized applications) to run more efficiently and cost-effectively. Recent updates – Layer-two adoption in the real world Polygon’s expanding ecosystem – Polygon ( MATIC ), one of the most notable layer-two platforms on Ethereum, has recently seen explosive growth. With major projects like Aave ( AAVE ), Decentraland ( MANA ) and even Starbucks utilizing Polygon to enhance scalability and reduce fees, it’s clear that layer-two solutions are becoming an integral part of the DeFi and non-fungible token (NFT) ecosystem. Arbitrum’s airdrop and rise in popularity – Arbitrum’s recent airdrop was one of the most highly anticipated events in the crypto space. This optimistic rollup solution has gained substantial traction for its low-cost transactions and high throughput, making it a go-to choice for developers and users in the Ethereum ecosystem. Solana’s layer-two integration – While Solana ( SOL ) is a layer-one blockchain known for its high-speed and low-cost transactions, it has also been exploring layer-two solutions to enhance its ecosystem further. With the introduction of layer-two protocols like zk-Rollups, Solana is continuing its push to become a global blockchain platform. Why layer-two is the key to unlocking crypto’s potential Layer-two solutions are set to play a critical role in driving the mass adoption of blockchain technology. By reducing transaction costs, improving transaction speed and minimizing network congestion, layer-two platforms are making DeFi, gaming and NFTs more accessible to the broader population. In addition to scalability, layer-two solutions offer enhanced privacy and security. As blockchain adoption grows, and more people enter the world of DeFi and crypto, layer-two will continue to bridge the gap between traditional financial systems and the decentralized world, ensuring that blockchain technology can scale for years to come. The road ahead – A fully scalable blockchain ecosystem As blockchain technology continues to evolve, it’s clear that layer-two solutions are not just a temporary fix but a long-term solution for scalability. The next phase of blockchain innovation will involve further integration of layer-two solutions across multiple blockchain ecosystems, leading to faster, cheaper and more efficient DApps. In the coming years, we can expect even more innovative layer-two protocols to emerge, offering a range of functionalities from secure cross-chain interoperability to privacy-preserving technologies. These developments will play a pivotal role in shaping the future of DeFi, NFTs and beyond. Conclusion Layer-two solutions are a game changer for the blockchain industry. As Ethereum, Polygon and other layer-one blockchains integrate these technologies, we’re seeing real-world applications for DeFi, NFTs and DApps thrive. By tackling scalability and reducing transaction costs, layer-two is helping bring blockchain into the mainstream. For investors, developers and blockchain enthusiasts, keeping an eye on layer-two’s development is crucial to understanding where the future of crypto and blockchain innovation is headed.

Avalanche (AVAX) and SUI, two prominent blockchain platforms, have experienced considerable setbacks recently. Avalanche has fallen 28%, while SUI has dropped 35%. In light of these developments, investors are turning their attention to emerging opportunities, notably Web3bay. Currently in its presale phase, Web3bay (3BAY) has successfully secured $1.60 million, drawing significant interest with its well-structured token sale. Amid the struggles faced by Avalanche and SUI, Web3bay is emerging as an attractive alternative for investors examining the current unpredictable market. Avalanche: Analyzing Recent Setbacks Avalanche, celebrated for its rapid and cost-efficient blockchain solutions, has witnessed its value decrease to $16.25. This represents a 2.37% decline in the last 24 hours and a substantial 28% over the past month. The slowdown in user engagement and the rising competition from similar technologies have influenced this decline. Despite being a preferred platform for numerous DeFi and NFT initiatives due to its low fees and quick processing times, the introduction rate of new projects on Avalanche has slowed. This deceleration has sparked concerns about the platform’s capacity to sustain its previous momentum. Experts believe that Avalanche could revitalize its ecosystem by securing new partnerships, launching innovative applications, and enhancing support for developers, potentially restoring its appeal and broadening its user base. SUI: Navigating Market Challenges SUI, a high-performance blockchain, is currently valued at $0.682. The token has decreased by 3.25% in the last day and 35% over the past month. Initially celebrated for its scalability and accessible tools, SUI is now struggling against a surge of competition from other Layer-1 blockchains, which has intensified the market environment. The growth of SUI’s ecosystem has lagged behind expectations. Although the platform’s technological foundation is robust, its slower-than-expected adoption has resulted in diminished transaction volumes and decreased network activity, adversely affecting the token’s performance. The market’s cooling sentiment towards SUI has investors waiting for more consistent growth indicators. Web3bay: Emerging as a Promising Investment Web3bay is carving out a niche as a viable investment choice. Its presale has already accumulated $1.60 million, with its organized sale strategy and potential for significant gains catching the eye of many. Web3bay’s goal is to establish a decentralized commerce platform that allows users complete control over their transactions. A key strength of Web3bay is its meticulously planned token sale. The current token price stands at $0.00524, with the presale setup poised to offer substantial benefits to early backers. Forecasts suggest a launch price of $0.1959, which could lead to notable profits for early investors. This methodical approach not only promotes a gradual increase in value but also provides investors with a clear picture of the project’s long-term viability. By emphasizing transparency and user empowerment, Web3bay positions itself as an appealing alternative in a landscape where other cryptocurrencies are struggling. Moreover, the platform distinguishes itself by tackling inefficiencies in traditional e-commerce systems. By eliminating middlemen and facilitating secure, direct interactions, Web3bay aspires to create a more streamlined and user-centric marketplace. For investors on the hunt for a high-growth opportunity, Web3bay offers a combination of a transparent roadmap, substantial initial interest, and a distinctive use case. Key Insights Avalanche and SUI each face unique challenges and opportunities. Avalanche, while well-established, is encountering slower growth and heightened competition. Its recent price reductions suggest that strategic innovations are needed to regain its momentum. SUI, despite its advanced technology, is wrestling with lower adoption rates and market pressures. While it retains potential, its slow ecosystem development is pushing investors towards other options. Web3bay stands out with its novel approach. As a decentralized commerce platform , it offers a unique proposition that differentiates it from conventional blockchain projects. Its structured token sale, coupled with a clear growth strategy, is attracting investors looking for potentially higher returns.

Strong Market Performance Fuels Optimism The asset has been among the beneficiaries of Bitcoin’s recent upward momentum, with its price surging past $2.60. This increase has contributed to a 23.79% gain over the past week, reinforcing confidence in the asset’s future potential. The ongoing market rally has led to heightened speculation among investors, with some predicting that XRP could reach triple- or even four-digit price levels in the coming years. Matthew Brienen, Chief Operating Officer at CryptoCharged, has stated that XRP has a strong chance of reaching a price between $100 and $1,000 in the long term. His views were highlighted in a post by a cryptocurrency commentator “Random Crypto Pal,” who described XRP’s market position as highly favorable. Brienen has been investing in XRP for over five years. He made it the largest asset in his portfolio, comprising 50% of his holdings. His investment strategy includes both short-term profit-taking and long-term accumulation. While he plans to sell part of his holdings soon, he intends to keep a substantial amount for the next 5 to 10 years, anticipating significant price appreciation. #XRP will go anywhere from $100 to $1000 in next 5 to 10 years, experts predict!! #XRP IS GIGA BULLISH! pic.twitter.com/7CtQNdBZ5Z — Random Crypto Pal (@RandomCryptoPal) March 2, 2025 Factors That Could Drive Growth According to Brienen, XRP’s potential for substantial growth is closely tied to its role in the global remittance industry. The asset’s ability to facilitate cross-border transactions within seconds and at a minimal cost is a major advantage. He emphasized that this efficiency makes the token a valuable tool for the future of financial transactions, particularly in international payments. Brienen believes that if XRP continues to gain adoption in the financial sector, its value could rise dramatically. However, he acknowledged that market conditions and other unpredictable factors could influence the timeline for achieving these price levels. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Cap Implications of a $1,000 XRP For the asset to reach $1,000 per token, its market capitalization has to grow significantly. Given its current price of $2.50, a move to $1,000 would represent a gain of over 38,000%. This would place XRP’s total market value at approximately $57 trillion, a figure that far exceeds the current size of the entire cryptocurrency market. While this projection may seem ambitious, some analysts argue that the token’s potential use cases in global finance could support long-term growth. However, reaching such a high valuation would require widespread adoption and favorable regulatory developments. Differing Opinions on the Token’s Long-Term Outlook Brienen is not the only analyst predicting substantial price increases for XRP as others in the crypto community have expressed similar expectations. Some foresee XRP reaching $100 soon, while others take a more cautious stance. Meanwhile, the prophet who predicted Trump’s reserve pick is also bullish on the digital asset . For example, research from Telegaon suggests that while the token could eventually reach $500, this milestone may not be achieved until 2050. This timeline contrasts with Brienen’s prediction of a $1,000 valuation by 2035, highlighting the range of opinions on how quickly XRP could experience such a dramatic increase in value. While the asset’s future remains uncertain, its recent market performance and growing use in cross-border payments have fueled optimism among investors. However, as with any cryptocurrency investment, potential risks and market fluctuations should be carefully considered.

The legal expert suggested that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might be waiting for new leadership before making a final decision. This has led to discussions about whether Ripple could negotiate a reduced penalty or alternative settlement. Ripple vs. SEC Lawsuit Could End with $125M Judgment The US SEC, currently led by a 2-1 pro-crypto commission under acting Chair Mark Uyeda, has not dropped its case against Ripple, despite withdrawing other cryptocurrency-related lawsuits. Legal analysts Fred Rispoli in an X post believes the agency is waiting for new SEC Chair candidate Paul Atkins to take office before making further decisions on the case. Fred Rispoli has argued that dropping the appeal while keeping the $125 million fine would save the SEC from further legal battles. “The best satisfaction of this, if true, is that it nullifies the thousands of hours of work put in by SEC staff to get the $125M judgment,” Rispoli stated in a post on X. The Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit remains one of the most complex legal battles in the cryptocurrency industry. While the SEC recently closed cases against Kraken, Coinbase, and ConsenSys, it has yet to take similar action against Ripple. Some legal experts believe the injunction on Ripple’s institutional sales of XRP may be a key factor in the delay. Speculation Over XRP Payments and Strategic Reserves There has been speculation that Ripple could settle the $125 million fine by transferring XRP instead of cash. Vincent Van Code, a market analyst, suggested that Ripple might be negotiating to pay the fine in XRP, which could then be allocated to a government-controlled cryptocurrency reserve. According to Van Code, “Some are speculating that Ripple, rather than pay $125 million in dollars, provides the equivalent in XRP to the new crypto strategic reserve.” However, attorney Rispoli doubts that such an arrangement is likely, given the slow progress in legal proceedings. Meanwhile, Ripple’s escrow holdings, which contain approximately 37.1 billion XRP, have been at the center of discussions regarding potential government acquisitions. Over the weekend, U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed that XRP would be part of the country’s digital asset reserve, fueling speculation that Ripple’s escrow could be involved in the legal negotiations. XRP Sales Restrictions Remain a Key Issue The Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit has focused on whether XRP should be classified as a security. In 2023, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple’s institutional sales of XRP were securities transactions, leading to the $125 million fine. Ripple has since been working to challenge the injunction that restricts certain sales of XRP to banks and payment processors. According to legal experts, Ripple’s efforts to overturn the injunction could be a reason why the SEC has not yet dropped its case. Attorney Jeremy Hogan has suggested that Ripple may be engaging with the Second Circuit Court of Appeals to contest the ruling. Meanwhile, Ripple Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz has dismissed concerns about XRP inflation. Schwartz reaffirmed that XRP’s total supply cannot be increased under the XRP Ledger’s code. “There is literally no function to create any more XRP. The code to do such a thing does not exist,” he stated. As for the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit, it is currently under review at the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. The SEC submitted its arguments to the court on January 15, 2025, and Ripple has until April 16 to file its response.

BTFD Coin’s $0.006 Target Price Could Be the Opportunity You Can’t Afford to Miss,https://thecoinrise.com/wish-you-had-a-time-machine-for-brett-btfd-coins-0-006-target-price-could-be-the-opportunity-you-cant-afford-to-miss/,"The crypto market is filled with moments you look back on and think, “If only I had bought in earlier.” Brett ($BRETT) is one of those stories. As the official meme coin of the Base Chain, Brett has skyrocketed in value, turning early believers into massive winners. But let’s be real—there’s no time machine to go back and grab Brett at its lowest price. However, there’s an even bigger opportunity unfolding right now with BTFD Coin ($BTFD). With BTFD Coin already raising over $6.27 million in presale, this isn’t just another meme coin hype cycle—it’s the next big thing. Packed with a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that’s already live, 90% APY staking rewards, and an explosive Bulls Squad referral program, BTFD is gearing up for a major market debut. And here’s where things get interesting: BTFD is currently priced at just $0.00016, but analysts predict it could hit $0.006 post-launch. That’s a massive 3,650% ROI potential, making it one of the top cryptos to join for short term gains right now. BTFD Coin’s Presale Is Smashing Records—Are You In? If you’ve been searching for top cryptos to join for short term, it’s time to take a serious look at BTFD Coin . Right now, Stage 14 of the presale is in full swing, and this discounted price won’t last long. With over 11,200 Bulls already on board and 71 billion $BTFD sold, demand is surging—and for good reason. Here’s what makes BTFD different from your average meme coin: Presale Strength – Over $6.27 million raised, proving major investor confidence. Staking Rewards – 90% APY on staking, allowing holders to earn passive income. P2E Game – Already live since January 1st, 2025, bringing real use cases to the ecosystem. Bulls Squad Referral Program – Giving investors extra ways to earn rewards by bringing in new holders. Now, let’s talk numbers. If you drop $5,000 into $BTFD at its current presale price of $0.00016, you’d be sitting on 31,250,000 BTFD tokens. When BTFD lists at $0.0006, your investment would already be worth $18,750—more than 3x your money. But what if BTFD reaches its projected $0.006 moon price? That’s where things get wild—your $5,000 turns into $187,500, delivering a 3,650% ROI. That’s the kind of second chance most investors dream of. And let’s not forget the keyword here—BTFD is one of the top cryptos to join for short term gains, and missing out on this presale could be just as painful as missing Brett’s initial run. How to Buy BTFD Coins? Getting in on one of the top cryptos to join for short term is simple: Set up your wallet – Use MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Load up with BNB, ETH, or USDT – These are your go-to purchase options. Connect to the presale – Visit the buy page and select your investment amount. Confirm your purchase – Approve the transaction in your wallet. Claim your tokens – Once the presale ends, your $BTFD will be ready to claim. With Stage 14 already here, this price won’t last forever. Top cryptos to join for short term don’t stay cheap for long—BTFD is proving that right now. Brett’s Success Story—What You Missed Brett ($BRETT) launched as the mascot of the Base Chain, quickly gaining traction among meme coin lovers. Inspired by Matt Furie’s “Boys’ Club” comic, this token became a cultural icon within the crypto space. It has a fixed supply of 10 billion tokens, which helped fuel its rapid rise in value. What made Brett explode? Community hype, strong branding, and Base Chain backing. It was one of those projects that caught fire overnight, turning small investments into serious gains. But let’s be real—most people didn’t get in early enough to ride the biggest part of the wave. Now, if you’re searching for the top cryptos to join for short term, Brett has already made its move. The next big opportunity? BTFD Coin. The Final Thoughts Based on what we’ve seen with Brett and countless meme coins before it, the pattern is clear—those who jump in early make the biggest gains. BTFD Coin is still in presale, and that means you have the chance to get in at the lowest possible price before the big exchange listings happen. Right now, BTFD is sitting at $0.00016, but that price is moving fast. With $6.27M+ already raised and analysts predicting a $0.006 post-listing price, this is one of the top cryptos to join for short term if you’re looking for high-ROI opportunities. There are no second chances in crypto—except when there are. This is yours. So, don’t wait and join the BTFD Coin presale before it’s too late. FAQs What makes BTFD Coin one of the top cryptos to join for short term gains? BTFD Coin combines a strong presale performance ($6.27M raised), a live P2E game, 90% APY staking, and a bullish community. With a listing price of $0.0006 and a moon target of $0.006, it’s positioned for major upside. Is it too late to invest in BTFD Coin? No, but time is running out. Stage 14 of the presale is live, and once it ends, the price will move up. Getting in now at $0.00016 means you’re still ahead of the crowd. Can BTFD Coin reach its predicted $0.006 price? Analysts believe it has the momentum, community, and ecosystem to hit $0.006 post-listing. Early investors stand to gain up to 3,650% if this happens.

Doge Uprising Staking & Presale Offer Huge Returns,https://coinpedia.org/sponsored/best-altcoins-to-buy-this-week-doge-uprising-staking-presale-offer-huge-returns/,"The post Best Altcoins to Buy This Week? Doge Uprising Staking & Presale Offer Huge Returns appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market is entering a critical phase, and many investors are looking for the best altcoins to buy this week before major price movements occur. With multiple opportunities across different sectors, there are several altcoins that could deliver significant returns. This week, five altcoins stand out as strong contenders for investors looking to maximize their portfolios: Doge Uprising (DUP) – A presale meme coin with staking and high ROI potential Tron (TRX) – A blockchain powering stablecoins and decentralized applications Toncoin (TON) – The Telegram-backed cryptocurrency gaining widespread adoption Raydium (RAY) – A decentralized exchange driving liquidity in the Solana ecosystem Tezos (XTZ) – A smart contract platform known for its self-upgrading governance Among these, Doge Uprising presents the strongest opportunity, offering a low-cost entry point through its presale and a staking platform that allows investors to earn passive income while holding their tokens. Doge Uprising: The Best Altcoin to Buy This Week Doge Uprising has become one of the most talked-about presales in 2025, having raised over $415,000 and currently sitting in stage 9 of its presale. With each new stage, the price of $DUP tokens increases, meaning early investors get the best possible entry point before the token is listed on exchanges. The current price per $DUP token is $0.00002595, but as the presale progresses to stage 10, the price will increase again. Investors who secure tokens now will be in a strong position when Doge Uprising launches on major exchanges, where early presale participants historically see the highest returns. Unlike many meme coins that rely purely on speculation, Doge Uprising provides a staking mechanism that allows holders to earn rewards simply by holding $DUP tokens. This feature makes it more than just a speculative asset—it becomes a passive income-generating investment that appeals to both traders and long-term holders. Low Market Cap with High Upside Potential With Doge Uprising still in its early stages, the token has significant room for growth. Compared to established meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, Doge Uprising offers a much higher upside potential, making it an attractive option for those looking for a high-risk, high-reward opportunity. Tron (TRX) – A Blockchain Powering Stablecoin Transactions Tron is one of the most widely used blockchain networks, particularly in the stablecoin sector, where it handles high transaction volumes for Tether (USDT). Its fast and low-cost transactions make it a solid choice for long-term investment. However, because Tron is already an established asset, its growth potential is more limited compared to low-cap presales like Doge Uprising, which have yet to experience explosive growth. Toncoin (TON) – The Cryptocurrency Backed by Telegram Toncoin has gained traction due to its strong connection with Telegram’s massive user base. The blockchain is optimized for fast transactions and scalability, making it a promising investment for those looking at long-term adoption. However, because Toncoin has already seen significant price increases, it does not offer the same level of upside as Doge Uprising, which is still in its presale stage with room for rapid price appreciation. Raydium (RAY) – A Key Player in the Solana Ecosystem Raydium is a decentralized exchange and liquidity provider that plays a central role in the Solana network. As Solana continues to grow, Raydium is likely to benefit from increased trading activity and liquidity incentives. While Raydium is a strong project in the decentralized finance sector, its growth potential is limited compared to Doge Uprising, which has a lower initial market cap and the potential for massive returns once it enters the public market. Tezos (XTZ) – A Smart Contract Platform with Built-In Governance Tezos is a self-upgrading smart contract blockchain known for its governance model, which allows it to implement changes without hard forks. The platform has been widely adopted in the NFT and enterprise blockchain sectors. Although Tezos is a solid investment for long-term security, it does not have the same high-risk, high-reward potential as Doge Uprising. Investors looking for quick gains are more likely to find better opportunities in presales like $DUP. The Best Altcoin to Buy This Week For investors seeking high-growth opportunities, Doge Uprising presents the best risk-reward ratio this week. The combination of a rapidly growing presale, an upcoming exchange listing, and a fully operational staking platform makes it one of the most promising altcoins in 2025. With a low current price and an increasing presale valuation, Doge Uprising offers investors a rare opportunity to secure an early position in what could be one of the biggest meme coins of the year. The crypto market moves fast, and those who recognize potential early often see the highest returns. Doge Uprising Is The Best Altcoin To Buy This Week!

However, due to bearish market sentiment, it has been continuously struggling to gain momentum. Today, March 8, 2025, amid market uncertainty, the asset has registered a 5% price drop and has reached a crucial support level. Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels As ADA reaches a crucial support area, concerns are rising about whether the price will hold this level or fall below it due to bearish market sentiment. Let’s see what happens in the coming days. Source: Trading View According to expert technical analysis, the $0.81 level is a strong support zone with significant buying pressure and potential for a price reversal. If the current sentiment persists and the price falls, closing a four-hour candle below $0.81, there is a strong possibility of an 18% decline to $0.68. On the other hand, if ADA holds this level, it has the potential to rebound and surge by 35%, reaching $1.15 in the future. At present, ADA is trading at the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which provides strong support and indicates that the asset is still in an uptrend. Current Price Momentum At press time, ADA is trading near $0.827, having registered a 5% price drop in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume declined by 10%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. Despite market uncertainty, traders are currently over-leveraged at $0.804 on the lower side and $0.84 on the upper side, according to on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Additionally, these levels hold $9.11 million worth of long positions and $5.45 million worth of short positions, indicating that bulls are strong and could support the asset in holding this level.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|ADA|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-08 05:37:11

Over the past week, its price surged by 46.76%, with a monthly increase of 16.97%. Over the last six months, ADA has soared by an impressive 202%, showcasing strong bullish momentum. Currently, ADA trades between $0.76 and $1.33, reflecting both volatility and potential trading opportunities. Technical indicators support a continued uptrend. The 10-day simple moving average (SMA) is at $0.95, slightly above the 100-day SMA of $0.92, signaling short-term bullish strength. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 49.17, leaning toward oversold territory, while the stochastic oscillator at 18.46 suggests a potential rebound. Additionally, the MACD remains positive at 0.001651, reinforcing a bullish outlook. ADA faces its nearest resistance at $1.53, with a breakthrough potentially leading to $2, offering significant upside potential. On the downside, key support lies at $0.384, acting as a crucial level to monitor. Traders are closely watching these levels as ADA’s price action unfolds. Ripple Ripple (XRP) has seen strong momentum recently, gaining 17% over the past week while ranging between $2.26 and $3.32. Despite a slight 5% decline in the last month, its six-month performance remains exceptional, with a 394% surge. Technical indicators hint at further gains. The 10-day and 100-day SMAs are both near $2.50, indicating stability. The RSI stands at 64.39, nearing overbought territory, while the stochastic indicator at 71.07 suggests strong momentum. A positive MACD of 0.02169 further supports the bullish trend. If the uptrend continues, XRP could test resistance at $3.70, with a successful breakout paving the way toward $4.76. Conversely, a pullback could see support at $1.58, approximately 30% below current levels. Traders are closely monitoring these levels for potential moves.

FIFA President Teases FIFA-linked Crypto Launch FIFA President Gianni Infantino hinted at launching a FIFA-linked cryptocurrency at the White House Crypto Summit on March 7, ahead of the 2026 World Cup. President Trump suggested the coin could even exceed FIFA’s value. President Donald Trump spoke about the potential of FIFA Coin, joking, “It could be quite a coin,” and added, “That coin could be more than FIFA.” His comments quickly sparked speculation in the crypto community about the possibility of a FIFA-branded cryptocurrency becoming real. FIFA COIN’s Reaches $3M Market Cap After Trump’s comments, a cryptocurrency called FIFA COIN (FIFA) soared by 142,000%, reaching a market cap of around $3 million. FIFA COIN, traded on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, saw a spike in trading activity, with a 24-hour volume of $0.65 and a price of $0.0645. However, it has no official connection to FIFA or the 2026 World Cup. Crypto investors are cautioned about meme coins that often pop up after major events or statements from influential figures, that could lead to significant losses. Speaking at the event, Infantino said that FIFA, under his stewardship, is “very, very interested under my presidency to develop the FIFA coin.”So if there is anyone interested in teaming up with FIFA, we’ll conquer the world of soccer with the FIFA coin,” he added. The 2026 FIFA World Cup will be hosted by Canada, Mexico, and the United States, marking the first time three nations will co-host the tournament. With a new 48-team format, it will feature 104 matches, making it the biggest World Cup ever.

Durag Doge is not just another meme coin that will fade away. In fact, it’s here to stay as it reflects the hustle, grind, and the never-give-up attitude of degens in the crypto community. Its unmatched swagger has turned it into a top presale crypto. Durag Doge: Hood swagger meets Blockchain grit Litecoin is currently bleeding, and its price has been in the freefall mode after dipping below the $100 mark. In the last month alone, 11% of its value was erased . Once referred to as the silver of crypto, Litecoin is currently at the mercy of bears and it doesn’t seem like they are ready to give up yet. However, while LTC is tumbling, Durag Doge is rewriting the script. Unlike other meme coins that play the safe game, $DURAG remains unstoppable and walks the streets with unmatched confidence and an edge sharper than a razor-lined durag. Durag Doge is not just a presale token. Instead, it is a movement for dreamers and hustlers. It represents everyone who knows that fortune favors those who dare. Earlier, Durag Doge was just another pup in the DOGE ecosystem meme coin, aimless and overlooked. However, things changed. Durage Doge channeled inner ambition, embraced an underdog mentality, and promised to turn skepticism into power $DURAG doesn’t ask for attention anymore, rather, it demands it, making —it demands it, making it one of the best crypto coins to buy now. Presale Erupts as Polygon Gets Dragged Down Polygon’s year-to-date value is down by a whopping 59.7%, and investors are currently gripping their seats. At the same time, Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) dropped to -0.15 because of heavy selling pressure. Durag Doge , on the other hand, isn’t just weathering the storm; it’s harnessing it. The presale is on fire. The credit goes to its strong community, resilient vision, and rich culture. Early adopters of the coin are entering the community with a price of only $0.0009 per token while eyeing a launch price of $0.01. It reflects an explosive momentum and positions $DURAG as one of the best altcoins for the next bull run. Conclusion: The Streets Have Spoken Litecoin is limping. Polygon is gasping. But Durag Doge? It’s strutting through the crypto scene with the attitude of a champion. And if the presale is anything to go by, $DURAG isn’t here to play. It’s here to dominate, making it the most promising crypto. Follow Durag Doge on X and Telegram for the latest news and updates.

Bitcoin is taking a strategic role in the U.S. economy after a groundbreaking government move, while Trump Official is thriving under a wave of political attention. But the real underdog in this high-stakes game? BitLemons ($BLEM) , a project breaking records as it races through its presale and reshapes the crypto-gaming sector. With volatility reaching new heights and speculation fueling price swings, today’s real winners are projects backed by substance rather than hype. As the market landscape shifts, the smart money is looking toward assets that can weather the storm. BitLemons ($BLEM) Expands as Demand Surges BitLemons isn’t just another token—it’s a fully operational Web3 casino that generates real revenue 24/7. While many crypto projects are caught in speculation, BitLemons is already proving its worth through a live gaming platform featuring over 8,000 games from leading providers like Evolution and Pragmatic. Momentum is accelerating fast. Stage 1 of the presale sold out in just 16 days. Now, with Stage 2 over 76% complete at $0.02, the price will soon increase to $0.03. Early supporters are racing to secure their positions before the next price jump, with speculation building around a potential launch price of $0.17–$0.18. Confidence in the project is reinforced by $1 million in private seed funding, strong security audits from SpyWolf and SolidProof, and an investor-friendly tokenomics model that directs 30% of Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) back into the ecosystem. As traditional crypto assets battle uncertainty, BitLemons is forging ahead with a sustainable model. Bitcoin Enters a New Chapter with a Government Endorsement Bitcoin’s dominance isn’t just about market performance anymore—it’s now part of the national strategy. President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve, leveraging seized cryptocurrency assets to strengthen the U.S. digital economy. This is a historic moment for Bitcoin, marking the first time a major government has directly integrated the digital asset into its financial infrastructure. The move is drawing mixed reactions, with some celebrating Bitcoin’s growing legitimacy while others caution against increased governmental influence. Adding to the buzz, a major cryptocurrency summit is taking place at the White House today, bringing together key industry leaders to discuss the future of regulation and digital assets. Whatever comes from these talks could have long-term implications for the market, and investors are closely watching for new policy announcements. Trump Official Token Rides the Political Wave The Trump Official (TRUMP) token is riding high on the momentum of political news. As discussions around crypto regulation heat up, assets tied to the former president’s brand are seeing a surge in interest. While TRUMP remains highly speculative, social media activity has skyrocketed, fueling increased trading volumes and renewed attention from traders. Meme coins often thrive on cultural and political trends, and with Trump now at the center of the crypto conversation, the token’s volatility is expected to remain high. Market analysts remain split on whether TRUMP’s rally is sustainable or another short-lived hype cycle. But with ongoing discussions surrounding Trump’s crypto policies, traders are keeping a close eye on further developments. BLEM Proves It’s More Than Just Hype While Bitcoin and Trump Official make headlines, BitLemons is securing its place in the crypto world with a model built on real, sustainable value. The gaming platform is already generating revenue, its deflationary tokenomics create consistent demand, and its presale is outperforming expectations. With over $1.8 million already raised and Stage 2 nearly sold out, investors have limited time to get in before the next price jump. Unlike speculative assets that depend on short-term trends, BitLemons is positioning itself for long-term success. The next big move is coming. Will you be ready when it happens?

After reaching $94,000 earlier this week, the cryptocurrency has since retreated below $90,000, marking an approximately 18% drop from its all-time high (ATH) of $109,000 recorded in January. This latest pullback highlights the shifting sentiment among investors and the increasing influence of large holders, or whales, in the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Enters ‘Optimism Stage’—Is a Massive Rally About to Begin? Whales Are Finally Back, Data Shows CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost has identified a notable trend in Bitcoin whale behavior, revealing that these influential market participants had been reducing their holdings for over a month, marking the longest period of net decline in the past year. However, recent data indicates that whales are beginning to increase their Bitcoin holdings again, shifting the monthly percentage change into positive territory. If this trend continues, it could signal a potential return of bullish momentum, as previous instances of whale accumulation have often preceded upward price movements. According to Darkfost’s analysis, whales play a crucial role in shaping Bitcoin’s price direction due to the sheer volume of BTC they control. 🐳Whales are finally back.

Historically, increased whale buying activity has coincided with periods of price stability or growth, making this a key indicator for traders and investors. Coinciding With US Bitcoin Reserve Plans The resurgence of whale interest in BTC coincides with reports of US President Donald Trump signing an executive order to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. CryptoQuant analyst Maartuun has provided insights into this development, suggesting that the United States could officially become a long-term holder of Bitcoin. The reserve may be funded using seized BTC, which currently stands at 188,898 BTC, valued at approximately $18.14 billion. If implemented, this move could significantly reduce selling pressure in the market, as these holdings would be secured rather than liquidated. In addition to securing its existing Bitcoin holdings, reports suggest that the US government may consider purchasing additional BTC. Maartuun citing Bloomberg disclosed that this initiative could lead to an expansion of the strategic BTC reserve, reinforcing Bitcoin’s status as a long-term asset for institutional and sovereign investors. According to Maartuun, if these reports materialize, it could introduce a new dynamic to Bitcoin’s supply and demand, potentially influencing its price trajectory.

How does crypto money laundering work? Criminals hide dirty money by turning it into anonymous cryptos. They mix these cryptos with others, making them impossible to trace. Then, they swiftly move the money through many crypto addresses. Finally, they cash it out, pretending it came from legal crypto trading or investments or use it to purchase high-value products. China’s Action against Financial Fraud and Crimes The same report states that around 25,000 people were arrested in China for financial fraud and crimes in 2024. This showcases that the Chinese government is keen to weed out the threat of financial fraud and crimes from its financial ecosystem. The report also notes that in the same year, no fewer than 825 people were prosecuted for securities crimes, such as financial fraud and insider trading. It also adds that around 42 people in the Evergrande Group case and 49 people in the Zhongzhi Group case were booked in the same year. Reports say that the China Securities Regulatory Commission is working with the procuratorate to clean up the private equity sector. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : U.S. Releases Seized Chinese Crypto Mining Equipment Amid Trade War , Chinese Crypto Regulation Landscape: An Overview China’s approach to cryptos is characterised by prohibitions rather than regulation . There is not a single crypto regulator in the country; instead, several Chinese government entities enforce the country’s crypto restrictions. The People’s Bank of China is a primary force behind China’s cryptocurrency crackdown. Various other agencies, including those responsible for financial stability, cybersecurity, and law enforcement, also contribute to the enforcement of cryptocurrency restrictions. In conclusion, China’s strict legal action against financial crimes shows its commitment to controlling illegal crypto transactions and financial fraud. With thousands prosecuted, the government’s stance against crypto money laundering is clear. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Here’s why",https://timestabloid.com/pundit-says-most-xrp-holders-will-cash-out-20-50-100-and-500-heres-why/,"Edoardo Farina, a well-known XRP advocate, recently shared his perspective on potential sell-off patterns as XRP reaches higher price levels. He suggested that at $20, a significant portion of retail investors would likely sell due to the psychological impact of holding substantial unrealized gains. Farina argued that this trend would continue at subsequent milestones, including $50, $100, and $500. He expects institutions to buy up those tokens progressively reducing the available supply for retail investors. At $20, most XRP holders will cash out. People aren’t used to see so much money, it will trigger a wave of sell-offs. The pattern continues at $50, $100, $500, and beyond, each milestone shaking out more holders until supply dries up for retail. Me? I'll lend my $XRP for Banks — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) March 6, 2025 Farina’s assertion reflects a common market behavior where retail investors liquidate their holdings at psychologically significant price points. However, it also shows how those who don’t have faith in XRP could miss out on significantly higher price levels. Institutional Involvement in XRP Unlike retail investors, Farina stated that he intends to lend his XRP to banks rather than sell it. Farina is a strong proponent of holding on to XRP, previously describing selling at $20 as premature . His recent statement suggests that even $500 may be a premature level to sell, and this perspective aligns with the broader belief that the digital asset could play a role in institutional finance, particularly in cross-border payments and liquidity provisioning. He plans to hold his tokens long enough to lend them to institutions who didn’t see the value of the digital asset early and want to join in by any means. Some crypto figures have emphasized that holding XRP today is comparable to owning Bitcoin in its early stages , and selling prematurely would mean missing out on substantial future gains. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP’s Potential Future Farina’s post adds to an ongoing debate within the community regarding optimal strategies for long-term holders. Some believe that the digital asset’s price appreciation will be significant enough to warrant holding for the foreseeable future, while others view the asset as a tradeable investment. However, Farina’s stance on the asset’s future is clear. He recently described selling XRP at this stage as throwing a winning lottery ticket away , reinforcing that current prices do not reflect the token’s full potential. If his prediction proves accurate, unlucky retail investors who sold early could lose out on massive future gains. Farina has previously said that XRP’s price action will make grown men cry , and this missed opportunity would be devastating to those who threw it away.

PEPE has captured the viral meme coin market, while Rollblock is rapidly gaining pace as a serious GameFi contender. With its presale moving up a gear and its ongoing blockchain-based transparency, Rollblock could be primed for a massive 50x rally this year. As crypto investors look for the next major opportunity this cycle, Rollblock’s verifiable blockchain transactions set it apart in the gaming space. Here’s why this project is becoming impossible to ignore. Rollblock (RBLK): Transparent Transactions Giving Gamers Huge Peace of Mind Rollblock ( RBLK ) continues to rock the $500 billion gaming industry with its blockchain-backed approach. Every transaction, from user deposits to jackpot payouts, is fully verifiable on the Ethereum chain, ensuring absolute transparency for players. This innovation is not surprisingly driving rapid adoption, with new signups, deposits, and wagered bids growing each month. Rollblock’s presale has already pulled in $10.8 million, showing immense investor confidence. Rollblock offers a library of over 7,000 classic games, including poker and blackjack, plus a brand-new sports prediction league. Fiat deposits are now enabled through a partnership with Apple Pay, Google Pay, Visa, and Mastercard, making it easier than ever for users to get involved in the revolution. The team has also secured a prestigious gaming license from Gaming Anjouan and an audit from Solid Proof, adding another layer of trust. Why Is RBLK Poised for Massive Success? Rollblock’s deflationary revenue-sharing model makes it a unique long-term investment and marks it out as a leader in the space. The platform takes 30% of its revenue to buy RBLK tokens, with 60% of these buybacks permanently burned to reduce the supply and the remaining 40% allocated to staking rewards of up to 30% in hassle-free APY. This ensures continued demand while rewarding holders for their loyalty. Dive into more of Rollblock’s game-changing features with Crypto Octo’s video: https://youtu.be/ONh5c192f3o?si=fsTNSby5C_mcEELG Stage 10 tokens are selling fast at just $0.061, with over 40% already spoken for. Investors can also refer a friend in March to receive a 30% $RBLK bonus, plus a further 20% purchase bonus. PEPE Coin (PEPE): Meme Hype Continues to Build PEPE Coin has remained a dominant force in the ever-changing meme coin sector, seeing colossal interest from traders and retail investors. It is currently priced at $0.00000719, and has seen a 5% drop this week. However, this is nothing compared to the monthly candle, which has painted a worrying 29% decline. Top trader Friedrich noted that PEPE ‘bulls need to step in fast to avoid further downside’ and that traders will need to be ‘watching price action closely’ in the coming weeks: PEPE has seen a flurry of bullish exchange listings in recent months, launching on Binance.US and Coinbase, as well as the popular trading app Robinhood. This all bodes very well for PEPE’s adoption and future price action and could lead PEPE to become a top-ten meme coin once the dust settles on the current crypto correction.

41316903,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=138375,1741416340,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,How Cryptocurrency is Reshaping Digital Transactions,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/how-cryptocurrency-is-reshaping-digital-transactions/,"The Creation of Bitcoin and Digital Currencies In 2009, bitcoin was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (the pseudonym for the Japanese individual or group responsible for its creation). Bitcoin was created around the idea of creating a decentralised financial system that would operate outside of the confines and control of the government and that could not be regulated by traditional banking systems. It would remove the need for financial intermediaries when making transactions and also help to reduce the trust and dependency on powerful financial institutions that have wielded ultimate power over individuals and have breached the rights of their clients. The Response Of Financial Institutions and Governments to Cryptocurrencies The creation of cryptocurrency sparked many angry responses from governments and financial institutions alike because they had no control over it. The biggest critics of cryptocurrencies complained that due to lack of regulation, they were being used to fund nefarious entities such as terrorist groups, drug dealers, and criminals, as well as consuming massive amounts of electricity to mine them, creating inequality and also market volatility. Bitcoin was quickly followed by the creation of more than one hundred different other types of cryptocurrencies. Governments have realised that these forms of digital money are around to stay, creating many challenges for governments. Many of them, such as the United States, have begun to adopt different regulations to develop rules that will protect customers against financial risks. The U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was the first organisation to approve cryptocurrency to be introduced to the securities market however, the challenge remains of how to protect investors without slowing down technology. The Rise in The Use of Cryptocurrency What originally started out as a novel idea has now developed into a mainstream form of investment and has also risen in popularity as a payment method. Bitcoin and other digital currencies now have a net worth of trillions of dollars. They are an excellent form of investment; however, there is always a risk of big fluctuations, making the use of cryptocurrency a fun but also risky business. The global rise in popularity of cryptocurrency means that more merchants both online and offline are accepting cryptocurrency as a form of payment. Many online gaming platforms now have integrated cryptocurrency into their platforms, and leading online casinos such as Casino Days are leading the cryptocurrency revolution making their services more accessible to a wider number of users around the world. Many large companies have also embraced the use of digital payment, with Microsoft leading the way. As a result of increased public awareness, financial regulators are also slowly beginning to support this revolution which helps to create an environment of compliance and trust within the financial sector. The Benefits of Using Cryptocurrency For Payments In a society where the risk of being defrauded has become a massive concern, the fraud protection that is offered through the enhanced security of blockchain technology makes paying with cryptocurrency one of the safest methods around . Elements such as the immutable ledger which permanently records transactions, decentralised verification where many different nodes are required to verify transactions, reduced chargebacks which means that a cryptocurrency payment is final which eliminates the possibility of the payee making fraudulent chargebacks, and advanced encryption protect data and consumers personal details which helps to eliminate the risk of fraud. Digital transactions are a cost-effective solution both for consumers who enjoy lower transactions costs and also for merchants who pay lower fees than they would if they offered traditional methods of payment such as credit cards. Instant payments means that there is no waiting time for a transaction to clear. When a transaction is completed using digital currency, it is completed almost instantaneously which takes away the hassle of either consumer or a business having to wait several days for funds to arrive in their accounts and therefore means that they have constant access to their financial assets. Inclusion of those without traditional bank accounts means that more users have easier financial accessibility and can use services that would not otherwise be available to them. Payments can be easily made from a smartphone and users pay lower fees then they would if paying through traditional methods. The increased accessibility fosters more economic inclusion around the globe and opens up new markets both for consumers and businesses. The transparency of transactions is guaranteed through the use of the blockchain. Each transaction is documented in a public ledger, this ensures that all transactions can be verified. This builds trust for businesses and consumers. A more trustworthy financial environment is created because the blockchain technology allows for continued improvement as well as regular audits. The assurance of privacy and anonymity of transactions such as online gambling are very important to consumers and cryptocurrency transactions mean that users can enjoy different services anonymously away from the prying eyes of governments and financial institutions and also lower the chance of sensitive personal data being exposed and exploited by third parties. The creation of innovative methods of payment means that assets can be tokenized (this can include paintings, real estate, and many other items) which means that there can be new payment options available. Integrating programmable money through use of the blockchain means that automated payments can be made for a variety of different services. Decentralisation gives consumers and businesses more control over their financial transactions and also helps to create resilience and foster innovation without worrying about control, censorship, and manipulation from external sources as the financial network is not controlled by a central authority. The potential for appreciation is another factor that is interesting for customers. Though there can be fluctuations in cryptocurrencies, it does have the potential to increase in value as can be attested to with Bitcoin which in 2016 was worth $400 per coin and has risen to $73,000.00 in 2024. Even if it does drop, it will never devalue to its original price, so owners of cryptocurrency stand to make small and sometimes quite large financial gains. All of these factors have made paying with cryptocurrency seamless and hassle free which creates a better experience for customers and as a result the use of digital payments is becoming more prevalent and continues to rise in popularity.

U.S. law enforcement released documents on March 7, showing that Larsen lost approximately $150 million in XRP value in January 2024.

Among the attendees was Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who said he was “pleased to see the incredible support from this administration.” In an X post late Friday, the CEO coined the time President Trump and Crypto Czar David Sacks have spent discussing regulatory frameworks for digital currencies as “ weeks that feel like months .” Ripple CEO: We need a level playing field Garlinghouse, an advocate against the Securities and Exchange Commission’s legal actions against Ripple under the previous administration, mentioned the importance of entities in the industry collaborating and to stop pitting “one coin versus another.” “ We will, as we’ve always done, continue to champion the need for a level playing field ,” he stated. “ It was great to hear others in the room echo this as well! The industry must come together to move much-needed legislation forward in the US. “ Garlinghouse concluded his message by thanking President Trump, Crypto Czar David Sacks, White House’s Executive Director of the Council of Advisers on Digital Assets Bo Hines, and CFTC Commissioner Caroline Pham for hosting a “truly historic summit.” Praise for Trump’s leadership in crypto After the summit, industry leaders and administration officials showed their support for Trump’s friendly approach to digital assets. In his post-summit press conference speech, David Sacks said it was an honor to work for a president who “works every day to get so much done for the American people.” “ Your love of innovators and high IQ people is why we’re here ,” Sacks remarked. “ You love legal fairness and nobody knows what lawfare feels like better than you do . You will fight and never back down, even in the face of an assassin’s bullet. It’s an inspiration to everyone in this room .” Sacks, who is leading efforts of the current administration’s crypto policy, described Trump’s White House as operating “at tech speed” and credited the president with pushing forward with his promises for the digital asset industry. President Trump formalized his commitment through an executive order signed on Thursday, instructing the Treasury and Commerce Departments to come up with budget-neutral strategies for accumulating Bitcoin and other digital assets into a national strategic reserve, without the involvement of taxpayers. “ We don’t want any cost to the taxpayers ,” Trump reckoned. US President’s message to the crypto community “From this day on, America will follow the rule that every Bitcoin owner knows very well: never sell your Bitcoin,” asserted Trump, repeating the words he had said to the American people back in July 2024, at the Nashville Bitcoin conference. Pausing for effect, he added, “ I don’t know if that’s right or not. Who the hell knows, right? Who knows? But so far, it’s been right, and well, let’s keep it that way. ” Industry leaders attending the event welcomed the administration’s policies, with many executives bashing the Biden administration’s regulatory crackdowns, arguing that they stifled innovation and targeted digital currency businesses unfairly. “What everyone really needs to have at this point is clarity on what the level of scrutiny and intensity of regulation will be, who the key regulators will be,” Vanderbilt University law professor Yesha Yadav told Reuters. Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini , took to social media to support the administration’s cause. “ Yesterday was history in the making ,” he wrote . “ The first crypto President. The first crypto summit at the White House. We are winning bigly and we are going to keep on winning until we get tired of winning—which will be never! ” Still, the Washington crypto meeting did not have much impact on Bitcoin’s price as expected.

Now, Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange , has introduced a new listing model that could bring Pi Network closer to being officially listed. The new listing model matches the Pi Network community’s recent voting activity which received an 88% vote to list Pi on exchanges. Binance’s New Listing Model Binance has introduced a decentralized voting system where users with at least 0.01 BNB can participate in the “Vote to List” and “Vote to Delist” options. The exchange explained that projects must secure a certain level of community support to be considered for listing. If a token gains enough popularity, Binance will move forward with its listing process, rewarding early supporters with airdrops and other incentives. This model also includes a delisting mechanism where tokens that fail to meet community and regulatory standards can be voted out. Binance has stated that the new listing model is designed to give more power to the community while ensuring that listed tokens meet compliance standards. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pi Coin Price Prediction Today: Can Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Push Price Beyond $10? , Could Pi Network Be Listed Soon?

The recent community voting event for Pi Network ran from February 17 to February 27, 2025, saw massive support for PI’s listing, with Binance receiving 232,676 eligible votes. Out of these, 88% (202,547 votes) were in favor of listing Pi Network, while only 12% (30,129 votes) opposed it. Given the overwhelming community support, Binance now faces pressure to follow through and list Pi Network. If Binance stays true to its new listing model, the official listing of PI could happen soon. Impact Of Binance Listing on Pi Coin Despite not being listed on Binance yet, Pi Network has built a strong community and gained a significant market presence. As of now Pi coin is trading around $1.81 , reflecting a 2% gain in the past 24 hours. Many believe that if Binance officially lists PI, its price could surge beyond $10, pushing it into the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Currently standing at 11th position with a market cap of $12.95 billion trailing behind Tron (TRX), and Cardano (ADA). .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

It’s all about the next crypto to explode—and folks, BTFD Coin is coming in hot. As AI16Z tries to maintain its ground, down 12.84% in the last 24 hours, and Snek snakes through price dips, there’s a fresh challenger on the block. Spoiler alert: BTFD Coin isn’t just joining the meme coin race, it’s about to turn heads and catch some serious momentum, thanks to its jaw-dropping 10% referral reward. With Stage 14 already sold out, there’s no time to wait. Move fast, or risk missing out. Plus, its still-valid 100% bonus code LAUNCH100 gives you twice the tokens with your $BTFD purchase in the current stage. Once Stage 14 is over, it evaporates, which is another reason to get in now! BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Getting All the Attention With Cool Referral Rewards BTFD Coin is shaking up the meme coin space with one awesome presale. Why? Because it’s the next crypto to explode, and it’s got an insane offer that could rocket you to the moon: a 10% referral reward. Talk about stacking some serious coins without lifting a finger. Let’s paint the picture. You sign up, share your referral code with friends, family, or, your whole social media following. When your referral goes on to buy some BTFD, they get a 10% bonus if they spend $50 or more. And that’s not all—if you make it into the top 20 on the leaderboard by the end of the month, you’re also raking in a 10% cut of their total purchase . What’s more: Stage 14 is selling out quicker than you can say “moon,” and the next crypto to explode is poised to hit exchanges at an eye-popping $0.0006. Analysts are predicting that once this coin catches momentum, it could hit a jaw-dropping $0.006. Imagine putting in $8,000 at today’s price of $0.00016—bam, that’s 50 million BTFD tokens. If BTFD hits $0.0006 at launch, you’re looking at $30,000. But if it moons to $0.006? You’re staring at a mind-blowing $300,000. That’s the kind of ROI that makes you sit up and take notice, especially if you use the LAUNCH100 code now to get double that amount! Other BTFD Coin Features BTFD Coin isn’t just about making a quick buck; it’s about long-term value. With features like staking rewards that are out of this world (up to 90% APY) and a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that lets you earn more BTFD tokens, this project is designed for the long haul. The Bulls Squad community, staking rewards, and the upcoming global launch make BTFD Coin one of the most anticipated tokens in the market today. AI16Z: The AI-Powered Meme Coin with a Not-So-Small Dip AI16Z is a rising star in the meme coin universe, but its recent performance has been a bit of a rollercoaster. Currently sitting at $0.2449, AI16Z has seen a drop of 12.84% in the last 24 hours. The 24-hour trading volume stands at a solid $73.98 million, showing there’s still plenty of action happening in its corner of the crypto market. At the time of writing, AI16Z holds a respectable market cap of $269.4 million, ranking at #157 on CoinMarketCap with just under 1.1 billion circulating coins. Still, despite its vast supply, AI16Z’s price has had some struggles staying afloat, and it remains to be seen whether it can break through this dip and turn things around. Why all the buzz about AI16Z? Well, it’s all about the tech. But that doesn’t mean it’s immune to the turbulence of the market, especially when meme coin hype is in flux. While AI16Z could offer some nifty gains if it bounces back, there’s still a lot of uncertainty surrounding its future. Will it ride the next crypto wave or fall back into obscurity? Only time will tell, but if it can get its act together, AI16Z could be the next crypto to explode. Snek: Cardano’s Slippery Meme Coin Struggles With a name like Snek, it’s no surprise this meme coin is making waves in the crypto world, but like all good snakes, it slithers through highs and lows. Currently priced at $0.003838, Snek is experiencing a 9.09% drop in its 24-hour trading volume, which is just over $2.7 million. Sitting at #216 on CoinMarketCap, Snek’s market cap hovers at $285.7 million with a circulating supply of 74.4 billion coins. While the numbers don’t scream “top dog” (or in this case, top snake), Snek has still earned its place in the meme coin hierarchy. While its trading performance could be better, it’s clear there’s still a loyal fan base rallying behind it, making it one of the meme coins to keep an eye on. The road ahead isn’t free from hurdles, though, as market conditions remain rocky for all meme coins at the moment. Still, as any crypto enthusiast knows, that’s exactly when some of the best gains can be found, and Snek could surprise everyone once again.

The newly established reserve will consist of digital assets confiscated from criminal cases in the U.S., with proponents drawing parallels to a “digital Fort Knox.” This initiative is designed to assure Congress that taxpayer money will not be used to purchase digital assets while enabling the government to acquire cryptocurrency through forfeitures. The move aligns with Trump’s campaign promises and places the U.S. in a stronger position within the digital asset space. Crypto expert Vincent Van Code believes the order is an impressive gambit that delivers on multiple fronts. He stated, “Trump’s team is clever. Because now, it allows them to get their hands on US tokens for either next to nothing, gifted, or perhaps swaps for bonds.” The Trump Executive Order regarding BTC reserve and ""digital asset stockpile"" for me is a winner. Firstly, XRP is no longer a security, in any way by the sounds of it. Forcus that's our trigger for adoption. It would have been nice tocsee the escrow bought, but you never… pic.twitter.com/3yGDLTNBCi — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) March 7, 2025 He emphasized that even those in Congress who oppose Trump or cryptocurrencies would struggle to reject a deal that results in a financial windfall for taxpayers. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Implications for XRP and Other Digital Assets A major implication of this order is the solidification of XRP’s legal status. Van Code remarked, “XRP is no longer a security, in any way by the sounds of it.” This statement aligns with the 2023 court ruling that determined XRP is not a security, a decision that removed significant regulatory uncertainty surrounding the asset. The order also affects the broader digital asset market, particularly for projects like Solana and Cardano. Trump’s approach appears to weaken the position of crypto companies by increasing government influence over digital assets. Commenting on the power of these cryptocurrency companies, Van Code referenced Trump’s recent meeting with the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, stating, “You don’t have the cards, you’re not in a good position.” Government Acquisition of Digital Assets Unlike traditional asset purchases, the executive order ensures that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are acquired without taxpayer funding. The digital asset stockpile will consist of assets obtained through forfeitures, potentially allowing the government to accumulate substantial holdings at no direct cost. This strategic move allows the administration to position itself as a key stakeholder in the crypto market without directly investing federal funds. Van Code drew attention to the administration’s framing of the Bitcoin reserve as a passive “do nothing and hold what we got” approach, which has created favorable optics, making it more palatable to lawmakers, and drawing favorable reactions from Eric Trump and many other prominent figures.

A Step-by-Step Guide to Buying and Selling Crypto,https://coinpedia.org/traders/what-is-cryptocurreny-trading/,"The post How to Trade Cryptocurrencies? A Step-by-Step Guide to Buying and Selling Crypto appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News If you’re new to trading and looking to step into the world of cryptocurrency , you’re in the right place. Cryptocurrency trading offers exciting opportunities, but it can also be confusing and risky if you don’t know what you’re doing. This guide is designed specifically for beginners who are serious about understanding crypto trading. We’ll cover everything step by step, from how markets work to choosing the right cryptocurrencies and managing risks. By the end of this guide, you’ll have a clear foundation to start your trading journey with confidence. What is Cryptocurrency Trading? Cryptocurrency trading is the act of buying and selling digital currencies like Bitcoin , Ethereum , and many others to make a profit. Just like stock trading, the goal is to buy low and sell high. However, unlike traditional stock markets that have set trading hours, the crypto market is open 24/7. For example, if you bought Bitcoin at $30,000 and sold it at $40,000, you just made a $10,000 profit. Simple, right? Well, not exactly. Prices change quickly, and not every trade is a winning one. That’s why it’s important to understand how the market works before investing your money. How Do Cryptocurrency Markets Work? Cryptocurrency markets function differently from traditional financial markets. Here’s a simple way to look at it: Supply and Demand – If more people want a certain cryptocurrency, its price goes up. If people start selling, the price drops. Just like any other product! Exchanges – Crypto is traded on online platforms like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken. These platforms allow you to buy, sell, and swap different cryptocurrencies. Volatility – Unlike stocks, cryptocurrencies can see huge price swings in just minutes. Bitcoin, for example, has gone from $3,000 to $60,000 in a few years. But it has also had sharp crashes along the way. Liquidity – This refers to how easily you can buy or sell a cryptocurrency. Popular coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum have high liquidity, meaning you can trade them quickly. Lesser-known coins might be harder to sell. Market Participants – You’re not the only one trading! There are big investors (whales), small traders, bots, and institutions all playing the game. Why Do People Trade Cryptocurrencies? People trade cryptocurrencies for different reasons: Profit Potential – The price of cryptocurrencies can go up quickly. Traders try to capitalize on these price movements. 24/7 Market – Unlike traditional stocks, crypto trading never stops. This allows traders to react to news and trends instantly. Low Barriers to Entry – You don’t need thousands of dollars to start. Some exchanges allow you to trade with as little as $10. Diversification – Some investors use cryptocurrencies to diversify their portfolios. Decentralization – Unlike stock markets, which are controlled by governments and financial institutions, crypto operates independently. Example: If you invested $100 in Dogecoin when it was worth $0.01, and it later hit $0.70, you would have made $7,000. But, if you bought it at the peak and it dropped to $0.10, you would have lost most of your investment. That’s why timing and strategy matter. Which Cryptocurrency Should You Trade? There are thousands of cryptocurrencies, but not all of them are worth trading. Here are some of the most popular ones: Bitcoin (BTC) – The first and most well-known cryptocurrency. It’s often considered a safe bet. Ethereum (ETH) – Known for its smart contracts and decentralized applications. Binance Coin (BNB) – Used for trading fees on Binance, one of the biggest exchanges. Solana (SOL) – Known for its fast transactions and growing ecosystem. Meme Coins (DOGE, SHIBA) – Fun but highly volatile. These coins can skyrocket but also crash hard. Beginners often start with Bitcoin and Ethereum before exploring other options. Step-by-Step Process to Start Cryptocurrency Trading Choose a Reliable Exchange – Some good options are Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, and Bybit. Create an Account – Sign up, verify your identity, and secure your account with two-factor authentication. Deposit Funds – You can use a bank transfer, credit card, or even PayPal (depending on the exchange). Pick a Cryptocurrency – Start with something stable, like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Choose a Trading Strategy – Will you hold long-term or trade daily? Use Stop-Loss Orders – Protect yourself from major losses by setting a price where your trade will automatically sell. Stay Updated – Follow crypto news, trends, and analysis. Practice First – Many platforms offer demo accounts to practice trading without real money. Is Cryptocurrency Trading Safe? Crypto trading is risky, but there are ways to stay safe: Security – Always use two-factor authentication and keep your funds in a secure wallet. Market Volatility – Prices can change quickly. Never invest money you can’t afford to lose. Scams – Be careful of fake investment schemes and phishing attacks. Regulations – Some governments have strict rules on crypto trading. Know the laws in your country. Example: If you keep all your crypto on an exchange and it gets hacked, you could lose your funds. That’s why many traders store their assets in private wallets. The Future of Cryptocurrency Trading The crypto market is still young, and many changes are coming. Here’s what we might see in the future: More Regulation – Governments are working on clearer rules for trading. Institutional Adoption – More big companies and banks are getting into crypto. Advanced Trading Tools – AI-driven bots and automated strategies are making trading more efficient. Integration with Traditional Finance – Crypto trading might merge with traditional markets. New Cryptos and Technologies – Coins like Ethereum 2.0 and new blockchains are improving how crypto works. Cryptocurrency trading is exciting, but it’s not a get-rich-quick scheme. It takes knowledge, patience, and a solid strategy. Start small, learn the ropes, and always stay informed. If done right, it can be a rewarding experience. FAQ How do I start trading cryptocurrencies? To start cryptocurrencies, you need to create an account on a reputable cryptocurrency exchange, complete the verification process, and deposit funds into your account. What is a cryptocurrency wallet? A cryptocurrency wallet is a digital wallet that allows you to securely store, send and receive cryptocurrencies. What is the difference between a market order and a limit order? A market order is executed immediately at the current market price, while a limit order allows you to set a specific price at which you want to buy or sell a cryptocurrency. Are there any fees associated with cryptocurrency trading? Yes, most cryptocurrency exchanges charge fees for executing trades, depositing or withdrawing funds, and other services. These fees can vary between exchanges. What is a trading pair in cryptocurrency trading? A trading pair in cryptocurrency trading refers to the two cryptocurrencies that can be traded against each other. For example, BTC/ETH represents the trading pair of Bitcoin and Ethereum, where one can be exchanged for the other. What is the significance of trading volume in cryptocurrency markets? Trading volume represents the total amount of a cryptocurrency traded within a specific time period. High trading volume is often considered an indicator of market liquidity and can influence price movements.",Traders,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|EXCHANGE|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-08 07:27:48

Numbers are flashing. Prices are jumping up and down. How do you know when to buy? When to sell? When to just sit tight? That’s where trading indicators come in. They help traders make sense of all the madness. If you’re new to crypto, understanding indicators is like having a map in a foreign city. Without it, you might get lost. With it, you can navigate the market with confidence. In this guide, we’ll break down the most useful trading indicators, how to use them, and how to combine them for better results. Top Crypto Trading Indicators: How to Use RSI, MACD, and Moving Averages There are dozens of indicators out there, but let’s start with three of the most popular ones: 1. Relative Strength Index (RSI) Think of RSI as a “hype meter” for a coin. It tells you whether a cryptocurrency is overbought (too much hype) or oversold (nobody wants it). If RSI is above 70 , the asset is overbought – meaning it might be time to sell. If RSI is below 30 , the asset is oversold – meaning it could be a good buying opportunity. Example: Bitcoin’s RSI hits 80. This means too many people have bought it recently. A price drop might be coming. A smart trader could wait for the RSI to cool off before buying. 2. Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) MACD helps traders spot trend changes. It consists of two lines: A fast-moving line (short-term trend) A slow-moving line (long-term trend) When the fast-moving line crosses above the slow-moving line, it signals a buy opportunity. When it crosses below , it signals a sell . Example: The MACD line crosses above the signal line. This could mean an uptrend is starting. A trader might decide to buy before the price climbs further. 3. Moving Averages (MA) Moving averages smooth out price movements to help identify trends. Simple Moving Average (SMA) : An average of past prices over a set period. Exponential Moving Average (EMA) : Similar to SMA but gives more weight to recent prices. Example: If Bitcoin’s price is above its 50-day moving average, it suggests an uptrend. If it drops below, it might signal a downtrend. Best Technical Indicators for Crypto Trading: Trends, Momentum & Volume Signals Besides RSI, MACD, and MAs, here are a few more indicators that can improve your trading decisions: 1. Bollinger Bands Bollinger Bands measure price volatility. They consist of three lines: A middle line (moving average) An upper band (high price range) A lower band (low price range) When the price touches the upper band, the asset might be overbought. When it touches the lower band, it might be oversold. Example: Ethereum’s price touches the lower Bollinger Band. This might be a signal to buy as a price bounce could be coming. 2. Volume Indicators (OBV – On Balance Volume) Volume indicators tell you whether the market is truly interested in a coin. If the price is going up with high volume , it confirms a strong uptrend. If the price is going down with high volume , it signals a strong downtrend. Example: A coin’s price rises, but the volume is low. This could mean a weak uptrend and a possible fakeout. Step by Step: How to Read Crypto Charts for Profitable Trades Now that you know some indicators, let’s put them together in a simple strategy: Step 1: Identify the Trend Use Moving Averages and MACD to see if the market is trending up or down. Step 2: Look for Overbought or Oversold Conditions Check RSI and Bollinger Bands to see if the asset is overpriced or underpriced. Step 3: Confirm with Volume Look at On-Balance Volume (OBV) to check if traders are actually buying or selling. Step 4: Enter the Trade If all signals align (e.g., RSI is low, MACD shows a buy signal, and volume is rising), consider entering a trade. Step 5: Set Stop-Loss and Take-Profit Levels Always set a stop-loss to protect yourself from unexpected moves. Combining Crypto Indicators for a Winning Trading Strategy No single indicator works 100% of the time. The best traders combine multiple indicators for a more complete picture. Example of a Trading Strategy: Use the 50-day Moving Average to identify the trend. Use RSI to check if the asset is overbought or oversold. Confirm with MACD for buy or sell signals. Check volume to confirm the trend. If all indicators point in the same direction, the trade has a higher probability of success. Final Thoughts: Mastering Crypto Trading Indicators Trading isn’t just about gut feelings. It’s about making informed decisions. Crypto indicators are tools that help you see beyond the noise of price fluctuations. Start with simple indicators like RSI, MACD, and Moving Averages . Learn to combine multiple indicators for better accuracy. Always confirm trends with volume before making a move. The more you practice, the better you’ll get at reading the market.

A sharp decline in the US Dollar Index (DXY) coupled with the expansion of the Global M2 Money Supply add credence to that the risk-on assets are likely to rally. The Wyckoff Accumulation pattern noted on ETH price adds further credence that a bullish reversal to potentially $4,000 is likely. DXY Decline and Global M2 Surge: A Tailwind for Ethereum Price? The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the dollar’s strength against a basket of major currencies, dropped 3.90% since February 28, 2025. A weaker dollar typically boosts risk assets like cryptocurrencies as investors seek higher returns in alternative investments. So, investors can expect the declining dollar to boost Bitcoin and Ethereum prices higher. Dollar Index Additionally, the global M2 money supply, which is a broad measure of money in circulation, including cash, checking deposits, and other liquid assets, has also risen by 1.87%, from $105.4 trillion to $107.4 trillion since mid-January 2025. This expansion in liquidity is a perfect combination that further pushes investors to seek higher returns in risk assets. History shows that similar conditions have driven crypto bull cycles in the past and could catalyze a rally for Bitcoin and Ethereum prices as well. Global M2 Money Supply Crypto analyst Sam Mandal noted, “Ethereum thrives in environments of loose monetary policy and increased liquidity. The combination of a declining DXY and a rallying global M2 money supply creates an ideal setup for Ethereum to capitalize on market momentum.” Ethereum’s Wyckoff Accumulation Pattern: A Springboard to $4,000 and Beyond? Adding to the macroeconomic bullish narrative is Ethereum price action forming a Wyckoff Accumulation pattern, as noted by prominent crypto analyst Louie. According to his recently shared post on X, ETH is in the “spring” phase, which is often followed by a bullish reversal if certain conditions are met. The spring phase is when price dips below key level, indicating a potential smart money accumulation. In the post, Louie highlighted that if Ethereum price recovers above the key support level at $2,300, it could kickstart a bullish reversal. In such a case, ETH’s value could explode to the next key hurdle at $4,000. “Smart money thinks in terms of years, not weeks,” Louie wrote, emphasizing the long-term accumulation strategy at play. Depending on the momentum at $4,000, he hinted that bullish Ethereum price prediction could extend its rally to $5,000, driven by strong market sentiment and technical support. ETH/USDT 2-day chart Conclusion: Ethereum’s Bright Future Ahead As of March 8, 2025, Ethereum appears primed for a significant price rally, driven by a weakening U.S. dollar, expanding global liquidity, and a textbook Wyckoff accumulation pattern. With the DXY down 3.90% since February 28 and global M2 money supply up 1.87% since January, the macroeconomic environment is highly favorable for risk assets like ETH. Combined with technical signals pointing to a recovery above $2,300 and a potential target of $4,000 or $5,000, Ethereum investors have reason to be optimistic.

While Floki Inu and Brett are making waves, one project is capturing immense attention—Arctic Pablo Coin (APC). This innovative meme coin isn’t just another player in the game; it’s setting the stage for an unprecedented surge with its unique token burn mechanism. This article will cover the latest developments on Arctic Pablo Coin, Floki Inu, and Brett, offering insights into why these cryptos are among the best crypto to invest in right now. Token Burns: Arctic Pablo Coin’s Secret to Skyrocketing Value Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) has introduced a groundbreaking approach to increasing scarcity and long-term value. Through its aggressive token burn mechanism, all unsold tokens during the presale are permanently removed from circulation every week. Even after the presale, any leftover tokens will be burned, ensuring a deflationary model that favors investors. What makes this approach game-changing? Every burn reduces the overall supply, creating a higher demand for the remaining tokens. The transactions are fully recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), providing transparency and trust. The Numbers Behind Arctic Pablo Coin’s Presale Success Current Location: ChillVille (13th phase) Current Price : $0.000070 per APC Total Raised: Over $1.78 million Launch Price: $0.008 ROI Potential: Over 11,285.71% from the 13th phase to launch Staking APY: 66% during presale Referral Incentives & Competitions: Earn rewards in APC tokens or USD ChillVille Presale: Last Chance Before Arctic Pablo Coin Moves On The Arctic Pablo Coin presale is heating up as the project reaches its 13th phase, ChillVille.

This is a rare window of opportunity with a staggering ROI potential of over 11,285.71% by the time it hits the launch price of $0.008. Arctic Pablo Coin is unlike traditional meme coin presales. Instead of staged rounds, it follows a unique journey model, traveling through different locations. With each new destination, the price climbs, making the current phase the last golden opportunity for early adopters to grab APC at an incredibly low cost. As more investors jump in, the supply shrinks, pushing prices higher. The question is: will you be on board before it takes off? Floki Inu’s Latest Breakthrough Floki Inu has once again caught the spotlight with its latest ecosystem expansion. The meme coin recently announced an upcoming DeFi platform integration, which will enable staking and yield farming, further strengthening its utility beyond hype. This new feature is expected to drive user adoption and make Floki Inu a strong contender in the best crypto to invest category. With increased liquidity and utility, Floki’s latest move could position it for major gains. Brett: A New Contender with Big Moves Brett, the fast-growing meme coin, is making headlines after securing a strategic partnership with a major NFT marketplace. This development opens up new opportunities for token holders, allowing them to engage in NFT transactions using Brett tokens. As meme coins continue to evolve, Brett is proving that it’s more than just a trend—it’s a project with long-term potential. With strong community backing and continuous innovation, Brett is gaining traction fast. Conclusion: Arctic Pablo Coin Leads the Charge With three exciting crypto projects in the spotlight, Arctic Pablo Coin stands out as a must-watch investment. While Floki Inu and Brett are making significant moves, the Arctic Pablo Coin presale is creating an unparalleled level of excitement. The current phase, ChillVille, offers a rare opportunity for investors to enter at just $0.000070 before the price jumps.

This decline is part of a larger trend impacting meme-based cryptocurrencies, which saw explosive growth in 2024 but are now struggling in 2025. The market cap of meme coins has dropped a staggering 59% from its peak, sparking serious doubts about their long-term future. Adding fuel to the fire are high-profile controversies and the rise-and-fall stories of certain tokens, which have further shaken investor confidence. With speculative hype fading and regulatory pressure increasing, the golden age of meme coins like Dogecoin could be drawing to a close. Now, both whales and retail investors are shifting gears, seeking crypto projects with real, long-term growth potential.

Could XRP reach $20 by 2025 as Lightchain AI steals the spotlight? While XRP has shown promise in the crypto market, Lightchain AI, priced at just $0.006 and having already raised $17.1 million in its presale, is quickly gaining attention for its innovative approach. Combining blockchain with artificial intelligence, Lightchain AI offers scalable, decentralized solutions with real-world applications. As its presale continues to gain momentum, many believe that Lightchain AI’s explosive growth potential could outpace XRP, making it a strong contender for market dominance and an exciting investment opportunity for 2025. Could XRP Hit $20 by 2025? As of February 28, 2025, XRP is trading at $2.07, marking a 6.76% decline from the previous close. Analysts hold varying predictions for XRP's price trajectory in 2025. Some estimates project a potential increase to $5 to $7 during the first half of the year, supported by Ripple's technological advancements and a favorable regulatory landscape. However, achieving the $20 mark would require an extraordinary surge of approximately 865% from the current price. While there are optimistic forecasts, such a dramatic rise remains speculative and would depend on unprecedented market conditions. While growth in XRP's price is possible by 2025, reaching $20 appears improbable based on current market analyses and trends. How Lightchain AI is Revolutionizing Crypto World Lightchain AI is set to transform the crypto landscape by integrating artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, a combination that is rapidly gaining importance. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies that focus mainly on financial transactions, Lightchain AI brings AI-powered automation and intelligent decision-making to decentralized networks, unlocking new possibilities beyond payments and smart contracts. This innovative approach positions Lightchain AI at the forefront of the next phase of blockchain evolution, where AI-driven solutions will improve security, scalability, and overall efficiency. Its presale price of $0.006 and impressive fundraising success reflect strong investor belief in its long-term growth potential. As AI continues to expand its influence across industries, blockchain projects incorporating advanced AI features are likely to see rising demand. Lightchain AI stands out as a strong contender for future leadership in this space. How XRP and Lightchain AI Can Work Together XRP and Lightchain AI (LCAI) operate in different areas of the blockchain ecosystem, allowing them to coexist and succeed side by side. XRP specializes in providing fast and affordable cross-border payment solutions, making it a major player in the global payments industry, particularly as institutional adoption grows. On the other hand, Lightchain AI combines artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, opening the door for decentralized AI-driven applications that enhance automation and decision-making. While XRP is focused on transforming financial transactions, LCAI aims to innovate industries that depend on AI-integrated blockchain systems. Their unique purposes ensure they can grow without overlapping or competing directly. As blockchain continues to evolve, technologies that boost financial efficiency like XRP and those advancing AI-powered automation like LCAI can work in harmony, shaping the future of decentralized systems while appealing to distinct industries and investor groups.

Investors had pinned high hopes on President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance, expecting bold announcements about a U.S. strategic crypto reserve that would prominently feature major altcoins. Instead, the summit delivered a more subdued outcome : a framework for stablecoin legislation before August and assurances of a lighter regulatory touch—moves that failed to ignite the market as anticipated. Trump said it was ""foolish"" that the federal government had already sold so much of its seized bitcoin, adding that the country will a colloquial rule of “never sell your bitcoin.” XRP dropped 3.5% in the past 24 hours to nearly $2.4, down from a high of $2.98 earlier in the week — marking a decline of nearly 20% from its Sunday peak following Trump’s initial reserve announcement. Cardano’s ADA fell over 5% while Solana’s SOL shed 4% to hover around $138 as of Asian afternoon hours Saturday. Bitcoin, by contrast, held up better, trading at $86,000—down 2.5% in the past 24 hours but showing relative resilience compared to the altcoin bloodbath. The summit, chaired by Trump’s AI & Crypto Czar David Sacks, had been billed as a landmark event following the president’s earlier pledge to establish a U.S. crypto strategic reserve including BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL, and ADA. Trump’s Sunday Truth Social posts had sparked a massive rally, with majors surging as much as 60% as traders bet on a transformative policy shift. However, Sacks’ clarification on Friday that Trump’s mention of five cryptocurrencies was merely illustrative — not a firm commitment — doused hopes of longer rallies. Meanwhile, the embrace of bitcoin could eventually see other countries act in lockstep, potentially acting as bullish catalysts in the coming months. “The US’ prioritisation of Bitcoin as a reserve asset not only legitimises its status as “digital gold’ but also sets a precedent that could accelerate regulatory frameworks and drive institutional adoption worldwide,” Vincent Chok, CEO of First Digital, told CoinDesk in an email. “This move will inevitably prompt a diverse range of responses from global regulators.’ “For those aligned with US policy, it could accelerate the establishment of their own national strategic stockpiles. Such federal confidence could inspire institutions to move on-chain, increasing participation, injecting liquidity into the decentralised finance market, and broadening interest beyond Bitcoin to other digital assets like stablecoins,” Chok added.",Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|ADA|SOL|XRP|FIAT,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-08 07:56:01

Recent burn metrics indicated that roughly 30 million coins were removed from the crypto’s circulating supply. In response, traders and investors eye a bullish outlook for the meme coin, with market sentiments further uplifted as a top market analyst revealed over 50% gains for SHIB price looms. Shiba Inu Burn Rate Soars 3200% As 30M Coins Destroyed The latest data from Shibburn indicated that the Shiba Inu burn rate skyrocketed by 3252% in the past 24 hours. This major upswing is primarily attributed to 29.32 million tokens removed from the token’s circulating supply. Source: Shibburn Official Site To frame this properly, it’s worth mentioning that the SHIB burn mechanism permanently reduces the asset’s circulating supply by sending coins to a null address. As an upshot, market participants anticipate SHIB price gains amid reduced supply, mirroring the law of supply and demand. What Is Shiba Inu’s Current Circulating Supply? As of press time, Shiba Inu’s circulating supply shrank to 584.34 trillion coins, taking a blow via constant burn rate surges. A staggering 410.49 trillion coins have been burned to date, per Shiba Burn statistics . Furthermore, roughly 76 million coins have been burnt in March just as the first week comes to an end. Crypto market participants anticipate more burns ahead, bolstering SHIB tokenomics further as March reaches a close. The upshot remains that market-wide expectations of a price rally prevail. Top Analyst Says SHIB Price Rally To $0.000020 Possible Simultaneously, top market analyst Ali Martinez has recently posted on X, revealing that a $0.000020 price target for SHIB price looms. The meme coin’s price is currently holding above the critical support of $0.000013. A surge in buying pressure amid broader optimistic developments could fuel a price rally to $0.000020, which is up over 50% from the current price level. Source: Ali Charts, X However, Shiba Inu price today traded at $0.00001296, down nearly 2% in the past 24 hours. The dog-themed crypto bottomed and peaked at $0.00001295 and $0.00001367 intraday. Traders and investors eagerly await an upswing as the impact of the constant SHIB burn rate surges. Simultaneously, market-wide speculations of SHIB being included in the U.S. crypto stockpile also persist. Although there is no official confirmation on the matter yet, market sentiments are brimming with optimism amid pro-crypto developments in the U.S. The recent announcement of a BTC strategic reserve, crypto stockpile, and the conclusion of a White House crypto summit has left the market abuzz. Nevertheless, the crypto market is yet to see a bullish wave in light of optimistic developments unfolding across the broader industry.

While the trend remains bearish daily, it may join the ongoing dip if the price continues to face rejection. The past three days saw SUI through a small recovery from the recent dip. This recovery came after initiating another drop on Monday. Unfortunately, the overall crypto recovery was short-lived due to an overnight drop in Bitcoin’s price, and the market declined. While today marks another downturn in altcoin prices, SUI remained strong and continued to post gains daily. Although the gains have become minor after rejecting $3. It may resume bearish anytime soon following a new lower low and lower high formation on the 4-hour chart. The current rejected high might pose more threats in the future. As of now, the buying pressure has slowed down. If that continues to happen, the price may drop and lose momentum until it finds support. A hold above the previous low could trigger a potential shift. Looking at the current price actions, SUI has yet to signal a buy. It must break above the previous high before we can consider a bullish move. From a technical standpoint, the bears are still in charge. For this reason, it will likely see more drops in the future. SUI Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview Considering the bearish formation on the 4-hour chart, SUI’s next selling target would be $2 after passing through the current $2.26 support. The lower level for further drops is located at $1.6. If the price increases above the previous $3.26 high, the next line of resistance would be $3.74. Higher resistance levels for a shift are $4.24 and $5.36.

One of them is financial inclusion and individual empowerment. Does it necessarily mean that the sector demonstrates a perfect gender balance? Turns out, no. Years after the rise of the crypto industry to prominence, men and women are presented in crypto disproportionately, with men dominating both as owners and entrepreneurs. What are the gender trends in the crypto sector? Table of Contents Women as crypto owners Women in the industry Women’s impact A study by BDC Consulting reveals that over half of women who turned to crypto did so to improve their well-being. Women are more likely to hold crypto for long terms rather than be involved in trading. The study points out that the main challenges on the way into the crypto sphere are a deficit of education materials, shared family budgets, and offensive comments from male peers in the crypto-related online communities. According to Psychology Date research, only 23% of women find men fond of crypto attractive. So, let’s find out how many women are into crypto and what the specs are for working in the crypto sector as a woman. You might also like: From concept to reality: Five ways women can launch and lead in blockchain | Opinion Women as crypto owners The Global State of Crypto 2024 report by Gemini reveals that the ownership gender gap is not only real, but it got more prominent in 2024 compared to 2022. The share of women among the respondents dropped from 42% in 2022 to 31% in 2024. The report suggests that women and men are equally willing to buy crypto to hold it for the long term. In the UK, the percentage of women holding crypto for more than a year is higher than the share of the male long-term holders. It’s worth saying that although the research is called “global,” it is based on a survey of 6,000 adults from only five countries: the U.S., the UK, France, Turkey, and Singapore. It does not include respondents from many countries with populations highly involved in crypto. Disproportion indicates that crypto companies have a huge potential to increase their user base by attracting female investors. However, the companies need to find a way to appeal to women who have yet to take an interest in cryptocurrencies. Women in the industry The gender disparity is even more explicit when it comes to the share of women working in the cryptocurrency industry. The Forex Suggest study points to the severe gender imbalance among CEOs of the leading crypto companies. The study suggests that only 3 of the top 50 industry leaders are women, while the rest 47 are men. The most influential female blockchain CEOs, according to Forex Suggest, are BitOasis CEO Ola Doudin, Kaiko CEO Ambre Soubiran, and Elliptic CEO Simone Maini. None of them is based in the U.S., and none of them has a web presence comparable to the top male CEOs, which makes them not as visible as the companies led by them. This gap is really stark; however, these statistics shouldn’t discourage women from entering the crypto sector, as many women build decent careers in crypto despite the challenges. The wage gap is another hot topic. Forbes cites the 2024 Web3 Finance Compensation Report as indicating that, on average, in the web3 industry, women earn 46% less than men. This gap is much wider than the gap existing in the web2 finance sphere. The VC investments in women-founded crypto startups reached 7% in 2024, which is 100% higher than a year before but still minuscule. However, Pantera Capital offers a completely different picture. Based on its study, women in the crypto industry are paid more than their male colleagues. The company surveyed 502 respondents from the U.S. in 2024. According to Pantera Capital , in the web2 finance sphere, women get 84 cents, whereas men get a dollar. In web3 finance, men get a dollar, whereas women get $1.15. This means that the median salary of female employees is 14.67% higher than that of male employees’ compensation. The study indicates that the overall number of women in the industry is very low. Interestingly enough, entry-level positions are mostly occupied by men, while women usually serve in positions that require at least 5 years of experience. Pantera Capital’s study suggests that this can be a factor explaining the “reversed wage gap” in the crypto industry. You might also like: ‘AI will accelerate blockchain adoption:’ Interview with Pantera Capital’s Cosmo Jiang It seems that we need more time and more studies to finally learn if women are thriving from working in web3 finance or experience even more problems than women in web2. The challenges typical for any male-dominated spheres persist in the crypto sector too: pov you’re a girl in a crypto conference lol https://t.co/9SX6Fx2kls — Abril Zucchi (@abruzuc) March 3, 2025 Women’s impact We cannot underestimate the huge impact women have made in the crypto industry. Among the brightest examples of the 2020s, we can easily point out two Wyoming activists — Senator Cynthia Lummis, mainly known as the architect and advocate of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, and Caitlyn Long, a CustodiaBank CEO, a passionate enemy of Operation Choke Point 2.0. Long is a speaker whose over two decades of Wall Street experience makes her a prominent expert who can cover various financial topics and outline Bitcoin’s advantages over TradFi assets. She’s worth following on X; she gives speeches on podcasts and at conferences. Her comments shed light on multiple topics, revolving mostly around crypto regulation. Lummis was advocating for crypto and Bitcoin in the government long before it became mainstream. According to her, much has changed in the Senate, where many of her colleagues in the 2010s didn’t understand what Bitcoin was. Now, she shapes the future of cryptocurrencies in the U.S., impacting the global crypto sector, given that the U.S. has become the world’s leader in the industry. Hester Peirce brought changes to the way the SEC is working with cryptocurrency companies. In the Gary Gensler term, the crypto giants were spending resources on court battles. Crypto was treated as unregistered securities. Peirce brought a different vision, letting companies develop freely at last. These are only a few examples of many. We probably need more time to see more women owning crypto and leading crypto companies. The trend is ascending; there are challenges along the way, but the competence and dedication of women in crypto are undeniable.

Bitcoin Binance Whale To Exchange Flow Shows An Interesting Pattern In a new post on X, CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has talked about the trend in the Bitcoin Exchange Whale Inflow for the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. The “Exchange Whale Inflow” here refers to an on-chain metric that measures the total amount of the asset that the whale entities are transferring to a given centralized exchange. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Signal: $900 Million In BTC Leaves Exchanges When the value of this indicator is high, it means the whales are depositing a large number of tokens to the platform. Such a trend can be a sign that these large entities are looking to sell, which can be a bearish sign for the asset’s price. On the other hand, the metric being low suggests this cohort may be accumulating or just not planning to distribute, which can naturally be a bullish sign for BTC. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst, that shows the trend in the 30-day sum of the Bitcoin Exchange Whale Inflow for Binance over the last couple of months: As displayed in the above graph, the 30-day Bitcoin Exchange Whale Inflow for Binance has recently witnessed a sharp climb, which suggests large deposits to the platform have been on the rise. Maartunn has discovered a pattern related to what usually happens whenever the metric shows a trend like this one. From the chart, it’s visible that spikes in the indicator have come around tops in the cryptocurrency’s price. This relationship hasn’t been exact, but it’s true that BTC has witnessed some kind of peak shortly before or shortly after a strong surge in the Binance Exchange Whale Inflow. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Price Range Could Be The Bulls’ Final Defense Line, Report Says Whales are the largest of investors in the sector and Binance is the largest exchange, so it makes sense that the combined behavior related to the two would have noticeable implications for Bitcoin. Following the recent increase, the 30-day Binance Exchange Whale Inflow has reached a value of $7.3 billion, which is the highest that it has been in around three months. It now remains to be seen whether these high deposits would have a similar effect on the asset as before or not. BTC Price Bitcoin has continued to display volatility in both directions during the last few days as its price has been wobbling up and down, with neither bulls nor bears gaining control. At present, the asset is trading around $89,500.

Many cryptos are currently experiencing high volatility, and Hyperliquid token (HYPE) is among those. In this chaos, whales are still active and buying the dip, where one crypto whale alone is buying $15 million worth of HYPE tokens, signaling bullish confidence. However, the price continues to decline. Why? Let’s discuss the reasons behind this and whether a HYPE price rally will happen next or not. Whale Buys $15M Hyperliquid Token– But Hype Price Keeps Falling A few hours ago, the on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain revealed that a single whale executed a $15M buy order for the HYPE. The whale has already bought 563,238 HYPE, equivalent to $8.93M, and placed multiple limit orders between $12 and $14.63 to buy more with the remaining balance. This is an interesting scenario, especially considering HYPE price struggles and a 40% decline over the month. Such a bold purchase is a bullish indicator, revealing that the larger institutional buyers are seeing the uptrend potential. However, the crypto whale placing orders for a lower price shows it is seeing a potential decline. Hype price is currently at $15.48 after a 3% drop in the last 24 hours, confirming the whale’s plunging prediction. Now, the question is whether this decline will continue or gain bullish momentum. Why Is Hyperliquids Token Price Still Dropping? In correlation to the broader crypto market turbulence, Hyperliquid token is also struggling. Despite Donald Trump’s Crypto Summit and Bitcoin Reserve announcement, investors’ sentiments are fearful. As a result, the 24-hour volume of the token has dropped by 39.06% to $333.61M. It is an indication that market participation is decreasing. Additionally, its Open Interest has been down 2% since yesterday, showing cautious behavior by traders. With the crypto market correction , investors must confirm bullish factors before entering long positions. Interestingly, the long/short ratio on a few crypto exchanges like OKX shows traders are betting on the Hyperliquid price rise. Is a HYPE Price Rally Still Possible? With the current bearish trend, there’s a possibility that the downtrend may continue. However, they are also signs of potential rebound where whales ‘ involvement could trigger buying sentiments. Moreover, if the price continues to decline, shorts would get overcrowded, triggering a trend reversal with liquidations. Crypto analysts also reveal that Hyperliquid is nearing its bottom, with crucial support at $15.47. A bounce from there could begin an uptrend soon, hitting $2o or higher. More importantly, some believe that the HYPE price rally will reach the $200-$300 mark in the long term. $HYPE – Looks unreal and is close to a bottom. Can see this going to $200-$300 end of cycle but tbh probs way higher. Back above $21 and it’s full blown send imo. Is This The Right Time to Buy? The Hyperliquid whales are jumping on the buying, following the “buy the dip” strategy where traders take off profits on recovery. It is also a bullish signal, and a few other factors also reveal the potential recovery, especially as demand for the token has been high since the Hyperliquid EVM launch. However, there’s a possibility that the downtrend may continue for a little longer. Investors must look at the broader market conditions and Bitcoin price recovery before jumping into the trade.

A surge from the current trading level should determine the next direction. Shiba’s short-term structure appears overdue for a major retracement following a consistent decline in the past three months. However, things might get worse if the market continues to supply. Looking back, it has lost more than 60% since it initiated drops last December. While this puts the assets in an extreme oversold condition, it is now looking very weak on a daily scale. Meanwhile, it took a short break in selling since the price bounced slightly from the $0.000012 level on Tuesday. The buying appeared stalled today following a 2% drop in the last 24 hours. That could restore selling pressure if the price continues to drop. If that happens, Shiba may wash the recent gains and break down to a new low. Such a setup could position the market in a more bearish state. A push above the previous daily high could bring more increase. If the price surges higher, the asset may change trend to the upside. Right now, it is too early to consider a reversal, as Shiba remains bearish on the daily chart. A continuous price breakdown could cause serious bleeding in the future. Shiba’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview Pushing above the $0.0000152 level could fuel more increases in the coming days. The next crucial level to watch is $0.0000173, followed by $0.000019. The $0.0000116 level still provides support. If the price cracks below it, the next drop may reach the important $0.00001 level and perhaps $0.000009 in the future.

However, speculation that China could follow in the US footsteps and launch its own BTC reserve has stirred market interest. If China were to announce a Bitcoin strategic reserve, would BTC price surge to $200,000? Bitcoin price today trades at $86,221 after a slight 2.5% drop in 24 hours. Will China Launch a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve? Bitcoin price is poised for a parabolic rally if China launched a Bitcoin strategic reserve. According to CNBC, many countries including China and the Middle East are likely to adopt a Bitcoin buying strategy. It also added that there were reportedly conversations within the Chinese government to start buying BTC if the US starts accumulating the asset. China was once the world’s largest Bitcoin miner before imposing a ban in 2021. CNBC believes that it would be very easy for the country to set up a BTC reserve if they start mining BTC again for the reserve. The country could also adopt a Bitcoin strategy to evade sanctions amid an ongoing tariff war between China and the US. China has the second-highest Bitcoin holdings among countries after the US, with 195,000 BTC seized from the PlusToken crypto scam. BTC Holdings Per Country MicroStrategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor had earlier said that Trump’s move to establish a US Bitcoin reserve was “a turning point in the financial and geopolitical landscape of the 21st century.” If more nation-states start buying and holding Bitcoin it could push BTC price toward an all-time high and possibly $200K. Analyst Maps Bitcoin Path to $200K Bitcoin is currently under bearish pressure amid a lack of strong demand in the broader crypto market. However, according to analyst MerlijinTrader, Bitcoin could hit $200K this year if it follows previous patterns. In his Bitcoin price prediction , the analyst noted that BTC was following the same cycle as in 2017 and 2022. Bitcoin was in the early stages of this cycle despite the recent pullback. If the bullish momentum resumes, BTC price could skyrocket towards $200,000. Bitcoin Historical Performance Key Levels to Watch in Bitcoin Price Despite this bullish take, Bitcoin’s 4-hour chart shows that bearish trends are still prevalent. The RSI is fluctuating below 50, indicating that sellers are in control. However, an ascending triangle pattern suggests that bulls could regain control. For Bitcoin to resume an uptrend and retake levels above $90,000, there needs to be a surge in demand. The volume profile bars show that at the current price, many traders are not willing to buy Bitcoin, which may inhibit the price action. BTC/USD: 4-hour chart A bullish catalyst is needed to aid a Bitcoin price rally past the $90,000 psychological level. Plans for a Bitcoin reserve by the US, China, and other countries could aid this bull run, but the short-term sentiment remains weak.

In a new thread, crypto strategist Jamie Coutts tells his 36,000 followers on the social media platform X that a recent move in the US Dollar Index (DXY) has historically predated a rally for the flagship digital asset. “When looking at this recent move in the DXY through a historical lens, it’s challenging to be anything but bullish. I ran a signal screen for three-day negative moves of more than -2% and -2.5% and found they have all occurred at Bitcoin bear market troughs (inflection points) or mid-cycle bull markets (trend continuations). As always with Bitcoin, the statistical significance of medium-term signals is severely constrained by dataset history (not enough), but this is an objective data point to keep in mind.” According to Coutts, in 2013, there were eight occasions when the DXY declined by at least 2.5%. BTC went up each time afterward with an average return of 37% in 90 days. When looking at when the DXY declined less than 2% during the same time frame, the data shows 18 instances, 17 of which saw BTC climbing afterward with an average return of 31.6% in 90 days. Source: Jamie Coutts/X Coutts goes on to say that the stage is set for BTC to skyrocket in a couple of months. “This week had it all. The DXY saw its 4th largest negative three-day move – massively liquidity-positive. Just as Bitcoin nuked and had its worst Feb in a decade. Meanwhile, in altcoin land, the Top 200 crypto index puked one more time. The chart shows that 365 days of New Lows hit 47%, a hallmark of capitulation in a bull cycle. The stage is set for a new all-time high in Bitcoin and Top 200 aggregate market cap by May.” Source: Jamie Coutts/X Bitcoin is trading for $87,881 at time of writing, a fractional increase on the day.

The Highest Official Makes the Final Statement,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/will-the-us-sell-its-gold-and-buy-bitcoin-the-highest-official-makes-the-final-statement/,"White House Crypto Chief David Sacks confirmed today that the Trump administration is not yet in talks to sell government gold reserves to acquire more Bitcoin. However, key federal departments are set to explore budget-neutral strategies to expand the newly announced Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. “There hasn’t been any talk about that,” Sacks said of speculation that the government could liquidate gold to support Bitcoin assets. “I see people speculating about that online.” Sacks noted that any decisions regarding such financial maneuvers would fall to the Treasury Secretary and the Commerce Secretary. “Ultimately, it will be up to the Treasury Secretary and the Commerce Secretary to determine whether there are budget-neutral ways to add to our Bitcoin Reserve,” he said, adding, “But we haven’t had any discussions yet about what those might be.” Related News: BTC Wallet of Illegal Marketplace Holding Huge Amount of Bitcoin Wakes Up After 9 Years - What's Happening? The announcement comes after President Donald Trump issued an executive order on Thursday formally establishing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The initiative combines approximately 200,000 BTC (worth around $17 billion at current market prices) that the U.S. government has obtained through criminal and civil seizures. According to the decision, the Departments of Treasury and Commerce “shall develop strategies to acquire additional Government BTC, provided that such strategies are budget-neutral and do not impose additional costs on United States taxpayers.” Because new allocations of taxpayer funds often require congressional approval, budget neutrality is a crucial factor for the administration, both in terms of public perception and legal considerations. The administration has also made a clear distinction between Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. A senior White House official told reporters that Bitcoin “deserves special treatment” compared to altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, XRP and Cardano because of its security, decentralization and lack of an issuing entity. *This is not investment advice.

In particular, a handful of promising tokens are making waves due to their innovative solutions and growth potential.

Whether you’re looking for the best crypto presale to buy for 2025 or just looking to keep up with the latest trends, understanding these coins and their recent developments is essential. This article will explore the latest developments surrounding these three cryptos, focusing on how they compare in terms of growth, technology, and future potential. 1. Qubetics: Interoperability and Innovation in DeFi Qubetics ($TICS) is quickly gaining traction as a solution to the complex challenges of tokenizing real-world assets and offering scalable DeFi solutions. Unlike traditional blockchain projects, Qubetics focuses on enhancing interoperability across various platforms, making it easier for businesses, professionals, and individuals to use decentralized finance effectively.

Litecoin (LTC): Volatility and ETF Rumors Stir Investor Interest Litecoin (LTC) has experienced notable fluctuations recently, with a significant 12.36% drop in its price in just 24 hours. This decline has raised concerns among investors, as it points to the volatility of Litecoin’s price in the short term. However, despite these challenges, Litecoin has also seen some positive news. Rumors have emerged about the possibility of Litecoin being included in an exchange-traded fund (ETF), which has led to a brief surge in its price. While such news has sparked excitement in the community, the potential approval of an ETF remains speculative, and investors will need to wait for official confirmation. If the ETF rumors prove true, it could significantly enhance Litecoin’s presence in the market, especially in the mainstream financial world. Terra Classic (LUNC): Struggling Amidst Market Volatility Terra Classic (LUNC) has faced a challenging period, with its price dropping over 10% in the past week. This downturn is attributed to various factors such as large-scale wallet movements, increased exchange transfers, and broader market instability, which have led to growing investor uncertainty. Despite these price struggles, Terra Classic continues to implement measures aimed at boosting its value. One such initiative is the ongoing token burn mechanism, particularly through exchanges like Binance. In its latest round, Binance burned 1.7 billion LUNC tokens, valued at around $233,156. This effort is part of a broader community-driven plan to reduce the token’s circulating supply and potentially increase its price over time.

If you’re looking for a fresh, innovative approach to decentralized finance, Qubetics stands out with its robust tokenization and blockchain interoperability solutions. On the other hand, Litecoin remains a solid choice for those seeking stability and faster transactions, while Terra Classic offers an opportunity for those looking for an established coin with a resurgence in the making.

A few weeks later, it gained over 4 million followers on X (formerly Twitter). PI’s price may experience volatility if Binance lists the token, as the community overwhelmingly voted in favor of it. The Latest Developments Pi Network has completed some serious achievements over the past few weeks. Perhaps the most important one is the launch of the Open Network, which occurred on February 20. The development made the PI token publicly accessible and enabled exchanges to list it. Among the first to embrace it were Bitget, OKX, MEXC, and others. The asset’s price experienced huge turbulence during its first trading days, hovering between $0.65 and an all-time high of almost $3 on February 27. Currently, PI trades at roughly $1.80 (per CoinGecko’s data). The aforementioned milestone has potentially increased the project’s popularity. As CryptoPotato reported , Pi Network’s followers base on X (formerly Twitter) has surged past four million. Thus, it surpassed Shiba Inu (3.9 million subscribers) and Ethereum (3.7 million followers). Despite the progress, the project remains quite controversial, with some industry participants describing it as a scam. Meanwhile, many users still have not completed Know-Your-Customer (KYC) procedures and migrated to the mainnet. The team previously set February 28 as a deadline for these efforts, but as usual, it extended the date. Last week, it moved the Grace Period to March 14. “This extension especially helps Pioneers who have recently returned and want to reengage with the network now that Open Network is live, upholding Pi’s core objectives of inclusivity and fairness. Submit your KYC application and complete your Mainnet Checklist by 8:00 am UTC on March 14, 2025 , to avoid any forfeiture,” the disclosure reads. Waiting for Binance’s Move The price of PI has recently stabilized at around $1.80, but it may soon experience a new bout of turbulence. One factor that can trigger substantial volatility is Binance’s decision to list the token on its platform. Last month, the world’s biggest crypto exchange held a community vote to determine whether its users would want to see the token available for trading. The results became official on February 27, with over 86% of the voters clicking the “yes” option. Despite the overwhelming support, Binance has remained silent on the matter. Such a listing would increase PI’s liquidity and boost its accessibility. This, in turn, could spark an upward pressure for the valuation.

A lesson from Hideo Kojima,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/why-is-pc-gaming-so-expensive-hideo-kojima/,"PC gaming has its perks, but the very advantages that computers have over the current-gen consoles are sadly also their downfall. It has become excruciatingly painful for people to go deeper into their pockets to buy rigs that make today’s games at the least playable. Why? Because publishers do not have the PC in mind when developing games. The price of a “good” gaming PC by most experts’ standards, say, for example Linus Sebastian, feels less like a premium and more like a penalty. An Nvidia RTX 5090 GPU alone costs almost three times more than a PS5 or Xbox Series X|S, but what do you get for your money? Bugs, bugs, bugs. PC Games demand powerful and expensive hardware, and I know exactly who to blame for that; game devs. But I’m certainly not pointing fingers at all of them, because some, like Japanese programmer Hideo Kojima, know how important every community is. Gaming studios need to do better for PC Kojima, under his 2015-founded Kojima Productions banner, has shown that PC ports don’t have to be second-class citizens. If you want to know how bad games run today, Metal Gear Solid 5 is almost a decade old, and it still beats several titles released today. A mere Intel Core i7-4600M CPU, 2 cores, 8GB RAM, 2.90GHz clock speed, with an Intel HD 4600 integrated GPU, runs MGSV on medium settings and clocks 35 frames per second (FPS) for its 1% lows. This isn’t magic. It’s just good game optimization. yeah metal gear solid 5 rocks pic.twitter.com/Q6dKMKLOk0 — max | playing mgsv (@silenthills_exe) February 19, 2025 We could also mention Death Stranding , which is lauded for running smoothly on all current-gen consoles and the PC. All you need is an RTX 3090. Contrast that to something like the February 28-released Monster Hunter Wilds , where even recommended specs churn out sluggish frame rates and muddy graphics at 30 FPS. Why are developers making such abysmal titles? They simply table the bare minimum for whatever reason and expect hardware to do the rest. The black tax of high-end rigs The cost of PC gaming isn’t just about the upfront hit to your wallet, building a tower with an RTX 4080 or Ryzen 9 will always be pricey, but that’s always been the deal, pay more, get more, isn’t it? Apparently not. Consoles can lock you into fixed hardware for a decade, while PCs let you upgrade, tweak, and play around till you find what fits your expectations. Yet, gaming on computers somewhat feels duller, and this is why. Console games are built to run on one spec, optimized to squeeze every drop of power and operational capabilities from that box. PC games are often console ports slapped onto Steam with little regard for when one gamers hardware is different from another’s. Sure, a $5,000 tower will easily hit 60 FPS, but not everyone has that kind of money to spend on video games. I could also partly blame streamers for this; they show us gameplays rendered on the best of what PCs have to offer, but the average gamer can only afford so much. It costs $1000-$1500 to get a pc equivalent of a PS5 pic.twitter.com/WQc2SAIdJI — AstroCyborg (@AstroCyborg) August 25, 2024 Game development 101 is a concept that seems to be lost after 7 decades of video games. It’s not just about what a PS5, Xbox, or PC can do; it’s about making good gameplay, then the visuals come later. Kojima’s team don’t just port games, they optimize them so well that everyone in the industry can have fun. Love shines on consoles, and PC gets a big piece of the cake too. Upscaling: What could bring the industry to its knees I have a message from an oracle, the industry’s got a dirty secret: it’s now hooked on shortcuts in the name of artificial intelligence upscaling. What good is a 4K gaming experience if the groundwork done on the game is half-baked? Nvidia’s Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) and AMD’s FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) were made to boost frame rates by rendering at lower resolutions and letting algorithms fill the gaps, not to make up what graphical flaws a game has. DLSS/FSR and Frame generation has been a disaster for the PC community https://t.co/oaVTJdIR2q — 𝕿𝖍𝖊 𝕳𝖊𝖗𝖗𝖘𝖈𝖍𝖊𝖗 𝖔𝖋 𝕸𝖊𝖉𝖎𝖈𝖎𝖓𝖊 🩺 (@Papa_Kutz) March 2, 2025 I am not saying fake frames are the problem, 60 FPS is 60 FPS, and it’s generally “good for the soul” if upscaling technology makes our experiences better. But if the base game’s a mess, then upscaling is as good as useless. Spending $1,999 on a GPU to get pixelated edges, blurry smears, and distortions that make 120 FPS feel like 10 FPS could make anyone’s blood boil. Devs seem to think “good enough” visuals plus AI magic equals a finished product; it doesn’t have to play well; it just has to look good. Maybe President Trump needs to sign an executive order banning games that cap at 30 FPS and leave the rest to upscaling. Publishers might listen to everyone for once. Wilds is peak but BRO I CANNOT SEE Fix it Capcom please 🙏 😢 😭 This is 7950x3d and 4090 pic.twitter.com/9i4bAsHYAi — Orsus (@Orsusgaming) March 4, 2025 To quote one gaming community member on X, please, let’s stop pretending like fake frames are the solution to anything. Take your time and release good games, we’ll wait Too many devs churn out games to hit quarterly targets, not because they want us to play good titles. They lean so much on upscaling to mask lazy programming and laggy frame rates, banking on your $1,500 GPU to pick up the slack, and if you don’t have one, sorry, I guess? If PC gaming costs more—considering the hardware and the $70 game price tag—it should definitely deliver more than consoles. Not frustration. Not Patches. Not excuses. Just watched this, it's actually a very fair video. I obviously disagree and think that Wilds looks fucking amazing, but NO game should have system requirements that require frame generation and upscaling pic.twitter.com/QcDwnqlxTl — Lutyrannus (@lutyrannus) February 8, 2025 Call Kojima’s output slow, say two games in a decade under his own studio is unacceptable, but I believe I speak for everyone when I say quality will always trump quantity, even if the price to pay is high. We need more creators who value every community who see PC gamers not as tech guinea pigs but as players who deserve their money’s worth. Take all the time you need and come up with a game that will make us not think twice about forgoing sleep on the launch date. Our community is patient; we waited 12 years for Grand Theft Auto VI .

The reverse coin placement for MUTM operates at $0.015 in its present second marketing phase while the total presale exceeds $2.4 million and about 4,500 people possess these tokens. This DeFi project offers more than just a token since it functions as an interconnected financial structure that delivers genuine utility as well as lasting development prospects. Early investors should consider MUTM because its innovative lending model and automatic buy pressure system creates potential for identical XRP market performance. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Momentum The second phase of Mutuum Finance ’s presale continues by selling its tokens at $0.015 each. The current phase of Mutuum Finance receives notable interest among investors who could benefit from a 33% market price boost at $0.02 in the upcoming period. People who purchase tokens at present receive two advantages from the presale launch protocol: they can access a discount of 400% and benefit from rewards provided to early participants. The planned price structure of MUTM repeats the trading patterns from XRP’s initial expansion stage where it increased by more than 1000% within thirty days. Mutuum Finance’s successful presale demonstrates continuous growing interest from investors. The existing selling phase for MUTM tokens shows equally robust demand as the previous phase did before it reached completion. Users are rapidly investing in the project because they find its special token economics system and financial returns tempting. The upcoming price increase will soon create an opportunity window which will shut shortly for acquiring MUTM at its present low cost. Real Utility and Long-Term Growth The foundation of Mutuum Finance stands apart from speculative tokens because it uses genuine financial applications. The decentralized lending and borrowing system in the platform lets users gain passive income through their liquid assets. The platform presents mtTokens as digital tokens that demonstrate deposits while simultaneously accumulating interest until maturity. The system creates mtETH from deposited ETH thus extending its utility to multiple DeFi platforms. The platform achieves stability while minimizing risks because of its overcollateralized lending model. The lending agreement mandates borrowers to submit assets exceeding the loan sum which enhances safety for both the lender and borrower against default scenarios. Mutuum Finance enables users to establish negotiations about loan terms through its peer-to-peer lending platform Meme coins obtain better borrowing access through Mutuum Finance because the platform provides lending flexibility to participants. The purchase distribution model represents a major advantage of Mutuum Finance platform operations. The platform uses its revenue to acquire MUTM tokens from market exchanges before distributing them to holders of mtToken. The continuous purchasing and accumulating of MUTM tokens fuels the growth of both price and stakeholder incentives. The platform design maintains MUTM market demand by continuously purchasing from the market which serves the dual purpose of benefiting the MUTM token value and MUTM token holders. Projected ROI and Future Potential Mutuum Finance established its token economic system with sustainability as the main design objective. Early purchasers of MUTM at $0.06 could experience a 400% profit when the project launches. The prospective value extends far beyond this point. Professional analysts predict MUTM will exceed $1.50 dollars after launch while delivering up to 9,900% profit on current presale investments. Analysts made the ROI projection by evaluating Mutuum Finance’s user growth rate alongside its progressive features against DeFi market expansion. The project provides both new and existing investors with a $100,000 reward opportunity through prize giveaways that grant early participants access to $10,000 winner positions. This promotional effort has succeeded in driving additional attention through its time-sensitive nature which helps investors feel a sense of urgency. Mutuum Finance establishes itself as a market leader in decentralized finance through its strong real-world utility and successful presale run as well as its attractive growth opportunities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands as a tokenized fundraising platform that operates as a revolutionary DeFi initiative proposing to achieve identical success as Ripple (XRP). During the token’s second presale phase MUTM investors can purchase the tokens at $0.015 to gain from the upcoming growth of the project. The innovative lending approach combined with the buy-for-distribution system and calculated returns in MUTM positions the company for market leadership throughout the next 5 years.

However, despite the recently volatile move, experts remain optimistic about the long-term trajectory of the coin. A recent analysis suggests that the crypto could mirror its explosive 2017-2018 rally, which saw the coin skyrocket by over 700%. If history repeats, Ripple’s native asset could see a massive price surge, potentially reaching double-digit valuations. XRP Price Target: Can It Repeat 700% Rally? In a recent X post, renowned analyst EGRAG CRYPTO has highlighted two key price targets for XRP. He points to historical breakout patterns as a guide for future price action. The first target sits at $9.7, derived from the midpoint of a triangle breakout pattern. The expert notes that traders should consider taking profits gradually at $8, $9, and $10 instead of waiting for an exact peak. This strategy could help investors secure gains without missing out on price movements. Meanwhile, the second and more ambitious target is $27, based on XRP’s 2017 surge. During the 2017-18 cycle, XRP soared by 718% from a breakout of around $0.35-$0.39. Applying the same percentage gain to the current cycle’s local top of $3.4 gives a potential price point of $27 per coin. Source: EGRAG CRYPTO, X While this target looks too ambitious, this projection underscores the potential of another massive rally. Whale Activity Gains Momentum This bold prediction by EGRAG CRYPTO comes as XRP whale activity has surged significantly over the past few days. In a recent X post, expert Ali Martinez highlighted the trend, saying that the crypto’s “whale activity has been consistently rising over the past three weeks.” Source: Ali Martinez, X Notably, this indicates the growing participation of the market participants towards the XRP network. Although this could be due to the selling as well, it seems that more investors are entering the market given the recent market trends. Recently, Ripple whales moved nearly $6 billion coins, which has caught the eyes of the traders. For context, the anticipation over a Ripple Vs SEC lawsuit conclusion has fueled market sentiment lately. On the other hand, the potential launch of XRP ETF in the US has further sparked hopes among traders. Besides, Ripple’s coin also reigned supreme against top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum over the past few weeks, which indicates the growing market confidence towards the asset. What Lies Ahead For XRP Price? XRP price today was down 6% to $2.35, and its trading volume fell 13% to $8 billion. The crypto’s Futures Open Interest also fell 4% to $3.37 billion, reflecting the gloomy market sentiment. However, despite that, the experts maintained a bullish forecast for the asset. Ripple’s crypto is consolidating within a symmetrical triangle, according to analyst Ali Martinez. A breakout from this pattern could spark a 23% price move, Martinez noted in a recent post. Source: Ali Martinez, X Echoing a similar sentiment, expert CasiTrades pointed out that XRP is testing critical resistance at the $2.54 level. A breakout above this level could lead to further gains, with potential targets at $2.70 and $3.05. The expert also suggested that XRP may be in the early stages of Wave 3, a bullish pattern that could propel the price to $9.50. This target is aligned with the macro target range of $8-$13.

Every year brings new opportunities, and 2025 is no different. Among the top trending cryptos to buy, Solana, Immutable X, and the rising star Qubetics are capturing the attention of tech enthusiasts and blockchain advocates alike. As blockchain technology becomes more mainstream, these three tokens are positioning themselves as major players, each with its unique offerings and innovations. For those who’ve been keeping their eyes on the space, you’ll know that Solana has been a strong contender for the title of “the blockchain of the future.” Its lightning-fast transaction speeds and low costs have made it one of the hottest trending cryptos to buy. Immutable X, on the other hand, has carved a niche with its NFT-focused technology, offering gas-free transactions and scalability. But there’s a new contender that’s making waves: Qubetics, which is about to disrupt the industry with a groundbreaking innovation in blockchain development.

Are Cardano and FXGuys The Best Bets For The Bull Run?,https://timestabloid.com/market-green-again-are-cardano-and-fxguys-the-best-bets/,"Crypto investors have reason to cheer as the market turns positive again. After months of doubt, altcoins have strong, promising prospects, and people keep leaning toward projects ready to lead. Cardano and FX Guys are two main projects with solid bases and expanding networks. Cardano’s blockchain earns more support, while FXGuys emerges as the Top PropFi Project by offering staking, Trade2Earn, and a funding plan for trading. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Cardano’s Comeback and Its Role in the Next Rally Cardano, one of the most prominent names in crypto, returns to investors’ attention as the market grows more assertive. It follows a method based on careful study and aims for scalability. Cardano set up a system that attracts developers and institutions. As more people use decentralized applications and smart contracts, Cardano remains the defi group’s leading coin. Even though Cardano stands on solid basics, a market surge may bring fresh leaders from new fields, such as prop trading fund programs and Trade2Earn systems—two areas where FXGuys has made progress. FXGuys—The Top PropFi Project With Huge Upside Traditional DeFi projects involve staking or farming for extra coins, but the FX Guys use a new approach. They work as a firm that gets support from a broker so traders can get help with money. With their program, traders may qualify for accounts that offer up to $500,000, and they keep 80 % of what they earn once they get money. FXGuys stands apart because it combines basic DeFi rewards with real trading results. Every deal made on the platform brings users $FXG tokens through a simple reward rule. This basic cycle of awards pulls in more people and money, so FXGuys becomes more than just a token—it forms a network made for traders. Staking $FXG and Unlocking Passive Rewards Another key feature of FXGuys is the Staking program. Owners of the $FXG token lock their assets and receive a 20% share of the platform’s profit and revenue. This reward depends on the broker trade volume. If traders work more on the platform, those participating may be rewarded more. This setup shows a mix of active and steady earnings. FXGuys removes typical obstacles such as high taxes and strict KYC checks. With no charge for buying or selling, traders can change positions freely plus enjoy decentralized trading without KYC, which protects their privacy. Instant Funding, Same-Day Payouts, and Platform Flexibility Traders face a major problem when they need money fast. FXGuys removes this block by offering immediate funding at a prop firm. Once traders pass tests, they open a funded account without delay. They also take money out fast, as same-day payouts come in over 100 fiat currencies and well-known cryptocurrencies. To serve skilled proprietary traders, the FX Guys platform links with top trading systems such as MT5, Match-Trader, cTrader, and DXtrade. This approach helps traders pick familiar tools and boosts their chance of winning in the fierce field of proprietary trading. FXGuys Presale—Stage 3 Opportunity Right now, FXguys is in Stage 3 of its presale, selling the $FXG token for only $0.05. It has already gathered more than $4.5 million, which shows that investors see great promise in the platform. People who join the presale also get to use the BETA platform, which gives them a free trial of the trading system before it officially starts. This early chance lets traders and investors see how FXGuys mixes prop trading funding plans, Trade2Earn, and Staking, giving them a preview of what will happen when the platform fully opens. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Conclusion: Cardano and FXGuys—A Power Pair for the Bull Run Investors search for altcoins to beat the competition as the market shows signs of recovery. While Cardano builds its smart contract system, FXGuys steps forward as a leading project linking decentralized finance and prop trading in new ways. With features like staking, trade to earn, and fast prop trading funds, FXGuys gives both hands-off investors and active traders ways to make money. Without fees on buying or selling, without KYC in decentralized trades, and with payouts on the same day, FXGuys offers a unique deal in this rising market. With the FXGuys presale active and the platform set to launch soon, early adopters have a big chance. As Cardano plus FXGuys grow together, they might form a strong pair for the next crypto surge, giving long-term investors and day traders a reason to notice.

The market is unpredictable, and with regulatory pressures and shifting investor sentiment, both DOGE and XRP could face challenges ahead. However, amidst this uncertainty, one token stands out with the potential for explosive growth— Lightchain AI (LCAI). With its innovative combination of blockchain technology and artificial intelligence, Lightchain AI is attracting significant attention from investors looking for the next big opportunity. As the presale continues to gain traction, priced at $0.006 with over $17 million raised so far, Lightchain AI could experience a surge, possibly jumping as much as 9,900% by 2025. In this article, we’ll explore the factors driving this potential growth and why LCAI could outperform many other altcoins. Could Trader Predictions Hold True? Trader predictions about the potential meltdown of Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ripple (XRP) by mid-2025 have sparked significant debate within the crypto community. While these warnings are based on market trends, regulatory developments, and investor sentiment, it's important to consider the broader context. Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, and predictions often depend on a variety of external factors, including global economic conditions and technological advancements. For Lightchain AI, its unique positioning in the rapidly expanding sectors of AI and blockchain gives it a distinct advantage. The potential for a 9,900% increase hinges on continued technological development, adoption by key industries, and successful ecosystem integration. If the market responds favorably, and Lightchain AI continues to innovate, trader predictions about its remarkable growth could indeed hold true. Can LCAI Overcome Regulatory Pressures? As regulatory pressures continue to shape the cryptocurrency landscape, Lightchain AI (LCAI) will need to navigate challenges to maintain its growth trajectory. Governments around the world are increasingly focused on tightening regulations for digital assets, which could impact token adoption and market dynamics. However, Lightchain AI's decentralized approach, coupled with its emphasis on privacy and security, positions it well to adapt to evolving regulatory standards. By integrating blockchain technology with AI, LCAI has the potential to offer solutions that align with regulatory frameworks aimed at ensuring transparency and compliance. As the platform matures, its focus on decentralization and community-driven governance could further help mitigate regulatory risks, enabling LCAI to thrive amidst challenges. Whether LCAI can overcome these pressures will depend on its ability to stay ahead of regulatory changes and continue attracting adoption in a compliant manner. How Will Investor Sentiment Impact LCAI? Investor sentiment will play a crucial role in determining the future performance of Lightchain AI (LCAI). As the cryptocurrency market is heavily influenced by investor emotions and perceptions, a shift in sentiment could either propel or hinder LCAI’s growth. Positive sentiment driven by excitement around its innovative integration of artificial intelligence and blockchain could lead to increased demand, boosting its price. However, negative sentiment—possibly triggered by market uncertainty or regulatory challenges—could result in short-term volatility. Given that LCAI is still in its presale phase, early investor confidence will be key to establishing a strong foundation. If LCAI can generate excitement through its technological advancements and successful adoption, it could attract long-term investors, creating sustained momentum for its price increase. Ultimately, investor sentiment will help determine whether LCAI can meet its growth potential in the coming years.

The U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have just experienced a jolt. Data reveals a significant net outflow of $409.48 million on March 7th. This marks the fifth consecutive day of investors pulling back from these newly launched investment vehicles. Is this a temporary blip or a sign of deeper shifts in the crypto landscape? Let’s dive into the details and uncover what’s happening in the dynamic world of digital assets. What’s Behind the Recent Bitcoin ETF Outflows? The numbers don’t lie. A substantial Bitcoin ETF outflow is underway. According to data meticulously tracked by Trader T on X, the collective net outflow from these U.S. based funds hit a notable $409.48 million on March 7th. This isn’t just a one-off event; it’s a trend. We’re now looking at five straight days of net outflows, raising eyebrows and prompting questions across the crypto community. Let’s break down where these outflows are concentrated: ARK Invest’s ARKB: Bearing the brunt of the withdrawals, ARKB saw a hefty $160.03 million exit. Fidelity’s FBTC: Following closely behind, FBTC experienced a significant $154.89 million outflow. BlackRock’s IBIT: Even the giant BlackRock wasn’t immune, with IBIT recording a $40.12 million net outflow. Grayscale’s GBTC: Continuing its trend, GBTC saw another $36.46 million leave its coffers. Bitwise’s BITB: BITB also experienced outflows, totaling $18.60 million. Interestingly, amidst this sea of red, there was one green island. VanEck’s HODL ETF managed to buck the trend, attracting a net inflow of $0.62 million. The remaining ETFs reported no change in their holdings, suggesting a concentrated outflow from specific funds rather than a blanket exit from all. Spot Bitcoin ETF Performance: A Deeper Dive To truly understand the significance of these spot Bitcoin ETF outflows, we need to look beyond just the numbers. These ETFs were launched with immense hype and fanfare, promising to open up Bitcoin investment to a wider audience. For a while, they delivered, attracting billions in assets and driving up Bitcoin prices. So, what’s shifted? Here’s a closer look at the performance and potential factors influencing each ETF’s outflow: ETF Net Outflow (March 7) Possible Contributing Factors ARKB $160.03 Million Potentially profit-taking after strong initial gains; investor sentiment shift. FBTC $154.89 Million Similar to ARKB, could be profit-taking or broader market concerns. IBIT $40.12 Million While smaller compared to ARKB and FBTC, still noteworthy; might indicate some broader institutional pullback. GBTC $36.46 Million Continued outflow trend from pre-existing holders seeking lower fees in other ETFs. BITB $18.60 Million Part of the overall outflow trend; potentially reflecting general market sentiment. HODL +$0.62 Million Outlier; could be due to specific fund strategies or investor base. It’s crucial to remember that the Spot Bitcoin ETF market is still relatively new. Volatility and shifts in investor sentiment are to be expected. The initial surge of inflows might have been partially driven by pent-up demand, which is now normalizing. Impact on Bitcoin Price: Cause for Concern? The question on everyone’s mind is: how will these ETF outflows impact the Bitcoin price ? Historically, significant ETF inflows were seen as a bullish signal, contributing to price appreciation. Conversely, outflows could exert downward pressure. However, the relationship isn’t always linear. Here’s what to consider regarding the potential impact on Bitcoin’s price: Short-term Price Fluctuations: Large outflows can trigger short-term sell-offs as ETF providers liquidate Bitcoin to meet redemption requests. Market Sentiment: Sustained outflows can negatively impact market sentiment, leading to further selling pressure. Broader Market Context: Bitcoin’s price is influenced by numerous factors beyond ETF flows, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, and overall risk appetite. Long-term Outlook: While short-term impacts are possible, the long-term trajectory of Bitcoin and its price will depend on broader adoption, technological advancements, and its role in the global financial system. It’s important not to overreact to short-term fluctuations. The crypto market is known for its volatility, and corrections are a natural part of the cycle. However, monitoring the trend of ETF flows remains crucial for gauging institutional sentiment towards Bitcoin. Navigating the Crypto Market Amidst ETF Volatility The recent crypto market activity, highlighted by these ETF outflows, serves as a reminder of the inherent volatility and dynamism of the digital asset space. So, how should investors navigate these uncertain waters? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on ETF flow data and broader market indicators. Platforms like Coinglass and others provide up-to-date information. Diversify: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your crypto portfolio and consider asset allocation strategies. Manage Risk: Understand your risk tolerance and invest accordingly. Crypto investments carry inherent risks, and it’s crucial to manage your exposure. Long-Term Perspective: Avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term market swings. Focus on the long-term potential of blockchain technology and digital assets. Seek Professional Advice: If you’re unsure about navigating the crypto market, consult with a qualified financial advisor who understands digital assets. Conclusion: A Temporary Setback or a Shifting Tide? The $409.48 million Bitcoin ETF outflow on March 7th is undoubtedly a significant event. While it’s tempting to interpret this as a major shock and a sign of a looming bear market, it’s crucial to maintain perspective. The crypto market is inherently cyclical, and corrections are a natural part of its evolution. Whether this is a temporary setback or the beginning of a more sustained outflow trend remains to be seen. Monitoring ETF flows, Bitcoin price action, and broader market sentiment will be key to understanding the direction of the crypto market in the coming weeks and months. For now, caution and informed decision-making are the best strategies for navigating these intriguing times.

His analysis highlights a well-defined channel where Bitcoin’s RSI has historically moved between overbought and oversold levels, with previous peaks and bottoms aligning with key market movements. Based on this trend, the RSI appears to be approaching a critical area that often coincides with market tops. #BTC – RSI Monthly Time Frame If I showed you this RSI on the monthly time frame and didn't mention it was for #BTC , where do you think it will peak first?

Check out the post for reference: Link… pic.twitter.com/lqs9geZvQM — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) March 7, 2025 Egrag Crypto raises the question about where Bitcoin’s RSI might peak next, implying that historical patterns suggest another major upward move before a correction. The chart he shared marks previous RSI tops and bottoms, reinforcing that Bitcoin’s price cycles have followed predictable momentum shifts over time. Understanding the “Wall of Worry” Concept A key theme in his analysis is “Climbing the Wall of Worry”, a term that describes how markets can continue rising despite concerns, hesitation, and fear among investors. Many traders, especially those newer to the market, struggle with uncertainty and become cautious when prices increase rapidly. However, this psychological barrier often prevents investors from capitalizing on bull market opportunities, as price action tends to move higher despite lingering doubts. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have experienced strong bullish momentum even when sentiment appears mixed. This pattern occurs because technical indicators and underlying market fundamentals drive demand, even when skepticism remains high. Recognizing this behavior is crucial for traders trying to navigate market cycles effectively.

The broader market appears to be gearing up for another move, reinforcing that the overall trend remains bullish despite short-term volatility. At the same time, he stresses the importance of strategic profit-taking. While the market may still have room for growth, past cycles show that parabolic moves often lead to eventual corrections. Investors are encouraged to approach the market with optimism and caution, ensuring they secure profits rather than attempting to time the absolute peak. Market Implications and Final Thoughts Egrag Crypto’s RSI analysis points to a potential blow-off top, a phase where prices rise sharply before undergoing a significant correction. If Bitcoin follows its historical RSI trends, it could be approaching a pivotal moment in the market cycle. While this suggests further upside potential, it also highlights the importance of understanding market patterns and making informed decisions. With Bitcoin and altcoins showing signs of strength, traders and investors will closely watch whether the RSI behaves similarly to past cycles, potentially leading to another major rally before a correction.

Priced at just $0.006 and having already raised $17.1 million in its presale, Lightchain AI is quickly gaining traction with its unique combination of blockchain technology and artificial intelligence. Alongside more established players like Ethereum (ETH) and Toncoin (TON), Lightchain AI offers scalable, decentralized solutions with real-world applications, positioning it for explosive growth. Investors are flocking to secure their tokens, anticipating that Lightchain AI could outperform even the biggest names in crypto as Q1 2025 unfolds. 3 Cryptos Set for Surge in Q1 2025 As we progress through the first quarter of 2025, three cryptocurrencies are poised for significant growth: Ethereum (ETH), Toncoin (TON), and Lightchain AI (LCAI). Ethereum (ETH)- Ethereum continues to lead the blockchain space, with predictions suggesting it could reach around $5,000 to $6,000 by early 2025. This anticipated rise is driven by the increasing adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), as well as institutional interest and staking rewards. The development of Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism is also enhancing Ethereum's scalability and performance. Toncoin (TON)- Toncoin has garnered attention due to its integration with Telegram, significantly expanding its user base. Analysts project that TON could reach approximately $12.31 by March 16, 2025, marking a substantial increase from its current value. This growth is attributed to Toncoin's expanding ecosystem, strategic partnerships, and the rising adoption of decentralized applications within its network. Lightchain AI (LCAI)- Lightchain AI is an emerging project that combines artificial intelligence with blockchain technology to create a decentralized platform for AI services. The project has raised over $17.1 million in its presale, indicating strong investor interest. Predictions suggest that LCAI could reach $0.15–$0.20 by Q1 2025, with further potential depending on adoption and ecosystem development. While these projections are optimistic, it's essential to conduct thorough research and consider market volatility before making investment decisions. Why One of These Coins Could Surprise Investors Lightchain AI emerges as an intriguing opportunity for investors, standing apart from established options like Ethereum and Toncoin. While Ethereum shines with its smart contract capabilities and Toncoin focuses on decentralized solutions, Lightchain AI uniquely blends artificial intelligence with blockchain to deliver practical applications across various industries. Its innovative use of Layer 2 solutions and DAG structures ensures high-speed, scalable performance, making it ideal for handling complex AI processes with ease. The platform also emphasizes decentralized governance, empowering the community to shape its direction and ensuring sustained engagement. With a robust tokenomics model and a transparent roadmap, Lightchain AI is positioned to achieve rapid growth, surpassing traditional blockchain platforms in both innovation and scalability. For investors seeking the next major breakthrough in crypto, Lightchain AI presents a compelling case. Invest Now in Lightchain AI and Secure Your Potential Gains As we look ahead to Q1 2025, Ethereum, Toncoin, and Lightchain AI are set for significant surges. While Ethereum and Toncoin have established themselves as strong players in the crypto market, Lightchain AI presents a unique opportunity for explosive growth. Its combination of blockchain and AI technology positions it as a potential game-changer in the industry. Investors looking to secure their potential gains should consider adding Lightchain AI to their portfolio before its value potentially skyrockets. Keep an eye on this emerging project as it continues to make waves in the crypto space. So, don't hesitate, invest now!

In their 102-page brief, they argued that he was never presumed innocent and faced undue bias from prosecutors, the judge, and the media. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : FTX and Alameda Unstake $431M in Solana – Is a Bigger Crash Coming? , SBF’s family, including his parents Joe Bankman and Barbara Fried, are consulting with a lawyer connected to Trump’s past campaigns to help secure a pardon. Although they haven’t contacted Trump directly, they hope his transactional approach to clemency will work in their favor. However, the clemency effort has not gained much momentum, and it’s unclear if it will succeed. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

A total of 2.2 million Rite Aid customers will share a $6.8 million settlement after hackers from the RansomHub group stole a trove of personal information over the summer. The hackers successfully impersonated a Rite Aid employee and accessed the company’s systems to extract information. The breach exposed names, addresses, birth dates and IDs tied to purchases from June of 2017 to July of 2018. A federal judge has now granted preliminary approval to the settlement, and customers can claim up to $10,000 for documented losses. Rite Aid, which exited bankruptcy in September 2024, says it’s boosting its digital security and notifying affected individuals.

Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President signed an executive order to establish a Crypto Strategic Reserve. But what really caught everyone off guard was the inclusion of XRP, Solana, and Cardano alongside Bitcoin. The move sparked excitement in the market, with XRP surging 8.6% in just a week. However, the rally didn’t last long. In the past 24 hours, XRP has dropped over 5.2%, raising concerns about whether the initial hype is fading. Is Trump’s plan really a game-changer for XRP, or was it just a temporary boost? Let’s break it down. XRP’s Price Swings After the Announcement Despite the recent dip, XRP has seen strong gains this week. On March 1, the token was trading at $2.14, and within just two days, it surged over 35.5%, briefly crossing the $3 mark on March 2. However, this rally didn’t last long. By March 3, XRP had fallen to $2.38. The market then attempted a recovery, gaining 8.82% between March 4 and 6, but in the last 24 hours, it has dropped another 4.9%. This suggests that while Trump’s announcement initially boosted the market, the effect was short-lived. US Economic Data Adds to Market Uncertainty Recent economic reports from the US have added to the uncertainty in financial markets. The unemployment rate rose from 4% to 4.1%, despite forecasts predicting it would stay the same. The non-farm payrolls index increased from 125K to 151K, but this was well below the expected 160K. These numbers indicate that the US economy is under pressure. Concerns over inflation and Federal Reserve policies have also led to lower risk appetite among crypto investors. Can Trump’s Crypto Reserve Plan Pass Congress? Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou , managing director of global market strategy at JPMorgan, believes Trump’s crypto reserve proposal has less than a 50% chance of gaining congressional approval. He also noted that if the reserve does get approved, it would likely only include Bitcoin and Ethereum, making it difficult for XRP, Solana, and Cardano to be part of it. This explains why XRP’s rally was short-lived. Reports suggest that many traders took profits near the $3 level, contributing to the recent decline. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple News Today: Major XRP Update Drops – What’s Changing on the Ledger? , What’s Next for XRP? At the moment, XRP is trading at $2.35. Analysts warn that if selling pressure increases, the price could drop as low as $1.95. On the other hand, if XRP holds above $2.47 and sees strong buying volume, it could move toward $3.20. However, there is strong resistance at $2.99, which may limit further gains. The coming days will be crucial in determining XRP’s next move, as investors weigh the impact of macroeconomic conditions and political developments on the crypto market. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Solana (SOL) is trading at $167, while Cardano (ADA) maintains stability at $0.78 as of February 18, 2025. Though resilient, investors are always searching for the next high-potential asset that might match or even exceed SOL and ADA’s explosive increases. Many of these traders are now focusing on Rexas Finance (RXS), a startup with an amazing 18000% growth potential and ready to transform real-world asset tokenization. Rexas Finance (RXS): Bridging Blockchain and Real-World Assets By tokenizing real estate, commodities, and valuable collectibles, Rexas Finance is revolutionizing how investors engage with physical assets. Unlike many crypto initiatives that exist only in the digital environment, Rexas Finance offers actual value by allowing fractional ownership of real-world assets such as homes, gold, and fine art. This invention provides security and stability that some tokens sometimes lack, opening a new market for blockchain investors. Given the around $900 trillion real-world asset (RWA) market, this industry has great room for expansion. Many early Solana and Cardano users now focus on Rexas Finance, realizing this unrealized potential. It offers a rare mix of utility, innovation, and exponential upside. The RXS Viral Presale Success Rexas Finance has had an amazing presale performance. Starting in September 2024 at just $0.03, RXS’s price jumped 567% to $0.20 at its twelfth and last presale stage. Demand is still skyrocketing, with 451,655,776 tokens sold and an amazing $46,331,613 raised before its formal release at $0.25 on June 19, 2025. When RXS launches at $0.25, purchasers will receive an instant 25% return in this last stage. Still, the token’s long-term possibilities are exciting. Many early investors saw the likelihood of a price path similar to that of Solana and Cardano, which produced legendary returns. RXS appeals mostly because of its dedication to decentralization. Rexas Finance has embraced a community-driven strategy, guaranteeing fair tokenomics and avoiding significant dumping from early institutional investors, unlike many blockchain initiatives that depend on venture capital funding. This approach has produced a devoted investment base, giving the project long-term viability. Rexas Finance also underwent a thorough security audit by top blockchain security company Certik, boosting investor trust. Furthermore, the project’s Coin Market Cap and Coin Gecko listings let traders monitor real-time market performance, enhancing openness and accessibility. Click Here To Buy Rexas Finance (RXS) Presale Why Solana and Cardano Traders Are Moving to RXS Experienced crypto traders understand that maximizing returns depends on diversification. Thus, RXS is becoming an interesting investment choice at the intersection of blockchain and actual asset tokenization. For Solana and Cardano investors, RXS appeals especially because of a few elements. First, its modest entry price of $0.20 makes it easily available to a wide spectrum of investors, enabling them to build large holdings before its anticipated rise. Second, its practical value distinguishes it from speculative cryptocurrencies because it allows tokenization and flawless trade of actual assets. Market analysts also project that RXS may rise to $36 in the distant future, which offers chances for early investors to get more than 18,000% returns. The presale has already shown enormous momentum with a 567% price gain, indicating great demand and ongoing growth potential. Rexas Finance started a large $1 million RXS token giveaway to increase adoption even more. With around 1.47 million entries logged thus far, twenty lucky participants will each get $50,000 worth of RXS tokens. Besides honoring early supporters, this campaign raises awareness and attracts fresh investors. Completing tasks on the Rexas Finance website—including social media activity and referrals—interested individuals can help. Conclusion The window to guarantee RXS at its presale pricing is fast closing. Investors who act now will be positioned for notable returns before the token’s formal listing and projected price explosion, as less than 10% of the final stage remains. Blockchain technology combined with actual assets offers a revolutionary possibility; Rexas Finance is driving the change. RXS provides a great chance for those wishing to copy the early triumphs of Solana and Cardano to enter the ground floor of a possible crypto revolution. Now protect your RXS tokens and start down the path of financial innovation and expansion.

Underlining that the US government currently holds approximately $760 billion worth of gold, Kendrick said, “The next question is what could constitute budget-independent strategies, and theoretically, one could do the following: sell gold and buy Bitcoin.” This development comes after President Donald Trump’s recent executive order marked a historic shift in the federal government’s approach to digital assets by officially establishing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile. Under the order, all future Bitcoin purchases for the reserve must comply with budget-neutral financing strategies that do not impose additional burdens on American taxpayers. The directive also calls for all Bitcoin currently held by the US government to be transferred to the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, with the strict condition that none of it be sold. Beyond selling gold, Kendrick outlined additional strategies to fund the SBR without increasing government spending. One potential avenue is tapping into the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF), which has $39 billion in net assets. Repurposing the ESF, traditionally used to stabilize financial markets, for Bitcoin purchases would be “a clear change of direction,” Kendrick said. Another possibility is to integrate the Bitcoin Act of 2024, introduced by Senator Cynthia Lummis, into the funding framework. The legislation aims to allocate 200,000 BTC per year for five years. Kendrick believes that if structured correctly, the bill could be implemented in a budget-neutral manner. Related News: BREAKING: FED Chair Jerome Powell is Speaking - Here's What He Says at a Critical Crossroad While President Trump is expected to detail the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve at the White House Digital Assets Summit today, Kendrick warned that immediate policy implementation is unlikely. Kendrick pointed to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s role in formulating and executing a comprehensive acquisition strategy. “I don’t really see any of those three solutions being presented today,” Kendrick said. “Rather, given the prominence given to Bessent in the executive order, they would all require Treasury Secretary Bessent to propose something.” Kendrick also suggested that U.S. states and institutional investors, including pension funds, could follow the federal government's lead in allocating to Bitcoin. Kendrick also noted that the establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve could prompt other sovereign countries to adopt similar strategies. “I’ve written before about how the US strategic reserve, whatever it looks like, could embolden other countries,” Kendrick said. He cited Abu Dhabi’s recent purchase of a 4,700 BTC-equivalent stake in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as an example of the growing sovereign interest in Bitcoin. “Other states will certainly join in on the purchase,” he added. *This is not investment advice.

Notably, the OCC issued a landmark interpretive letter, enabling federally chartered banks to provide cryptocurrency custody, stablecoin-related services, and operate blockchain nodes without prior regulatory approval. This has sparked hopes for increased XRP adoption and growth. XRP News: OCC’s Crypto Rule to Boost Ripple Coin Adoption In a recent development, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency clarified that federally regulated banks could engage in crypto activities without prior approval. Addressing the OCC’s decision to allow banks to custody crypto and handle stablecoin activities, Acting Comptroller of the Currency Rodney E. Hood stated, “The OCC expects banks to have the same strong risk management controls in place to support novel bank activities as they do for traditional ones.” While this move is expected to alleviate pressure on banks with cryptocurrency ties, the Ripple ecosystem is anticipating a surge in XRP adoption. According to analyst Amonyx , the OCC’s announcement is a bullish development for XRP. How Will OCC Rule Impact XRPL? In addition to crypto custody and stablecoin activities, the OCC allows banks to participate in blockchain networks like the XRP Ledger (XRPL). By eliminating the need for prior approval, the OCC has significantly reduced regulatory hurdles, paving the way for banks to adopt blockchain-based solutions. Interestingly, the XRP Ledger stands out as a highly scalable and efficient blockchain, specifically designed for institutional-grade financial transactions. Thus, the recent rule could mark a milestone for the Ripple ecosystem, with more banks integrating XRPL. In addition, Ripple’s launch of its stablecoin, RLUSD, provides a seamless path to adoption, driving increased utility for XRP. It is noteworthy that the increased use of RLUSD directly translates to greater utility for XRP. This development comes following growing anticipations of the imminent settlement of the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit . OCC Rule Signals US Banks’ XRP Adoption The XRP community has been eagerly awaiting US banks’ adoption of XRP and integration of the XRPL. Significantly, the OCC’s new development is a key step towards the increased adoption of XRP and other cryptocurrencies into the mainstream finance. In addition, the community is also anticipating the launch of an XRP ETF , fueled by the SEC’s progressive stance. The American Bankers Association has expressed its support for the OCC’s new rule, acknowledging it as a positive development. In an official statement, ABA cited, “Banks have a critical role to play in the digital asset ecosystem, which has the potential to be a catalyst for change in traditional financial markets, and the OCC’s actions today are an important step toward enabling that success.” The post XRP News: How Will OCC Crypto Rule Aid Ripple Coin? appeared first on CoinGape .",24/7 Cryptocurrency News|Altcoin News|OCC|Ripple (XRP)|XRP news,EN,0,0,XRP|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|WALLET|FIAT,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-03-08 09:06:45

According to several reports, the Mission Gate founder and venture capitalist has been under trial for allegedly embezzling investment profits. The latest development comes after a court in Georgia ordered Bachiashvili’s imprisonment for his alleged crimes under his former boss, the former Georgian PM Bidzina Ivanishvili. According to reports, Bachiashvili had been given a bail of about 2.5 million GEL ($900,000), but he violated his bail conditions after he crossed the border into Armenia on March 2. After an official report by the Georgia Ministry of Internal Affairs, Judge Giorgi Gelashvili upheld the prosecution’s motion to apprehend and hold Bachiashvili in custody, noting that he violated his bail conditions, which call for stringent detention measures. Former Georgian PM’s aide enters another country According to local news station TV Pirveli, Bachiashvili has left Armenia, seemingly after his movement was discovered and reported to the judge. The local television station mentioned that he has crossed over to a third country, with the venture capitalist refusing to disclose his current location to Reuters. Bachiashvili is presently facing allegations of embezzling about 8,253 BTC, carrying out his act between 2015 and 2017. The investor was said to have invested a $5 million loan, which was obtained using Ivanishvili’s funds, into the Bitcoin mining operations at Bitfury. According to Ivanishvili, he had discussed liquidating the mined Bitcoin in the second half of 2016, following concerns over the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Reports noted that Bachiashvili repaid the loan to the issuer, the Cartu Bank owned by Ivanishvili, in August and September of 2016. A year later, he transferred about $536,900 in profits to the director of the bank NATO Khaindrava. Still, Ivanishvili maintains that he was misled by Bachiashvili about the true returns of the mining operations, noting that the mined Bitcoin was worth millions of dollars. In pursuant to that, Bachiashvili was charged under Articles 182 and 194 of the Georgian Criminal Code, which prevents misappropriation of funds belonging to another party and money laundering. Transparency International kicks against the case Before the relationship turned sour between both parties, Bachiashvili served as an aide to the former Georgian PM Ivanishvili, who is estimated to own a fortune of about $7.6 billion, or a quarter of the country’s GDP. The PM had been previously hailed by many international organizations as a thoughtful leader, with Transparency International describing him as a “real ruler.” Ivanishvili founded the Georgian Dream Party in 2012, currently serving as the party’s honorary chairman. However, Transparency International has kicked against the ongoing case, noting that it “clearly and explicitly reflect[s] Ivanishvili’s private financial interests.” The association also said that “weakness of the prosecution’s position and the lack of evidence in this case are so evident that, in any legal system based on the rule of law, such charges would not only be inconceivable but would never even reach court proceeding.” According to the NGO’s report, the position of Bachiashvili was clear: advising his boss to obtain a loan from Cartu Bank and invest the funds into Bitcoin mining . The organization mentioned that the only non-testimonial evidence in the case are documents that show details of the loan, and a recording of a telephone conversation related to the loan, where Ivanishvili told Bachiashvili to pay a higher interest to secure the loan from the bank. With those details, the NGO contends that the charges do not have both legal and factual ground, a view also held by the legal representatives of the investor, Amsterdam & Partners, based in London and Washington D.C. “The State appears to be acting in violation of the law at the behest of the capricious wishes of Ivanishvili,” he said. “It’s not credible for Ivanishvili to claim he’s owed money from an eight-year-old repaid bank loan with no evidence, and then to have the matter pursued with criminal charges instead of a civil case,” senior partner at the firm Robert Amsterdam said at the first hearing in March 2024. Meanwhile, Bachiashvili could be looking at jail time of up to 12 years if he is found guilty of the allegations, with the investors previously noting that the charges are punishment for his stance in the ongoing Russian- Ukraine conflict. While he has publicly shown support for Ukraine, it has displeased the pro-Russian Ivanishvili. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

41321741,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=138403,1741424973,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Price Prediction: What to Expect in the Future,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-price-prediction-what-to-expect-in-the-future/,"Since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin, the first and most well-known cryptocurrency in the world, has been the focus of much debate and conjecture. Bitcoin has amassed a sizable following due to its decentralized structure and potential to upend established financial systems. But because of its price volatility, it’s a highly speculative asset as well as an appealing investment. Looking ahead, forecasting the price of Bitcoin is still a difficult task that is impacted by a wide range of variables, from macroeconomic conditions and regulatory changes to market trends and technological developments. The Past Performance and Price Volatility of Bitcoin Since its inception, Bitcoin’s price has fluctuated significantly. The cryptocurrency’s value soared to over $60,000 in 2021 after trading for only cents in the early years. Although this is an impressive increase, Bitcoin has also experienced notable decreases throughout the course of its history, including dips of over 80% following prior peaks. In the cryptocurrency market, such price fluctuations are not unusual and are frequently influenced by speculation, market emotion, and outside economic variables. The cyclical nature of Bitcoin’s price fluctuations is one of its main characteristics. Historically, Bitcoin has experienced a cycle of booms and busts, with each bull run being followed by a correction. These cycles are frequently caused by news-driven enthusiasm, institutional investment, technology advancements, and changes in international financial institutions. It is yet unclear if Bitcoin will follow this trend or if a new period of price stability is approaching. Factors Affecting Bitcoin’s Forecast Price A number of past determinants of Bitcoin’s value must be taken into account in order to make an accurate prediction about its future price. These consist of: quantity and Demand: The market is made scarcer by Bitcoin’s fixed quantity of 21 million coins. If demand stays high, the limited supply puts upward pressure on the price of Bitcoin as more investors want to buy it. Institutional Adoption: Interest in Bitcoin has grown among institutional investors in recent years. Growing institutional confidence is indicated by the addition of Bitcoin to the balance sheets of businesses like Tesla, MicroStrategy, and Square. The adoption of Bitcoin by larger firms, pension funds, and more mainstream financial institutions may increase demand and drive up prices. Regulation: Bitcoin Price Prediction could be significantly impacted by regulatory actions. Around the world, governments are debating how to regulate cryptocurrencies; some are being cautious, while others are aiming for complete prohibitions. While restrictive rules could lead to large sell-offs, positive regulatory developments, like the possibility that Bitcoin could be accepted as legal cash or a store of value, could send the price skyrocketing. Technological Advancements: The blockchain technology that powers Bitcoin is always changing. Improvements like the Lightning Network, which seeks to speed up and scale Bitcoin transactions, may increase the cryptocurrency’s usefulness and, consequently, demand. However, Bitcoin’s supremacy and price could be threatened by technological problems, security flaws, or competition from more sophisticated cryptocurrencies. Global Economic Situation: Bitcoin is frequently seen as a hedge against economic instability and inflation. When central banks adopt aggressive monetary policies, like printing more money or lowering interest rates, or when the economy is unstable, Bitcoin can profit from its reputation as a “digital gold.” On the other hand, Bitcoin’s price might see negative pressure if world economies recover or if conventional investments do better. Market Sentiment: The price of cryptocurrencies is significantly influenced by sentiment. Both good and negative price fluctuations can occur quickly as a result of news reports, social media conversations, and powerful individuals like Elon Musk. Short-term fluctuations in the price of bitcoin are frequently caused by public opinion, hype, or anxiety. What to Expect from the Short-Term Price of Bitcoin Because of its volatility, short-term price predictions for Bitcoin are especially difficult. According to current patterns, the price of Bitcoin typically ranges from $25,000 to $40,000 following notable peaks. According to some observers, Bitcoin may continue to consolidate before either seeing a correction or another notable upward rise. Future regulatory rulings, technical developments, and macroeconomic news might all have an immediate impact on the price of bitcoin. The price of Bitcoin may increase if institutional investors keep purchasing, but it may fall if news breaks or global market conditions deteriorate. Although the short-term forecast for Bitcoin is uncertain, the possibility of rapid price fluctuations makes it an interesting, if dangerous, investment. The Bullish Case for Bitcoin’s Long-Term Price Outlook In the long run, there are strong arguments for why the price of Bitcoin might keep rising. First, as more investors want to expose themselves to the cryptocurrency, the restricted supply of Bitcoin—just 21 million coins will ever be mined—may lead to a significant supply-demand imbalance. More people, businesses, and even nations may start using Bitcoin as a store of value, which might lead to more price increases as its acceptability expands. Additionally, Bitcoin’s price may increase significantly if it becomes a more widely accepted reserve asset or global currency. For instance, Bitcoin may become a crucial component of the global financial system if it becomes widely used in nations with erratic currency values or in areas looking for alternatives to established banking systems. In this case, the price of Bitcoin can surpass earlier all-time highs and keep rising. What Could Cause Prices to Drop in the Bearish Case for Bitcoin? Not all analysts, meanwhile, are optimistic about the price of Bitcoin in the future. A slump may result from a number of risks. More government regulation is one of the main dangers. The price of Bitcoin may drop if governments throughout the world place strict regulations on it, such as restricting its use for transactions or levying large taxes on its holdings. Another major obstacle is competition from other cryptocurrencies. The most well-known cryptocurrency is Bitcoin, although newer technologies like Ethereum and other altcoins might provide more effective or scalable substitutes. Bitcoin may lose market share and see a decline in value if a new cryptocurrency outperforms it in terms of acceptance, technology, or usefulness. Finally, significant technological malfunctions or security lapses may also have a detrimental effect on the price of Bitcoin. Despite Bitcoin’s blockchain’s shown high level of security, any serious attack or defect might erode investor confidence and result in a price drop. Analyst Predictions for the Price of Bitcoin Bitcoin Price Prediction continues to be a source of debate among analysts and investors. According to some hopeful forecasts, Bitcoin may hit $100,000 or higher in the next years as institutional usage keeps growing and the state of the world economy favors digital assets. However, some caution that if regulatory attention grows, Bitcoin’s price may plateau or even decline because to its volatility, which might cause abrupt declines. The Future of Bitcoin and the Role of DeFi and NFTs Their connection with Bitcoin may change as the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) grow. Other platforms, including Ethereum, have become more popular for DeFi and NFTs, even though Bitcoin is usually thought of as a store of value. Integrating Bitcoin into these ecosystems might be advantageous and raise its value even more. Conclusion: The Future Price of Bitcoin Is Uncertain In the end, Bitcoin Price Prediction is still quite speculative and unpredictable. The cryptocurrency market is still in its early stages, and a variety of factors, such as shifts in regulations, developments in technology, and market sentiment, can affect the price of Bitcoin. Although there are many of reasons to think that Bitcoin’s value will keep increasing, investors must exercise caution and be ready for any downturns due to the market’s volatility. Bitcoin will probably continue to be at the center of the cryptocurrency discussion for years to come, regardless of whether it achieves new heights or encounters major obstacles. When making judgments about their Bitcoin holdings, people must, like with any investment, carry out in-depth research, carefully manage risks, and keep up with market movements.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin price prediction,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2025-03-08 09:09:33

His post illustrates how reallocating small, recurring discretionary expenses—such as Starbucks purchases—into XRP over time could lead to substantial financial growth. The analysis presented in his tweet serves as a compelling case for long-term strategic investment and the power of financial discipline. XRP will change peoples lives! Redirecting an average monthly Starbucks expenditure of $50 into XRP from 2020 to 2025 could have grown the investment to approximately $14,403, based on current XRP prices. If $50 were invested monthly into XRP from January 2020 to March 2025,… — Coach, JV (@Coachjv_) March 6, 2025 The Financial Projection Coach JV’s post begins with a bold assertion: “XRP will change people’s lives!” He then provides a detailed breakdown of a hypothetical investment scenario. According to his calculations, redirecting a monthly expenditure of $50 from Starbucks into XRP from 2020 to 2025 could have resulted in a portfolio worth approximately $14,403, assuming a current XRP price of $2.50. He explains that investing $50 monthly from January 2020 to March 2025 would total $3,050 over 61 months. Based on the average price of XRP during this period, the cumulative amount of XRP acquired would be about 5,761 tokens. At the assumed price of $2.50 per XRP, this would equate to a portfolio valued at approximately $14,403. Extending this logic further, he presents an even more striking scenario: if the same $50 per month were invested in XRP continuously from 2020 to 2030, and XRP was to reach a price of $100 by 2030, the portfolio’s value would grow to approximately $623,543. This hypothetical scenario underscores the long-term wealth-building potential of small but consistent investments in XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Broader Implication of Small Financial Choices Beyond the numerical analysis, Coach JV’s post touches on a broader financial principle—the impact of minor discretionary spending habits. He highlights that the figures provided are conservative estimates, as many individuals spend significantly more than $50 per month on non-essential items like Starbucks. His message implies that re-evaluating everyday financial decisions could lead to transformative wealth accumulation. This perspective was backed by another X user, Coach Lendy, who commented : “This is a great reminder. The little purchases we make to feed our addictions could be used to build up generational wealth for our families. It takes discipline to say NO to something that makes you feel good NOW in exchange for something that will make you feel good later!” His response emphasizes the necessity of financial discipline and the importance of prioritizing long-term financial security over short-term gratification. Evaluating the Investment Potential While Coach JV’s projections present an optimistic outlook on XRP’s future value, they are based on assumptions that may not materialize as expected. Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, and price predictions—especially long-term ones—carry inherent uncertainty. However, the underlying principle of consistent investing, often called dollar-cost averaging (DCA), is widely recognized as an effective strategy in financial markets.

As a result, the crypto market saw a downturn, with major altcoins such as XRP, ADA, and SOL, taking a hit. On the contrary investors were expecting big news to boost the market. Notably, these altcoins witnessed steeper declines than Bitcoin. Investors were excited about President Trump’s pro-crypto stance, hoping for big announcements, like a U.S. crypto reserve that would feature major altcoins. However, the summit only presented plans for stablecoin legislation by August and a commitment to lighter regulations, which didn’t generate the market boost many were expecting. Market Disappointment as No New Bitcoin Purchases Announced A key highlight of the event was Trump’s executive order to create a strategic reserve of bitcoin, along with other digital assets. The reserve will be funded with bitcoin seized by the federal government through criminal or civil forfeiture, crypto czar David Sacks shared. However, the plans disappointed some who hoped for a plan to buy more bitcoin. As a result, bitcoin’s price dropped to $86,394. Altcoin See Steeper Decline XRP dropped 3.5% in the last 24 hours, falling to $2.4 from a high of $2.98 earlier in the week, down nearly 20% from its Sunday peak following Trump’s initial reserve announcement. Cardano’s ADA fell over 5%, and Solana’s SOL dropped 4%, trading around $138 as of Asian afternoon hours Saturday. Meanwhile, Bitcoin showed more stability, trading at $86,000, down 2.5%, but still outperforming the altcoins. The White House Crypto Summit, led by Trump’s AI & Crypto Czar David Sacks, was highly anticipated after Trump’s promise to create a U.S. crypto strategic reserve with BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL, and ADA. Trump’s Truth Social posts on Sunday sparked a huge rally, with major coins surging up to 60%. However, Sacks clarified on Friday that Trump’s mention of those five cryptocurrencies was just an example, not a firm commitment, cooling down expectations. Trump Receives Praise From Industry Leaders at Crypto Summit Nevertheless, the U.S. government’s choice to hold onto its bitcoin could pave the way for other nations to follow suit, potentially sparking a wave of global institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. Trump criticized the government for selling too much of its seized bitcoin and emphasized that the U.S. should adopt a policy of never selling bitcoin. At the summit, attendees praised Trump and industry leaders for supporting crypto growth.

Meanwhile, the stock is currently 60% above its fair value, and this gap has started to shrink as investors may not realize they are overpaying. Does this mean that MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin buying strategy is backfiring? Institutional Investors Cashing Out? As per 10x Research’s analysis, MicroStrategy traded $40 billion in volume in November 2024, when Bitcoin surged past $95,000. However, the firm highlights that institutional investors likely used this opportunity to offload their positions to retail traders at inflated prices. Now, those retail buyers are facing heavy losses despite Bitcoin maintaining its price levels. #MicroStrategy Cracks as #Bitcoin Tests $90K—Is a Deeper Drop Coming? 1-16) During my time in derivatives trading at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, we observed structural demand for yield products in Asia, where interest rates tend to be relatively low. These products rely… pic.twitter.com/XS1Jk3nk2B — 10x Research (@10x_Research) March 8, 2025 Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s recent price movements indicate that the market is entering a consolidation phase. Eventually, the cryptocurrency surged 89% between September and December 2024, mainly due to expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts. However, 10x Research points out that the December rate cut was seen as hawkish, signaling that the Fed may not cut rates further anytime soon. This has kept Bitcoin in a consolidation phase, increasing the risk of a further correction if the Fed maintains its cautious stance. Bitcoin ETF Outflows Add More Pressure Another major factor weighing on Bitcoin is the significant outflows from Bitcoin ETFs. 10x Research reports that February 2025 is shaping up to be the worst month for Bitcoin ETF outflows since its launch, with $1.3 billion exiting the market. A significant portion of these ETF purchases was driven by hedge funds engaging in arbitrage strategies. As funding rates drop, these trades are unwinding, adding further selling pressure to Bitcoin and the broader market. MicroStrategy’s (MSTR) Stock Declines Despite the bitcoin price drop, MicroStrategy has continued to accumulate Bitcoin, adding $6 billion worth since December. Meanwhile, 10x Research highlights that MicroStrategy’s stock is losing its premium over its net asset value (NAV). At its peak, MicroStrategy’s NAV premium reached 3.4x, but it has since dropped to 1.6x, suggesting a fair value of $156 per share. While Bitcoin is still at similar levels as in November 2024 when MicroStrategy hit an all-time high of $453, but the stock has since dropped to $287 , reflecting its NAV compression. Bitcoin Must Hold These Support Levels Bitcoin has broken below its ascending broadening wedge formation, increasing fears of a further decline. According to 10x Research, if prices fail to reclaim the wedge, Bitcoin could test MicroStrategy’s average cost of $66,300. Technical analysis also suggests that MicroStrategy’s shares are also breaching 11-week support, adding to bearish sentiment. With a lack of bullish catalysts and sustained selling pressure from ETF holders and hedge funds, Bitcoin’s struggle at $90,000 could lead to further declines pulling MicroStrategy down with it.",News|Fintech Company,EN,0,0,BTC|ZRX|BUSINESS|RESEARCH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-08 09:27:59

Dollar Index Breakdown Sparks Optimism Among BTC Bulls,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-uptrend-soon-dollar-index-breakdown-sparks-optimism-among-btc-bulls/,"The US dollar index (DXY) is experiencing one of its largest weekly declines since 2013, fuelling optimism for a potential rally among risk-on assets, including Bitcoin (BTC). The last time the DXY saw such a sharp pullback was during the height of the FTX fiasco in November 2022, which coincided with a Bitcoin bottom. Will Bitcoin See An Uptrend? BTC is down nearly 10% over the past two weeks, largely due to the hawkish stance of the US Federal Reserve (Fed) and concerns over trade tariffs from the US against Canada, Mexico, and China. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Showing Early Signs Of Bullish Divergence? Analyst Explains Since March 3, the DXY has slid more than 3%, tumbling from 107 to 103 at the time of writing. This decline has sparked hope among cryptocurrency investors for a potential rally. Historical data supports this outlook. In addition to the $15,000 BTC bottom formed in November 2022, the DXY has experienced similar sharp declines on two other occasions – during the COVID crash in March 2020 and back in the 2015 bear market when the premier cryptocurrency traded at $250. On all three occasions when the DXY dropped more than -4 standard deviations, BTC formed a bottom followed by a trend reversal that saw the digital asset resume its bullish momentum. Crypto analyst Merlijn The Trader shared their thoughts on the DXY-BTC relationship. In an X post, the analyst noted that whenever the DXY Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has turned bearish, BTC has rallied. The analyst illustrated this with the following chart. Fellow crypto analyst Rekt Capital had a similar perspective. The analyst emphasized that BTC has likely formed a higher low after another downside deviation, which saw the cryptocurrency hit a low of $78,258 on February 28. Important To Clear The $90,000 Resistance Another crypto trader, Daan Crypto Trader, hinted that BTC may target new all-time highs (ATH) around $120,000 if it continues to consolidate near range lows. The trader explained: We’ve seen this during every consolidation this cycle where it breaks lower, fails to see continuation, retakes the range and moves higher from there. Let’s see how this one turns out. That ~$90K level remains key. Related Reading: As Bitcoin Sell Pressure Fades, Could A Local Bottom Be Forming? Analyst Explains Recent analysis from CryptoQuant supports the view that BTC may have already formed a bottom. Additionally, seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted that BTC has hit oversold levels not seen since August 2024, likely signalling a trend reversal in the short-term. That said, BTC is also facing a bearish deviation as it fills a new Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) gap, which may dampen hopes for a swift price recovery. At press time, BTC is trading at $86,870, down 3.3% in the past 24 hours.

One of the most intriguing aspects of crypto is its sense of anonymity. Bitcoin ( BTC ), for example, was created in 2008 by an unknown figure using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto , and to this day, the true identity of its inventor remains unknown. The veil of anonymity has allowed users to create distinct identities through wallet addresses, adding an extra layer of privacy and discretion to transactions. You might also like: From concept to reality: Five ways women can launch and lead in blockchain | Opinion This concept of openness and universal access is one of the core promises of digital currencies, allowing anyone with internet access to engage, regardless of their financial history or background. However, even though the ethos of crypto promotes inclusivity, the reality hasn’t always reflected this. The early days of crypto were defined by the archetype “crypto bros,” referring to a specific demographic of young, tech-savvy men who influenced the industry’s direction. Their influence extended to the design of projects, development of key protocols, and framing of the culture surrounding digital assets. However, as the industry matured and evolved, efforts were made to reflect and include more female voices. This shift helped address the imbalance between gender representation, bringing new perspectives into the industry. A 2024 study rev ealed that over 560 million cryptocurrency owners exist globally, with 61 percent identifying as male and 39 percent as female. This marks an increase from the previous year, when the global total was 420 million, with 37 percent of owners being female, signaling a positive shift. Cryptocurrency owners worldwide | Source: Triple A In response to this trend, organizations have emerged to address crypto’s gender imbalances. Conferences and events once primarily targeted toward the male-dominated demographic have changed to allow women to step into the space and take the lead. The Association for Women in Cryptocurrency, or AWC , for example, was founded in 2022 as a platform for women looking to enhance their knowledge and education in crypto. Led by Amanda Wick, AWC hosts various events, like webinars and in-person meetups, where women can learn from industry experts and connect with mentors who can guide them and help them discover new career opportunities. Recently, Binance shared that it will offer global programs exclusively for women through its Binance Academy platform in honor of International Women’s Day. The events will be held across five continents at 11 venues to help women ease their way into the industry. While women have made significant strides in the DeFi space, now accounting for 40 percent of Binance’s workforce, leadership positions have been predominantly held by men. Despite this, several women have established themselves as leaders in the space. Perianne Boring , for instance, is the founder and CEO of the blockchain advocacy group The Digital Chamber, working alongside Congress and the government to promote and regulate blockchain technology. Her leadership role has made her an advocate for adopting blockchain technologies, as she has become a well-known voice in the space discussing the future of finance. In December, President Trump also considered Boring as a potential CFTC chair. Another established female leader in the space is Joanna Liang , the founding partner of Jsquare, a tech-focused investment firm specializing in blockchain and web3. With a previous background as CIO at Digital Finance Group (DFG), a global Venture Capital firm focusing on crypto projects, Liang recently launched Jsquare’s latest fund, the Pioneer Fund. The fund has successfully raised $50 million in capital, making its first investment in the startup MinionLabs. The fund will focus on emerging technologies in the crypto space, including PayFi, real-world assets (RWAs), and consumer apps. Laura Shin is also a prominent name in crypto and is recognized as one of the first mainstream media reporters to cover cryptocurrency full-time. She is the author of the book, ‘The Cryptopians: Idealism, Greed, Lies, and the Making of the First Big Cryptocurrency Craze,’ and the host of the podcast Unchained. Laura has shared her expertise at events such as TEDx San Francisco and the International Monetary Fund. Over the past 16 years, women have been instrumental in helping legitimize crypto assets throughout the financial landscape. Their contributions have spanned various sectors in the ecosystem, helping shift the narrative around crypto from a niche, speculative asset to a more widely recognized and accepted financial tool.

41322584,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=689315,1741426514,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41322584.jpeg,"3 Key Avalanche Foundation board members resign, what’s going on?",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/3-avalanche-foundation-board-members-resign/,"Three key board members of the Avalanche Foundation have reportedly stepped down from their positions. According to Chinese journalist Colin Wu, Omer Demirel, Aytunç Yildizli, and Vikram Nagrani formally left the board of the Avalanche Foundation and its subsidiaries earlier this week. In a long-heartfelt message shared on X Friday, Demirel described the resignations as a “well-considered” decision. He told his followers that stepping down was difficult, but insisted they all chose to leave the foundation collectively. “ This has been a difficult decision given our passion, dedication, and commitment to Avalanche and its people, as well as all the hard work we have done for the ecosystem and the community since we joined the Foundation ,” Demirel wrote. He also said that Yildizli had stopped being CEO on February 28, 2025, and that the board had been in a “holding pattern” since then, trying to find solutions. However, the three former board members did say they would keep helping the Avalanche ecosystem. Avalanche board members leave unexpectedly There is trouble and the departing board members acknowledged that. Their resignations come as a shock to the community, ecosystem partners, and stakeholders. “ We are immensely proud of what we have accomplished together and are inspired by the brilliant, tenacious, and passionate community members who have driven Avalanche’s growth ,” Demirel denoted. Reflecting on their time at the foundation, the ex-AvalancheFDN director listed some of the projects that were launched under their leadership. He cited the establishment of the Avalanche Foundation’s brand and identity, the publication of its first annual report, and the introduction of incentive and grant programs such as infraBUIDL() and infraBUIDL(AI). “ We have supported the community and project teams, launched incentive and grant programs, conceived and launched AiFRED, brought new builders to Avalanche, and most recently worked to bring the vibes and attention to Avalanche when other ecosystems have been faltering, ” he explained. Demiral concluded his message by calling the community “incredibly talented individuals,” that they would miss dearly. “ We wish the very best for the Avalanche ecosystem and you, our beloved community .” The community reacts, asks why the directors left The resignation announcement sparked conversations across the Avalanche community on social media, who were trying to find out what exactly caused the three to say their goodbyes. A community member on X, going by the pseudonym web3zous, asked : “ Why resign now, and who will take over? Personally, I think timing matters a lot in these decisions, leaving when things are shaky spells doubt .” “It was a collective resignation. Somebody or something somewhere got messed up,” said another member, replying to web3zous. Some Avalanche supporters like Pakt World developer BJ pleaded with the community to stop pressing for answers now to discourage conflicts from arising. “ Let’s be respectful of the Avalanche foundation departures and refrain from hot take speculation. Only a handful of ecosystem leaders know the true story. And there are likely competing ‘true stories’ depending on perspective. They gave us their best. We owe them ours .” Others lamented the loss, saying the three leaving will be a “huge loss for the Avalanche community.” “ I have personally witnessed how passionate they were about their work. You can’t simply hire people to replace that kind of dedication, these roles require true attachment. I hope the Avalanche Foundation can manage this transition. Thank you for everything. “ At the same time, CoinGecko data shows that AVAX, Avalanche’s native token, has dropped 3% in the last 24 hours and is now trading at $19.95. Charts on TradingView show that if AVAX finds support and refuses lower levels of $18, the price could go up toward $25 in the coming weeks. AVAX’s immediate support level lies around $16.00, a threshold that if breached on the lower side, could prompt a negative reaction. But a decisive break above $22.00 would be seen as a bullish signal. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

In a video posted on X on March 7 , Armstrong revealed that the exchange plans to add approximately 1,000 employees in the U.S. this year. “This is a direct result of his actions already in the first 60 days or so,” he said, highlighting the impact of Trump’s policies on the industry. Armstrong Calls Current U.S. Congress the ‘Most Pro-Crypto’ in History Armstrong noted that the current Congress is the “most pro-crypto” the U.S. has ever had. The hiring spree would increase Coinbase’s workforce by about 27%, based on Stockanalysis data that estimates the company currently has 3,772 employees. The announcement came after Armstrong attended the White House Crypto Summit, where he joined industry leaders such as Gemini founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor, and Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek. Speaking outside the White House, he described the event as a “historic moment” for the crypto sector. “President Trump has breathed life back into the crypto industry,” Armstrong stated.

Over the past month, COIN shares have fallen 22.4%, closing at $217.45 on March 7, according to Google Finance. The decline coincides with broader market downturns following Trump’s proposed tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico on Feb. 1. Just two years ago, Coinbase had taken the opposite approach, laying off nearly 1,000 employees in January 2023 to cut operating costs by 25%. At the time, Armstrong reassured investors that the company remained well-capitalized, emphasizing that “crypto isn’t going anywhere” despite market challenges. Coinbase CEO: Trump’s Crypto Plans Spark Buzz in Crypto Just recently, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said U.S. President Donald Trump’s crypto agenda has become a central topic of discussion across the crypto industry, financial markets, and the tech world. Reflecting on his recent time at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Armstrong revealed that conversations with major market leaders were dominated by Trump’s plans for digital assets. “Basically, every conversation I had with major market leaders was focused on what the Trump administration planned to do on crypto,” Armstrong said. He added that Trump’s bold vision is pushing industry players to step up, with many striving to avoid being left behind in the rapidly evolving landscape. During the WEF, Trump pledged to make the United States the “world capital of artificial intelligence and crypto.” This commitment, one of his first public statements since taking office on Jan. 20, has set a transformative tone for the industry. Armstrong praised Trump’s approach, along with the leadership of Argentina’s President Javier Milei and El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele, for embracing free markets as drivers of prosperity. Among Trump’s speculated plans is the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, though his latest executive order hints at a broader vision.

In a March 7 statement , the OCC clarified that national banks and federal savings associations can now engage in crypto custody, stablecoin-related activities, and participate in distributed ledger networks. This marks a significant shift in regulatory oversight, reversing some of the previous hurdles that had limited banks’ involvement with digital assets. OCC’s Interpretive Letter 1183 Removes Crypto Banking Restrictions The decision was outlined in Interpretive Letter 1183 , which removes the requirement for OCC-supervised banks to seek “supervisory nonobjection” before engaging in crypto-related activities. Acting Comptroller of the Currency Rodney E. Hood emphasized that the move aims to “reduce the burden on banks” and ensure consistent regulatory treatment of crypto-related banking activities. The OCC explained that its staff now has a stronger understanding of the crypto sector, enabling the agency to adjust its previous stringent policies. The change is intended to foster responsible innovation while improving transparency within the banking industry. While the crypto sector has welcomed the OCC’s announcement, Custodia Bank CEO Caitlin Long cautioned that the broader regulatory crackdown is not fully over. In a March 7 post on X, Long argued that Operation Chokepoint 2.0 remains in effect until the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) also withdraw their “anti-crypto guidance.” The timing of the OCC’s decision aligns with Trump’s statements at the White House Crypto Summit, where he addressed industry leaders and vowed to bring an end to the crackdown. AMID ALL THE JUBILATION ABOUT the OCC news, #OperationChokePoint2 .0 isn't over until: 1. Fed & FDIC also rescind their anti- #crypto guidance, which is still in effect (Fed & FDIC were far more detrimental to crypto banking than OCC) & 2. @custodiabank has its Fed master account. https://t.co/KjhxLk54aw — Caitlin Long (@CaitlinLong_) March 7, 2025 “Some people really suffered, it was ridiculous what they were doing,” Trump said, referring to the regulatory pressure on crypto firms. “In the end, they came around, but they came around for the wrong reasons—only because they wanted votes.” Operation Chokepoint 2.0, an initiative that limited crypto firms’ access to banking services, has been a major point of contention within the industry, particularly during the 2024 U.S. election. Trump criticized regulators for pressuring banks to cut ties with crypto businesses and blocking money transfers to and from exchanges. “They weaponized the government against the entire industry,” he claimed. “But I know that feeling also, maybe better than you do; all that will soon be over.” Crypto Firms Rely on Stablecoins Amid Banking Restrictions Many crypto firms turned to stablecoins to fund operations after traditional banks severed their business accounts. Meanwhile, on Jan. 16, Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis accused the FDIC of attempting to cover up its involvement in Operation Chokepoint 2.0. In a letter, she alleged that whistleblowers informed her of document destruction related to the program. “If it is uncovered that you or your staff have knowingly destroyed materials or sought to obstruct the oversight functions of the Senate, I will make swift criminal referrals to the U.S. Department of Justice,” Lummis warned.

Solana and XRP prices, among other major coins, have seen notable price fluctuations that may may Trigger weekend rallies as Nasdaq crashes below 200D average. Despite the recent Trump crypto summit held on 7th March, which aimed to boost sentiment, the market remains under pressure. The recent decline in the crypto market is closely linked to stock market trends, particularly concerns over U.S. tariffs. With equities experiencing volatility, cryptocurrencies have followed suit due to their strong correlation. However, with the stock market closed over the weekend, digital assets may find an opportunity to recover. Cryptocurrencies Price Prediction: Weekend Rallies Loom as Nasdaq Falls Below 200D The Nasdaq 100 has dropped below its 200-day moving average for the first time since March 2023, ending a 497-day streak. This marks the second-longest run in history. The last time a similar streak ended in January 2022, the index fell 5.7% within two weeks and 22.0% over the next year. Historical data shows that if the index declines more than 3.5% in two weeks, a bear market follows. However, if the drop remains under 3.5%, the Nasdaq typically recovers. These next two weeks could be critical in determining market trends. The cryptocurrency sector may react to Nasdaq’s movement, potentially influencing weekend rallies.

As of Saturday, March 8, the SOL price is trading at $138, reflecting a 0.24% decline. The price continues to consolidate within a tight range between $130 and $150 after facing strong resistance near $160. The Solana price prediction struggles to break past key resistance at $150, which remains a crucial level. On the downside, SOL has maintained support at $130, preventing further declines. If selling pressure intensifies, the next support level sits at $120, potentially leading to further weakness. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 41.74, indicating that the SOL is in a neutral trend. Source: TradingView XRP Price Struggles Below $2.50; Can It Recover? The latest XRP price is trading around $2.35, facing resistance at $2.50. The price recently retraced after failing to hold above $2.70. XRP had surged past key resistance but encountered selling pressure near $3.00, leading to a pullback. Currently, XRP is holding above the $2.20 support zone. If this level breaks, the price could extend losses toward $2.00. However, a rebound above $2.50 could push XRP toward $2.70 and possibly $3.00. The MACD indicator shows bearish momentum, with the signal line crossing below the MACD line. A recovery in momentum could indicate renewed buying interest. While failure to hold above $2.20 may lead to a decline. Source: TradingView To sum up, The Nasdaq’s dip below the 200-day average has raised market concerns, influencing cryptocurrencies price. Solana and XRP prices are at critical levels, with weekend trading offering potential for a rebound.

Related Reading: ‘All Options On The Table’: Bitcoin Must Hold This Level Ahead Of Trump’s Crypto Summit CZ Says There’s No Altseason Yet On Friday, Changpeng Zhao, also known as CZ, responded to an X user asking when the Altseason will happen. The Binance founder pointed out the price tracking and market data website CoinMarketCap (CMC), which recently added an “Altcoin Season Index.” CZ highlighted that “of the top 100 altcoins,” very few have outperformed Bitcoin (BTC) in the past three months, suggesting that the Altseason won’t happen yet. As the website states, the CMC Altcoin Season Index page “provides real-time insights into whether the cryptocurrency market is currently in Altcoin Season,” based on the performance of the top 100 altcoins against the flagship crypto over the past 90 days. Under this metric, an Altseason is in if 75% of the top 100 altcoins outperform BTC during the established period. To CZ, “This is a tough ranking system,” as he considers that 50 would be a good score for Altcoins. The CMC index page shows a score of 14/100, with only 14 altcoins outperforming BTC since early December. Some of the tokens in this list include Monero (XRM), Hyperliquid (HYPE), Pi (PI), Mantra (OM), Berachain (BERA), and the official Trump memecoin (TRUMP). Leading cryptocurrencies of 2024, like SUI and Solana (SOL), show 37% to 41% price decreases in the past 90 days. Meanwhile, memecoin sensations like dogwifhat (WIF), PEPE, FLOKI, and BONK have bled between 70% and 80% during this period. Analyst Michaël van de Poppe also noted that altcoins have had an overall negative performance on higher timeframes despite some recent price rallies. “Massive green day on some Altcoins, they are up 2%! Then, you zoom out, and you zoom out, and you zoom out,” he asserted. Altcoins Bottom Could Be Near Altcoin Sherpa stated that altcoins were in “about the same or worse” positions during the Summer 2024 retrace, pointing out that “things were also pretty bleak overall and then we saw some strong bounces in August.” However, he noted that, unlike last year, the market doesn’t have a “Trump Pump coming.” Recently, some of the top cryptocurrencies saw a significant price increase after US President Donald Trump announced a strategic reserve that would include SOL, XRP, Cardano (ADA), Ethereum (ETH), and BTC. Nonetheless, after the March 6 executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a “Digital Asset Stockpile,” the White House AI and Crypto Czar, David Sacks, clarified that the previously named altcoins were used as references for the most valuable tokens in the market. Sherpa considers that the market’s bottom is close, but “we still also probably have the chop period to get through” before any substantial recovery. On the contrary, some industry figures have also commented on altcoins’ overall performance this cycle, suggesting that the Altseason already started but will be different from previous cycles.

He affirmed there will not be a direct Bitcoin-to-altcoins rotation this cycle, as BTC dominance isn’t the key metric that defines it. To the CEO, trading volume is the metric that defines it this time. Ju also pointed out that this will be a very selective and challenging altseason, with only a few altcoins with strong narratives expected to thrive.

Are only men—the so-called “bros”—leading the crypto landscape? What about the increasing influence of women in crypto, who are actively transforming the traditionally male-dominated financial markets? Women are challenging the aggressive trading culture, the exclusionary practices that have favored certain communities, and the harsh dynamics often associated with the “Crypto Bro” mentality. While this culture may have contributed to early Bitcoin adoption, its exclusionary nature—marginalizing nearly 50% of the global population—is no longer acceptable. Today, as more women step into leadership roles within crypto firms and blockchain entities, CoinGape engages with these trailblazers to hear their insights on how they are evolving and leading in the Web3 corporate world. Read on… Women Thriving in the Security Space As the recent $1.5 Billion Bybit Hack has made User Security the critical focus for Crypto World, women are leading in the Blockchain Security space too. Cybersecurity and blockchain security have traditionally been male-dominated fields, but more women are stepping into key roles in fraud detection, compliance, and blockchain forensics. Few such names inlcude Erin Fracolli , Global Head of Intelligence & Investigations at Binance, leading efforts to combat crypto-related financial crime. Carole House , formerly in the U.S. National Security Council, has worked on crypto regulation and security policies. Simone Maini , CEO of Elliptic, the trailblaizing women working with her specialization in blockchain analytics for tracking illicit transactions. Eve Lam, Chief Information Security Officer at Trust Wallet, says on the rarity of women in security space, “Women in cybersecurity and Web3 often find themselves in male-dominated spaces, but the key isn’t just hiring more women—it’s creating a culture where they feel valued and truly belong. The great thing about Web3 is that it rewards skills and contributions, not backgrounds.” Sharing advice for women willing to jump in CryptoSecurity space, CISO Eve continues, “My advice? Forget gatekeepers and dive in. Web3 is built on open-source projects, meaning you can jump in right now. Find vulnerabilities, report them, and use bug bounty programs to prove your skills. Community also plays a huge role in Web3 and they are incredibly supportive—connect with experts on platforms like X and Telegram, join security groups, and learn from those already making an impact. The future of cybersecurity needs diverse voices, and there’s no better time to start than now.” Notably, as the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) of Trust Wallet, Eve oversees the security infrastructure of the platform, ensuring the protection of user assets and blockchain interactions. Women in the Crypto Founders’ Community Since the foundations of the crypto industry are built on decentralization and democratization, it is essential for women to play a key role. Only then can the true realization of blockchain innovation be achieved. As of 2023, cryptocurrency ownership data shows over 420 million digital currency users worldwide. 37% of these 420 million global crypto holders are women – implying almost close to 155 million women are already engaging in some way with crypto. Asia alone accounts for 263 million digital currency investors, with India leading with the highest number of crypto investors at 93 million, followed by Vietnam. Further, according to the latest Web3 Finance Compensation Report , women in Web3 finance earn 46% less than men on average. Though this is significantly higher than in Web2 finance where the pay gap is 39% in the United States and 28% in the United Kingdom, another relevant statistic from Crunchbase says that VC investment in female-founded crypto startups doubled in 2024, but only to reach 7% of all deals, from the low starting point of 3.5% of all deals. To the tragic scenario, Women-founded startups receive only 2% of total venture capital funding, and blockchain is no exception. Mattie Fairchild, Head of Founder Community at Polygon Labs, says, “Women in Web3 aren’t ‘emerging’. We’re driving. Coming from gaming, I don’t get the “where are all the women?” question. I see badass women leading, hiring, and shaping the space such that we now have a flywheel: more women in leadership means we’re seeing a deeper talent pool. At Polygon Labs, it means we can work with amazing teams like Boys Club and SheFi to bring in even more.` Mattie further shares her optimism and says, “So the question isn’t where are the women? It’s how do we scale what’s working? Some rooms still feel like a time capsule (me and 22 dudes, it happens), but the best rooms are showing us the future. Let’s build more of those.” Previously the CEO and Co-founder of Wacedash Games and been in the industry for more than a decade, Mattie Fairchild is heading the Founder Community at Polygon Labs. There are many such emerging female co-founders in the Web3 space. One such name is Eva Oberholzer, who has founded Super Sol – Solana’s first native layer-2 scaling solution designed to supercharge Solana’s capabilities. In a relatively nascent industry like crypto, where initial capital is often pivotal for scaling and success, the gender disparity in receiving startup funding creates broader inequities, including pay gaps, requiring collaborative efforts from the industry. Source: Forbes.com Its Not “Men vs Women” But “Men and Women Together” Although the number of women using and investing in crypto is growing, the job market scenario looks different. As of the recent data available from 2023, due to the 2023 market layoffs suggest that women hold some 26% of all jobs in the crypto industry, while only about 6% of the top leadership roles are held by women, with 94% of CEOs being male. Vivien Lin, Chief Product Officer at BingX & Head of BingX Labs says, “Historically, the cryptocurrency industry has been perceived as male-dominated. However, this perception is gradually shifting, with more women stepping into leadership roles. Female leadership should not be seen as competition; rather, it demonstrates how we, as allies, are collectively strengthening the pursuit of equality in the blockchain space. It’s encouraging to witness this trend as it continues to unfold.” CPO Lin further continues, “It is also important to understand that gender affirmation shouldn’t pit women and men against each other. Creating an inclusive and open professional environment requires effort and understanding from everyone involved. This includes recognizing that equality means providing the same opportunities and support to all. Everyone’s participation is essential in building a workplace where both men and women can thrive together. Meaningful transformation in Web3 will require the collective effort of many, especially women. Society often expects women to excel both professionally and in domestic responsibilities, regardless of their career success. I welcome these challenges because navigating complex situations is part of what brought me here.” BingX CPO Vivien Lin brings a wealth of experience and expertise to her dual roles as Chief Product Officer (CPO) at BingX, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, and Head of BingX Labs. Having nearly a decade of experience in trading, product management, and market development, Vivien has been instrumental in shaping the strategic direction and growth of BingX. As the Chief Product Officer of BingX, Vivien oversees the development and enhancement of the platform’s products and services. Before joining BingX, her professional journey includes key roles at renowned financial institutions such as Morgan Stanley, BNP Paribas, and Deutsche Bank, where she focused on forex and equity derivative products. Vision for Equitable Representation of Women in Crypto As a female author and editor at CoinGape, I envision the Web3 industry’s development with a strong focus on gender equity. Women possess exceptional critical skills and leadership potential. Since blockchain technology and Bitcoin are fundamentally innovative, we must prevent the traditional discriminations of the Web2 era from carrying over into this evolving Web3 space. Given its nascent stage, we still have time to ensure these past biases do not take root. To pioneer the ‘ Women In Crypto ‘ Era, expanding women-focused blockchain and cybersecurity education programs is crucial. Additionally, collaborations and initiatives supporting women in Web3—along with recognition for those already leading—are essential to fostering a truly inclusive industry. For instance, Bitget, a prominent cryptocurrency exchange and Web3 enterprise with women in top roles, such as Gracy Chen (CEO), had introduced the Blockchain4Her project at the World Economic Forum 2024. This initiative, designed to champion gender diversity and inclusivity within the blockchain industry, involved a substantial commitment of $10 million. Gracy Chen, CEO at Bitget says , “Blockchain remains a male-dominated industry, with women holding only 26% of leadership positions in Web3. This gap shows the need for targeted initiatives like Bitget’s $10M Blockchain4Her initiative, which has directly supported over 1,000 women in the past year through funding, mentorship, and networking. By providing $50,000 in grants and launching platforms like Pitch n Slay, we are seeing tangible results—women-led projects are securing capital and scaling in a competitive industry.” CEO Chen continues, “Efforts like these are not just about representation but about measurable change. The Blockchain4Her Ambassador Program has brought together influential female leaders who are actively mentoring and guiding the next generation. Our mentorship initiative builds on this by pairing aspiring entrepreneurs with those who have successfully navigated the Web3 space. The introduction of the Blockchain4Her Pin, inspired by cultural traditions, is another step toward making the movement visible and engaging a broader audience beyond digital spaces. While progress is evident, there is still work to be done. Bitget is committed to improving this figure by backing women-led ventures with capital, strategic support, and industry connections. Our focus remains on delivering real opportunities—whether through funding, education, or strategic partnerships—so that women are not just participants in Web3 but are shaping its future.” The post Women’s Day 2025: Women Leaders on Breaking the ‘Crypto Bro’ Stereotype in Web3 appeared first on CoinGape .",Power talk,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BUSINESS|MATIC,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-03-08 11:00:19

According to a Radio Free Asia exclusive , the company is part of Huione Group, an entity that oversees various financial and marketplace platforms. Among them is a Telegram-based marketplace that has been linked to an estimated $24 billion in illicit transactions, according to blockchain analytics firm Elliptic. The National Bank of Cambodia said the reason it revoked Huione Pay’s license is that it was noncompliant with financial regulations. A spokesperson for the bank told Radio Free Asia (RFA) via email on Thursday that the company had failed to adhere to existing rules and recommendations. Still, the official did not specify the exact date of the license withdrawal or what consequences Huione Pay might face if it continues operations. Allegations are false, says Huione Pay RFA confirmed that Huione Pay has denied allegations of any criminal activity. Responding to the allegations made by Elliptic, which coined them as a facilitator of illicit transactions, the company claimed that its platform, HaoWang Guarantee, merely provides escrow services and does not conduct direct transactions. The company said its involvement in questionable sales was not to its knowledge, explaining that products such as “detention equipment” account for less than 0.01% of its listings and could be intended for legitimate law enforcement use. “ There is a contact email on our official website, which the so-called blockchain analysis company never contacted us to verify the information or asked us to delete the information before publishing the analysis report. Instead, they directly published article for intentionally attracted attention. Initially, after seeing the media report, we deleted this information as soon as possible. Please be aware of this, media friends .” Huione reiterated, taking a dig at the blockchain security analysts’ research. Elliptic published its report on Huione in July 2024, calling them a “hub for online fraudsters” running scams on different industries en masse. The platform has allegedly provided a pathway for criminals to partake in illegal activities, including money laundering, identity theft, and the sale of technology used for fraud. According to Elliptic, thousands of vendors operate on Huione Guarantee, offering services that enable organized crime groups to conduct scams worldwide. The security company’s researchers uncovered listings for stolen personal data, money laundering services, and even electrified shackles, allegedly used to restrain workers trafficked into scam compounds. Following the report, Huione Guarantee altered its policies, explicitly prohibiting listings related to human trafficking, firearms, and terrorism. Still, naysayers assert that the company’s previous inaction allowed criminal enterprises to thrive on the platform. According to more recent news, the platform’s operations were still live in January. Updated analysis reveals that cryptocurrency wallets linked to Huione Guarantee and its vendors have received at least $24 billion in transactions so far. Since the July report, monthly inflows have surged by 51%, while the platform’s user base has expanded to over 900,000. Stablecoin issuer Tether in conjunction with authorities have frozen $29.62 million worth of USDT on the TRON blockchain associated with Huione Pay. The frozen funds are believed to be linked to transactions facilitated by Huione Pay, which the company suspects played a role in processing illicit payments. Tether continuous efforts to halt illicit transactions In separate but related news, Tether has frozen $27 million in USDT linked to the sanctioned Russian crypto exchange Garantex. The exchange, which has been under US and European sanctions, announced on March 6 that Tether’s action had forced it to halt operations. Garantex confirmed via Telegram that Tether blocked wallets containing over 2.5 billion rubles ($27 million), prompting it to suspend all transactions, including withdrawals. The exchange’s website is currently under maintenance, and law enforcement agencies, including the US Secret Service, Dutch National Police, and German Federal Criminal Police have seized its domain.

With the U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve in process, a debate is going on among supporters and critics. Peter Schiff, a renowned economist and crypto skeptic, is also actively debating the same topic. Recently, he took social media to mock Donald Trump’s move and reveal that he is also building a Bitcoin Reserve. Let’s dive deep into this matter and discuss the updates on the Crypto Summit as well. Peter Schiff Mocks the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve With a different approach and gold advocacy, Peter Schiff did not take long ridiculing Donald Trump’s move to establish a national Crypto Reserve. In his recent X post, Schiff sarcastically announced that he too is creating his own Bitcoin Reserve, but with a twist. I’ve decided to create my own Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Like the U.S. government, I’m developing a budget-neutral strategy for acquiring my Bitcoin at no incremental cost. Phase one of my strategy is inviting contributions to my reserve. He even shared his wallet addresses, jokingly crowdsourcing his reserve, but some people took it seriously. Schiff again posted and continued his mockery in his follow-up post, claiming that his Bitcoin Reserve is still empty. Then, he added that he is developing a Digital Asset Stockpile, for which people have sent him Solana. So far, my Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is still empty. But I’m developing a Digital Asset Stockpile too. Several people have already sent me Solana. It seems that blockchain is much faster than Bitcoin.” This behavior caught Peter Schiff’s followers’ attention; those who failed to understand the mockery questioned whether his account had been hacked. He replied, “I guess you don’t get my sense of humor yet.” Updates on the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve After Trump’s Executive Order signing for the Bitcoin Reserve, the enthusiasm among investors was at its peak. However, a slight disappointment took over the investors as they expected more, including massive Bitcoin buying by the government. The White House Crypto Summit also failed to mention much on the reserve, but President Trump did clarify that the U.S. will no longer liquidate BTC holdings. He even criticized the previous government for selling and revealed his vision for broader crypto strategies. Other key highlights from the Crypto Summit include the revelation of government Bitcoin holdings, which come to $17 billion. Moreover, Trump assured that no taxpayer funds would be used for the reserve. With a few more discussions on a stablecoin bill and regulation, they assured the United States would become the crypto pioneer. Peter Schiff’s Broader Criticism and the Market’s Reaction Peter Schiff’s criticism of the U.S. government forming a crypto reserve is not limited to humorous posts. He has also shown serious concerns about the implications of this decision, claiming that the government-backed crypto reserve would destabilize the U.S. dollar . With that, he emphasized gold’s dominance as the superior store of value. If Bitcoin’s success depends on the failure of the U.S. dollar, then this move only accelerates the dollar’s decline. Gold, not Bitcoin, will ultimately be the real winner. Interestingly, the crypto market’s reactions to Trump’s comments on the industry discard all this skepticism. The recent news about Trump is the best example, as the BTC price hit $91k after weeks of consolidations. Investors now await further updates on Crypto Reserve and anticipate a positive market impact.

Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President signed an executive order to create a strategic cryptocurrency reserve . But with Bitcoin’s price soaring, how can the U.S. government afford to stack BTC without dipping into taxpayer funds? That’s where VanEck VanEck - Cryptocurrency investment steps in with some surprisingly creative ideas. From revaluing gold to selling off surplus cheese, VanEck has proposed unconventional ways for the U.S. to expand its Bitcoin holdings—without printing more money or raising taxes. Some of these ideas could be put into action quickly, while others would require major policy shifts. Either way, they open the door to a future where Bitcoin plays a key role in U.S. reserves. https://twitter.com/ravstr/status/1898045697208832184 Could these strategies actually work? Let’s break them down. 1. Revaluing Gold to Unlock Funds The U.S. holds vast gold reserves, but they are valued at a much lower official price than their current market worth. VanEck suggests that Congress could update this valuation, instantly increasing the paper value of these reserves. The extra capital generated could then be used to buy Bitcoin—without printing new money or raising taxes. 2. Issuing Bitcoin-Backed Bonds Another option is for the government to create and sell “Bitcoin-backed bonds.” Investors would buy these bonds, and a portion of the money raised would go toward purchasing BTC. When the bonds mature, the government could repay investors either in Bitcoin or U.S. dollars, offering a flexible investment opportunity. 3. Using Federal Reserve Surplus Before 2015, the Federal Reserve was allowed to keep a larger surplus of funds. VanEck suggests bringing back this policy so that the Fed can build up extra reserves and use them to buy Bitcoin. This would provide a direct way for the government to acquire BTC without needing new congressional spending approvals. 4. Adding Bitcoin to IMF’s Special Drawing Rights Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) are international reserve assets issued by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). VanEck proposes convincing the IMF to include Bitcoin in SDRs, making it a recognized global reserve asset. If approved, this would further cement Bitcoin’s role in international finance. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Market Dips After Trump’s White House Summit – Here’s Why , 5. Selling Surplus Cheese for Bitcoin The U.S. government holds large stockpiles of surplus cheese. VanEck suggests selling off these reserves and using the proceeds to buy Bitcoin. Since this involves selling existing assets rather than increasing spending, it wouldn’t impact the federal budget deficit. At the same time, it would help the government manage its excess inventory more efficiently. 6. Using the Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Fund The Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF), controlled by the U.S. Treasury, is used to manage foreign exchange reserves and stabilize the dollar. VanEck’s final proposal is for the Treasury to use this fund to buy and hold Bitcoin. Since the ESF operates outside the normal budget process, this method would offer a more flexible approach to BTC accumulation. VanEck’s proposals highlight several ways the U.S. could acquire Bitcoin without adding financial strain on taxpayers. While some ideas require congressional approval, others—like selling surplus assets—could be implemented quickly. If adopted, these strategies could reshape how the U.S. government approaches cryptocurrency investment. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

41325583,https://nulltx.com/?p=146794,1741431874,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,$UNI Price Analysis: Accumulation and Key Supply Clusters Set the Stage for Future Price Movements,https://nulltx.com/uni-price-analysis-accumulation-and-key-supply-clusters-set-the-stage-for-future-price-movements/,"While the cryptocurrency market remains shaky, a number of tokens have managed to generate quite a bit of buzz. And Uniswap’s native token, $UNI, is definitely one of them. Of late, it appears that accumulation has ramped up noticeably, with the token’s price clustering around $7.30—an interesting development that leads us to consider some of the factors behind not only the token’s recent price action but also its potential long-term trajectory compared to some of its peers. Strong Accumulation at $7.30: A Potential Price Floor Traders and investors in $UNI are showing a lot of interest around the $7.30 level. Recent market data has shown that an impressive amount of accumulation has taken place at that price point. This seems to indicate that there are forces of nature on the buy side that are kind of holding up or supporting the token at this level. If the $UNI token were to move back to the $7.30 area in the near future, it would likely find that same level acting as a sort of price floor, preventing it from going much lower. Price floors are significant in trading because they represent price levels where demand is greater than supply, causing price stabilization or even reversals. Accumulation at $7.30 seems to indicate that there are enough investors valuing that price as reasonable and worth buying, which might prevent further declines. If the market does see another dip, could we then expect a bounce off $7.30, which would create a nice psychological and technical floor for subsequent price movements? Key Supply Clusters Highlighting Investor Sentiment The holder distribution across various price levels tells us a lot about how $UNI holders feel. One of the most notable clusters of supply originates from around February 2024, with a cost basis of approximately $10.60. This cluster contains roughly 14 million $UNI tokens, and the holders of these tokens have shown continued engagement despite the market’s volatility. This cluster is interesting because it displays resilience. Even though the market has been up and down, these investors keep holding. This could indicate a strong belief in the long-term value of $UNI. One might also think that these investors are just hoping that the market recovers and that $UNI regains its (previous?) momentum. But it seems these investors might expect $UNI to appreciate over time because of its (believed) higher intrinsic value. In contrast, the most extensive cluster of supplies above the spot price is packed into the $16.81 price bucket, which has become a point of special interest. This assembly, which formed around December 15, 2023, contains an enormous 31.01 million $UNI tokens. The holders of those tokens, with a cost basis of $16.81, seem to be holding through the recent market turbulence. Those investors had better be hoping for a significant price recovery to see their $UNI back above the levels they entered. The investors who have opted to hold through the ups and downs clearly have faith in the long-term viability of $UNI, despite all the short-term market shakiness. And this could also indicate that the big holders have no intention of selling at a loss, providing further support for $UNI as it tries to find a stable price. Market Implications and What’s Next for $UNI The continued collection at $7.30, together with the engagement from large supply clusters at elevated price points, creates a scenario where long-term holders are clearly still holding, and where more recent buyers are engaging with levels key to the picture of market maintenance. If $UNI can maintain the $7.30 level in the near term, it presents a picture where long-term demand should, in theory, kick in with even greater gusto. $UNI has seen strong accumulation at $7.30, making this level a candidate for a potential price floor in case of a retest. pic.twitter.com/BYDLWE3BUU — glassnode (@glassnode) March 6, 2025 Also, the large supply concentrations at higher prices show that there may be substantial resistance at prices above $16.81. For $UNI to break through this resistance and push up past these levels, it will need to be fueled by buying pressure from retail and institutional investors. The fact that so many tokens are held up here suggests that unless something really big happens to change sentiment, a lot of retail and institutional investors are not going to rush to the exit. In the end, the direction of $UNI will depend on a number of things, like the condition of the wider market, the performance of the DeFi (decentralized finance) sector, and the overall demand for the decentralized exchange services that Uniswap provides. But the current accumulation at what appear to be key levels and the continued engagement of some large holders suggest that $UNI might be well set up for a potential ascent. Conclusion: A Critical Juncture for $UNI’s Price Action The likely foundation for $UNI’s future price rests on strong, persistent accumulation at the current price point of around $7.30 and the immediate market sentiment regarding the token at large. Should accumulation at $7.30 persist, and should price action in the token broadly correspond with recent market dynamics (most recently, a strong rally in Bitcoin), there is potential for $UNI to establish a price floor that can protect it from further downside until it ventures back into recovery mode. That road looks strewn with obstacles, however, when one considers the half-dozen or so supply clusters that rise straight up toward the $10, $12, and $14 levels. For investors watching $UNI, these developments suggest that the token now finds itself at a critical juncture. Will it consolidate around the $7.30 level or eventually break higher? The answer to that question, and what it means for $UNI in this phase of market consolidation, will be determined over the next few weeks and will certainly involve both the market’s technical and fundamental judgments.

For the first time ever, DEX volume on Solana has surpassed not just Ethereum but the entire EVM ecosystem combined, which means we might just be on the precipice of a significant shift in the DeFi market. As Solana pushes to capture more market share, the question on everyone’s mind is whether this is the beginning of Solana’s push to, well, dominate the DeFi space. Solana’s Rapid Growth and Shift in Market Dynamics In both activity and liquidity, Ethereum has been the decentralized finance leader, commanding the vast majority of DeFi transactions. Yet in the past year, it has seen increasing competition from high-throughput blockchain networks like Solana, whose fast transaction speeds and low fees have made it an attractive alternative for many developers and DeFi users. Increasingly, Solana seems to be gaining on Ethereum, and the shift in momentum looks to be becoming more evident by the day. Solana’s DEX volume has skyrocketed, now commanding 53% of the total DEX market share. Just a year ago, Solana held only 21% of the DEX market share. Solana’s impressive rise in volume has put it ahead of even Ethereum, yet few would have predicted this DEX volume rise a year ago. The volume shift signifies that Solana is no longer just a fringe player with few DeFi dapps on it. Solana is now at the forefront of the DeFi movement—a movement that is very much challenging, if not outright attempting to dethrone, Ethereum. A few key DeFi protocols—Jito ($JTO), Jupiter ($JUP), Kamino ($KMNO), and Raydium ($RAY)—are really the ones that have pushed the development of this surge of volume to the forefront on Solana. They have been gaining an incredible amount of traction and charge toward an Egg-hatching event, and it seems their momentum has only continued on to the next reset of this Bullish Bitcoin trend. As for the fee structures of these projects, it seems that they have been seen as quite favorable by users. And so these protocols have been on a tear as we came into Q4 of 2023. $SOL DeFi is flipping the script in 2025. For the first time ever, Solana’s DEX volume has surpassed $ETH and the entire EVM ecosystem combined! Is this the beginning of Solana dominance? Let’s break it down. — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) March 6, 2025 Why Solana’s Growth Could Be Just Getting Started In spite of this rapid growth, Solana’s DeFi protocols are still trading at lower valuation multiples in comparison to their counterparts on Ethereum. This valuation gap represents a gigantic opportunity for developers and investors who think the Solana ecosystem will keep outperforming in the next few years. The main reason Solana has managed to grow so rapidly is because it has had 100% uptime for the last year. That, in itself, is a sign of a quite reliable and robust network. Just as with any layer-1 option, developers need to feel safe building on top of it, and Solana’s been building a good reputation in that regard. But what’s in Solana’s favor is not just how stable it is becoming but also how fast it is and how cheap it is to use. Given how many DeFi apps have already been built on top of Solana, it seems increasingly inevitable that it’s meant to be a layer-1 option for a whole lot more applications than it is currently. The widening ecosystem of Solana, along with its capacity to push through more and speedier transactions than Ethereum, could well prove to be a game-changer. Whereas Ethereum’s future seems set on layered solutions above its base layer (with the hope that they will prove both sufficiently scalable and at a reasonable cost), Solana looks to be staking a claim on the very base layer of DeFi. If many projects and thousands of users (in a way similar to what happened with Ethereum) start to consider Solana a suitable base for their decentralized applications, that should translate into a real and substantial Solana-financed future. The Rise of Solana as a DeFi Heavyweight Solana’s DeFi momentum has truly taken off, and when viewed from a distance, it appears to be in the early stages of a serious shift. The Solana ecosystem, with all its programmable capabilities, keeps bringing more and more decentralized applications into reality—much in the same way Ethereum did a few years ago. Even as Solana cements its status as a leader in the DeFi space, its trajectory toward becoming a blue-chip DeFi ecosystem seems unmistakable. Strong foundational support, low fees, fast transaction times, and DeFi protocol growth that can only be described as explosive make Solana a compelling option for both developers and investors. And considering that relative to Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem, Solana’s is valued at something of a bargain price, there is risk-averse upside potential for getting in at this stage. The main point to extract from all this is that the Ethereumiverse may not be the only, or even the main, place to find DeFi in the future. Solana—staking its claim with a teeming community, increasing liquidity, and an expanding, vibrant ecosystem—looks to be on track to capture a sizeable share of the DeFi marketplace. Solana’s DeFi landscape appears to be maturing and seems on the verge of doing the same with its momentum only building up. If Solana can keep going like this, 2025 could see it really take off as a leader in the DeFi space, and not just as an alternative to Ethereum—for so long the uncontested champ of DeFi—but as a direct challenger to Ethereum itself.

President Donald Trump made some encouraging announcements during the meet that could pave the way for crypto’s next bull run. Firstly, Trump vowed to abolish the long-running ‘Operation Choke Point 2.0,’ which has crippled the growth of crypto start-ups within the country. The erstwhile government used this to weaponize banks and pressure them into closing the accounts of businesses engaged in crypto. This not only hindered the growth of crypto in the States but also drove away new-age businesses to other crypto-friendly countries. Just hours after this announcement, the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued a document confirming that financial institutions would not require any ‘supervisory nonobjection’ to deal in crypto. This will reduce the burden on banks and help combat Operation Choke Point 2.0. Launch of a Bitcoin Reserve Another major announcement was the launch of a stable Bitcoin reserve, which will be formed out of Bitcoins already held by the US government. The reserve, being called the ‘digital Fort Knox for digital gold,’ will contain Bitcoins that were forfeited during criminal or civil cases and will not involve any fresh buying. The fact that this reserve doesn’t hint at any new crypto purchases was probably why $BTC prices did not react much to the news and stayed flat. However, a long-term federal confidence in the digital asset is undoubtedly a huge boost to the entire crypto market. From this day on, America will follow the rule that every Bitcoiner knows very well: never sell your Bitcoin – Donald Trump Plans to Create a US Crypto Stockpile Trump also showed intentions of the US government wanting to build a long-term US crypto portfolio consisting of not only Bitcoin but also other digital assets, such as Solana, XRP, Cardano, and Ethereum. A good thing is that none of these reserves would dig into taxpayer money – only seized digital assets would make up the entirety of the fund. It’s also worth noting that Trump has been quite vocal about his support for crypto ever since his campaigning days. During the summit, too, he promised more crypto-friendly legislative support, which would aim to establish a strong regulatory framework for the industry. With increasing legislative support, more crypto businesses are expected to join the US economy. All in all, the upcoming four years could be a golden period for crypto investors. If you’re looking to cash in big, here are some of the best altcoins to invest in right now . 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Altcoin to Buy for Rallying Behind Bitcoin’s Growth Trump’s latest announcement of a strategic Bitcoin reserve, followed by the digital gold’s inclusion in a US Crypto Reserve last week, is another major push for Bitcoin. Combined with the fact that $BTC is taking support at the 200 EMA, the upcoming months could see the OG crypto reach for new highs and turn a lot of portfolios green. What if we tell you there’s a better, more profitable way to invest in Bitcoin’s growth? Enter BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . $BTCBULL is a meme coin that will directly benefit from Bitcoin’s historic run to $1M. That’s because it’s the ONLY crypto on the market that plans to give out free $BTC to token holders. These $BTC airdrops will occur every time Bitcoin reaches a new landmark number, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. All you have to do is buy and HODL $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet . Launched in mid-February, the BTC Bull Token presale has made a prolific start. It has already amassed over $3.3M so far, offering each token for just $0.0024. But interested investors should hurry up because prices increase in just a couple of days. 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Solana Altcoin Solving Network Scalability Issues Although Solana saw an impressive upmove of nearly 25% right after the announcement of Trump’s US Crypto Reserve, the futuristic crypto is back again in the red for this week. It fell 36% in February, too. What’s the issue with Solana, you ask? Overcrowding. Ever since the successful launch of $TRUMP and Pump.fun, Solana has been battling with scalability issues. Transactions are either taking ages or failing to go through. Seeing as Solaxy ($SOLX) will build the first-ever Layer 2 solution on Solana, it’s no wonder why experts are predicting it to be the next crypto to explode . By executing transactions on a sidechain, Solaxy will reduce the burden on Solana’s mainnet. Additionally, it will process transactions in bulk (rather than one by one), meaning users will also be able to benefit from lower fees. Also, let’s not forget that Solaxy is one of the five cryptos to have been included in Trump’s US Crypto Reserve. The good news keeps coming, as $SOLX has also shown great investor interest during its ongoing presale. With over $25.4M in its presale kitty at the time of writing, Solaxy is easily among the best crypto presales in the last few years. 1 $SOLX is currently available for only $0.001656 – here’s how to buy it . 3. Cardano ($ADA) – One of the Top 5 Cryptos in the World Right Now Cardano’s call-up to the Crypto Reserve saw it rise by over 60% in less than 24 hours. Also, unlike $BTC and $ETH that are struggling to break higher, $ADA now looks poised for massive growth. In fact, our analysis suggests that it could reach as high as $3.10 in 2025. Check out our full Cardano 2025 price prediction for more details. Cardano is a decentralized proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain that’s not only more energy efficient but also more scalable than Bitcoin thanks to its use of a peer-reviewed tactic for developing the network. Currently trading at around $0.80 , $ADA is undoubtedly one of the best cheap cryptos you can consider buying. Debut White House Crypto Summit: Small but Significant Moves Although the historic crypto summit didn’t announce anything out of the ordinary, which is also why the markets didn’t react much to it, the confirmed abolishment of regulatory struggles and the US government wanting to become a crypto superpower could very well be the foundations of an upcoming rally. With that said, the current market situation demands extra caution. Buying the dip is a notoriously difficult task, after all. We suggest only investing an amount that won’t give you sleepless nights, as well as doing your own research and due diligence.

41325817,https://nulltx.com/?p=146792,1741432188,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Weekly Crypto Market Report: Trump’s Strategic Crypto Reserve Stirs the Market, SEC Retreats, and Institutional Adoption Grows",https://nulltx.com/weekly-crypto-market-report-trumps-strategic-crypto-reserve-stirs-the-market-sec-retreats-and-institutional-adoption-grows/,"This week, the cryptocurrency market experienced significant volatility as a series of events sent the market swinging in different directions. From former President Donald Trump’s proposal for a Strategic Crypto Reserve to the SEC’s unexpected backpedaling in its lawsuits against some big-name defendants, there was a lot going on in that regard. Yet, in the midst of all this, institutional interest in the cryptocurrency markets kept picking up. Trump’s Strategic Crypto Reserve Sends Shockwaves In a stunning move that made headlines almost instantly, President Donald Trump, in a release from his office, announced plans to create a “Strategic Crypto Reserve” to support the cryptocurrency market. Almost as soon as the announcement was made, the crypto market rallied, with a number of tokens surging as investors speculated what the reserve might actually do. Bitcoin ($BTC), which had been trading relatively flat, shot up to an eye-popping $95,000 following the news. But the rally was short-lived, as skepticism surrounding the reserve’s feasibility and legitimacy cooled the market’s enthusiasm. And as doubts began to surface about how such a reserve could even be implemented, the pullback in the market that manifested itself by the end of the week gave us our first look at something that has a good chance of being a quasi-ETF: the Bitcoin Reserve. Although the initial optimism has faded, there was a temporary sense of euphoria in the markets following the news, with plenty of analysts suggesting that the political backdrop could get friendlier for cryptocurrencies in the future—especially as Trump’s sometimes pro, sometimes con, public discourse around crypto keeps capturing headlines. SEC Takes a Step Back: Kraken & Cumberland Get Relief In yet another major market development, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made waves by failing to pursue legal cases against two major entities in the cryptocurrency space—Kraken and Cumberland DRW. The SEC’s decision to not go after these high-profile cases, which had attracted a lot of media attention, suggests a potential change in the regulatory environment. This is part of a broader trend of the SEC being less aggressive in pursuing regulatory actions, despite the regulator being under pressure to provide more clarity and fairness in its interactions with the crypto industry. This decision was a welcome sign for the market, offering relief to investors and market participants. In the past, we have seen crypto companies and the government engaging in high-stakes legal battles over the regulatory status of digital assets. More often than not, these cases end up being resolved in favor of the crypto businesses, which is a good result for them, obviously, but it may do nothing to clear up the regulatory fog that has so many in the sector worried and which has rendered the sector into an area of many unknowns for investors. Institutional Players Cement Their Commitment In the world of institutions, BlackRock, the largest asset manager on the planet, stirred things up by including Bitcoin in its model portfolio. This was the first time a major asset manager had made such a move, and it felt like a monumental step for Bitcoin toward the mainstream. BlackRock allocated a modest 1-2% of its Bitcoin ETF holdings to this portfolio, but then, even modest steps made by BlackRock tend to send ripples through the financial markets. This initiative by BlackRock folds neatly into a wider narrative of institutional interest in Solana. Just a few days ago, CME Group announced it would launch Solana futures on March 17, which was met by the requisite press release. But to really understand what’s happening here and why it matters, let’s first take a second to discuss Solana itself. Moreover, Bitwise Asset Management took a noteworthy step by putting money into the on-chain credit protocol Maple Finance. The platform uses Bitcoin-based lending to present institutional yield opportunities, which makes for an increasingly integrated traditional finance tool in the crypto space. 1/6 NEW Weekly State of the Market Report: This week, crypto markets seesawed as Trump’s proposed Strategic Crypto Reserve sent select tokens soaring before skepticism cooled the rally.

The much-anticipated Pectra testnet upgrade for Ethereum hit a few snags and is now on hold. Ethereum developers weren’t looking to pull the rug out from under anyone, but they were on a schedule that had the upgrade rollout pushing hard toward the timeline of having the improvements implemented on the ‘mainnet.’ That timetable looks shaky this week at best. Postponement is a delay; the Pegging Pectra project in Ethereum is compelling; the team undoubtedly is very good and quite capable; this is a good team working in a good manner. Now deploying Pegging Pectra is not going according to plan, and this makes Ethereum’s already precarious equilibrium of network congestion and transaction fee problems even worse. (For many in the Ethereum ecosystem, successfully deploying Pegging Pectra is seen as a necessary step toward restoring network equilibrium.) Market Summary and Performance By market cap, the total cap in cryptocurrency went from being at 2.77 trillion dollars to being at 2.96 trillion dollars. In this same time frame, Bitcoin went from having a market cap of 1.66 trillion dollars to having a market cap of 1.79 trillion dollars. Slightly more than half of the total cap in the market for cryptocurrencies is made up of Bitcoin. This same report puts Bitcoin’s dominance at around 60.4 percent. In the last week, Bitcoin had a gain of 8.5%, and noteworthy altcoins such as $ADA (+56.16%), $XRP (+15.91%), $LINK (+10.52%), and $TRX (+7.96%) led the way higher. By contrast, Ethereum ($ETH) had a loss of 1.49%, and that underscores the mixed sentiment within the broader cryptocurrency market. Across the various crypto sectors, performance was different. Specialized coins, value transfer coins, and application utility tokens saw solid gains. Media service tokens, blockchain utilities, and claim tokens all saw declines. The mixed performance reflects the market at large, with different tokens showing different amounts of volatility. Wallet activity also fluctuated but showed significant increases in tokens like $XRP (+520.25%), $ADA (+60.11%), and $BCH (+22.29%). In contrast, we saw $FTT (-41.96%) and $BTC (-17.41%) decline. This is an illustration of the herd animal that is the cryptocurrency market, with some coins charging ahead while others seem to be retreating. All in all, even though the crypto market has displayed resilience, the next few weeks are bound to deliver additional volatility, especially with the vital updates and regulatory advancements on the horizon. The market is still becoming more sophisticated, and it is certainly not free of obstacles—some of which might be deadly—that it must confront as it journeys through these uncertain times.

41325852,https://nulltx.com/?p=146791,1741432349,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Aave Continues to Lead DeFi Innovation: Surpassing $35B in Deposits and Unveiling New Upgrades,https://nulltx.com/aave-continues-to-lead-defi-innovation-surpassing-35b-in-deposits-and-unveiling-new-upgrades/,"Aave , a leading platform in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, is proving its continued leadership with a substantial achievement: its total deposits have more than doubled in the preceding year and now stand at a commanding $35 billion. This remarkable growth not only solidifies Aave’s place at the forefront of DeFi liquidity but also highlights the rapidly rising demand for decentralized financial solutions. As the platform evolves, Aave is making strides in liquidity optimization, risk management, and introducing new innovations, such as its stablecoin, GHO, setting the stage for a new era in DeFi’s development. Aave V4: Unifying Liquidity Across Multiple Chains The awaiting Aave V4 upgrade is going to change the way liquidity is managed on the platform. One of the primary features of this upgrade is the introduction of a “hub and spoke” system that will manage and centralize liquidity while maintaining the platform’s ability to operate across multiple blockchains. This upgrade aims to solve the problem of liquidity fragmentation that has been common to DeFi platforms as they have spread across various chains. By unifying liquidity into a central hub, Aave will streamline access for both individual users and the larger institutional players who are surfacing in the DeFi space and make the platform way more efficient. This change is set to enhance capital efficiency by curtailing fragmentation, which will lower costs and allow for more seamless transactions. The ‘hub and spoke’ system makes sure that users across many blockchains can get at liquidity, and it does this without throwing the platform’s decentralized character under the bus. This feature, by the way, is very nice for institutions and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) that want to have efficient liquidity across many chains. Aave’s approach here signals its clear intent to be a scalable solution in the DeFi realm, addressing the needs of both small-scale investors and large, entity-type players. Enhanced Risk Management with Dynamic Pricing One more key development in the Aave V4 upgrade is the move to dynamic risk pricing. Reporting on this for Karpatkey, @sisyphos7919 notes that the new system will allow Aave to better serve its different classes of borrowers by offering them rates that are more in line with the risk they present to the protocol. This is a reflection of Aave’s broader push to improve its risk management systems. 1/ Last week, we hosted a conversation with @StaniKulechov to discuss @Aave ’s growth, the upcoming Aave V4 upgrade, and the expanding role of Aave’s GHO stablecoin. Here’s a breakdown of the key insights: — karpatkey (@karpatkey) March 6, 2025 With dynamic pricing, Aave intends to ensure that the capital allocation on its platform is optimized. That is, it wants to make sure that its higher-risk people (the ones with riskier borrow positions) are not draining capital from its lower-risk people. New this is particularly relevant for large-scale asset managers, and why we include it here, is that it allows the dynamic risk model to dictate more competitive rates while giving institutions more control of (and insight into) the risk they’re taking. The change in risk management is expected to push the Aave platform toward a greater level of efficiency, allowing it to contend more nimbly with the old guard of lending and borrowing market, namely banks, which have historically held sway in this space. Indeed, if anything, Aave’s efficiency gains from this shift could place it in a position where it also rivals the “stable” financial sector. GHO: Aave’s Native Stablecoin Gains Traction Aave’s homegrown stablecoin, GHO, is securing a foothold in the DeFi space—gaining traction, as it were—at an impressive speed. As said by Aave founder @StaniKulechov, GHO provides a borrowing cost that may be predicted (as opposed, say, to a borrowing cost that may not be as easily envisioned) and is expanding, seemingly without hindrance, to multiple blockchains. One of the major benefits of GHO is that it could help to close the gap between DeFi liquidity and traditional finance. In moving beyond the Aave platform, GHO has the potential to create some really exciting cross-chain adoption opportunities. Its design allows for a pretty seamless integration with a bunch of different blockchain networks. And that cross-chain capability could be a serious milestone for DeFi. It would make decentralized financial services that much more accessible and usable, with a good number of even core DeFi ecosystem users, which seems to be an end goal here. GHO’s increasing appeal speaks to the soaring demand for stablecoins in DeFi. As the DeFi sector develops, stablecoins like GHO are becoming a more essential component of the architecture, used to reduce volatility and as reliable collateral. But the GHO insurrection is still young, and as more users adopt this so-called next-gen stablecoin, it could play a critical role in the ongoing evolution of DeFi. Conclusion: Aave’s Future as a DeFi Pioneer Aave is continuously evolving, from its innovative V4 liquidity optimization to GHO’s increasing adoption. The V4 upgrade positions Aave as a liquidty unifier and as a dynamic risk pricer (the ‘tokenomic’ terms for what V4 is supposed to do); this cements Aave as a DeFi leader. Meanwhile, GHO is moving out into new chains, potentially creating well-functioning markets across these chains. GHO’s role in this potential market, as a bridge between TradFi and DeFi, is an exciting possibility. Experiments such as these are what make Aave a trailblazer in DeFi. The decentralized finance (DeFi) sector keeps growing, and Aave is one of the leading projects in this realm, standing out for its innovative approach to not only lending and borrowing but also to the very architecture of monetary systems in a DeFi world. Projects like Aave and the many others in the DeFi space are well positioned to eventually bridge the current gap between centralized and decentralized finance. They do this largely by attempting to mimic the functionality of platforms like the Nasdaq Stock Market while also guaranteeing some semblance of user privacy—an objective not easily attained when one considers the growing power of the state.

On March 2, 2025, Trump revealed that the U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve would include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA), aiming to position the U.S. as a leader in crypto adoption. Crypto prices fall as US strategic reserve plan disappoints traders https://t.co/uFJ3iSmoJc — FT Markets (@FTMarkets) March 7, 2025 Initially, this sparked bullish momentum, pushing XRP to $2.96. However, once it was clarified that the reserve would only hold seized crypto assets, not newly purchased ones, the enthusiasm faded, and XRP dropped back to $2.35. Is the SEC Dropping Its Case Against Ripple (XRP)? Despite XRP’s pullback, there’s speculation that its SEC lawsuit might be coming to an end. Anthony Scaramucci, founder of SkyBridge Capital, recently claimed that the SEC may have dropped its lawsuit against Ripple. He made this statement during an interview on The Wolf of All Streets podcast, comparing the case to other SEC withdrawals involving ConsenSys, Gemini, and Coinbase. BREAKING: Anthony Scaramucci, a former White House Director of Communications, suggests that the SEC has dropped its case against Ripple! #XRP pic.twitter.com/Sd8rHSjEiO — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) March 4, 2025 However, there’s no official confirmation from the SEC or Ripple, making this purely speculative. The lawsuit, originally filed in December 2020, accused Ripple of selling XRP as an unregistered security. While Ripple secured a partial legal victory in 2023, a ruling found that direct XRP sales to institutions violated securities laws, resulting in a $125 million fine. If the SEC withdraws, XRP could see a major rally, but uncertainty remains until an official announcement is made. Key Takeaways: Scaramucci suggested the SEC dropped its lawsuit, but no proof has surfaced. Ripple won a partial legal victory in 2023 but was fined $125 million. XRP could surge if the case ends, but uncertainty may delay bullish momentum. XRP Price Prediction: Triangle Breakdown Signals Bearish Bias XRP recently broke below a symmetrical triangle pattern on the 4-hour chart, reinforcing a bearish outlook. Key Resistance: $2.45 (50-period EMA) Immediate Support: $2.21, with downside potential to $2.03 The rejection from the descending trendline, combined with weak market sentiment, increases the likelihood of further selling. If XRP fails to reclaim $2.45, it could test $2.21 and potentially $1.88 if bearish momentum continues. A break back above $2.45 would be the first sign of bullish recovery, with a move toward $2.64 needed to confirm upside potential. Traders should monitor volume trends before taking new positions.

41325980,https://nulltx.com/?p=146790,1741432492,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"NFT Trading Volumes Decline Sharply, Reflecting Broader Crypto Market Slowdown",https://nulltx.com/nft-trading-volumes-decline-sharply-reflecting-broader-crypto-market-slowdown/,"In recent months, the non-fungible token (NFT) market , once thought to be booming, appears to be on a steep and rapid downhill course. This appears to be especially the case for February 2025, which looks to be quite harsh in terms of downturns. For that month, and according to DappRadar, the NFT trading volumes appear to have plunged—by more than 60%—when we compare this to January. Unfortunately, January itself had already seen a 26% drop from December 2024, which had seen a high of $1.36 billion in trading volume. NFT trading volumes are on the decline. This is occurring during a market correction in the cryptocurrency sector, which has experienced a major retracement from its record highs in 2024. For instance, Bitcoin, which was virtually at $109,000 at its peak, has taken a downturn. This downturn reflects the caution that investors seem to be exercising across the spectrum of digital assets. The once-enthusiastic NFT market hasn’t been spared either. Nowadays, many collectors and investors seem to be pulling back in response to the weakness that has infected the prices of cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. A Market in Decline: NFT Volume and Activity Drop NFTs, initially perceived as a revolution in digital ownership and collectibles, have experienced a dramatic slowdown this year, with the enthusiasm surrounding them diminishing greatly. This is evidenced by a sharp drop in the trading volumes and the overall NFT marketplace activity. This decline is not at all surprising when one considers the unstable crypto market coupled with the current economic contraction. Of course, these trade volumes are but the tip of the NFT market iceberg, as the fervent interest in the NFT space has basically disappeared, along with the prices. 2/ Dapp activity cooled off, with daily unique active wallets (dUAW) dropping 8% to 24 million, though AI, Social, and NFT categories saw user growth. pic.twitter.com/WsOssh3mLb — DappRadar (@DappRadar) March 6, 2025 Although the newest figures show a major decrease in the amount of trades within the NFT space, the peak numbers are still striking. In December 2024, the height of the NFT trading phenomenon, trading volumes reached approximately $1.36 billion. The following month should have seen a good amount of continued trading as the NFT market seemed healthy and investors were generally bullish on anything related to blockchain technology. Instead, the NFT trading volumes dropped 26% in January and then fell off a cliff—a 50% drop—in February. The NFT trading slump isn’t entirely separate from the broader crypto market downturn. The health of the NFT sector, for instance, has been closely tied to Bitcoin’s market performance. Bitcoin, which reached an all-time high of $109,000 in 2024, has dropped since then, mainly because of some uncertainty around a few key global issues. One of the more colorful factors affecting the broader market sentiment has been the ongoing uncertainty over former U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposed tariff plans, which have added a nice little shock to the markets. The interest in NFTs—especially those that are valued in digital currencies—has waned, but not due to a lack of desire. Each day that NFTs exist is another day that the inevitable realization of their various potentials creeps closer. In a not-so-distant future, the types of things that are currently being called “art” will be as easily traded in a decentralized-gallery-as-hedge-fund ecosystem as they will be on the walls of a physical museum. Dapp Activity Cools, but Some Categories Show Growth Although trading volume has dropped sharply, NFTs have, nevertheless, retained a top spot in the reports from DappRadar. The next few paragraphs will shine a light on some of the findings in this latest February report from DappRadar regarding Dapp activity. Using the metrics supplied, the report indicates that Dapp activity is on the wane. 1. Besides NFTs, the other major category of dApps is DeFi apps. Much like NFT trading has cooled, so too has the DeFi dApp activity. The report indicates that the number of people using dApps in DeFi has dropped 8%. Not all sectors within the larger Dapp ecosystem are losing out. Some categories, particularly AI, Social, and NFTs, have actually grown in user activity amid the sector slump. These categories have continued to show user activity resilience, as new use cases and emerging applications pop up on the blockchain. AI-powered decentralized applications, social platforms, and NFTs have offered unique functionalities and user engagement features to pull in new users, even as overall Dapp activity sits in the doldrums. This shift toward the more niche categories could indicate a diversification in the Dapp ecosystem. Users may be seeking platforms that offer more than just speculative trading opportunities. The growth of AI and social Dapps, for example, suggests that blockchain technology is moving beyond just financial applications and NFTs. And is starting to gain traction in new, emerging areas. Looking Ahead: Will NFTs Recover? Broader uncertainty in the cryptocurrency market casts a shadow over the future of NFTs. The trading volume slowdown is worrying, but it doesn’t have to be the NFT market’s death knell. Like the rest of the crypto space, NFTs could just be in a boom/bust cycle. And hey, some crypto veterans are already touting upcoming recovery potential, thanks to new innovations and use cases. At present, the indications are that NFT investors are taking a more cautious approach, with many preferring to wait for the overall market to stabilize before they again invest in what has become a very speculative subset of the crypto universe. Once we see a more matured market, there’s a reasonable chance that a number of unique digital assets could then make the jump from high-risk, speculative investment vehicles to stable, safe, long-term-value digital collectibles, art, and other one-of-a-kind purchases. To sum up, the NFT market’s sharp drop in early 2025 mirrors what is happening in the wider cryptocurrency space. As the crypto bull has pulled back, the once-sky-high volumes of NFT trading have thudded back to earth. In their place, for now, are mostly crickets. The immediate future of the NFT space seems as uncertain as it does with respect to the broader market. Still, a few Dapp types continue to grow, and the blockchain space keeps on innovating. What might these developments mean for the NFT universe? Here are some things that could happen. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

41326081,https://nulltx.com/?p=146789,1741432663,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Sonic’s Stablecoin Surge and Record TVL Set the Stage for Continued Growth,https://nulltx.com/sonics-stablecoin-surge-and-record-tvl-set-the-stage-for-continued-growth/,"Sonic, a decentralized finance (DeFi) project supported by the famous DeFi architect Andre Cronje, has recently been in the news for its impressive developments in both stablecoin issuance and total value locked (TVL). As DeFiLlama reported earlier today, the stablecoin ecosystem of Sonic has seen a remarkable 106% increase over the last seven days, reaching a total of $252 million in stablecoins. According to DeFiLlama, the stablecoin scale of the Sonic supported by Andre Cronje has increased by 106% to $252 million in the past 7 days, making it one of the L1s with the largest stablecoin growth, of which USDC accounts for 77.21%. However, $195 million worth of stablecoins… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 7, 2025 This rapid expansion not only has Sonic approaching $1 billion in total value locked (TVL), now at $948 million per DeFiLlama, but it has also put the project in a position as one of the layer-1 (L1) protocols seeing the largest growth in stablecoin adoption! The growth of stablecoins is especially pronounced in the case of Sonic’s ecosystem, where the majority—$195 million—of its stablecoin assets are bridged stablecoins. These are digital assets moved across different blockchains, typically from one layer-1 network to another. This growth underscores not only the adoption of Sonic’s protocol by the DeFi community but also the burgeoning demand for cross-chain interoperability. Sonic’s Record TVL and $S Price Outlook Along with the enormous increase in stablecoin use, Sonic achieved another huge landmark—its total value locked (TVL). As of yesterday, it hit an all-time high (ATH) of $750 million. But what does this really mean? The long-standing “DeFi is dead” narrative continues to bubble across crypto Twitter. Yet despite the absolutely horrid state of the crypto markets, Sonic (and other EVM-compatible protocols) are raising millions (or billions) of dollars across TVL. So, is DeFi truly dead? Don't get all carried away by the Trump hype @SonicLabs TVL hit an ATH of $750M yesterday. And I couldn't help but notice the obvious contrast between the TVL and DEX trading volume. Could it be that people are avidly staking, because of the $S Point airdrop, or is there… https://t.co/RuVyHr0nnf pic.twitter.com/WsYcu8IIUk — Brill (@thenameisbrill) March 7, 2025 Sonic’s native token, $S, is influenced directly by the TVL growth. It is presently trading at $5. Simultaneously, the token has been on a substantial increase path as the platform’s TVL has been encountering serial all-time highs. If the current pace holds, the platform’s total value locked could easily challenge the $1 billion mark by the end of Q1 2025. If $S has even a shallow reversion to the $1 level, that would mark a 100% increase over the next 16 months for the token. This possibility for growth illustrates the wider trend in DeFi, where platforms with robust liquidity and utility see both their TVL and token prices rise as they keep building out their ecosystems and recruiting fresh users. The surety that Sonic has shown in its aptitude for rapid scaling is becoming ever more apparent, and it seems that investors are starting to pay attention. A Competitive Edge in Stablecoin Adoption and Cross-Chain Interoperability Sonic is not your average DeFi platform, and that is readily apparent as soon as one starts to explore its myriad features and functions. Unlike many DeFi protocols that have become far too entangled in their own complexities, Sonic has remained refreshingly straightforward. Indeed, its very genesis was rooted in concepts of simplicity and usability. Moreover, Sonic continues to differentiate itself in the activities it engages in and the market segments it focuses on. Most notably, this is the case with stablecoins. The fact that $195 million of Sonic’s stablecoins are bridged assets speaks to the platform’s rising stature as a cross-chain destination. Bridged stablecoins let you move assets freely between different blockchains—an ability that is crucial in a multi-chain ecosystem like the one currently developing in DeFi. That unfettered movement of liquidity across chains is in itself a competitive advantage, and the same is true for using Sonic as a pathway to that liquidity. Additionally, Sonic enjoys the backing of Andre Cronje, one of the most important people in the DeFi space. From a pure credibility standpoint, it is tough to argue in favor of any projects that Cronje is not involved with. His influence and past success with projects like Yearn Finance and Keep3rV1 help make Sonic appear more credible to potential investors. Of course, appearance and reality overlap at some level, and having someone with Cronje’s clout associated with your project undoubtedly helps. But is Sonic pumped up by Cronje’s association? Unlikely. Cronje himself is too busy to get involved in pumping and dumping projects. The Road Ahead for Sonic The forward-moving Sonic has established both stablecoin growth and total value locked (TVL) in its system as advantageous, secure features of its platform. The current trend, which sees stablecoins deployed across multichain systems, is still in its infancy. Yet, if it were to continue (which seems to be a strong possibility), Sonic could be a DeFi player with stablecoins valued at about $1 billion by the end of the first quarter. That could very well add upward pricing momentum to the prover $S. DeFi is developing into a clear sector of the crypto market, and we are starting to see reasonable levels of competition between different DeFi protocols. In this increasingly competitive space, some projects do seem to warrant a closer look based on their growth rates and certain potentially compelling aspects of their setups. One such project is called Sonic. Sonic’s appearance in the scene has been something of a whirlwind, with its stablecoin issuance and total value locked in (TVL) growing at a staggering clip. To sum up, Sonic’s latest results in stablecoin proliferation, TVL, and $S token price action show that the project is on a clear upward trajectory. If it can keep up the pace, Sonic seems set to keep galloping right along and possibly become a major player in the DeFi ecosystem. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

ZachXBT shared that the complaint detailed how Larsen’s private keys — or code to access one’s token holdings — were stored in LastPass, the widely used password manager that suffered a major breach in 2022. At the time, hackers stole source code and technical data by compromising a developer's account. By November of that year, they used this access to infiltrate a cloud storage system, stealing encrypted customer password vaults and unencrypted metadata for an estimated 25 million users. Although ‘vaults’ were encrypted, weak or reused master passwords could be brute-forced, exposing stored data. Hackers exploited this vulnerability, accessing Larsen’s keys and siphoning off the XRP, valued at $150 million at the time of the theft and over $600 million as of Saturday’s prices. “A forfeiture complaint filed yesterday by US law enforcement revealed the cause for the ~$150M (283M XRP) hack of Ripple co-founder, Chris Larsen's wallet in Jan 2024 was the result of storing private keys in LastPass (password manager which was hacked in 2022),” ZachXBT wrote on his Telegram channel. “Up to this point Chris Larsen had not publicly disclosed the cause of the theft,” he added.

The fallout from the 2022 LastPass hack has been extensive and remain ongoing.

The downturn was mostly driven by price falls in equities. Every billionaire on Forbes list , bar Warren Buffet, saw their net worth trickle down at the start of the month, as the effects of a Trumpian market, which started back in November 2024, continue to wear off. Elon Musk’s fortune sheds $62 billion Forbes still places Elon Musk as the world’s richest person, but February was a month to forget for the Tesla and xAI CEO. A decline in Tesla shares wiped out $62 billion from his fortune, aided by the electric vehicle maker’s loss of one-quarter of its market value in 2025. Musk became the first billionaire to surpass a $400 billion net worth in December last year. His privately held artificial intelligence firm, xAI, had grown in value due to the capital new investors had poured into the tech company. But by February 10, Tesla’s stock had slid enough to take his wealth below the $400 billion mark. Trump’s “First Buddy” has made enemies by taking up a role in Washington as a special advisor to the Office of the President, and founder of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has cut thousands of federal jobs in the past month. As of March 1, Musk’s net worth is estimated at about $359 billion. Zuckerberg overtakes Bezos for no. 2 spot Mark Zuckerberg had a relatively better month compared to his billionaire counterparts, although he did count losses as well. The Meta Platforms CEO climbed to the second spot in the rankings for the first time, taking Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ spot. Zuckerberg clinched the world’s second-wealthiest person position largely due to a downtick in Amazon stock, which saw an 11% decline in February, erasing more than $23 billion from Bezos’ fortune. He begins March with an estimated fortune of nearly $231 billion, while Bezos now stands at roughly $227 billion. Oracle’s Larry Ellison stays fourth Larry Ellison retained fourth place, but his wealth took an $8.8 billion hit after Oracle shares fell about 2% over the past month. Ellison was present on January 21, the day after Donald Trump was inaugurated as US president when the latter announced the Stargate Project. The initiative, involving Oracle, OpenAI, Japan’s SoftBank, and UAE-based MGX, will reportedly invest $500 billion over four years to build AI infrastructure, primarily data centers across the United States. Bernard Arnault sees losses after LVMH shares slip Fifth on the list is French luxury goods magnate Bernard Arnault, CEO and chairman of LVMH, who saw his wealth drop by $2.8 billion following a slight decline in the company’s share price. He was the world’s richest person for the first quarter of 2024, but Musk overtook him in May. Earlier this year, Arnault nominated two of his sons, Alexandre and Frédéric, to the board of LVMH. His daughter Delphine, who oversees Dior, and his son Antoine were already serving on the board. Arnault seemingly likes to keep the top spots of his businesses within the family. Warren Buffett gains $15 billion as Berkshire Hathaway rises 94-year-old Warren Buffett was the only billionaire in the top ten to see his fortune grow in February. Shares of the conglomerate he heads, Berkshire Hathaway , climbed by nearly 10%, adding about $15 billion to his net worth. Buffett now holds an estimated fortune of $161 billion. Google Founders hit slag over Alphabet stock decline Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin both suffered heavy losses last month as shares of Alphabet, Google’s parent company, plummeted by more than 13%. Page lost $26 billion, bringing down his estimated net worth to $141.61 billion. His wealth took a deep cut in late November, after the US Department of Justice pushed Google to divest its Chrome browser, planning to reduce its dominance in the online market. Google clapped back, cautioning the DOJ that the order could harm consumers and America’s technological prowess. His partner Brin, who co-founded Google with Page in 1998, also saw his net worth fall to $135.4 billion at the eighth position. He recently came out of retirement to contribute to Google’s Gemini AI chatbot project and was credited as a core contributor when the model launched in December. The last two names on the list are fashion business Zara-parent Inditex founder Amancio Ortega, and former Microsoft CEO and NBA franchise Los Angeles Clippers owner Steve Ballmer, who are worth $121.9 and $118.9 billion, respectively.

This technical formation suggests that a breakout or breakdown is impending. How traders choose to interact with this situation could set the stage for a price move worth up to 20 percent in either direction. For Bitcoin, this moment of decision comes after a lull in relative price stability and is energized by some important technical and fundamental factors. #Bitcoin $BTC is consolidating within a triangle, setting the stage for a potential 20% price move! pic.twitter.com/ELPb5wjar9 — Ali (@ali_charts) March 7, 2025 Triangle Pattern Signals Possible Price Move Bitcoin’s recent price action has entered a consolidation phase, confined within a triangle pattern. Such patterns often precede sharp price moves, with traders keeping their eyes peeled for a breakout above or a breakdown below the triangle’s boundaries. The range between key support and resistance levels suggests that Bitcoin is poised for a price swing of about 20% in either direction once it breaks out of its current range. Right now, both technical and on-chain data are driving Bitcoin’s price, and analysts are dissecting the most recent support and resistance levels to get a handle on where the crypto could be headed next. Per the Cost Basis Distribution, one of the key supports under the current price is at about $59,882.62, where more than 220,000 BTC were bought. If the price were to drop to that level, it could serve as a solid floor that would most likely keep Bitcoin from declining much further. Conversely, the levels of resistance that Bitcoin encounters are equally apparent. The strongest resistance directly above Bitcoin’s existing price lies at $98,081.72, a level at which 320,040 BTC were amassed. This area could give Bitcoin some serious trouble if it attempts to push through to new all-time highs, as there’s a healthy supply of BTC sitting in this range. Should Bitcoin reach this height, it would almost certainly contend with a solid wall of selling as the accumulated holders look to cash in. Based on #Bitcoin Cost Basis Distribution, the strongest support below the current price is at $59,882.62, with 220,150 $BTC accumulated. Meanwhile, the toughest resistance above is at $98,081.72, where 320,040 #BTC were acquired. pic.twitter.com/2w4zqN2dD3 — Ali (@ali_charts) March 7, 2025 These two levels are—$59,882.62 support and $98,081.72 resistance. They stage potential volatility. With such a large price range between support and resistance, it’s possible that Bitcoin could see a swift 20% price move. Long-Term Holders Continue to Accumulate Alongside the technical indicators, holders of Bitcoin over the long term continue to accumulate the cryptocurrency, which, if anything, signifies a super-strong market confidence. Holdings of long-term holders have shot up, with the latest report indicating that they added an unspeakable 85,000 Bitcoin just in the month of June alone. Long-term holders are accumulating! The supply held by long-term holders has increased by 85,000 #Bitcoin $BTC in the past month. pic.twitter.com/udy0Aqg6BW — Ali (@ali_charts) March 6, 2025 This shows quite a clear picture; even with all the recent hullabaloos, there’s a segment of the investing world that is very, very confident in Bitcoin’s future. This accumulation trend among long-term holders is truly significant in that it reflects the growing and apparently widespread sentiment that Bitcoin is nothing less than an appreciation prospect. On the whole, these holders appear unwilling to trade in and out and instead seem committed to Bitcoin for the long haul. They have given no real signs that they expect anything but higher prices in the future. So the potential payoff for Bitcoin could be anything but negligible. This accumulation also accentuates the ever-increasing shift in market sentiment. Although short-term price fluctuations can lead to fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) among traders, the commitment from long-term holders of Bitcoin reaffirms the overall market outlook. It puts stable, unfudgable faith back into the market. As more Bitcoin is held by long-term investors, the amount of Bitcoin available in the open market decreases. Therefore, if the amount of Bitcoin held by the public continues to increase and if the price did not seem capable of going back down, would it not seem logical to assume that upward market pressure might be evident in Bitcoin’s near future? Bitcoin ETF Outflows Signal Short-Term Concerns In spite of the potent accumulation from long-term holders, the Bitcoin market has been encountering short-term tests. On March 6, the Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) experienced a net outflow of $134 million. This was the fourth straight day of outflows from the Bitcoin ETF. Although the ETF itself isn’t the main vehicle of institutional investment anymore, the outflows have raised some eyebrows. “Is demand for Bitcoin through traditional investment vehicles kind of waning for some reason?” That seems to be the question that has some folks concerned. On March 6, the Bitcoin spot ETF had a total net outflow of $134 million, which continued for 4 consecutive days; the Ethereum spot ETF had a total net outflow of $35.8867 million. https://t.co/59u0BnEqLG — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 7, 2025 Even though the outflows are significant, they might not be suggesting a long-term trend. On the contrary, these outflows could just be a response to the current short-term volatility or to a shift in the not-so-recent past in institutional investors’ strategies toward Bitcoin. But what’s most concerning here is the consecutive nature of these outflows. This does seem to convey some amount of caution on institutional investors’ part as they reevaluate their Bitcoin exposure amid broader market uncertainty. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Bitcoin? Bitcoin’s current state of consolidation within a triangular pattern has naturally directed most of the attention toward its most salient support and resistance levels. At present, these seem to have been smoothened up into a near-horizontal span of demand between $59,882.62 and a rather liquid upper supply span split between $98,081.72 and $100,000. Merging technical chart patterns, long-term investor accumulation, and short-term ETF outflows offers a cloudy view of the Bitcoin price in the next few weeks. The market may see increased volatility as Bitcoin nears a key breakout point, with a potential 20% move in either direction. At the same time, investors must stay on high alert, looking for indications of price action that might give clues as to where Bitcoin is headed next. If the price moves significantly in either direction, it will break out of the current consolidation phase. And given how long it’s been coiling, the next breakout—up or down—is likely to lead to some big price changes. Wherever Bitcoin goes next, the next move is almost bound to be big.

The Fear & Greed Index presently sits at 25, cautioning a fearful sentiment among investors. Bitcoin’s short-lived uptrend above the $90,000 incurred selling pressure, leading to a trend reversal. Macroeconomic concerns, including recent U.S. trade tariffs and sustained ETF outflows, are contributing to the ongoing bearish trend. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction: Bitcoin has struggled to maintain its position above the $90,000 mark, tracing back to $87,289.57, down 2.12% in the last 24 hours. The market’s bearish sentiment is reflected in its declining 24-hour volume, which has dropped by 11.28% to $51.61 billion. Bitcoin Price Prediction Next Week If Bitcoin fails to hold above $85,000, a retest of the $82,000 level is likely. A break below this level could push BTC toward the $80,000 support. However, a bounce from the current range could see Bitcoin attempting to reclaim $90,000, with a potential move toward $95,000 if momentum strengthens.

While CoinGecko co-founder Bobby Ong believes that “meme Coins are dead now,” he noted that “they will be back.” Ong notes that meme coins have historically been cyclical, with a small number managing to survive multiple market cycles. The Meme Coin Collapse Explained The launch of TRUMP and MELANIA tokens marked the peak of the meme coin mania. According to Ong, these launches drained liquidity and investor interest from the broader meme coin space and signaled the end of a speculative cycle. The subsequent collapse of LIBRA, in particular, shattered the illusion that meme coins were “fair launches” and exposed the reality of insider advantages and coordinated profiteering. This led to a sharp decline in key market indicators, with metrics from Pump.fun – one of the most prominent meme coin platforms – falling by over 90% from their February peak. However, tokens like OG meme coin Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and even Bonk (BONK) serve as examples of how strong community-driven memes can persist, particularly those that cultivate dedicated and passionate followings. The increasing ease of launching meme coins has made competition fierce, and only those projects that successfully capture and maintain attention will have a chance to endure. In the long run, the meme coin market is expected to follow an extreme power law, where the vast majority of tokens fail while a tiny fraction thrives, Ong said in his latest analysis . VC Greed to Regulatory Gaps Shifting the focus to the broader industry, Ong explained that the meme coin frenzy was partly fueled by retail investors’ frustration with venture capital (VC)-backed “low float, high FDV” tokens that launched at inflated valuations in early 2024. Many of these tokens were structured to benefit early investors while offering little upside for later buyers. This frustration created a demand for alternative opportunities, which led to the rapid rise of meme coins. The debate over launch mechanisms continues, with some arguing that structured launches like Jupiter’s JUP model – where initial liquidity pools constrained price movements – offer a better approach than volatile airdrop-driven launches. Alternative fundraising models, such as curated angel investing platforms like Echo.xyz, have also gained traction. However, Ong argued that regulators, particularly in the United States, bear some responsibility for the meme coin boom, as their failure to establish clear token issuance frameworks has driven projects toward speculative, often meaningless tokens. Looking ahead, Ong remains optimistic about the broader trend of tokenization, noting that the success of launchpads like Pump.fun has spurred the development of new platforms for AI agents, DAOs, and other experimental tokens. Traditional finance (TradFi) institutions are also exploring tokenization, with US treasuries leading the way and more complex financial products expected to follow. Meanwhile, in January 2025 alone, over 600,000 tokens were created and more than 5.5 million are tracked on GeckoTerminal.

One project drawing increasing attention is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)—a decentralized lending platform designed to provide passive income opportunities while allowing users to keep full control of their assets. With Phase 2 of its presale nearly sold out, many are securing their holdings now, expecting rising demand in the coming months. Meanwhile, Chainlink (LINK) continues to strengthen its role in blockchain integrations, and XRP remains a key player in cross-border transactions. Both assets have established use cases, but for those looking to maximize their portfolio before the next bull run, getting in early on Mutuum Finance could be a strategic move. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) The Mutuum Finance presale is rapidly progressing, with over 4,500 investors already participating and more than $2.4 million raised. With 75% of Phase 2 now completed, the token is set to move into Phase 3, where the price will increase. Investors are acting fast to secure MUTM at $0.015, knowing that as demand surges, future phases will come at a higher entry price. This structured presale model not only rewards early investors but also ensures a steady and sustainable price appreciation as the project gains traction. As the next phase approaches, those waiting on the sidelines are feeling the pressure to secure their share before the price adjusts. Mutuum Finance is building a decentralized lending system, allowing users to borrow and lend assets through two key lending models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C): Lenders deposit assets into liquidity pools, and borrowers can access these funds under automated interest rate adjustments, ensuring fair borrowing costs and competitive returns. Peer-to-Peer (P2P): Borrowers and lenders interact directly, negotiating loan terms for assets that may not typically be supported in traditional lending pools. Another feature of Mutuum Finance is its overcollateralized stablecoin, which allows borrowers to mint a decentralized, dollar-pegged asset backed by locked collateral. Unlike traditional stablecoins that rely on centralized reserves, Mutuum’s stablecoin is issued solely through smart contracts, ensuring full transparency and security. Additionally, the interest paid on stablecoin loans goes directly into the protocol’s treasury, strengthening the system over time. This creates a self-sustaining ecosystem, where liquidity remains secure and predictable, a key advantage over traditional lending models. Ripple (XRP) XRP experienced a strong upward movement in early 2025, with its price climbing from $2.23 to $2.99 within a short period. This growth has been driven by increasing investor interest and broader market adoption. Recently, XRP was included in the U.S. strategic crypto reserve, reinforcing its role in the financial sector. As institutional adoption expands, trading volume has surged, reflecting heightened market activity around the asset. Analysts anticipate that XRP will remain one of the leading cryptocurrencies in the next market cycle, with its price expected to see further growth. Given its established position in global finance and its continued integration into cross-border payment systems, XRP is considered one of the top investment choices ahead of the bull run. Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink has seen a surge in network activity, with new wallet addresses reaching their highest level since January. Its technology continues to be integrated across multiple blockchain projects, further solidifying its position as a leading provider of decentralized oracles. Price movements have been influenced by growing demand, with LINK trading near key support levels. As adoption increases, on-chain activity has strengthened, reflecting rising investor confidence. Analysts suggest that LINK is positioned to be one of the leading assets in the next bull run, driven by its essential role in securing smart contract data across multiple blockchain networks. With its expanding utility and increasing institutional use, LINK remains a key investment choice before the market surges further. Why MUTM Offers the Biggest Upside Unlike LINK and XRP, which are already well-established, Mutuum Finance is still in its early stages, presenting investors with an opportunity for significant upside potential. The presale is quickly progressing, with Phase 2 nearly sold out and Phase 3 about to start. With a structured lending model, passive income incentives, and an integrated stablecoin, Mutuum Finance is proving to be a strong contender in DeFi. As more investors take notice, MUTM’s presale demand continues to grow, making this a key moment to secure tokens before the next price increase.

In just the last 48 hours, well-heeled investors have added more than a million $ETH to their portfolios. This notable accumulation, by high-net-worth individuals, has led to rampant speculation that these big players have some sort of insider knowledge or are at least making a very bullish bet on Ethereum ahead of what many hope will be a sharp price rebound. Whales bought 1.10 million #Ethereum $ETH in the last 48 hours! Do they know something we don't? pic.twitter.com/ucSTelerNC — Ali (@ali_charts) March 6, 2025 Ethereum’s MVRV and Historical Buying Patterns Ethereum’s recent price movements have brought the asset nearer to levels that have offered long-term investors solid returns in the past. Since 2016, buying Ethereum whenever it dips below the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio has proved to be a profitable strategy. The MVRV is a metric that compares the current market value of the asset to its realized value. When the Ethereum has traded below the MVRV, it has typically indicated a favorable entry point. The asset provides investors with strong returns in the subsequent market rally. Since 2016, buying #Ethereum $ETH whenever it dips below the MVRV has consistently provided the best returns! pic.twitter.com/7WDpwLkNvn — Ali (@ali_charts) March 7, 2025 Considering this strategy’s historical success, a watching cohort of traders has trained its collective attention on whether the present MVRV dip beneath might just be signaling Ethereum’s next big buying opportunity. Another rumbling factor is the Ethereum whale class. These accumulation-heavy market actors, in seeming concert, have pushed Ethereum prices down to where they are today. Do they see current price levels as a similar value to what they were in the past, expecting another big Ether cycle pay-off? Key Resistance and Support Levels for Ethereum Ethereum’s price chart is currently spotlighting some essential obstacles, with traders and analysts directing their attention toward certain crucial levels. These individuals gauge these levels to try and understand where the next principal price move might occur. The biggest sticking point for Ethereum right now is the resistance zone around $2,460. At this level, 10.95 million holders apprehended 64.52 million ETH. This means there is a buttload of supply at this price point. If Ethereum can punch through this level, it could reignite the somewhat muted bullish momentum that we have seen in this market. The biggest hurdle for #Ethereum is at $2,460, where 10.95 million investors acquired 64.52 million $ETH . Breaking through this level will reignite #ETH bullish momentum! pic.twitter.com/tZLGuOPzrH — Ali (@ali_charts) March 7, 2025 Conversely, as long as Ethereum stays above $2,200, the price could well see a rebound. It’s hovered around there too many times to not consider the $2,200 level a psychological support price in the previous market cycle—and in this one, so far. Since 2016, buying #Ethereum $ETH whenever it dips below the MVRV has consistently provided the best returns! pic.twitter.com/7WDpwLkNvn — Ali (@ali_charts) March 7, 2025 Besides giving off good vibes, the weekly chart’s TD Sequential indicator (a popular technical tool for identifying potential price reversals) has flashed a buy signal for Ethereum. And not just any buy signal, but a decent-for-bulls buy signal that comes with an A13. An A13 buy signal happens when the TD Sequential indicator is showing an apparent imminent price reversal to the upside. And that is what we have in the picture above for Ethereum right now. More specifically, we have a series of consecutive price candles that say this is happening. In terms of trading rebound opportunities, this is a major signal. If Ethereum holds even better than it has until now, at around $2,200, then it could be just about ready for a price push upward. Bullish Potential if Ethereum Breaks $2,350 In the short term, one of the key price levels for Ethereum is $2,350. Should Ethereum manage to regain this price point, analysts think the cryptocurrency could chalk up another significant rally—this time, toward $3,260. The price bands suggest that regaining $2,350 would be a critical move, potentially triggering a strong upward push that might take Ethereum to the next resistance level. The target of $3,260 appears quite achievable when we consider that Ethereum has shown time and again that it can break key price levels and surge upward. For it to get to the target, however, it would need to increase substantially from where it is now. This increase, of course, is what long-time Ethereum bulls are banking on. Ethereum ETF Outflows and Market Sentiment In spite of the favorable technical outlook for Ethereum, the market is addressing some immediate challenges. On March 6, the Ethereum spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) saw a net outflow of $35.89 million. This represents a change in investor sentiment, as big institutional investors seem to be pulling money out of Ethereum-based products. While the outflows do look concerning, they don’t have to signal anything nefarious or a trend that’s going to last for a long time. They could just be short-term market adjustments or profit-taking by institutional players who have been holding onto Ethereum for a long time. On March 6, the Bitcoin spot ETF had a total net outflow of $134 million, which continued for 4 consecutive days; the Ethereum spot ETF had a total net outflow of $35.8867 million. https://t.co/59u0BnEqLG — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 7, 2025 The outflows from Ethereum’s ETF might also signal a shift among institutional investors who are reallocating capital to other assets within the cryptocurrency space or to traditional markets. But, as far as we’re all aware, such reallocations aren’t being driven by any significant negative developments intrinsic to Ethereum itself. Rather, the context here is that Ethereum’s strong fundamentals and the positive signals from both whale activity and the technical picture are, as far as anyone can tell, keeping a strong overall vibes in terms of market sentiment. The Road Ahead for Ethereum Ethereum is currently consolidating around vital support levels, which gives it potential as an opportunity for traders and investors. The effects of the recent ETF outflows are still being mulled over by the market, but on a technical basis, Ethereum has been printing some bullish signals of late. The price recovery that followed a recent dip took Ethereum back to the $2,300–$2,400 zone, where it has been slowly working its way up. As for upside targets, a break above $2,460 could send the price to around $3,260. While Ethereum’s price keeps moving through a set of really important price levels, it’s worth keeping an eye on for any further developments with whale accumulation, ETF flows, and whallicate buying which could drop us some big clues about the next major move. At the moment, the whales remain in buy mode and have been for some time. On top of that, buying below the MVRV continues to be a sign that whatever we might think of price action at the moment, Ethereum is a good asset to buy.

Identifying the next high-potential asset is key as investors weigh their options in a rapidly shifting landscape. Why is BitLemons ($BLEM) Gaining So Much Traction? The emergence of BitLemons ($BLEM) has been nothing short of spectacular, solidifying its place as a major disruptor in the blockchain gaming sector. Operating in a $450 billion traditional casino industry, BitLemons offers a fully functional crypto casino with over 8,000 games from top-tier providers like Evolution and Pragmatic. Its revenue-sharing model, coupled with a deflationary supply and staking rewards, has positioned it as an attractive prospect for investors. Momentum continues to surge, with Stage 2 of the presale currently priced at $0.02, following a successful private seed round that raised over $1.6 million. With only 16.6 million tokens remaining before the next price increase, investors are moving quickly to secure their allocation. Additionally, BitLemons boasts dual security audits from SpyWolf and SolidProof, setting it apart from competitors in the GambleFi space. With a well-structured buyback and burn mechanism, BitLemons is shaping up to be more than just a trend—it’s a long-term powerhouse. Can XRP Secure Its Place in the Global Financial System? The spotlight is on XRP as anticipation builds around the White House Crypto Summit. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse is expected to engage in discussions with policymakers and financial regulators. Speculation suggests the summit could address regulatory frameworks and even the potential for cryptocurrencies like XRP to be considered in national reserves. This has renewed investors’ optimism, reinforcing XRP’s relevance in cross-border payments and institutional finance. Over the past week, XRP has shown steady upward momentum, with trading volumes increasing by approximately 7%, reflecting renewed investor interest. Price levels have remained above key support zones, with resistance near the $0.65 mark. While macroeconomic trends have influenced short-term movements, XRP’s long-term viability remains tied to its institutional adoption and regulatory clarity. Is Hyperliquid (HYPE) Running Out of Momentum? Unlike XRP, Hyperliquid (HYPE) has seen little major news or developments over the past 48 hours. While the project maintains a stable presence in the market, the absence of fresh catalysts has left traders searching for direction. From a technical perspective, HYPE’s market activity has remained relatively stable, with trading volumes fluctuating between 2-3% daily. Price action has held within a tight range, lacking the breakout momentum seen in other assets. The market’s reaction to HYPE has been muted without new announcements or product updates. Investors may need to exercise patience and monitor official channels for upcoming developments that could reignite interest in the token. BitLemons ($BLEM): The Clear Standout? While all three projects have strengths, BitLemons ($BLEM) demonstrates the highest momentum and investor enthusiasm. The project offers tangible utility beyond speculation with a rapidly growing presale, a disruptive business model, and a revenue-sharing structure directly benefiting token holders. As we inch closer to the next stage of the presale, the question remains: Will you capitalize on this opportunity before demand sends prices soaring?

The latest setback comes as Cardano’s co-founder, Charles Hoskinson, was excluded from the White House Crypto Summit on March 7, raising concerns about ADA’s standing in regulatory discussions.

Some speculate that Cardano’s exclusion from key policy discussions signals a shift in influence, raising concerns about ADA’s standing in the broader market. BREAKING NEW XRP SOL ADA WILL NOT BE IN THE CRYPTO STRATEGIC RESERVE!! IT WAS AN ENTIRE RUG PULL, This is why he mentioned BTC n ETH together The rest are shit coins. https://t.co/stBNefbT6o — Maximus Anonymus (@MaximusInvestor) March 6, 2025 Adding to the uncertainty, a White House official retracted a statement that initially suggested ADA, XRP, and Solana (SOL) were part of a proposed U.S. crypto reserve plan. This backtracking has fueled market volatility, leaving investors questioning ADA’s role in future regulatory decisions. Is Hoskinson’s Exclusion a Red Flag for Cardano Investors? The decision to leave Hoskinson out of the Crypto Summit has led to speculation about Cardano’s relevance in shaping crypto policy. Some industry analysts argue that projects with stronger institutional ties were prioritized, while others see it as a broader disconnect between regulators and emerging blockchain projects. Hoskinson was not invited to the White House Crypto Summit, raising concerns about Cardano’s influence. Market sentiment remains cautious, with ADA struggling to regain lost ground. Despite uncertainty, Cardano’s tech and community remain solid, supporting long-term prospects. While this exclusion alone isn’t a sell signal, it highlights regulatory uncertainty that could impact investor confidence. The focus now shifts to Cardano’s ability to drive adoption and innovation, rather than relying on policy recognition. Cardano (ADA/USD) Price Outlook: Bearish Breakdown Signals More Downside Cardano has confirmed a bearish breakdown below a symmetrical triangle on the 4-hour chart, indicating further downside risk. Key Resistance: $0.85 (50-period EMA) Support Levels: $0.76, with a deeper drop possible to $0.679 Failing to reclaim $0.85 would keep selling pressure intact, increasing the likelihood of a decline toward $0.76 or even $0.68.

Bitcoin (BTC), for instance, briefly plummeted below $85,500. The situation with the alternative coins is no better, with some of the leading ones charting more substantial losses than the primary cryptocurrency. BTC Enters Red Territory Again Somewhat expectedly , the highly anticipated crypto summit held at the White House on March 7 caused turbulence in the digital asset market. While some speculated that the event would trigger a price rally for Bitcoin (BTC), the asset showed its unpredictable nature again. US President Donald Trump hosted the gathering with a handful of well-known crypto executives and relevant members of his administration. He doubled down on his promise to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and assured that America would follow a “never sell your BTC” plan. The event proved that Trump’s administration will take the crypto industry seriously. But despite the positive comments, the leading digital asset tanked to $85,300 hours after the summit. It is worth mentioning that some market observers previously warned that the gathering may have a “sell the news” effect. In the following hours, BTC slightly rebounded to the current $86,100 (per CoinGecko’s data), representing a 2.5% decline on a daily scale . BTC Price, Source: CoinGecko The asset’s market capitalization has dropped to roughly $1.7 trillion, while its dominance against the altcoins is around 58.2%. The Alts Suffer, too Many of the leading altcoins have performed even worse than BTC. Ripple (XRP) has fallen by 5.5% to $2.35, Cardano has slipped by 6% to $0.81, whereas Chainlink (LINK) is down 9%. Other cryptocurrencies witnessing painful losses include Hedera (HBAR), Sui (SUI), Stellar (XLM), and many more. On the other hand, TRON (TRX), Pi Network (PI), and Litecoin (LTC) are among the very few charting some gains. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization currently stands at roughly $2.93 trillion, representing a 4% decrease for the day .

Contrary to the optimism, traders are advised to be cautious as XRP’s open interest has surged lately. Time for a New Rally? Despite witnessing a substantial downtrend in the past 24 hours, the price of XRP is well on the green on a weekly scale . Currently, it trades at approximately $2.35, and many market observers suggest it could reach fresh peaks in the near future. The X user Dark Defender recently outlined three important reasons why Ripple’s native token remains in a bullish mode. The analyst claimed that the asset successfully broke the multi-year resistance line in November 2024 and tested previous resistance as support. Additionally, they assumed that XRP’s indicators signal a potential surge. “I’ve never seen XRP bullish more than this before,” Dark Defender stated. The trader, using the X moniker CRYPTOWZRD, also chipped in. They maintained that in the past 24 hours, XRP followed BTC and closed bearish. “However, I expect to see further upside pressure and higher volatility during the weekend from XRP led by XRP/BTC,” they added. Other analysts giving their two cents on the matter over the last few days include JAVON MARKS and EGRAG CRYPTO. The former claimed that the pattern XRP broke out of in November 2024 resembles that of 2017. As such, they expect a bull run “greater than many think or even imagine to possible.” EGRAG CRYPTO made a truly shocking prediction. The analyst suggested that XRP could be gearing up for its next “big leap” due to several factors, such as a retest of “the bull market support band” and a “noise consolidation” at the $2-$3.40 range. The market observer thinks that if history repeats, this could result in a price explosion in the $27-$222 range. Reaching such high levels would require XRP’s market cap to explode to at least $1.5 trillion. With the asset’s current capitalization under $140 billion , this prediction seems unlikely . Investors Should be Cautious Despite the overall bullish forecasts from numerous industry participants, traders should tread carefully when entering XRP’s ecosystem since the price can swing significantly in any direction. One factor doubling down on that assumption is the coin’s open interest, which has been on the rise lately. “The rise in XRP’s price is being driven by leveraged positions, signaling increased risk in the market. This could eventually present a good shorting opportunity, provided it’s carefully managed. XRP price action can be wild. Make sure to manage your risk,” analytics firm CryptoQuant alerted.

Among these, Pi Network (PI) and Berachain (BERA) are noteworthy as both have gained significant traction in the industry. However, a new Layer 1 DePIN competitor, Coldware (COLD) , is rapidly emerging, leaving both Pi Network (PI) and Berachain (BERA) in its wake. This article delves into the rise of Coldware (COLD) and explores the unique selling proposition (USP) that sets it apart from Pi Network (PI) and Berachain (BERA). The Growing Influence of Pi Network (PI) and Berachain (BERA) Since its inception, Pi Network (PI) has been gaining attention for its mobile mining capabilities, which allow users to mine Pi Coin using their smartphones. While initially viewed as an experimental project, Pi Network (PI) has surprised critics with its growing user base and increasing market capitalization. The Pi Coin price recently surged to nearly $2, fueled by growing speculation surrounding its mainnet launch and potential exchange listings. However, concerns about its long-term utility persist, as Pi Network (PI) has yet to fully prove its capacity to provide real-world applications beyond social mining. Similarly, Berachain (BERA) has made waves with its innovative approach to Web3, focusing on decentralized applications (dApps) and scalability. The Berachain (BERA) blockchain, however, has struggled to differentiate itself from other DeFi platforms, and its market position has fluctuated. Despite Berachain (BERA)’s efforts to integrate proof-of-stake (POS) technology and decentralized governance, the project faces competition from Coldware (COLD) , which offers superior scalability and a more secure ecosystem. Enter Coldware (COLD): A Game-Changer in the Market Coldware (COLD) is stepping up as a serious competitor to Pi Network (PI) and Berachain (BERA). As a Layer 1 DePIN platform, Coldware (COLD) is designed to combine decentralized finance (DeFi) with robust web3 infrastructure, making it a powerful contender for institutional and whale investors. Coldware (COLD) provides solutions for yield farming, staking, and decentralized lending, addressing gaps left by other players in the market. The key unique selling proposition (USP) of Coldware (COLD) lies in its DePIN architecture, which ensures high scalability, security, and transparency. Unlike Pi Network (PI) and Berachain (BERA), which are still refining their infrastructure, Coldware (COLD) has a well-established blockchain that supports efficient decentralized applications. The network’s design allows it to handle higher transaction volumes with ease, an essential factor for future growth as Web3 continues to expand. Coldware (COLD) vs Pi Network (PI) and Berachain (BERA) When compared to Pi Network (PI) and Berachain (BERA), Coldware (COLD) clearly stands out due to its real utility and well-executed tokenomics. Pi Network (PI) still depends on speculative trends, and while its large community is enthusiastic, it faces challenges regarding network scalability and real-world adoption. Berachain (BERA), on the other hand, has struggled to differentiate itself in a crowded space, lacking the robust functionality that Coldware (COLD) brings to the table. Coldware (COLD), by focusing on decentralized finance and leveraging a Layer 1 blockchain, offers solutions that are more market-ready and scalable, making it an attractive option for institutional investors and whales looking for long-term investments. The tokenomics of Coldware (COLD) is also designed to provide sustainable rewards for holders and stakers, which further bolsters its appeal. The Market Potential of Coldware (COLD) Experts predict that Coldware (COLD) is positioned to capitalize on the growing interest in DeFi and Layer 1 solutions. As Pi Network (PI) and Berachain (BERA) continue to experiment with their respective ecosystems, Coldware (COLD) is poised to take a leadership role in providing secure and scalable solutions for Web3applications. With its well-designed POS Chain and decentralized protocols, Coldware (COLD) is quickly becoming a preferred choice for those looking for a platform with real-world utility. Investors are increasingly recognizing the potential of Coldware (COLD) as a long-term growth asset, especially as the platform continues to gain momentum with each passing day. Coldware (COLD) has already seen significant interest from institutional investors and whales, who are attracted to the project’s scalable solutions and innovative features. The platform’s integration with decentralized finance offers passive income opportunities, making it an enticing investment for those seeking sustainable returns. Conclusion: The Future of Coldware (COLD) As Coldware (COLD) continues to rise in prominence, it is clear that the project is set to outpace Pi Network (PI) and Berachain (BERA) in the long run. With its DePIN Layer 1 blockchain, Coldware (COLD) is providing investors with a platform that not only boasts scalability and security, but also real-world use cases. As the market matures, Coldware (COLD) is poised to become a leading player in the DeFi space, challenging Pi Network (PI) and Berachain (BERA) for dominance.

These investors focus on a tiny fraction of projects that show substantial potential, be it from innovative technology, a promising ecosystem, or key use cases, and lucky us, they often let us in on their secret with blockchain data. Emerging Trends in AI, Stablecoins, and Meme Tokens Three distinct sectors have recently caught the attention of smart-money wallets, the data shows. They are: 1. Artificial Intelligence (AI) 2. Stablecoins and decentralized finance (DeFi) 3. Meme/community-driven tokens. Strategic investments in these three categories are picking up. Some projects are even witnessing quite substantial growth in terms of both accumulation volume and market interest. The AI story has moved forward, as the developers and the investors have moved on—have continued to move on—toward focusing on something else. And that something else is still the power of the decentralized technologies. But they’re using—these next-generation developers—they’re using decentralized tech to create something new: next-generation AI-driven decentralized solutions. Stablecoins are the other story here. They—they’ve got to be the unsung heroes of decentralized finance. With all the hyper stuff going on, DeFi builds on the back of stablecoins. And that has to be acknowledged. Key Smart Money Accumulations 1. $AVA (Ava AI): The most significant accumulation in the last 24 hours has occurred in Ava AI (AVA), a project that stands at the intersection of decentralized AI and blockchain technology. One smart money wallet made a purchase of $81,000 worth of AVA tokens, indicating that this investor sees considerable potential in Ava AI’s future growth. With a market cap of only $43 million, Ava AI is a serious contender in the space of decentralized AI and could become a key player in what’s next for blockchain innovation. How could this be the blockchain? Certainly, Ava AI seems a strong enough candidate for that role. The basics: Decentralized AI. More importantly, what makes Ava AI so special? – $VERTAI (Vertical AI): Another accumulation to watch closely is in Vertical AI (VERTAI), which concentrates on vertical AI agents that are meant to serve industry-specific needs. With smart money now apparently behind it, vertial AI seems to be in the process of at least a mini bubble. One smart wallet, for instance, recently accrued nearly $20,000 worth of VERTAI, which has a market cap of only $16 million. Still, the project seems to cover some serious bases. What it’s likely betting on with this accumulation, though, is the efficiency of the sorts of specialized AI solutions that large segments of different (i.e., non-tech) industries will likely be hungry for. – $USR (Resolv USD): Smart investments in the DeFi sector still center around stablecoins. One amounting to $31,000 found its way into Resolv USD, a stablecoin with clear design intentions to find a home in decentralized finance, and a market cap of $545 million. Though still relatively small, the purchase is a sign that USR is integrating sufficiently into major DeFi protocols (like Curve Finance) to warrant a sizeable investment from a “smart money” wallet. – $BLUB (Blue Pill): Entering the meme and community token space, we find $BLUB, which in the last 24 hours has caught the attention of seven smart wallets. Seemingly a nothing burger, $BLUB has attracted a total accumulation of $88,000 and at present has a market cap of $27 million. Investors are yapping on social media saying $BLUB is a prime contender for the next longshot price-surge that meme and community tokens sometimes deliver. With a structure like that, what’s driving the price of $BLUB? After all, meme tokens have no intrinsic value and their price can only be driven upwards with robust social media hype and community engagement. – $GrokCoin: Finally, $GrokCoin is seeing the attention of smart wallets, with six separate investors grabbing a total of $15,000. And even though it’s got a modest market cap of just $13 million, $GrokCoin is seeing a big surge in trading volume and social media buzz that’s leading some to wonder if it isn’t about to make a big price move. So what’s going on here? The uptick in market activity around $GrokCoin strongly suggests the potential involvement of market makers—traders who’ve got the cash to influence the price in the way they want it to go. And while $GrokCoin is still a speculative play, it is catching the kind of visibility and volume that a lot of traders go for when they’re looking to make short-term gains. Smart money wallets accumulations in the last 24 hours Main specific narratives accumulated: AI & Agentic Frameworks (6 wallets) Stablecoins & DeFi (3 wallets) MEME & Community Tokens (3 wallets) Top accumulations and reasoning: $AVA (Ava AI) -> Potential… pic.twitter.com/bg7ok2skSY — CoinSense.app (@CoinSense_App) March 7, 2025 Conclusion: Shaping the Future of Crypto Again, smart money investors have demonstrated their acumen in picking out potential projects across a range of sectors. From the rise of decentralized AI to the ongoing stablecoin ecosystem in DeFi, and the totally unpredictable meme token market, these recent bets show the diversity of the opportunities that exist within the crypto market. Anyone investing in these sectors should probably do quite a lot of research and invest with the same kind of caution that one would exercise when investing in any potentially quite lucrative but also potentially quite volatile market.

In this article, we explore the top 4 Solana tokens that could easily rally 100x as the ETF approval deadline nears. Top Solana Tokens that Could Rally 100x Ahead of SOL ETF Approval The approval of a spot Solana ETF seems more likely after the asset was mentioned as part of the proposed digital assets stockpile. As the approval deadline looms, below are the top 4 Solana tokens that you can buy today for 100x gains. Bonk (BONK) SOL meme coins have been getting much attention and BONK is one of the top Solana tokens to buy for a 100x rally. BONK price has declined after a broader market pullback and trades at $0.0000118 after a slight 3% drop in 24 hours. BONK is oversold after the recent downtrend as its RSI of around 33 shows. The Awesome Oscillator histogram bars are also shrinking, which hints at a bullish divergence and a bullish BONK price forecast . If demand rises again and BONK flips resistance at the 50% Fibonacci level of $0.000036, the price could extend its gains to target the 123.6% Fib level of $0.000074. BONK/USDT: 1-day Chart Jupiter (JUP) Jupiter is also one of the best Solana tokens to buy today. JUP is the native token of the Jupiter decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator on the Solana blockchain. As such, unlike meme coins, the JUP token is backed by utility, making it more likely that the price could rally 100x. Data from DeFiLlama shows the massive growth that the Jupiter DEX aggregator platform has seen in the last year. If this extends it supports a bullish Jupiter price prediction and could stir an over 100x rally. Jupiter TVL Official Trump (TRUMP) Official Trump is also one of the top Solana tokens to buy for significant gains. At press time, TRUMP trades at $12.20, and despite falling by more than 80% from its record high, it remains one of the top meme coins to buy due to President Trump’s recent pro-crypto utterances. TRUMP also shows a strong technical outlook as a potential double-bottom pattern emerges on its four-hour chart. If this meme coin flips resistance at the neckline of this pattern at $17.73, it could fuel a rally toward $24.59, allowing traders to make swift returns. TRUMP/USDT: 4-hour Chart Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) The other top altcoin to buy that could also potentially rally 100x is Pudgy Penguins (PENGU). This meme coin has registered strong gains of 3.4% in 24 hours despite a pullback across the broader crypto market. Pudgy Penguins price bounced after it was listed on the Robinhood exchange where it will be available to EU traders. Exchange listings tend to bode well for price and as more traders get access to PENGU, it could drive a notable recovery and even lead to a 100x rally. Final Thoughts Solana tokens have previously outperformed the rest of the crypto market, and such a trend could happen again. BONK, Jupiter, TRUMP, and PENGU could register a 100x rally amid a bullish technical outlook, rising adoption, and exchange listings.

Why Durag Doge Presents the Ultimate Superpower Having lost the psychological prices of $0.4 and $0.3, Dogecoin has not yet found the right footing due to intensified bearish conditions. For instance, the apex meme coin has been grappling with a 53.34% drop in its daily trading volume whereas its price is witnessing a 30.6% decline in price on the daily charts to trade at $0.2678. Nevertheless, at times being underestimated presents the ultimate superpower, and Durag Doge borrows a leaf from this ideology since it's a meme coin that’s all about confidence, community, and culture, making it one of the best altcoins for the next bull run. Therefore, $DURAG is in high gear to rewrite the meme coin script. With confidence, community, and culture taking center stage in the Durag Doge ecosystem, the presale cryptocurrency caters for all those who flex and hustle. As a result, investors are taking note with every $DURAG coin retailing at 0.0009 USDT at the first round of its presale. While the crypto world is full of imitators and overhyped promises, $DURAG brings something fresh: a token that’s all about culture, community, and confidence. Experts are weighing in that Durag Doge will soon skyrocket being the best crypto to buy now. Why Durag Doge is Triggering a Meme Coin Community Revolution Even though Litecoin (LTC) is attracting significant attention due to the approval of an exchange-traded fund (ETF), its daily trading volume has been in the red after dropping by 38.43% . As LTC struggles to hold the $100 price zone, Durag Doge continues to enjoy the backing of an overwhelming community. As a result, pundits deem it a cultural icon that integrates the bustle and hustle of street life with the thrill presented by meme coins, making it one of the best crypto coins to buy now. Therefore, Durag Doge has shown its unrelenting intention to create a crypto-powered community that is inspired by the drip and united by ambition. Conclusion As Durag Doge continues to give Dogecoin and Litecoin a run for their money, the future is bright for the freshest meme coin and deflationary token.

The Game-Changer in Crypto You Can’t Ignore,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/best-crypto-to-buy-now-aurealone-the-game-changer-in-crypto-you-cant-ignore,"Crypto refers to cryptocurrency, a digital currency that runs on blockchain technology that is safe and decentralized yet continually changing. What crypto projects or innovations should get your attention among all the ones out there? With DeFi and gaming, as well as mainstream tokens to consider, there is always something exciting happening in the world of cryptocurrency. This guide will be delving into Aureal One, DexBoss, XRP Ripple, and a few others that are presently making waves! Listed Below are the Best Crypto to Buy Now: AurealOne (DLUME) DexBoss (DEBO) XRP Ripple (XRP) Shiba Inu (SHIB) Pi (PI) 1. Aureal One: A Look into the Future of Gaming and Beyond Revolutionizing Gaming Aiming at Advancement in the Metaverse Aureal One is leaving no stone unturned in the advancements of Gaming and the Metaverse with a state-of-the-art blockchain ecosystem created to enhance user experience. It uses ultra-fast speed and low gas fees through Zero-Knowledge Rollups technology, and the entire platform is capable of scaling and cost-effectiveness. Central to the ecosystem is its native currency, DLUME, used for transactions, staking, and governance in the Aureal One community. The proof-of-concept game ""Clash of Tiles"" has come to life to demonstrate the platform's ability to host more complex projects like ""DarkLume."" Click here to visit best crypto to buy now - AurealOne A Strategic Investment Opportunity This presale for the DLUME token is sequenced into 21 rounds, allowing early investors pricing tiers. From the first to the 21st round, while it initially starts at $0.0005, the presale hopes to raise $500,000. Gradually from round two to round 21, the price is supposed to reach $0.0005-$0.0045 upon listing at an estimated price of $0.0055. Presently, DLUME presale is going for $0.0011 in Round 4; this means it has some good momentum going into the presale period. The structured and staggered growth presents the first adopters with a brilliant scope of NRV capturing within the Aureal One ecosystem. 2. DexBoss: Connecting Traditional Finance to DeFi DexBoss: Taking DeFi to the Boots DexBoss is a very user-friendly platform for opening the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) to everyone while providing advanced features for experienced traders. The platform is powered by its native token, $DEBO, and is set to improve the entire trading experience using its innovative margin trading, liquidity farming, and deep liquidity pools to allow transactions at very low slippage levels in a pretty high volume. DEBO presale and growth potential The presale structured into 17 rounds is expected to raise approximately $50 million, for which the presale starts at $0.01 in Round 1, moves to $0.0458 by Round 17, and will list at $0.0505.

In addition, DexBoss features a buyback and burn mechanism that contributes to the generation of long-term value for token holders through supply reduction and scarcity. Latest Developments The price of $DEBO remains at $0.01 in its presale, currently steady and holding up pretty well. These state-of-the-art platforms are promising as there is visible adoption coming along. 3. XRP Ripple: A Mainstay on the Crypto Landscape XRP Ripple is a very well known name in the field of crypto, and it prides itself on being one of the few digital assets leading the charge. Known for its speed and scalability, this XRP Ledger (XRPL) is a pillar on account of cross border settlements and remittances. There are constant updates around XRP regarding the legal engagements it is entangled in-the laundry list of issues with the SEC regarding the way in which XRP has since been regarded as a security. What could possibly happen with the conclusion of this legal quagmire? This may play out toward XRP's very complexion in the years and price extended. Currently, XRP trades at about $0.48, indicating a resilient presence in the market. 4. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The Meme Coin Phenomenon Shiba Inu has intrigued the minds of investors as one of the top meme coins, associated with a great community. It started as a very modest parody of Dogecoin, possessing a respectable market capitalization and gaining the attraction of a very buoyant fan base. Even though it originated through the fame of meme culture, Shiba Inu has slowly had utility features added to its ecosystem, evoking undertones of classical cryptocurrencies. The price of SHIB currently is 0.000012, with fluctuating levels of user interest entering the crypto space. 5. Pi (PI): A New Horizon In Crypto Mining Last but not least is the Pi Network, which allows users to mine cryptocurrency on their phones without killing the battery. It is intended to promote wider access and attendant mass adoption of cryptocurrency by Internet users all over the world. The Pi Network is currently operating with great emphasis on the testing phase. No official market price currently exists for PI. However, its community-based model and user base is steadily growing. To Sum Up The cryptocurrency marketplace keeps changing and offers various opportunities in investment via pre-sales, most of which can yield good returns. DexBoss is a clear standout, taking on the mission of deconstructing DeFi to make it accessible to all. Providing this with a niche would attract both novices and professional investors, given the innovative angle with which it approaches things. In parallel to it, Aureal One is reaching to get noticed in the booming gaming and metaverse sphere with its highly efficient blockchain technology infrastructures and organized presale model. In spite of the strength XRP Ripple commands over the crypto market, watchers await claimants Aureal One and DexBoss to become newcomers in the likes of Shiba Inu and Pi that have walked in their shoes ahead. As is true in all blockchain ventures, the crypto market rises and falls wildly in volatility, demanding that one engage in due diligence before making important investments.

From meme coins to tokens with real utility, the sector has provided transformative returns for astute investors. Although Dogecoin (DOGE) dominated the news with its viral fame, two altcoins, XRP and Rexas Finance (RXS), are demonstrating significant potential to surpass DOGE in 2025. Here’s the reason these two crypto coins might transform a small $200 investment into a significant $20,000. The Rise and Fall of DOGE crypto coin Dogecoin was launched in 2013 but swiftly rose as one of the best meme coins to buy , thanks to social media buzz and endorsements from celebrities such as Elon Musk. Even with DOGE price rapid rise, its absence of practical use in the real world has impeded sustained stability. Although Dogecoin might continue to experience price surges due to excitement, it lacks the foundational elements necessary for enduring growth. Investors aiming for transformative returns in 2025 should concentrate on initiatives with strong use cases, backing from institutions, and opportunities for growth. That’s where XRP and Rexas Finance (RXS) excel. 1. Rexas Finance (RXS): Crypto Coin Transforming RWA tokenization Rexas Finance (RXS) is revolutionizing investment markets through Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization. By leveraging blockchain technology, RXS enables fractional ownership of physical assets such as real estate, commodities, and intellectual property This unique approach allows everyday investors to access lucrative markets traditionally reserved for high-net-worth individuals and institutions. Why RXS Could Skyrocket RXS’s innovative model, combined with rising demand for tokenized assets, makes it a promising investment. The RWA project has already raised over $46 million in its presale, with over 90% of tokens sold. Priced at $0.20 in its final presale stage, RXS will officially debut at $0.25 on June 19, 2025. Here’s the math behind RXS’s potential gains: Investing $200 at $0.20 per token = 1,000 RXS tokens. If RXS reaches $20 per token, that same 1,000 tokens would be worth $20,000. With robust security backed by a CertiK audit, RXS combines innovative technology with investor protection, making it a strong candidate for explosive growth, and one of potential new cryptocurrencies to invest in . 2. XRP: The Bridging Crypto Coin to Global Finance XRP has long been a standout in the crypto world due to its practical use in global financial systems. As the native token of the XRP Ledger, XRP facilitates fast, low-cost cross-border payments — a major improvement over traditional systems like SWIFT. Why XRP Could Surge in 2025 XRP’s growing role in international finance, partnerships with major financial institutions, and involvement in Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) give it a clear advantage. With regulatory clarity improving and institutions increasingly adopting XRP for cross-border payments, analysts predict substantial price growth. Here’s the math behind XRP’s potential gains: Investing $200 x $ 2.59 per token = 77 XRP. If XRP climbs to $260 per token, those 77 tokens would be worth $20,000. Given the crypto coin’s utility in global finance, XRP price target is within reach as adoption expands. Trading currently at $2.31, the token has experienced a decrease in value by nearly 8.64% over the past day. XRP price chart Why XRP and RXS Crypto Coins Outshine Dogecoin While Dogecoin thrives on social media buzz, both XRP and RXS are backed by solid fundamentals: Utility: XRP drives global finance, while RXS tokenizes real-world assets. Institutional support: XRP is embraced by banks, while RXS has completed a CertiK audit for security assurance. Growth potential: Both coins target multi-trillion-dollar markets — cross-border payments (XRP) and asset tokenization (RXS). Dogecoin’s speculative nature may still attract short-term traders, but for those seeking serious long-term growth, XRP and RXS present a more calculated opportunity. Final Thoughts: Seize the Opportunity with These Crypto Coins The crypto market thrives on innovation, and projects that solve real-world problems tend to outperform hype-driven tokens. As 2025 approaches, XRP and Rexas Finance stand out as prime crypto coins for substantial gains. With RXS set to launch at $0.25 and XRP gaining institutional traction, the potential for a $200 to $20,000 transformation is realistic — but only for those who act early.

While some users see these policies as developments that help against the risks in the crypto market, others see them as a way for the government to monitor their activities. According to a Coinbase survey, 56% of crypto users in the United States now know about self-custody solutions, with a 22% rise in non-custodial wallets since 2023. The University of Illinois researchers noted that self-custody wallets hold 35% of the total market supply, up from 25% in 2022. While decentralization remains one of the ethos of the crypto industry, it is no longer news that bad actors take advantage to carry out illegal transactions. Meanwhile, these atrocities do not bother some users as they want control over their tokens, driving them to the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. Although centralized exchanges promise better security of funds and assets, there have been high-profile cases of these platforms being breached. Users continue to lose faith in centralized platforms Crypto wallet Exodus registered a 107% revenue, with its CEO JP Richardson noting that the surge in the demand for self-custody solutions is directly responsible for the rise. “Self-custody is the future. As trust in centralized platforms continues to erode, more people are realizing the importance of owning their keys,” Richardson said. “Recent changes in the USA have certainly been gratifying. We actively engage with regulators—and have for years—to advocate for self-custody as a fundamental right,” he added. Founder and CEO of crypto wallet Cowchain Mykhailo Adzhoiev mentioned that the increase in the adoption of self-custody wallets has reinforced a popular belief that if a token is not in your wallet, it’s not yours. “Self-custody is no longer just for the hardcore crypto nerds. It’s becoming the gateway for onboarding the next wave of users,” Adzhoiev said. According to analysts at NAKA, users are now moving towards decentralized systems as they prefer to control their private keys. According to their research, self-custody wallets may hit $3.5 billion by 2031. Crypto policies are boosting self-custody solutions One of the key crypto regulations in the crypto market is the Markets in Crypto-Assets ( MiCA ) regulation in the European Union. The regulatory framework has been hailed as one of the most complete globally as it provides clarity and security in the crypto industry. It features transparency, market integrity, strict compliance measures, and investor protection. In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) has traditionally overdone its enforcement of exchanges, pushing users to explore decentralized exchanges as a means to gain control over their assets. While the new Trump administration has promised better laws and the way enforcement will be carried out, it remains to be seen if things will change. The FATF’s Travel Rule, now mandates crypto exchanges to collect and share transaction information, causing uproar about privacy concerns. The move has also led to a shift to self-custody solutions, as users continue to look for ways to maintain autonomy. In addition, other countries are also coming up with regulations to help the move.

On March 7, the wallet’s holder transferred $77.5 million worth of BTC to three fresh addresses, with about $365 million remaining in the primary wallet. The wallet was inactive since April 2016, when Nucleus crashed with 5,000 BTC in vendor and customer deposits. The money was worth approximately $2.1 million then—far less than they’re worth today. Nucleus Marketplace and Its Checkered Past Nucleus was one of many darknet markets that thrived in the early days of Bitcoin. It facilitated the sale of illicit goods, including drugs and guns. The stated reason for its shutdown was a hack, but speculation was that something else was at play. Some believed the administrators pulled an exit scam, while others believed law enforcement activity was responsible for its downfall. As with most darknet platforms, Nucleus was largely based on Bitcoin for its anonymity, making it harder to track activity. Blockchain forensics have since advanced, however, and tracing historic flows of BTC is now more feasible. A Shift in the Crypto Landscape The sudden spike in Nucleus’ wallet occurs at a major political moment: U.S. President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve. The reserves’ first BTC will be sourced from assets seized through forfeitures, with provisions for further “budget-neutral” purchases. While there is no direct link between the two incidents, the coincidence has left people suspicious. Some wonder whether law enforcement agencies may have obtained the wallet or whether its rightful owners are moving funds to prevent them from falling into government hands. Dormant Wallets Waking Up During Bitcoin’s Price Rally The Nucleus wallet is not the only deep-sleeping Bitcoin stash to stir. Bitcoin’s price has increased from less than $17,000 at the start of 2023 to an all-time high of around $108,000. This price boost has stirred up activity in most dormant wallets: July 2023: An 11-year-old wallet moved 1,037 BTC. May 2024: Three Satoshi-era wallets stirred, one of which moved 687 BTC and two of which moved 1,000 BTC. June 2024: A whale moved 8,000 BTC from an idle wallet that hadn’t been accessed in five years. September 2024: Five Satoshi-era miner wallets roared back to life after 15 years. These revivals raise questions regarding security risks, inheritance transfers, or even quantum breakthroughs corrupting early wallets. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino has recently warned that quantum leaps can make it possible for hackers to crack old cryptography keys , exposing wallets long presumed lost. What’s Next for Nucleus’ BTC? For now, the fate of the other $365 million in Bitcoin is unknown. Whether this is a sign of an individual buying back old positions, a law enforcement move, or something nefarious, it is another installment in the saga of dormant crypto wallets coming to life in the aftermath of Bitcoin’s meteoric price rise.",Blockchain|Cryptocurrency|Regulation,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|ARKM,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-03-08 11:52:41

Table of Contents BitLemons presale nears sellout as investors rush in ADA draws attention amid regulatory speculation XRP in the spotlight as reserve speculation builds Why BLEM stands out in this market? Crypto markets are moving fast as regulatory speculation takes center stage. Cardano (ADA) and XRP are gaining traction amid rumors of their potential inclusion in a U.S. strategic crypto reserve, while BitLemons (BLEM) is making waves with a red-hot presale that’s already secured over $1.8 million. With volatility at elevated levels, investors are shifting their focus from short-term price swings to major developments that could shape the future of digital assets. The question is — will regulatory speculation push ADA and XRP higher, or will BitLemons’ real revenue model deliver stronger long-term growth? You might also like: ETH, LINK surge as BitLemons emerges as new hidden opportunity BitLemons presale nears sellout as investors rush in BitLemons is proving itself as one of the most sought-after crypto opportunities right now, with its presale rapidly approaching completion. The project is disrupting the web3 gaming sector with a fully operational gaming platform featuring over 8,000 titles from providers like Evolution and Pragmatic. With $1 million already secured in private funding, institutional interest is growing. Unlike tokens driven purely by hype, BitLemons boasts a revenue model where 30% of Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) is allocated to tokenomics — 15% for buybacks and burns, and 15% for staking rewards. Security is also a priority, with dual audits from SpyWolf and SolidProof ensuring top-tier protection. The presale is progressing fast, with Stage 2 already 77% sold. At $0.02 per token, early adopters are moving quickly before the price increases to $0.03 in just 11 days. With a rumored listing price between $0.17-$0.18, BitLemons is offering an opportunity that serious investors aren’t ignoring. ADA draws attention amid regulatory speculation Cardano is making headlines as President Trump hints at a possible U.S. strategic crypto reserve that could include ADA alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. This speculation has driven a surge in interest, as investors consider ADA’s potential role in shaping the regulatory future of blockchain projects. ADA has seen a remarkable 44% price increase in the past week, now trading at approximately $0.87. Trading volume remains strong at $3.07 billion, despite a slight dip in market cap. However, the token faces resistance near $0.97, with support holding at $0.82. A breakout above this level could signal further upside, but investors remain cautious as regulatory clarity unfolds. XRP in the spotlight as reserve speculation builds XRP is another token benefiting from policy-driven speculation. Recent social media discussions have placed XRP among the potential assets for inclusion in a U.S. national crypto reserve. This has sparked a surge in both price and trading volume, pushing XRP to $2.49 with a 22% gain over the past seven days. The token’s market cap sits at $144 billion, with daily trading volume soaring 58% to $8.85 billion. XRP has tested key resistance at $2.64 multiple times but has yet to break through. Analysts are watching closely to see if bullish momentum can carry it past this crucial level. A pullback to $2.41 could offer a stronger support base for further accumulation. Why BLEM stands out in this market? While ADA and XRP navigate the regulatory landscape, BitLemons is delivering immediate value with a fully functional revenue-generating platform. The web3 gaming sector continues to expand, and BitLemons is at the forefront, offering a deflationary supply, high-yield staking, and a strong growth trajectory. With its presale nearing completion, early investors have limited time to take advantage of what could be one of the most profitable entries in the market today.

With Ethereum’s high gas fees and scalability issues, many are turning to altcoins with innovative technology and real-world applications. Among the best performers for 2025, Lightchain AI (LCAI) is a standout, but there are also other altcoins in the market that show great potential. Here are 5 altcoins that are set to exceed investor expectations in 2025, as they push Ethereum’s performance to the sidelines. Lightchain AI (LCAI) – Next Big DeFi Gem Lightchain AI (LCAI) is quickly becoming one of the hottest altcoins to watch in 2025. Why? It’s redefining the game with an AI-powered blockchain built for industries like DeFi, finance, and data security. At the heart of its innovation is the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM)—a cutting-edge layer designed for AI tasks like model training and inference, seamlessly integrated into the blockchain. And it doesn’t stop there - LCAI’s energy-efficient systems supercharge both the AIVM and its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) protocols, delivering high performance while slashing energy consumption. But here’s the real kicker— LCAI is capturing serious institutional interest. With its groundbreaking tech and massive growth potential, it’s poised to leave Ethereum’s slow growth in the dust. As AI and blockchain continue to collide, Lightchain AI is shining as a trailblazer in this rapidly evolving space. Don’t blink, or you might miss it. Top Blockchain Projects to Watch for 2025 - Solana, Avalanche, Chainlink, and Sui Several blockchain projects are making waves and reshaping the future of digital ecosystems. Solana (SOL) - Trading at $165.69, Solana continues to thrive even amid market shifts.

Avalanche (AVAX) - Priced at $23.18, Avalanche is redefining scalability and interoperability for dApps and smart contracts. With its unique tri-chain architecture, it tackles the blockchain trilemma, balancing scalability, security, and decentralization like no other. Chainlink (LINK) - At $17.61, Chainlink is the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi). Its secure, decentralized oracles seamlessly connect smart contracts with real-world data, providing the reliable data feeds that power countless DeFi applications. Sui (SUI) - Trading at $2.99, Sui is a rising star in the blockchain world. Its high-performance layer-1 design, object-centric data model, and Move programming language set the stage for scalable, low-latency Web3 applications and DeFi solutions. These projects are pushing boundaries and driving innovation, positioning themselves as key players in the ever-evolving blockchain landscape. 5 Altcoins to Watch in 2025 Ethereum has long been a powerhouse in the crypto world , but 2025 might see its dominance tested by a new wave of altcoins offering groundbreaking innovations in scalability, speed, and real-world applications. Enter Lightchain AI —a game-changer with its AI-powered blockchain, providing scalable solutions for industries like DeFi and finance. Then there’s Solana, Avalanche, and Chainlink, each dominating their niches with compelling use cases and rising adoption rates. But don’t overlook Sui, a rising star built for scalability and real-time applications , positioning itself as a serious contender for the top spot in 2025. For investors hunting the next big thing, these five altcoins are worth keeping on your radar. With their potential to disrupt the market and deliver strong returns, they might just outpace Ethereum in the years ahead.

Sui’s User Surge? Web3Bay Is STILL the Biggest Story in Blockchain!,https://thecoinrise.com/avalanche-hits-250-suis-user-surge-web3bay-is-still-the-biggest-story-in-blockchain/,"The crypto market is confronting renewed energy as platforms like Sui and Avalanche show promising signs of resurgence, while Web3Bay is setting a new standard in the application of blockchain technology. Sui (SUI) is experiencing a notable increase in active addresses, fueling speculation of an upcoming price rebound. Simultaneously, Avalanche (AVAX) continues to captivate the investment community with its prospects for long-term growth. Stepping beyond simple price dynamics, Web3Bay is transforming online commerce with its innovative blockchain-enabled, social media-driven peer-to-peer sales, seamlessly integrating crypto and fiat payments. This advancement goes beyond mere speculation to deliver real-world utility and transform the digital marketplace. Surge in Sui’s Activity Signals Market Awakening Sui (SUI) has recently seen an explosive increase in daily active addresses, peaking at 1.4 million users over three months, signaling a significant rise in platform engagement. This uptick, coupled with daily new wallet registrations hitting 1.1 million—a high not seen since October 2024—and robust returning user numbers, suggests a potent resurgence in user interest and platform growth. Despite a 23.71% drop in value last month, with SUI currently trading at $2.74, the rising user engagement offers a glimmer of hope. The trading scene is buzzing, with buy volumes overtaking sell volumes, hinting at a shift towards a bullish market sentiment. Additionally, a substantial negative spot net flow of -1.84 million indicates that holders are increasingly transferring their tokens off exchanges, likely in anticipation of a future price surge. Moreover, a consistently positive funding rate over recent days bolsters this optimistic view. If this trend holds, SUI could soon challenge the $3.60 resistance level, potentially marking a significant reversal in its recent downward trajectory. Avalanche: A Beacon for Million-Dollar Returns Avalanche (AVAX) is quickly becoming the focal point of the crypto world, thanks to its groundbreaking technology designed to tackle scalability, security, and decentralization. Boasting transaction speeds that dwarf Ethereum’s, processing over 4,500 transactions per second, and featuring minimal fees and an eco-friendly Proof-of-Stake model, Avalanche is increasingly attractive for DeFi and NFT ventures. Avalanche’s ecosystem is flourishing as it becomes a preferred platform for projects migrating from Ethereum, boosting its growth and adoption. Technical analyses are bullish, showing strong support zones and indicators like MACD and RSI all pointing upwards. Imagine the potential: if AVAX hits $250 in the upcoming bull run, a $10,000 investment could skyrocket to $100,000. Even more exciting, should AVAX ascend to $2,500 longer-term, that investment could balloon to a staggering $1,000,000. With inherent risks in mind, Avalanche’s robust ecosystem and momentum make it an exciting prospect for investors eyeing substantial returns. Web3Bay Pioneers Direct Sales on Social Media The era of social commerce has been redefined by platforms like TikTok, which have empowered influencers to turn followers into buyers instantly. Unlike traditional platforms such as Shopify, which suffer from high fees and limited crypto integrations, Web3Bay is revolutionizing the game by allowing direct sales without intermediaries. Web3Bay leverages blockchain for instantaneous, secure transactions, supporting both crypto and traditional payments. Its use of smart contracts cuts out chargeback risks, and decentralized IPFS storage ensures that listings are free from censorship. This shift allows creators to effortlessly create their own digital shops, monetizing their content freely without traditional platform constraints or hefty fees. The impact is tangible: Web3Bay’s presale has already amassed over $1.6 million, with over 400 million coins sold. Currently in its fifth stage, priced at $0.00524 per coin, Web3Bay offers a prime opportunity for early adopters ahead of widespread adoption. With Web3Bay, influencers are not just selling products—they are trailblazers redefining the very fabric of online commerce. Blockchain Adoption: A New Era of Practical Applications As Sui signals a potential market recovery and Avalanche draws investors with its scalability, Web3Bay is carving out a unique niche by moving past speculative market plays into practical applications. By democratizing social commerce through decentralized transactions, it challenges outdated e-commerce models and hands financial control back to the creators. The industry’s shift from speculative price movements to practical applications signifies a mature phase in blockchain evolution. Projects that deliver tangible, everyday benefits stand poised to define the future landscape of blockchain adoption, proving that blockchain’s transformative power extends far beyond financial speculation to real-world, functional integration.

While Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) remain the two most well-known blockchains, they still struggle with scalability issues that affect transaction speeds and overall network efficiency. Enter Coldware (COLD) , a promising new blockchain that could be the decentralized solution the masses need. Coldware: The Scalability Solution Coldware (COLD) has emerged as an alternative to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) by focusing on speed and scalability. With its advanced consensus mechanism and decentralized architecture, Coldware offers a faster solution for users and developers. The blockchain's ability to handle thousands of transactions per second sets it apart from Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), making it an attractive option for both large enterprises and everyday users who require fast, low-cost transactions. Bitcoin and Ethereum's Scalability Struggles Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have proven their worth in the crypto space but are far from perfect. Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, has faced scalability issues due to its 10-minute block time and limited transaction throughput. Ethereum, although more flexible with its smart contracts, still experiences high gas fees and slower speeds as the network becomes congested, especially during periods of high demand. The Shift Toward Scalable Blockchain Networks As the blockchain space matures, scalability will be the defining factor for widespread adoption. Coldware’s (COLD) scalability-focused design gives it an edge in the race for blockchain dominance, especially as DeFi, NFTs, and other blockchain applications continue to grow. While Bitcoin and Ethereum will undoubtedly remain prominent players, Coldware's ability to scale efficiently places it in a strong position to capture a larger market share moving forward.

According to a March 7 report from The New York Times, the interview was not approved by the US Bureau of Prisons, violating strict communication regulations at Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC). “This particular interview was not approved,” a Bureau of Prisons representative told the media. Bankman-Fried Faces Prison Consequences A source familiar with the situation revealed that after the interview went live on March 6, prison officials swiftly moved Bankman-Fried into solitary confinement as a disciplinary action. The conversation, which aired on Carlson’s YouTube channel, has already amassed over 730,000 views. During the discussion, Bankman-Fried reflected on his time behind bars, his views on crypto regulation in the US, and his belief that he is ‘not a criminal.’ However, the consequences of his words came almost immediately, raising questions about the Bureau of Prisons’ strict policies on media interactions with inmates. Speculation Over a Possible Trump Pardon Grows While Carlson did not directly ask Bankman-Fried if he expected a pardon from former US President Donald Trump, the FTX founder’s remarks aligned with certain Republican viewpoints on financial regulations. This has fueled speculation within the crypto community about a potential Trump-backed pardon should the former president return to office. According to crypto prediction platform Polymarket, betting odds on an SBF pardon have nearly doubled since the interview aired. Some are drawing parallels to Trump’s January 2025 pardon of Ross Ulbricht , the Silk Road founder who served 12 years in prison for running the now-defunct darknet marketplace. Despite the rising speculation, there is no official indication that Trump or any other political figure is actively considering clemency for Bankman-Fried, who was convicted on seven felony counts and sentenced to 25 years in prison in 2024. Legal Appeal Continues Even before the Carlson interview incident, Bankman-Fried had been fighting to overturn his conviction . His legal team filed an appeal in September 2024, arguing that the former FTX CEO was unfairly scrutinized by prosecutors, the presiding judge, and the media. In a 102-page appeal brief, his attorneys claimed that Bankman-Fried was ‘never presumed innocent’ and was subject to biased treatment throughout his trial. However, legal experts believe that overturning a 25-year sentence remains a long shot, given the scale of financial misconduct tied to FTX’s $8 billion collapse.

Experts say the potential is even greater,https://invezz.com/news/2025/03/08/can-mutuum-finance-mutm-outperform-dogecoins-historic-surge-experts-say-the-potential-is-even-greater/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) made history with its massive price rally, turning early investors into millionaires. However, experts are now looking at a new contender—Mutuum Finance (MUTM)—as a project with even greater potential for long-term growth. Unlike meme coins that thrive on hype, Mutuum Finance is building a decentralized lending platform with real financial utility, attracting investors seeking more than just speculation. With its presale already gaining momentum and demand rising, analysts believe MUTM’s structured financial model and growing ecosystem could lead to exponential gains. As investors compare past market trends to emerging opportunities, many are questioning whether MUTM could not only match but surpass Dogecoin’s legendary performance. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE) gained widespread attention after experiencing a massive price surge, reaching an all-time high of $0.73 in 2021. Initially created as a meme, the cryptocurrency evolved into a widely recognized asset, largely driven by community support and social media influence. High-profile endorsements, including those from Elon Musk, played a significant role in fueling its momentum, attracting millions of retail investors. Despite its popularity, Dogecoin’s price movements have remained highly volatile, often reacting to market sentiment and external events. While it has been used for tipping and payments, concerns over its long-term sustainability have been raised due to the lack of a structured utility. Over time, interest has shifted toward projects with defined financial applications, prompting some investors to explore alternatives with stronger fundamentals. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is establishing itself as a leading decentralized lending platform, offering real financial solutions beyond market speculation. Unlike meme coins that depend on viral trends, MUTM’s value is driven by its structured financial model and expanding ecosystem. The platform provides a seamless way for users to lend, borrow, and earn passive income without relying on centralized financial institutions. At the core of Mutuum Finance is its innovative lending mechanism, which supports both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending. The P2C model allows users to deposit funds into liquidity pools, earning competitive yields based on utilization rates. On the other hand, the P2P model enables borrowers and lenders to negotiate loan terms directly, catering to a broader range of assets, including those not traditionally supported in DeFi markets. This dual lending structure ensures flexibility while maximizing earning opportunities for participants. Mutuum Finance’s presale has seen rapid adoption, with over $2.35 million raised and a growing number of investors securing their positions. The token is currently priced at $0.015, but with demand increasing and the next phase nearing completion, early adopters are positioning themselves for significant returns. The final launch price is set at $0.06, meaning those who enter at this stage are already looking at a 400% gain before the token even hits exchanges. Beyond its pricing strategy, what makes MUTM stand out is its buy-and-distribute mechanism. A portion of the platform’s revenue is allocated to purchasing MUTM from the open market, which is then distributed among mtToken holders. This continuous buy pressure not only rewards long-term investors but also helps maintain price stability while reducing volatility. Mutuum Finance introduces mtTokens, which serve as proof of a user’s supplied assets within the platform. When users deposit funds into the lending pools, they receive mtTokens in return, which automatically accumulate interest over time. These tokens can be redeemed for the original asset plus accrued earnings, offering a seamless way to earn passive income. Additionally, mtTokens can be transferred or traded on secondary markets, further enhancing their liquidity and usability. A major upcoming feature of Mutuum Finance is its overcollateralized stablecoin, designed to enhance borrowing capabilities while maintaining price stability. Unlike traditional stablecoins that rely on centralized reserves, Mutuum’s stablecoin will be minted against collateral deposited within the lending protocol. This ensures a decentralized and transparent approach to stablecoin issuance, aligning with the project’s commitment to financial sovereignty. The stablecoin supply will dynamically adjust based on user demand and collateralization, making it a valuable asset for borrowers looking to access liquidity without selling their crypto holdings. With this addition, Mutuum Finance is expanding its DeFi utility, further differentiating itself from speculative tokens with no clear use case. As the meme coin hype fades, many investors are shifting their focus to projects with long-term financial applications. Mutuum Finance stands out by offering real-world DeFi solutions, combining sustainable yield opportunities with structured borrowing mechanisms. Mutuum Finance is more than just another token—it’s a fully developed DeFi platform designed for sustainable growth. With its lending protocol, mtToken system, buy-and-distribute mechanism, and upcoming stablecoin, the project offers multiple revenue streams for investors while ensuring long-term adoption. As the presale phase rapidly sells out, investors are taking note of its potential to outperform past market leaders. While Dogecoin’s rise was historic, MUTM’s structured financial model suggests it could be an even bigger success in the evolving DeFi sector.

Crypto moves at breakneck speed. New narratives dominate retail investor mindshare every market cycle. And critics demonize shifting investment patterns as a short-term, speculative frenzy that harms the industry’s growth potential. You might also like: The strategic entry of institutional investors into cryptocurrency | Opinion However, early investors who get into narratives with the highest mindshare accelerate innovation and growth. Unlike VCs and institutions who wait for ‘due process,’ retailers bring the necessary liquidity and attention to emerging industry narratives. They must be encouraged for the industry’s sustainable and holistic growth rather than vilifying mindshare-led investing patterns. Mindshare-driven investing is good practice In 2024, AI emerged as one of the top categories occupying investor mindshare, with over 50% dominance across all market narratives. The growth of AI-related sectors like DeFAI with over 7,000 projects and a peak $7 billion market cap, AI infrastructure protocols, and thousands of AI agents, testifies to the mindshare dominance. Early investors who have rearranged their portfolios and allocated funds to AI-related tokens have made substantial gains as the industry matured. Analysts who think investing in a category with the highest mindshare is a get-rich-quick scheme are wrong. On the contrary, mindshare-based investing helps identify potentially disruptive and innovative sectors to supply capital for supporting their growth and earn long-term dividends. For example, consider AI agents, one of the top categories where retail investors have deployed capital. The market cap of AI agents was just $4.8 billion in October 2024. But soon after the Goatseus Maximus ( GOAT ) token launch on Solana, the market cap of AI agent tokens rose by 322% to $15.5 billion by December 2024. AI Agents aren’t a speculative fad. Neither are they merely glorified bots shitposting on social media. Investing in AI agents means leveraging capital to develop futuristic financial applications. Agentic AIs can reshape digital finance by performing complex tasks within web3 apps and autonomously interacting with users. Eliza, ai16z’s agent, already manages an onchain liquidity pool with over 60% annualized returns. Early use cases for AI agents range from automated trading bots to wallet and transaction management systems. As the technology develops, AI agents will interact with smart contracts, make market data-based decisions, stake tokens, and improve customer service. The capital deployed through tokens helps build the underlying infrastructure for these agentic AIs. Over 10,000 web3 AI agents earned millions of dollars from on-chain activities in 2024. According to VanEck’s 2025 crypto predictions report , there can be a million agents by the end of this year. Consequently, the market capitalization of AI agent tokens will reach $60 billion , per Gracy Chen, CEO of Bitget. The AI agent boom demonstrates it is anything but a short-term investment. Rather, investors who take cues from the dominant mindshare narrative and invest early, deploy capital into future technology. They profit when the industry develops more viable, real-world utilities for consumer-facing applications. To date, most of the capital in the AI agent market has come from retail investors. This trend demonstrates the power of retail capital in fuelling technical innovations without funding assistance from VCs. Towards a mindshare-led retail investing era According to a recent panel discussion at Consensus 2025, VC firms are yet to invest in AI agents despite their initial enthusiasm. Most VC executives think AI agents are “not investable yet” because they’ll take “a bit of time to get there.” The lack of VC funding despite the rapid development of AI agents shows the parochial nature of VC-led capital raising. Following a market share-driven investing approach, VCs wait until an industry is ripe enough to provide predictable and substantial balance sheet profits to its board members. Whereas with mindshare-driven investing, retailers provide the necessary capital to kickstart operations, support early-stage innovations, and sustain growth. AI agents occupy high mindshare among retailers because they enjoy a symbiotic relationship, reinforcing each other’s growth. Protocols like Virtuals empower non-technical people to create, deploy, and monetize AI agents. This creates a positive feedback loop as retailers benefit from innovative agents while AI maintains mindshare dominance. Therefore, by rejecting VC-led high FDV tokens, retailers have seized the opportunity in the AI agent market. It is no surprise that retailer investors hold the maximum number of AI agent tokens on Solana and Base, with almost 50% mindshare, respectively. Investor attention becomes the most valuable currency when multiple narratives compete for limited mindshare and capital reserves. Retailers leverage this currency to foster the development and growth of the sector that’ll benefit them the most. Mindshare-driven investing converts people from passive to active investors as they control the narrative through continuous portfolio management. Instead of relying on VCs and KOLs, retail investors actively shape the market narrative by deploying capital toward cutting-edge tech innovations. Despite ongoing market corrections and uncertain macroeconomic conditions, specific trends, like AI, will continue to dominate investor mindshare due to their long-term utility. And there’s a premium in identifying and getting into such narratives early.

In a new interview with CNBC, Bessent says the United States should welcome crypto-related businesses into the country and take a leadership role in the industry. “I am a big proponent of the US taking the worldwide lead in crypto. I think we have to bring it onshore and they use our best practices and regulation.” He also praises the recent action by US President Donald Trump to create a Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve, which commits the US to not selling any seized BTC. According to the White House’s “Crypto Czar,” David Sacks, the US government has sold approximately 195,000 Bitcoin for $366 million, far less than the more than $17 billion it would be worth today. The US government currently owns $17.05 billion worth of BTC, per data from the blockchain analytics firm Arkham. Bessent adds that there may eventually be developed an acquisition plan to purchase more Bitcoin for the reserve. “I think that the Bitcoin reserve, before you can accumulate it, you have to stop selling it. So what we have now is from a seized asset pool… So the first thing to do is to stop the selling… After the victims are paid, and all of that, any seized assets will go into this reserve, and then we’ll see what the way forward is for more acquisitions for the reserves.” Bitcoin is trading for $86,624 at time of writing, flat on the day.

Industry leaders met Donald Trump at the first-ever White House crypto summit, discussing the path forward and rolling back the aggressive regulatory stance adopted during the Biden administration. Bitcoin Acquisition Plans In Discussion US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has revealed that Bitcoin acquisition plans are being discussed, and the government will evaluate the plan moving forward. Bessent shared his views in an interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box, and discussed President Trump’s recent order to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Bessent stated, “Generally, I’m a big proponent of the US taking the worldwide lead in crypto. I think we have to bring it onshore using best practices and regulations.” He also addressed the rationale behind creating the Bitcoin reserve, adding that the first step is to halt the sale of the seized Bitcoin before making additional acquisitions. “I think the Bitcoin reserve, before you can accumulate it you have to stop selling it. What we have now is from a seized asset pool. I believe what happened was that about 500 million dollars of Bitcoin was seized, and half of it was sold.” Bessent stated the remaining seized assets would be redirected to the reserve after victim repayment obligations were met. The Treasury would then evaluate strategies for additional acquisitions. “And then we’ll see what the way forward is for more acquisitions for the reserve.” Bitcoin (BTC) Not The Only Asset In Reserve Bessent stated that white Bitcoin (BTC) is the initial focus of the reserve, it has a far broader scope, adding, “We’re starting with Bitcoin, but it’s an overall crypto reserve.” Bessent’s remarks come after President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve, instructing agencies to retain confiscated BTC instead of liquidating it. The order left many in the crypto ecosystem disappointed, as many expected the government to purchase Bitcoin directly. The industry also expected the executive order to include a proactive acquisition plan, similar to Senator Cynthia Lummus’s proposal to strategically buy and hold Bitcoin as a long-term investment to reduce the national debt. However, the absence of such a buying strategy has sparked unrest among investors. Will The US Buy Bitcoin? Bessent stated the Trump administration intends to take a structured approach to maintain and expand the reserve. He also said no taxpayer funds would be used to finance acquisitions. However, he did not elaborate on how further Bitcoin acquisitions will occur. “The first step is to stop selling. And then we’re going to put a plan in place from there. I’m going back to Washington this afternoon, and then we’ll talk about the way forward.” Squawk Box co-host Andrew Ross Sorkin stated there seems to be no current plan for Bitcoin purchases. “Do you know of a way that they could [buy Bitcoin] without taking taxpayer? No, honestly, I say that because it’s the craziest thing I’ve ever heard in my whole life.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Dogecoin Steadies Around $0.21 as Traders Watch Key Resistance Levels Dogecoin is currently trading between $0.20 and $0.26, showing a slight increase of 2.35% over the past week. The price is aligning with its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages, both at $0.21, indicating a period of consolidation. The relative strength index (RSI) is at 54.78, which suggests the market is neither overbought nor oversold. The nearest resistance level is at $0.28. If Dogecoin breaks above this point, it could move toward the second resistance level at $0.35, marking a potential increase of over 34% from the current price. The nearest support level is at $0.16, providing a possible floor for price drops. A positive MACD level of 0.0028 hints at emerging upward momentum. With these indicators, Dogecoin may be poised for growth in the near future. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Eyes Growth as Altcoin Season Approaches Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been trading within a narrow range, hovering around $0.00001350. This aligns closely with its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages, indicating a period of consolidation. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is just above 56, suggesting that SHIB is neither overbought nor oversold. Over the past week, the price has dipped slightly, but it’s still up compared to six months ago. This mixed performance shows a tug-of-war between bulls and bears, with neither side taking clear control. As the crypto community anticipates a new altcoin season, SHIB could be set for upward movement. If it breaks above the nearest resistance level around $0.000017, it may target the next resistance near $0.0000197—an increase of over 40% from current levels. Technical indicators like the Stochastic oscillator and MACD hint at a potential bullish trend. If the price pulls back, support levels near $0.000012 and $0.0000094 might hold firm. Traders are watching SHIB closely, eyeing its potential in the evolving market landscape. Conclusion While DOGE and SHIB show promise, XYZVerse stands out with its sports-meme fusion, targeting massive growth and offering a unique, community-driven ecosystem.

Coldware (COLD) is making waves in the DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) model space, drawing the attention of seasoned investors looking for the next big move. With recent doubts surrounding Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), especially with President Trump’s influence on the market, many are beginning to explore alternatives like Coldware (COLD) , which presents a fresh take on decentralized technologies and offers new opportunities for long-term growth. Uncertainty Surrounds Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) with Trump’s Announcement As the cryptocurrency market saw some volatility with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), the influence of high-profile figures like Donald Trump is impossible to ignore. Trump’s recent comments about his crypto reserve have left investors questioning their next steps, especially regarding Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), the two giants of the crypto space. These two tokens, despite their established status, face growing concerns over regulatory changes and market dynamics that may limit their growth potential in the near term. While Bitcoin (BTC) continues to fluctuate around key price levels, Ethereum (ETH) also finds itself under pressure. Both networks are facing challenges that could affect their scalability and transaction costs. Amidst this uncertainty, Coldware (COLD) presents an intriguing alternative for investors who are wary of traditional blockchain models. Coldware (COLD): A Game-Changer for DePIN and Blockchain Innovation Coldware (COLD) is rapidly gaining recognition as a next-generation blockchain solution that leverages the power of decentralized physical infrastructure. Unlike Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC), Coldware (COLD) focuses on a more scalable and efficient model that reduces the dependency on traditional network structures. Coldware’s DePIN model introduces a new form of decentralized ownership and governance, allowing token holders to participate in the decision-making processes related to physical infrastructure, such as data centers, power grids, and more. This innovative approach is gaining traction in the crypto community, especially as Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) struggle to adapt to the demands of modern blockchain use cases. Coldware (COLD) is poised to capitalize on this shift by offering a more sustainable and scalable blockchain ecosystem, which could position it as a key player in the next phase of cryptocurrency evolution. Why Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) Investors Are Turning to Coldware (COLD) With market conditions growing increasingly uncertain for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), many investors are looking for fresh opportunities. Coldware (COLD) provides an attractive alternative, especially for those who are familiar with the challenges these two major cryptocurrencies face. For example, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) often experience network congestion and high transaction fees during peak periods. Coldware (COLD), on the other hand, operates on a more efficient consensus mechanism that mitigates these issues. Moreover, Coldware’s unique DePIN model offers investors the opportunity to diversify into physical infrastructure, which could help stabilize portfolios amidst the volatility in the digital asset space. Coldware (COLD) offers more than just a token; it represents a stake in a decentralized network of critical infrastructure, providing long-term value beyond mere speculation. The Future of Cryptocurrency: Coldware (COLD) Leads the Way As Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) face potential slowdowns and doubts cloud their future, Coldware (COLD) is carving a path that could define the next era of decentralized finance and infrastructure. With its DePIN model, Coldware (COLD) opens up new avenues for investment and decentralization that could outperform traditional blockchain systems. In a market where large players like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) dominate, Coldware (COLD) provides a refreshing alternative, making it an exciting option for forward-thinking investors. The next wave of crypto innovation may very well be driven by Coldware (COLD), making it a must-watch token in the coming months.

With thousands now flocking to Remittix in a trend that goes against conventional ICO norms, investors are wondering how these developments could impact Dogecoin’s destiny. Some are waiting and watching, expecting policy signals to send DOGE soaring or plummeting within hours. Either way, traders are anticipating a potentially volatile but rewarding ride. DOGE and the Impact of a Crypto Reserve DOGE has again attracted investors’ attention, with insiders reporting sneaky and cinematic activity in recent days. The meme coin is trading at $0.2015 with a small 0.13% increase in a day and a market capitalization of approximately $29.9 billion. Any official reserve, whether non-dogecoin-specific, would redefine DOGE price forecast in alternative shapes. A government reserve would, in the initial place, be a signal that governments have a specific interest in high-end money and can drive meme tokens to the periphery. Source: Tradingview Stable regulation would also drive capital to ventures with purported real-world utility, surpassing DOGE’s meme origins. DOGE supporters do, however, invoke its enormous internet following in the hope that network effects and viral culture keep DOGE in a competitive niche. Recent social media chatter references a “Golden Cross” on DOGE’s chart, which is highlighted by David Dogecoin’s tweet. This sort of technical signal—where the 100-day moving average moves above the 200-day—often suggests a bullish breakout is near. While it might give DOGE price prediction a short-term boost, broader macro factors like regulatory news or changes in Bitcoin sentiment still hold a big sway over DOGE’s direction. DOGE Price Prediction Amid Shifting Market Sentiment Despite DOGE’s enormous fan base, the token’s daily volume rose only 2.44% to $1.81 billion. Relatively subdued trading indicates Dogecoin may be suffering from waning hype as newer tokens take centre stage. A legitimate crypto reserve, to the possible detriment of tokens with less robust use cases, might further dampen investor focus on DOGE. However, some think that DOGE can still experience sudden price surges, especially if influential figures rekindle public interest. A bright price prediction for DOGE based on memes alone can be fragile, but a supportive policy environment could lift DOGE from contagion. If governments soften their stance toward digital assets, the retail investor could move in, and DOGE can ride the wave. However, the development of practical finance tools like Remittix and others signifies a drift away from pure speculation and a shift towards tokens that genuinely face real-world problems to solve. To that degree, DOGE possesses a dynamic world that is not solely within its control. Thousands Flock To Remittix: A Utility-Driven Alternative Whereas DOGE is plagued with dubious direction, Remittix is a project that addresses real global needs rather than surfing on the web meme frontier. Remittix has managed to sell more than 516 million tokens at $0.0734 and has raised more than $13.7 million. Remittix, as opposed to most initial coin offerings (ICOs) that tantalize with great promises but minimal real substance, is exploring PayFi—a platform that integrates crypto velocity with live banking to enhance global remittances. Consider a European buyer paying a Canadian freelancer, or a Peruvian exporter importing from Asia. Remittix eliminates backroom wire fees, enabling near-instant crypto-to-FIAT. In a space previously occupied by shinier meme tokens, such a user value proposition resonates. Merchants, e-commerce platforms, and freelancers tired of traditional inefficiencies, welcome the emphasis. It’s no wonder, then, that thousands have signed up to Remittix, possibly siphoning capital that would have otherwise flowed into DOGE. Others foresee heightened demand for stable regulation to the detriment of tokens like Remittix, which addresses real financial impediments. If a crypto reserve encourages a problem-solving mindset and not social media madness, Remittix could soar. If DOGE can’t escape being a meme coin, it could be replaced by utility tokens. But DOGE’s inherent volatility and cultural value could have it spreading even more widely or to new use cases, so the token’s destiny can’t be predicted. Remittix Defying the ICO Norm Remittix has also attracted interest due to being among non-standard ICO traps. ICOs typically rely on surface-level marketing and hard-sell roadmaps with no concrete proof of concept. Remittix, on the contrary, has a functional product that can be deployed by companies. The project’s pay-as-you-go business model, transparent pricing, and simple dashboard appeal to risk-averse clients who shun complex installations. This functional application thrives in a space in which DOGE thrives with social media hype in place of utility. If the cryptocurrency reserve myth ever turns into policy reality, tokens with instant fixes would be thrust into being more than gambles in assets. With Remittix making cross-border transfers easy, inroads in spaces beyond crypto fans can be made by the platform. The more real-life, ordinary money gets, the stronger tokens like RTX become. DOGE trails behind with policy and consumer demand siding with established, service-oriented companies.

Here’s What It Means,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-army-and-u-s-government-interests-align-for-the-first-time-heres-what-it-means/,"Crypto entrepreneur Yassin Mobarak (@Dizer_YM) has drawn attention to the possibility that the U.S. government will soon hold XRP for the first time in history. In a post on X, Mobarak speculated that Ripple’s $125 million penalty to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could be paid in XRP rather than U.S. dollars. Mobarak argued that this development would align the interests of the government and the XRP community, potentially unlocking XRP’s long-awaited utility in the U.S. The penalty stems from a court ruling that Ripple violated securities laws through institutional XRP sales. To manage this payment, Ripple requested a delay and proposed placing the $125 million into an escrow account, an arrangement the SEC accepted. However, whether the escrowed funds were held in U.S. dollars or XRP remains unclear. #XRPCommunity Ripple Labs was ordered to pay a $125 million penalty to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for improperly selling its $XRP tokens. To manage this payment, Ripple requested a delay and proposed placing the $125 million into an escrow account. The… — Yassin Mobarak (@Dizer_YM) March 7, 2025 The U.S. Government’s Stockpile and Its Implications Mobarak’s theory is tied to a newly announced U.S. government Stockpile account, which is expected to contain select high-quality digital assets with sufficient market liquidity. He suggested that the SEC might accept Ripple’s penalty payment in XRP and deposit it into this Stockpile. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Donald Trump recently announced the creation of the national crypto reserve . According to his executive order, the U.S. will fill the stockpile with assets obtained through forfeitures. If Ripple pays $125 million worth of XRP into this stockpile, Mobarak believes it would mark a major shift for XRP. He also believes Ripple will gladly agree to this arrangement, as the U.S. government will hold XRP for the first time, and may be incentivized to let its price grow. According to him, this could remove regulatory barriers that have hindered XRP’s use in the U.S. and lead to positive price movements. The SEC’s Changing Stance on Crypto The discussion around Ripple’s penalty comes amid significant changes in the SEC’s approach to cryptocurrency regulation. The regulator recently dismissed its lawsuit against Coinbase and dropped investigations into Uniswap Labs, Gemini, and other crypto firms. This shift suggests a departure from the aggressive enforcement strategy seen under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler. However, the Ripple lawsuit remains unresolved, and its appeal process is ongoing. Mobarak noted that the Interests of the U.S. government and XRP army are aligned for the first time, and the dismissal of the lawsuit could be part of the government’s strategy to boost XRP’s value.

Recently, Galaxy Digital staked $40M worth of SOL tokens, which could ease the sell-side pressure that is currently weighing on Solana. As staking activities rise, can Solana price recover from bearish trends and rally? At press time, Solana price trades at $136 after a 4.4% decline in 24 hours. Solana Price in Focus as Galaxy Digital Stakes $40M SOL Solana price has been facing high selling pressure from the March FTX unlocks . However, a sudden surge in staking activity could turn the tide and push the SOL price higher. According to LookonChain , crypto investment firm Galaxy Digital withdrew 282,000 SOL from Coinbase, Binance, and other exchanges. It later staked 274,000 tokens valued at approximately $39M. This staking activity shows the firm is not willing to sell SOL in the near term. Solana Staking Data from Dune Analytics shows a slight drop in Solana staking activities. As traders and institutions unstaked SOL and deposited their tokens to exchanges, it contributed to high selling activity. However, if staking activity is increasing again, it could absorb the selling pressure that is currently pushing Solana price down and pave the way for a recovery. Dune Analytics Is Solana Poised for a Parabolic Rally? SOL price could be poised for a parabolic rally, with analysts sharing a bullish Solana price prediction . Per analyst Ali Charts, SOL price has been moving in consolidation within a right-angled triangle pattern, which hints at a significant price move ahead. If Solana defends support at the lower trendline of this pattern and rallies to breach resistance at the upper trendline, it could ignite a parabolic price rally. However, more buyer support is needed to support such an upswing. SOL/USDT: 1-day Chart Another analyst, Satoshi Flipper, also shared a bullish outlook on SOL price, saying that it was testing resistance at the upper trendline of a descending parallel channel. SOL has been fluctuating within this channel for more than a month as bearish trends prevailed. If SOL breaches resistance at the upper trendline, it could indicate a buy signal that will trigger a rise in demand. This could push Solana price past $200 to its all-time highs. SOL/USDT: 1-day Chart Solana price has been under stiff bearish pressure due to weak sentiment in the broader crypto market. However, institutional interest is rising again after Galaxy Digital staked $39M worth of SOL. If staking activity continues, SOL may record a swift recovery.

The U.S. government has waved on how to regulate cryptocurrency for years, unsure how to incentivize innovation while keeping the public safe. With Trump personally involved, the administration seems eager to cement America’s status as a global digital asset market player. Just hours ago, U.S. President Donald Trump promised to support legislative efforts to build the regulatory framework for stablecoins . That came after his order to form a U.S. regulatory body and a separate stockpile of other digital assets. During a meeting with crypto executives at the White House, Trump said he wants to give his full support to lawmakers in Congress as they craft bills to clarify the regulatory status of dollar-backed stablecoins and the broader digital asset markets. Stablecoins bridge the gap between fiat and crypto stability Stablecoins serve as a bridge between the stability of fiat currency and the price volatility of cryptocurrencies, making them a critical solution for traders, investors, and everyday users alike. In contrast to regular digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, whose prices can be very volatile, stablecoins tend not to change and are pegged to a reserve of either fiat currency, commodities, or a basket of assets. This stability makes them more functional for payments, remittances, and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Different stablecoins have different underlying mechanisms. Traditional currency-backed or fiat-collateralized stablecoins — such as USDT and USDC — have reserves in several currencies that are guaranteed to equal their nominal value 1:1. The DAI is an example of a crypto-collateralized stablecoin, which would require over-collateralization from digital assets to exist. Algorithmic stablecoins rely on smart contracts to automatically adjust supply and demand, although some, such as Terra’s UST, have shown to be risky. PAX Gold — a commodity-backed stablecoin that derives its value from tangible assets like gold, providing investors with digital exposure to physical commodities. White House pushes crypto regulation and stablecoin strategy Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who attended the White House meeting, stated his commitment to collaborating with agencies and regulators—including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Internal Revenue Service—to update and revise existing guidance. “We are going to keep the U.S. the dominant reserve currency in the world, and we will use stablecoins to do that,” he said. Among those present at the White House roundtable were Coinbase Global Inc. CEO Brian Armstrong, Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor (formerly of MicroStrategy Inc.), and billionaire twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. Late Thursday, Trump signed an executive order establishing a Bitcoin reserve and a separate stockpile of other digital assets, both to be funded with cryptocurrency seized in legal proceedings. According to the order, both the reserve and the stockpile will consist of crypto assets forfeited through legal actions. A few weeks ago, Senator Bill Hagerty introduced legislation that seeks to create a predictable regulatory environment for stablecoins, cryptocurrencies marketed as being less volatile than other tokens because their value is pegged to the dollar or other stable assets. Proponents say that federal regulation would legitimize the asset class and could lead to broader adoption. Stablecoins serve as the main conduit for crypto trading and have become more popular in payment systems. Are stablecoins a safe haven or a crypto illusion for investors? Since their introduction in 2014, new stablecoins have entered several markets, making investors more confident about trading crypto and resulting in higher movement and trade volume. However, don’t expect to make big returns (if any) while trading stablecoins because their value lies in their stability compared to other digital currencies. Most traders use stablecoins to hedge against crashing markets, making them a safe haven for your digital funds until the markets normalize. Despite carrying “little” to no risk in the market, stablecoins need regulation, supervision, and sufficient oversight before they become a risk to payment systems’ operations. Existing coins must be contained within a regulatory framework, and new ones need to follow the same procedures to be developed. Stablecoin regulation and a Bitcoin reserve could benefit the U.S. economy only if executed with transparency and a clear long-term strategy. U.S. to audit crypto holdings as Bitcoin Reserve strategy unfolds The first thing that the White House crypto czar, David Sacks, said they will probably do after the executive order is an audit of the government’s crypto holdings. In an interview with Bloomberg TV on Friday, Sacks revealed that the U.S. government had acquired approximately 400,000 Bitcoin over the past decade, primarily through criminal and civil litigation seizures. He estimated that the government still retains about half of that total. “We say we believe because no one knows for sure, we never had a proper audit,” he said. According to data from blockchain analytics researcher Arkham, the U.S. currently owns roughly $17.5 billion in Bitcoin and about $400 million worth of several other tokens in its known digital wallets. Bitcoin fell around 3% to $87,172 as of 4:27 p.m. in New York. The executive order authorizes the Treasury and Commerce departments to develop “budget-neutral strategies” for buying more Bitcoin for the reserve with no incremental costs to taxpayers. The government will not acquire additional crypto for the separate stockpile of other digital assets beyond those obtained through forfeiture proceedings. The executive order directs the Treasury and Commerce departments to devise “budget-neutral strategies” for purchasing additional Bitcoin for the reserve without imposing extra costs on taxpayers. However, the government will not acquire more cryptocurrency for the separate digital asset stockpile beyond what is obtained through forfeiture proceedings. “With the reserve, the goal is long-term preservation,” Sacks said. “With the stockpile, the goal is responsible stewardship.” The US president made several crypto-specific promises to the industry ahead of his re-election last November, with the goal of making America the “crypto capital of the planet.” An earlier executive order on digital assets, issued shortly after Trump’s inauguration in January, established a working group of agency heads tasked with recommending policies for the sector’s development. The crypto industry has gained momentum on Capitol Hill, with lawmakers introducing pro-crypto legislation. Financial regulatory agencies—now led by Trump-appointed crypto-friendly officials—have also taken a supportive stance. In recent weeks, the Securities and Exchange Commission has paused or closed more than 10 crypto-related investigations and cases. As the administration enacts these policies, the crucial question is whether this marks a turning point for crypto adoption in the U.S., or merely business as usual in the form of political opportunism. Time will tell, but one thing is for sure: the government’s position regarding digital assets is changing, and the world is watching.",OP-ED|BTC|Coinbase|ETH|SEC|Strategy|USD,EN,0,0,REGULATION|FIAT|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-08 13:14:06

Infantino made the remarks while attending President Trump’s White House Crypto Summit on March 7. Standing alongside Trump, Infantino expressed FIFA’s interest in creating a digital token to interact with its global fanbase. “FIFA is very, very interested to develop a FIFA coin, to do it from here, from America, and to conquer the 5 billion soccer fans in the world,” Infantino stated. “If there is anyone here who is interested to team up with FIFA, here we are, together with the United States of America, and we will conquer the world of soccer with the FIFA coin.” The announcement, though lacking specific details or timelines, hints at FIFA’s exploration of blockchain technology as a potential avenue for fan engagement and revenue generation. Trump responded positively to Gianni stating: “That coin may be worth more than FIFA in the end. It could be quite a coin, actually.” You might also like: Crypto finally dropped its ‘bros’ era and made way for a new, inclusive chapter | Opinion FIFA token surges 357,000% Following the summit, market confusion led to a surge in an unaffiliated cryptocurrency named “FIFA.

As a result, thousands of SOL investors are looking for better opportunities to counteract current losses. Meanwhile, crypto presale projects like Rollblock are gaining attention for their consistent growth. Having raised over $10.8 million in its ongoing presale, the question remains: Can RBLK successfully surpass SOL in 2025? Find the details below! Rollblock’s crypto presale dominates the market Rollblock is a promising crypto project that brings efficiency to the $540 billion gambling industry. With over 300 million active players in iGaming, Rollblock could prove astronomical in its niche. The platform uses blockchain technology to secure transactions and verify game results, unlike traditional casinos that manipulate winnings and influence odds. Here, success is entirely dependent on one's gambling skills. The platform offers a selection of over 7,000 games, from classic casino favourites to innovative virtual experiences. Smart contracts run these games, ensuring that every outcome is fair. As a second bolt in its security, Rollblock undergoes regular audits with SolidProof and complies with strict regulatory checks. Central to Rollblock is the RBLK token, which serves multiple purposes. Players use it to access games, stake for rewards, and earn a share of the platform’s revenue. Each week, 30% of Rollblock’s profits go toward buying back RBLK tokens from the market. Of these, 60% are sent to a burn wallet, reducing supply and driving value higher over time. The remaining 40% is distributed to stakers, offering a steady stream of passive income. In fact, Rollblock provides extra incentives like cashback rewards and bonus programs. By blending gaming with GambleFi, it delivers a unique, rewarding experience for both players and investors. Rollblock is establishing a unique ecosystem that stands out in the crowded crypto market. Its ongoing crypto presale has already generated significant returns for early backers, with analysts forecasting even greater gains if it lists on platforms like Uniswap or Binance. Solana faces resistance after Trump’s crypto strategy announcement Solana just got a nod from US President Donald Trump. In a recent post on Truth social , he expresses his support for a crypto strategic reserve that includes SOL, XRP, and ADA. His executive order directs the Presidential Working Group to move forward on this initiative, aiming to make the US the “crypto capital of the world.” Within a few hours, SOL responded with a 26.94% surge from $140.7 to $178.6. However, a US crypto reserve cannot happen overnight, as Congress must draft, debate, and pass the necessary legislation. As a result, the green candle was short-lived, with short traders cashing in on profits. SOL has since dropped to $152.5, trading 30.7% below the previous month. This is in addition to 19 red days and a Fear and Greed Index (FGI) of 33. According to the latest Solana price prediction, Solana’s price is projected to recover as early as March 8, 2025. Before August, the SOL token could cross $300, hinting at a potential 95% increase by Q3. While Solana's future appears promising, late investors must carefully navigate global market pressures, balancing optimism with strategic planning. Source: CoinCodex Conclusion While SOL is beneficial to long-term holders, Rollblock is the peak of fun all year round. Players and investors enjoy the thrill of gambling on Rollblock with weekly rakebacks and tiered bonuses. For $0.061 per RBLK token, anyone around the world can own a piece of a billion-dollar opportunity.

However, while waiting for that potential rally, crypto whales are shifting their focus to Rollblock – a GameFi protocol already delivering high returns. Priced at just $0.061, Rollblock’s token has surged over 600% from its initial price of $0.01. In just ten presale rounds, the protocol has raised nearly $11 million, making it one of the largest GameFi presales in Web3 history. With demand growing, investors see Rollblock as a standout opportunity in the current market. Dogecoin Price Prediction: DOGE Consolidates as the Memecoin Market Loses Investor Interest Dogecoin is trading at $0.2049, down 19.6% in the past two weeks as the memecoin market continues to crash. Since December, the sector has lost more than half its value, with its total market cap plunging to $54 billion from a peak of $124 billion according to Coinmarketcap . The collapse follows an all-time high of $137 billion on December 8, driven by Donald Trump’s presidential victory. However, despite Trump and Melania Trump launching their memecoins in January, the market has steadily erased all post-election gains, with Dogecoin and other memecoins struggling to regain momentum. Memecoin trading volume across major platforms has also collapsed. Pump.fun saw a 63% drop in volume, falling from $119 billion in January to $44 billion in February, according to Dune Analytics . Daily token listings dropped from 1,200 to below 300. Scams and fraud have worsened investor sentiment in Dogecoin and other memecoins. The “Libragate” rug pull, endorsed by Argentine President Javier Milei, wiped out $107 million, with 86% of investors losing over $1,000. The SEC has confirmed that memecoins aren’t securities but warned of regulatory action against fraud. Despite the downturn, Dogecoin remains the largest memecoin, supported by its strong community and Elon Musk endorsements. However, without renewed adoption or utility, Dogecoin and the broader memecoin sector could continue to decline as investors shift toward more stable assets. Rollblock Scores Massive $10.8 Million Presale Victory Rollblock’s presale is gaining momentum, attracting over 50,000 early investors across ten rounds. With a 50% purchase bonus now available, demand is expected to rise further, bringing the project closer to its $11 million funding goal. Rollblock’s success comes from its innovative approach to online gaming. The platform hosts over 7,000 AI-powered games directly on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring every outcome is recorded on-chain. This transparency eliminates fraud and manipulation, setting it apart from traditional gaming platforms plagued by trust issues. Beyond security, Rollblock is redefining transaction speeds. While conventional gaming sites suffer from slow withdrawals and processing delays, Rollblock enables instant deposits and withdrawals across 20+ cryptocurrencies including Dogecoin and Solana. For fiat users, seamless payment integration with Apple Pay, Google Pay, Mastercard, and Visa makes transactions effortless. At the heart of the ecosystem is RBLK, Rollblock’s utility token, powering transactions, staking rewards, and passive income opportunities. With a fixed supply of 1 billion tokens, its deflationary model continuously reduces circulating supply, driving scarcity and long-term demand. Can Rollblock Surge to $1 This Cycle? Rollblock’s combination of a high-utility token and a fully transparent gaming platform has attracted both players and investors. In February alone, the protocol gained 10,000 new users, with a surge in bets, deposits, and signups. If Rollblock could maintain its success in March, many believe the protocol could become a top-ten crypto token by 2025. Momentum continues to build with new presale bonuses. Investors can now earn a 30% referral bonus and an additional 20% purchase bonus, stacking for a total 50% bonus, boosting demand and participation. Crypto YouTuber Freddie Finance has also highlighted Rollblock’s potential, predicting that RBLK could reach $1, outperforming Dogecoin and other established altcoins.

While meme coins like PEPE have made millionaires overnight, smart investors are looking at utility platforms with clear long-term potential. Rollblock (RBLK) is more than just another gaming token, it's reshaping GameFi, and its breakout potential could be even bigger. With so many bullish factors in its favor, it is not surprising that crypto analysts have been projecting a Rollblock rally of up 50x in the coming months. Here’s why now is the best time to get on board… Rollblock (RBLK): The Future of Provably Fair Gaming Is Here Rollblock is taking Web3 gaming to the next level, offering complete transparency through fully verifiable blockchain transactions. Unlike traditional platforms, where trust is a gamble, Rollblock ensures every bid and payout is secured on the mighty Ethereum blockchain. This innovative technology is revolutionizing the enormous $500 billion industry, growing at 8% annually, by eliminating any hint of house manipulation and offering a truly fair gaming experience for the very first time. The platform is seeing explosive growth, with month-on-month increases in signups, deposits, and wagered bids. RBLK presale inflows have already surpassed $10.8 million, showing strong investor confidence in the project. Users can enjoy over 7,000 classic games, including live poker and blackjack, alongside an innovative sports prediction league. All fiat deposits are seamless with Apple Pay, Google Pay, Visa, and Mastercard, making it easier than ever for gamers to jump in. The Key to RBLK’s Recent Growth Rollblock’s revenue-sharing model puts its investors first. The platform takes up to 0% of its weekly revenue to buy RBLK tokens, 60% of which are burned to reduce the supply and 40% which is used for lucrative staking rewards, offering up to 30% APY. With over 40% of Stage 10 tokens already sold at $0.061, prices will continue to rise as major crypto exchange listings approach. In March, referring a friend earns both parties a 30% RBLK bonus, plus a further 20% purchase bonus.

After a historic surge last year, PEPE has seen ongoing volatility, with many traders now speculating on its next move. Currently, PEPE is trading at $0.0000071, having dropped by 6% in the last week of chop. Price predictions for PEPE range considerably, given the ever-changing volatility of this token. An average prediction for January 2026 is around $0.000305, which represents a stunning 79% surge in under a year. This will no doubt be a result of the recent flurry of top-tier exchange listings, which saw PEPE appear on giants such as Binance.us and Coinbase, as well as the trading app Robinhood. With its distinctive frog character appearing all over crypto social media, PEPE is superbly placed to fly high during the next season of meme coin mania. Analysts suggest that while PEPE could see further gains in more bullish scenarios, it lacks the long-term fundamentals that make other projects a superior investment at the current time. Rollblock Emerges as the Best Crypto Investment Opportunity Bar None Bullish PEPE price predictions may continue to dominate the headlines, but Rollblock’s breakout potential looks even bigger this cycle. With a growing user base, provably fair gaming, and a unique revenue-sharing model, RBLK has the most upside potential of any crypto project in 2025.

The statement, posted Friday morning, comes after Russia launched a massive missile and drone strike against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure overnight. Trump says the penalties would remain in place until a “final settlement agreement on peace” is reached. This comes just days after Trump cut off all US military aid and intelligence-sharing with Ukraine. Now, with Russia “absolutely pounding” Ukraine on the battlefield, Trump appears to be changing course. But he isn’t saying much about how the sanctions and tariffs would work, or whether this decision has anything to do with the latest Russian attacks. Trump turns against Russia after pausing Ukraine aid Trump’s shift in tone has left many questioning what changed. Last Friday, he invited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to the Oval Office —only to berate him in front of reporters. Just days before that, Trump called Zelensky a dictator and accused Ukraine of starting the war that began when Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion on February 24, 2022. Following the heated meeting, Trump pulled the plug on all US military assistance to Ukraine, effectively leaving Kyiv without crucial American support. Then, on Thursday night, Russia unleashed a major airstrike on Ukraine. Nearly 70 missiles and 200 attack drones targeted critical infrastructure, cutting power and damaging residential buildings. By Friday morning, Trump had apparently decided that the situation needed economic retaliation. He told reporters, “They [Russia] are bombing the hell out of them [Ukraine] right now… and I put a statement out, a very strong statement: ‘Can’t do that, can’t do that.’” When asked if his pause on military cooperation helped Russia, Trump dodged the question. Instead, he said, “Putin is doing what anyone else would do.” Moscow has been dodging sanctions for years Trump’s new stance on sanctions and tariffs raises questions about what they would actually accomplish. Moscow is already under the toughest economic restrictions in history, largely targeting its oil exports and foreign currency reserves. But Russia has found ways around them. The Kremlin has built a network of sanctions evasion tactics, exporting discounted oil to India and China and importing Western-made goods through Kazakhstan and other neighboring countries. China has also been accused of helping sustain Russia’s war effort by supplying dual-use technology, though Beijing denies this. Trump hasn’t explained what would make his proposed tariffs or banking restrictions any different from the existing penalties. Nor has he said how the US would enforce them against a country that has already spent years outmaneuvering Western restrictions. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hinted at a more aggressive sanctions strategy while speaking at the Economic Club of New York on Thursday. He stated that Trump’s administration “has kept enhanced sanctions on Russia in place” and is now prepared to go “all in” on tougher economic pressure if it would help secure peace negotiations. Bessent also took a swipe at President Joe Biden, accusing him of imposing weak sanctions on Russia’s energy sector. He claimed Biden eased restrictions on Moscow to avoid driving up US energy prices during an election year. Bessent went even further, alleging that Biden lifted US sanctions on Russia in January. But there’s no record of that happening. Ten days before Trump took office, the US Treasury Department expanded energy sanctions on Russia, and there is no evidence that any of them were rolled back. Zelensky calls for a truce as Europe steps in As Trump and Putin’s relationship keeps shifting, Zelensky has called for an immediate truce in the air and at sea. Following Russia’s massive overnight attack, he said Ukraine is “ready to take the path to peace”, adding that Ukraine has “wanted peace from the very first second of this war.” Despite Trump’s uncertainty about supporting Ukraine, European leaders are stepping up. On Wednesday, French President Emmanuel Macron reassured Kyiv that Europe will continue providing military aid, even if the US pulls out completely. Ukraine has been using F-16 fighter jets and Mirage-2000 aircraft provided by France to defend its airspace, proving that Western military support is still crucial. But with the US cutting ties, Ukraine is becoming increasingly dependent on European allies to keep up its fight. While Trump threatens tariffs and sanctions, Putin appears unfazed. Russia’s latest airstrike was one of its biggest yet, and there are no signs of a retreat. Moscow is watching, Ukraine is waiting, and the White House is now forced to answer for its latest move.

Rollblock is making waves in the iGaming sector, combining blockchain innovation with real-world revenue streams. With millions raised in presale and rapid adoption, some investors see RBLK as a potential Ethereum challenger in its niche. As momentum builds, Rollblock’s growth trajectory positions it as the next major player in the crypto space ahead of Solana. Rollblock (RBLK): The Future of Blockchain Gaming With Massive Growth Potential Rollblock has established itself as the future of crypto gaming by seamlessly integrating blockchain technology with traditional gaming systems. Offering over 7,000 classic games, including poker, blackjack, and sports bidding, the platform attracts tens of thousands of daily players, wagering on the NBA, UFC, and the Premier League. With sports bidding now integrated, Rollblock’s ecosystem is more engaging than ever. Investors anticipate further price appreciation post-presale, making this a key entry point before Rollblock’s next major breakout. Security also remains paramount, with a SolidProof audit and an Anjouan Gaming license ensuring full transparency. Every bet is recorded on-chain, preventing manipulation and solidifying Rollblock’s credibility as a fair gaming hub. Freddie Finance on YouTube highlights that Rollblock’s economic model is designed for sustainability, using up to 30% of platform revenue to buy back RBLK tokens. Of these, 60% are burned, reducing supply, while 40% is distributed to stakers, offering lucrative passive income opportunities. Thanks to its play-to-earn and hold-to-earn mechanics, Rollblock’s user base has surpassed 50,000 members ahead of its official exchange listing. With RBLK’s value surging 500% and another 800% spike projected before the presale ends, investors are racing to secure their stake before the next price jump. Rollblock’s explosive growth continues as Stage 10 of its presale sells out, offering RBLK at $0.061. With nearly $11 million raised and a rapidly expanding community, Rollblock is emerging as a premier iGaming and blockchain entertainment platform. A limited-time referral program grants users a 30% bonus for bringing in new participants, increasing their RBLK holdings ahead of exchange listings. Solana Price Outlook: SOL Eyes $225 Amid ETF Speculation Solana (SOL) has experienced massive price fluctuations in 2025. The altcoin has lost approximately 30% of its value on the monthly charts, although Trump’s recent announcement of SOL’s addition to the U.S. crypto reserve has boosted optimism. Following the announcement Solana surged 7.2% on the weekly charts, trading in the $140 to $160 range. Market expert Jelle forecasts an increased bullish sentiment among investors and predicts SOL will reach $225 while maintaining its position along the trendline. Meanwhile, public anticipation is building as CME Group gears up to launch Solana futures on March 17th, enhancing possibilities for Spot Solana ETF authorization. The regulatory approval petitions from Franklin Templeton and Grayscale for a Solana ETF create favorable conditions for Solana to compete with Ethereum as a leading institutional investment option. Furthermore, Crypto trader Ali Martinez has sparked excitement by revealing that Solana (SOL) is breaking out of a descending parallel channel, signaling a potential rally. If momentum holds, SOL could climb to $213, marking a strong recovery from recent dips Despite short-term price fluctuations, Solana’s dominance in meme coins and decentralized applications positions it as a top contender in this bull cycle, making it a key asset to watch in 2025. Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Heats Up and Nears $11M Funding With altcoin markets primed for a breakout, now is the time to position for maximum gains.

However, Rollblock (RBLK) is emerging as a higher-growth contender, capturing investor interest with its GameFi innovations and blockchain-powered security. With almost $11 million raised in presale funding and a rapidly expanding user base, Rollblock’s potential to disrupt the market is undeniable. As ADA’s price outlook strengthens, RBLK’s explosive momentum could make it the surprise breakout of 2025. Rollblock (RBLK) Nears $11M Presale as GameFi Revolution Gains Momentum Rollblock has attracted over 50,000 investors in just a few months, cementing its position as a GameFi leader. With its RBLK token presale approaching $11 million, the platform is rapidly gaining traction. The platform delivers the thrill of a Vegas-style gaming experience while its blockchain-powered transparency and security set it apart from traditional gaming platforms. With over 7,000 games, including poker, Monopoly, and a live sports prediction league, every wager is securely recorded on Ethereum, ensuring fair play and accountability. As demand surges, Rollblock is proving to be a game-changer in the GameFi space , offering investors massive upside potential. The platform’s growth has been explosive, fueled by its prestigious Anjouan Gaming license and a comprehensive SolidProof smart contract audit. Its integration of Web3 gaming with real-world fiat payments through Apple Pay, Google Pay, Visa, and Mastercard has further expanded its user base, making Rollblock a dominant force in GameFi. Rollblock’s deflationary revenue-sharing model reinvests up to 30% of the platform’s revenue into buying back RBLK tokens, with 60% burned to reduce supply and 40% allocated to staking rewards of up to 30% APY. This setup minimizes selling pressure while offering some of the best passive income opportunities in crypto. With Stage 10 tokens selling fast already 43% sold at $0.061 per RBLK, Rollblock is poised for massive gains as it scales throughout 2025. The current 30% referral bonus in March further adds to the thrill, offering new and existing users even more rewards. ADA Price Surges 35% After U.S. Crypto Reserve Announcement Cardano (ADA) has stunned the market with a massive 35% surge, briefly surpassing $1.12 following the announcement of its inclusion in the U.S. strategic crypto reserve. Currently sitting at $0.87 , Cardano has increased by 44% in value in the past week , though it remains below its all-time high of $3.10 from September 2021. Cardano’s whale activity has also intensified, with Santiment data showing 2,671 unique transactions over $100,000, marking a three-month high. Technical analysis suggests ADA is poised for further growth. Some experts predict a 7x rally from current levels , potentially pushing the price well beyond its all-time high. With bullish momentum building, traders are eyeing Cardano as a top performer in the 2025 bull cycle. Meanwhile, speculation is mounting over a groundbreaking stablecoin project involving Cardano (ADA) and Hedera (HBAR) . Insider sources hint that this next-generation stablecoin will feature auto-generated yield and self-rebalancing mechanisms, potentially reshaping the DeFi sector. If confirmed, this collaboration could significantly enhance Cardano’s utility, drive wider adoption, and position both ADA and HBAR as key players in the decentralized finance sector. Investors are closely watching for further details on this potential game-changer. Rollblock (RBLK) Gains Investor Confidence as Cardano Struggles As Cardano (ADA) deals with market volatility, Rollblock (RBLK) is proving to be a stronger investment option.

However, optimism remains as US banks gain regulatory approval for cryptocurrency services. This approval could stabilize the market and fuel potential recovery. Amid these developments, four crypto tokens stand out as strategic assets to hold for possible gains. Crypto Tokens to Hold as US Banks Gain Approval for Crypto The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has allowed U.S. banks to provide cryptocurrency services under strict regulations. This includes asset custody, stablecoin transactions, and blockchain participation. This move integrates digital assets into traditional banking. Among the crypto to watch are XRP, PI, SOL, and SUI. Ripple (XRP) Ripple price has been moving sideways, mirroring the broader crypto market trend. Despite market corrections, XRP remains up 10%, positioning it as a crypto token to hold. Currently, XRP trades at $2.31 after an 8% decline. Crypto analyst Ali noted that XRP is consolidating in a symmetrical triangle. A breakout could trigger a 23% price surge, adding momentum to the market as U.S. banks gain regulatory approval for cryptocurrency services. Solana (SOL) Solana price remains above the $120 support level despite a prolonged sideways trend. The cryptocurrency is struggling to recover, but it is still up over the past year. At the time of writing, SOL is trading at $137.87, reflecting a 3.55% increase in the last 24 hours. A crypto analyst highlighted that Solana remains in consolidation within a right-angled ascending broadening pattern. This formation suggests a possible major price movement ahead. With speculation around a SOL ETF, Solana remains a crypto to watch. Pi Network (PI) Pi Network (PI) has gained attention following its mainnet launch, yet its Binance listing remains uncertain despite strong community support.** Binance has introduced a new “Vote to List” and “Vote to Delist” system, allowing users to influence which cryptocurrencies get listed or removed. However, despite widespread support, Pi Network price has yet to secure a confirmed listing on Binance. Pi Network (PI) is currently trading at $1.79, experiencing a minor market correction. Binance has not moved forward with listing the token, given its popularity among voters. Meanwhile, regulatory developments in the U.S. have allowed banks to engage with cryptocurrency services, potentially affecting market trends. The token remains among the crypto tokens to hold, as market participants anticipate potential exchange listings that could influence its future value. Sui (SUI) Sui (SUI) remains in a downtrend, forming lower highs and lower lows despite recent market movements. A price retest occurred before declining further. The cryptocurrency is down 4%, trading at $2.98. However, SUI has gained 50% over the past year, making it a crypto to watch. Analysts observe potential recovery signs as the broader crypto market strengthens. Meanwhile, U.S. banks gaining regulatory approval for cryptocurrency services adds momentum to the sector, influencing investor sentiment toward digital assets. Final Thoughts As the crypto market eyes recovery, regulatory approvals for banks could create new opportunities. Investors seeking growth may consider the above crypto tokens to hold with market potential.

41330799,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=385886,1741441537,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/41330799.jpeg,5 Expert Guidelines on Ripple (XRP) Prices in 2025,https://cryptopotato.com/5-expert-guidelines-on-ripple-xrp-prices-in-2025/,"Last month, an article that appeared on Nasdaq News & Insights posed the question: “Should you buy XRP while it trades under $3?” That article , written by an individual investor who focuses on high-growth stocks, concluded that “risk-tolerant investors with a long time horizon should consider buying a small position in cryptocurrency.” Whether or not an investor should make any investment includes factors like their own investing strategy, relevant timeframes, and other considerations. But as far as XRP’s market price goes, here are five timely guidelines for assessing its prospects in 2025. 1. SEC Ripple Lawsuit Fizzles The SEC lawsuit against Ripple Labs has been looming over the market since Dec. 2020. Big crypto hedge funder and former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci spoke with Scott Melker on the Wolf of All Streets Podcast in an interview released on Sunday (3/2). Scaramucci said now that fmr. SEC Chair Gary Gensler is gone, and Mark Uyeda is at the helm of the US regulator; the years-long legal battle in the US District Court SDNY is over. The SEC, meanwhile, just dropped its Kraken lawsuit, the crypto exchange announced on Tuesday (3/4), so it’s looking good for Ripple on this front. Massachusetts attorney and Ripple amicus brief lawyer John Deaton said in an interview that aired on Fox Business on Monday (3/3) regarding the SEC lawsuit over XRP tokens: “Trump has to drop it.” “Here’s a thought,” Deaton said. “How about Ripple pays that $125 million fine that Judge Torres issued and start that crypto reserve with XRP?” 2. XRP Supply Schedule A key long-term fundamental guideline for XRP’s price is the impact of its supply economics on market valuations for this top five cryptocurrency. Valued commodities with a limited supply command higher prices as every consumer and business knows. Prices surge when there are supply shortages in the market for household staple or business expense line item. XRP has a supply limit of 100 billion tokens that were all generated and serialized on its automated public ledger at the time Ripple launched the decentralized finance currency in 2012. That puts it, along with Bitcoin, in a class of Internet currencies with network properties that analysts compare to “digital gold,” long-term price support driven in large measure by their scarcity. Crypto news outlets widely circulated a report out this week by a popular anonymous crypto scam sleuth who goes by ZachXBT online. It highlighted that Ripple had transferred $109 million worth of XRP to a crypto exchange in January. But this is actually normal for XRP. Ripple has periodically released new supplies of the decentralized currency to exchanges for years to meet demand. No alarm for markets here. Ripple’s roadmap targets May 2027 to release the last tranche of tokens to circulate via crypto exchanges. 3. Ripple IPO, A Possibility Meanwhile, buzz over a possible Ripple IPO in the United States is building. With the end of the SEC lawsuit near and the new crypto-friendly White House and Congress in place, Ripple may reconsider taking its shares public in the US on the NASDAQ. Company CEO Brad Garlinghouse has previously stated that the San Francisco-based company would be looking overseas for an IPO. The firm weighed its options and thought that might be better than trading under a hostile SEC. However, more recently, the buzz around a potential US IPO for the parent company of XRP tokens has grown again. I have a Theory about the SEC’s unexplained delay in dismissing the @Ripple case. It might not be the SEC. It could be that @Ripple is negotiating hard to get the SEC to agree to vacate some or all of Judge Torres’ decision. The Torres decision was unquestionably GREAT for… — MetaLawMan (@MetaLawMan) March 1, 2025 Financial services attorney James Murphy shared a theory on Saturday (3/1) about the SEC lawsuit. The lawyer, who goes by MetaLawMan on X, suggested it is actually Ripple Labs holding up the suit from being dropped. Ripple might be driving a hard bargain for a settlement that would sit prettier with investors for an IPO, Murphy explained. 4. XRP Global Growth Today, we are partnering with BDACS to expand institutional crypto custody in South Korea: https://t.co/DhgeumFCn8 @BDACSKorea will use Ripple Custody to provide secure infrastructure for XRP, RLUSD, and other crypto assets—supporting institutional adoption, XRPL developer… — Ripple (@Ripple) February 27, 2025 Ripple’s expertly managed and aggressive expansion overseas has seen the San Francisco tech giant collaborate with foreign central banks and regulators on multiple projects. Last year, Ripple made strides in the APAC region with Infinite Block in Korea. Moreover, Ripple scored another partnership in Korea with BDACS, announced last week on Wednesday, Feb. 26. BDACS is a leading institutional custody platform for digital assets. 5. 1 Billion XRP Whale Surge Whales bought nearly 1 billion $XRP in the last 24 hours! pic.twitter.com/5KTdhjb0jg — Ali (@ali_charts) March 3, 2025 As a result of the factors listed above, among others, XRP whale activity has remained strong in support of prices in Q1 2025. Blockchain watchers spotted XRP whale buyers purchasing a total 1 billion XRP in under 24 hours on Monday, Mar. 3. That’s according to data from blockchain insights company Santiment. Ali Martinez, a popular crypto chart analyst on X, passed along the Santiment data on Monday. Last month, Martinez reported that whales bought 150 million XRP in under 48 hours ending on Feb. 19. At the time, he forecasted a potential move toward $2.68 for XRP. Bonus: XRP in US Crypto Reserve? President Trump splashed the waters last weekend when he named XRP, alongside SOL, ADA, ETH, and BTC, to be included in a potential US strategic crypto reserve. Such an inclusion had a dramatic and immediate effect on Ripple’s price, which skyrocketed by double-digits to $3. Trump indeed signed an executive order on Thursday but failed to mention any digital asset aside from bitcoin. Nevertheless, the implementation of such a crypto reserve remains a distant plan for now, so XRP’s inclusion remains a possibility. Because of that, we will leave this under a ‘bonus’ section, but if it is a part of a US-based reserve, it would lead to significant consequences for the asset’s price.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $4.66 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $14.78. Tezos started out really strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Following the November 5 U.S. elections and the emergence of ex-president Donald Trump, crypto markets have responded positively, with Bitcoin prices moving above the $100k mark. Tezos also responded similarly, hitting a high of $1.85. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.752 Market cap $771,545,791.42 Trading volume $25,463,523.4 Circulating supply 1,033,627,469.07 XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour low $0.738 24-hour high $0.791 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 6.86% 50-day SMA $0.9492 14-Day RSI 39.52 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 28 (Fear) Green days 14/30 (47%) 200-day SMA $0.9675 Tezos price analysis: XTZ sees rejection at the $0.799 resistance level TL; DR Breakdown XTZ has lost 4.04% in the last 24 hours. The coin’s support is at $0.737, and resistance is around $0.797. Tezos faced rejection at $0.799. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart: XTZ to surge past its 20-day SMA soon? The daily price analysis of the Tezos (XTZ) coin on March 8 shows a downtrend in the last trading hours. XTZ’s value is currently around $0.74, having faced rejection at $0.799. XTZ to surge past its 20-day SMA soon? The MACD indicator, on the other hand, shows a bullish crossover, indicating a possible market resurgence. The RSI (36.36) reflects a market approaching oversold conditions, suggesting buying opportunities at a discount. If buyers reenter the market, XTZ could surge past its 20-day SMA at $0.807. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart: XTZ is trading close to support at $0.737 The 4-hour chart indicates possible oversold conditions for XTZ, with the price near the lower Bollinger Band, with support around $0.737. The Bollinger Bands are tightening, suggesting reduced potential volatility in the short term and possible price consolidation. XTZ is trading close to support at $0.737 The CMF indicator at zero shows a neutral market, supporting the chances of XTZ consolidating. Meanwhile, the MFI also suggests oversold conditions, indicating ongoing cash outflow and possible trend reversal. If buyers push XTZ above $0.767, it might move toward resistance at $0.797. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.9493 SELL SMA 5 $0.8697 SELL SMA 10 $0.8508 SELL SMA 21 $0.8519 SELL SMA 50 $0.9492 SELL SMA 100 $1.1746 SELL SMA 200 $0.9675 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.8536 SELL EMA 5 $0.9282 SELL EMA 10 $1.0557 SELL EMA 21 $1.1837 SELL EMA 50 $1.2358 SELL EMA 100 $1.1413 SELL EMA 200 $1.0253 SELL What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? Tezos (XTZ) is in a downtrend, trading below $0.807. It’s near $0.737 support on the 4H chart, with oversold signals hinting at a bounce. A move above $0.767-$0.797 could push it to $0.807, but losing $0.737 may drop it to $0.700. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs – so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your own research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Why is Tezos down? Tezos (XTZ) is down today after facing rejection at the $0.799 resistance level, a move spurred by selloffs. The coin is now trading at around $0.74. XTZ price history Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications.

Tezos historic price sentiment Tezos price history ⏐ Source: Coinmarketcap Tezos mainnet went live in September 2018 and immediately gained popularity for dealing with the environmental impact of blockchain technologies at that time with its PoS model. XTZ’s price peaked during the bullish cycle of 2021, reaching above $9.0. After 4 April 2022, XTZ’s price plummeted below $4.0; by 9 May, it had sharply fallen below the $2 mark. XTZ surged to about $1 at the beginning of December 2022, but the bears reclaimed the market by the end of the month, resulting in a drop to $0.73. The coin made some recovery in 2023, averaging a market price of $0.8. Despite the partnership milestones achieved, Tezos (XTZ) had a largely bearish 2024. The coin reached a high of $1.4 in April but lost about 60% by August. The bulls soon entered the market, and XTZ saw renewed buyer interest, which resulted in a peak price of $0.7015 in September and $1.856 in November. The surge extended into December—Tezos XTZ recorded a maximum price of $1.909. Price corrections followed thereafter, and the coin closed the year at $1.286. In January 2025, XTZ reached a maximum price of $1.49, but in February, it lost momentum, averaging $0.72 per unit. After a failed attempt at breaking above $0.8 in early March, XTZ is currently trading around $0.74 – $0.78.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,TRADING|XTZ|BUSINESS|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|FORKS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-08 13:46:18

While other agencies like the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) rolled back in 2020 guidance, agencies like the FDIC have been reluctant on this matter. Coinbase CLO Blames FDIC for Refusal on Transparency In a message on the X platform, Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal lashed out at the FDIC for its refusal to cooperate and resist basic transparency efforts towards unwinding of the Operation Choke Point 2.0. This operation major led to the debanking of crypto companies with the goal of leaving them dry of liquidity. Speaking on it, Grewal wrote: “They haven’t gotten the message. Despite a huge week for crypto across the rest of the federal government, on this late Friday night over at FDIC staff still continue to resist basic transparency into Operation Chokepoint 2.0”. The crypto exchange asked the regulatory agency on how they conducted the “due diligence” to ensure no documentation related to the event was destroyed. However, according to Grewal, the agency has “repeatedly refused” to provide this information. He also stated that FDIC has been withholding key information related to its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) practices, and has only provided “snippets from a few documents” that appear unrelated to the specific FOIA policies or practices challenged in the amended complaint filed by History Associates. “What exactly are they hiding?” Grewal questioned FDIC , highlighting concerns over the agency’s transparency in handling FOIA requests. Developments in Operation Choke Point 2.0 Elimination Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terret stated that the recent White House Crypto Summit highlights major regulatory changes that would be coming to the crypto industry. During his remarks at the event, President Donald Trump referenced the rollback of Biden-era banking regulations, which critics say facilitated “Operation Chokepoint 2.0”. While the FDIC is not cooperating on the matter, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is reversing 2020 guidance that restricted banks from engaging with and providing custody services for cryptocurrencies. “This rollback is a major signal the industry and banks have been waiting for,” Terret stated. She added that it could pave the way for financial institutions to begin actively participating in the digital assets space.

Table of Contents Qubetics unveils dVPN: A major leap in decentralized privacy XRP surges to $3 after Trump’s crypto reserve announcement Solana’s rally and decline: Can SOL reclaim $180? Final thoughts The cryptocurrency market has once again seen major movements, with Qubetics unveiling its decentralized VPN (dVPN) service, XRP spiking after Trump’s announcement of a US crypto reserve, and Solana experiencing similar volatility. Investors seeking the crypto presale to buy are closely watching these developments to determine the next big opportunities. Qubetics’ dVPN could change online anonymity, offering a real-world utility that differentiates it from traditional crypto projects. Meanwhile, XRP surged to $3 before retracing, and Solana briefly reclaimed $180 before facing resistance. Investors are now watching closely to see which of these assets will lead the next wave of growth in the crypto market. You might also like: Qubetics presale soars as Solana, XRP tumble: What’s the next crypto to explode? Qubetics unveils dVPN: A major leap in decentralized privacy Qubetics is making significant strides in blockchain technology with its upcoming decentralized VPN (dVPN), designed to change online security and privacy. Unlike traditional VPN services under centralized control, Qubetics’ dVPN will be fully decentralized, leveraging blockchain technology to provide a censorship-resistant, transparent, and secure network. Qubetics’ dVPN runs on a peer-to-peer network, ensuring no single entity can control or manipulate user data. This starkly contrasts centralized VPN providers that may log user activity, restrict access, or comply with government regulations that hinder privacy. Unlike traditional VPNs, Qubetics’ dVPN has no central authority, meaning it is more secure, transparent, and resistant to surveillance. Users who contribute bandwidth to the network are rewarded with TICS tokens, creating a fully incentivized system for a stronger and more sustainable ecosystem. Investors searching for the crypto presale to buy should keep a close eye on Qubetics, as integrating its dVPN adds tangible utility to its blockchain ecosystem. XRP surges to $3 after Trump’s crypto reserve announcement XRP has recently been one of the most volatile cryptocurrencies, experiencing a sharp rally following Donald Trump’s announcement of a US crypto reserve initiative. This strategic move aims to establish the US as the “crypto capital of the world,” driving investor interest in major cryptocurrencies like XRP. Before the announcement, XRP was trading below $2.50. However, the surge in retail and institutional buying quickly pushed its price to $3, before encountering resistance. Market analysts pinpointed $2.75 as a strong support level, suggesting that if bullish momentum continues, XRP could break past $3.50 in the near future. However, as the initial excitement faded, XRP retraced its gains, trading at $2.63 after an intraday increase of 4.70%. The market now watches closely for whether XRP can sustain another bullish push or if selling pressure will drive prices lower. Solana’s rally and decline: Can SOL reclaim $180? Solana followed a similar trajectory to XRP, experiencing a 24% surge in a single day after Trump’s crypto reserve announcement. The sudden surge in demand propelled SOL above the $180 mark, triggering excitement across the market. During the rally, Solana’s trading volume skyrocketed by 480%, reflecting high market participation. However, the surge was short-lived as profit-taking kicked in, causing Solana’s price to retrace to $151.45, with an intraday increase of 2.20%. Market indicators reveal that Solana’s price has now dropped below all Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) on its daily chart, signaling potential downside in the coming days. Additionally, trading volume declined by 34.5%, suggesting lower network activity. Analysts now caution that a further drop may be imminent if Solana fails to hold current levels. Final thoughts The past few days have been pivotal for the crypto market. XRP and Solana experienced major surges following Trump’s announcement, only to retrace as selling pressure took hold. Meanwhile, Qubetics’ upcoming dVPN solution could redefine internet privacy by leveraging blockchain for secure, decentralized VPN services. For investors looking at the crypto presale to buy, Qubetics stands out due to its real-world application in online privacy. Meanwhile, XRP and Solana remain key players, but their price action will depend on market sentiment and broader crypto adoption trends. As the crypto presale market heats up, the next major opportunity may lie in emerging blockchain projects that provide tangible utility, just like Qubetics’ unique dVPN service.

Historical Data Suggests Another 718% Price Surge,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/will-xrp-hit-27-historical-data-suggests-another-718-price-surge/,"The XRP market has experienced some significant bullish action in the past week with prices rising by 7.05%. Amidst this surge, popular market analyst Egrag Crypto has provided an interesting bullish prediction highlighting two potential price targets for the altcoin. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Crashes 15% After Massive Profit-Taking Spike XRP Price Outlook: Analysts Eye $9.7 And $27 Breakout Targets In an X post on March 7, Egrag Crypto shared an audacious technical analysis of the XRP price action suggesting the altcoin may be gearing up for a major price upswing following recent gains. Egrag Crypto’s positive prediction is based on XRP’s potential ability to repeat a price surge from its 2017-2018 bull cycle. While past performance does not guarantee future results, the repeating nature of market cycles has led certain analysts to believe that XRP could experience another parabolic move. Notably, in early 2018, XRP moved from a breakout range of $0.35-$0.39 to a local market peak of around $2.89. However, for XRP to show any potential in validating a repeat of this price surge, market bulls must reclaim the $3.4 price level, which represents the local peak of the current bull cycle. Using this price level as a reference point, Egrag Crypto identifies $9.7 as the first major price target for XRP, mirroring the midpoint of its 2017–2018 breakout. The analyst explains that for investors looking to take profit, it would be ideal to sell at or around this price level i.e. $8, $9, $10, rather than waiting for an exact market peak. The second, more intriguing target would happen if XRP produces an exact 718% price surge, suggesting a potential price target of approximately $27. Related Reading: SUI Rallies 10% After Securing Deal With Trump Finance Arm XRP Price Overview At the time of writing, XRP trades at $2.34 reflecting a 5.34% decline in the past 24 hours. However, its daily trading volume has increased by 8.56% and is now valued at $8.63 billion. In realizing Egrag Crypto’s bullish prediction, the altcoin must push past immediate resistance levels at $2.62 and $3.0 before a fated encounter at the $3.4 price barrier. Furthermore, there must be a significant increase in buying volume and market participation. Other potential bullish factors include a clear regulatory stance around XRP. While its addition to the US digital assets stockpile is a much-welcome development, a termination of the SEC’s appeal case against Ripple would erase all regulatory and legal concerns around XRP. Finally, a widescale bull run across the crypto market is another potential bullish driver. Notably, XRP was one of the best-performing crypto assets in the late Q4 2024 crypto rally, rising by over 460% in three weeks following the US elections.

In a post on Binance Square, CZ revived the idea of “time tokens,” which would allow influencers to tokenize their time and pay users directly for their interactions. While previous attempts at this model have struggled to gain traction, CZ believes a refined approach could offer a viable solution. CZ suggested a platform where verified influencers connect their X (formerly Twitter) or LinkedIn accounts to establish credibility. They can then set a fee, such as 1 BNB or 0.1 BNB, to receive messages from users. If influencers don’t respond within five days, 50% of the payment is returned to the sender, reducing spam and encouraging quick responses. Related News: When Will Ethereum's Ultimate Recovery and Bull Wave Come? Analytics Company Shares Most Critical Points “I would use a platform like this. I would donate the crypto I receive to charity. This would help weed out people who are genuinely trying to contact me,” CZ explained. He also suggested that serious questions could lead to long conversations, potential rewards for security tips, or even full refunds. CZ revealed that YZi Labs is considering investing in a well-developed MVP (minimum viable product) for its time tokenization platform. Emphasizing the importance of security and functionality, CZ said, “This will require a few days/weeks of coding and security review. If the platform is secure enough, I will be the first user.” *This is not investment advice.

Polkadot (DOT) is enduring a tough phase with bearish trends, while PEPE coin is showing signs of a potential 245% rally. Meanwhile, Web3Bay (3BAY) is making waves with its presale, raising $1.60M swiftly and forecasting a striking 3,633% increase in value. With DOT’s 10% weekly drop, concerns about its future persist among investors who are exploring other burgeoning opportunities. Polkadot (DOT): Navigating Tough Market Waters Polkadot continues to face headwinds, with its price at $4.66 and a 10% drop over the past week, extending a month-long decline. Known for enabling cross-chain transfers, it now grapples with stiff competition and waning network activity, struggling to surpass crucial resistance levels. Despite updates and partnerships, Polkadot hasn’t regained its momentum. Some analysts hold a positive view on its future potential, yet the immediate outlook calls for caution. Investors are encouraged to monitor Polkadot’s development closely, as its ability to rebound in a fiercely competitive market remains under scrutiny. PEPE Coin: Poised for a Potential Upsurge PEPE coin is catching the market’s eye, potentially setting the stage for a substantial rally. Priced at $0.000007502, it exhibits a falling wedge pattern, a classic sign of an impending bullish reversal that could push its value up to $0.00002830, a 245% increase. Supporting this bullish outlook are favorable on-chain metrics, suggesting PEPE might be currently undervalued. However, given PEPE’s nature as a meme coin, its market behavior is highly speculative, dependent on community engagement and broader market trends. While the potential for profit is notable, the inherent risks are considerable, and investors should weigh their decisions with care. Web3Bay: Presale Triumph & Future Prospects In marked contrast to the challenges faced by DOT and the uncertain prospects of PEPE’s rally, Web3Bay has taken center stage with its remarkable presale achievements. This project has swiftly garnered $1.60M and distributed 400 million tokens. Currently, the price of Web3Bay’s token stands at $0.00524, marking a significant rise from its initial presale price of $0.003. Now in the fifth stage of its presale, the anticipated launch price is set at $0.1959. The methodically planned presale strategy of Web3Bay, aimed at progressively augmenting the token’s value, has played a crucial role in drawing investor attention. With its focus on decentralized commerce and a governance model that emphasizes transparency, the platform presents an enticing use case. As Web3Bay approaches its official rollout, the investment community is keenly observing the implementation of its roadmap and the extent of community involvement. The robust performance of its presale has established Web3Bay as a potential transformative force in the market, poised to deliver significant early returns to its participants and sustain long-term value. Insightful Market Overview The scenarios unfolding around Polkadot, PEPE coin, and Web3Bay provide a comprehensive view of the market’s varied dynamics. Polkadot remains a solid project troubled by short-term setbacks, making it a candidate for cautious long-term investment. Conversely, PEPE offers a high-risk, high-reward opportunity that could appeal to those comfortable with speculative investments. Web3Bay distinguishes itself with a successful presale and a clear, strategic vision for decentralized commerce. Its impressive fundraising and presale progression spotlight it as a significant emerging force, attractive to investors looking for promising early-stage ventures. The distinct paths of these three entities underline the diverse strategies and outcomes possible in the evolving crypto marketplace.

Bitcoin and Ethereum grab most of the attention, but low-cost altcoins are making major moves. Some of the best cryptos under $1 right now include Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE), Hedera (HBAR), and Stellar (XLM). From Cardano joining the U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve to Hedera’s collaboration with SWIFT, these projects are building strong foundations for future growth. A New Layer-2 for Bitcoin Alongside these well-known names, StratoVM ($SVM) might be able to disrupt things. As a Layer-2 solution for Bitcoin, it could bring a whole new use case for Bitcoin. Let’s check out the details. StratoVM ($SVM): The Game-Changing Layer-2 That Could Bring Speed, DeFi, and Innovation to Bitcoin Bitcoin is the world’s most secure and decentralized blockchain, but it has struggled to keep up with newer networks when it comes to DeFi, smart contracts, and AI-driven applications. That’s where StratoVM ($SVM) may come in—a Layer-2 solution designed to expand Bitcoin’s functionality and tap into new possibilities. Unlike Ethereum, which dominates the DeFi and dApp space, Bitcoin has remained primarily a store of value. StratoVM could change that by enabling faster transactions, decentralized finance (DeFi), and AI-powered applications, which could make Bitcoin more competitive. Interest in StratoVM is increasing. Over the past week, SVM’s price skyrocketed 347% to $0.1637, yet its market cap is still at $2.9 million—far smaller than rivals like CoreDAO, which is valued at $990 million. This points to significant growth potential if adoption picks up. SVM 7-day chart, Source: CoinGecko Bitcoin’s DeFi sector (BTCFi) is also booming, with the total value locked (TVL) in Bitcoin-based DeFi projects jumping from $307 million to $5.85 billion in a year. As demand for scalable Bitcoin solutions grows, StratoVM could be in the perfect position to benefit. With an active testnet supporting 113,000 wallets and 56,000 daily transactions, plus a recent Uniswap listing, there’s more and more speculation about a potential centralized exchange (CEX) listing. If adoption continues, StratoVM could play a key role in Bitcoin’s evolution. Cardano (ADA): A Scalable and Eco-Friendly Blockchain In a surprising move, former U.S. President Donald Trump announced on March 2, 2025, that Cardano would be part of the U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve. This decision is meant to strengthen the country’s position as a global crypto leader, which has led to a massive surge in ADA’s trading volume and increased attention from investors. On the tech side, Cardano continues to grow steadily. As of February 2025, nearly 2,000 projects are building on its network, and it has processed over 106 million transactions. Developers have optimized Cardano’s consensus system, cutting CPU usage by 9%, while updates to its Lace wallet and Plutus smart contract platform are improving usability and efficiency. Slightly below $1, Cardano (ADA) is trading at around $0.9884, up 52.9% in the last 24 hours. Svetoslav says that despite the recent bullish news, Cardano is approaching strong resistance levels at $1 and $1.15, which makes a price pullback likely. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Leading Meme Coin with Strong Community Backing and High Growth Potential Grayscale Investments recently launched the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust to allow accredited investors to gain direct exposure to DOGE—another sign that institutions are taking meme coins more seriously. On the technical side, analysts note that Dogecoin has broken out of an inverse Head & Shoulders pattern, which could mean bullish momentum ahead. Meanwhile, the SEC clarified that meme coins like DOGE are considered collectibles, not securities, which eased some regulatory concerns. There’s also more interest in meme coin ETFs, though some worry about their speculative nature. Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.2187, up 8.3% in the last 24 hours. The price has ranged between $0.2019 and $0.2415, with trading volumes hitting $4.4 billion. Cas Abbé says that Dogecoin is forming a bullish rounding bottom pattern, with a potential dip to $0.19-$0.20 before a major rally as the weekly RSI nears support. Hedera (HBAR): The Scalable Blockchain for Enterprise-Grade Innovation SWIFT, the global financial messaging giant, is testing Hedera’s technology to improve instant banking across North America, Europe, and Asia. If successful, this could enhance cross-border payments in a $150 trillion market. Meanwhile, Hedera has fully open-sourced its code and donated it to the Linux Foundation’s Hiero project, which reinforced its commitment to decentralization and transparency. On the adoption front, the Hashgraph Association has teamed up with Taurus to expand secure custody, staking, and tokenization for HBAR. As of today, March 3, 2025, HBAR is trading at $0.2517, up 2.2% in the last 24 hours. The trading volume has reached $1.246 billion Cas Abbé believes HBAR is gaining bullish momentum, with an RSI breakout and a MACD cross signaling a shift in sentiment. He expects a rise to $0.33, a slight pullback, and then a push toward a new all-time high. Stellar (XLM): The Fast and Low-Cost Blockchain Transforming Cross-Border Payments Stellar (XLM) has been making big moves in expanding its blockchain ecosystem. The Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) partnered with OpenZeppelin to boost security and innovation in smart contract development. Meanwhile, Etherfuse introduced Stablebonds on Stellar, a new initiative meant to bring tokenized real-world assets into the $140 trillion global bond market. Stellar is also pushing for financial inclusion—SDF teamed up with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to explore blockchain-based solutions for underserved communities in emerging markets. Stellar (XLM) is now trading at $0.3238, up 3.7% in the last 24 hours. Trading volume has hit $969 million. Rose Premium Signals believes Stellar is at a key breakout point, and if it holds above $0.30-$0.35, it could climb toward $0.64 and beyond. The Verdict Cardano, Dogecoin, Hedera, and Stellar are some of the best under $1 cryptos to watch, each with unique strengths—from institutional backing to major enterprise partnerships. These factors could help them break out in the 2025 bull run. But StratoVM ($SVM) might stand apart. It could tackle Bitcoin’s biggest limitations while benefiting from its security and global recognition. As Bitcoin’s DeFi sector grows, StratoVM may gain traction as a Layer-2 solution that could bring faster transactions, smart contracts, and AI applications to the network.

41333220,https://coingape.com/?post_type=trending&p=243048,1741446114,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Why is Ethena Token Price Up 20% Today & Will It Sustain?,https://coingape.com/trending/why-is-ethena-token-price-up-20-today-will-it-sustain/,"Amid the crypto market downturn, the Ethena Token (ENA) is witnessing a significant price rally, surging 20% from yesterday’s dip. The price spike, especially in the turbulent market, has caught everyone’s attention. In this blog, let us discuss why this surged and whether it is sustainable. Why is the Ethena Token Price Surging Today? With Donald Trump’s Crypto Summit closure, investor interest sparked a minor recovery in the market. Along with Bitcoin, the Ethena token price surged, but there’s more to this altcoin’s price rally. Beginning with the increased trading volume, where it has surged 23% in the last 24 hours. Currently, at $645.63M, it indicates an influx of buying activity while signaling strong investor interest. Interestingly, just a day before, 2.07B ENA (39.17% of the total supply) was released in the market. This led to a massive downtrend, as the token unlocks built selling pressure on the token. Getting back to the topic, the Coinglass Data reveals that Open Interest has surged to $42.33M. It indicates traders are becoming more active and opening more positions in the ENA futures contacts, advancing the price rally. Even the long/short ratio on Binance reveals that investors are more interested in long, which means they are betting for a price surge. Such action can bring upward momentum and influence investor sentiments. Will Ethena (ENA) Sustain This Rally? Many technical factors have favored the ongoing price rally, and a few will likely continue to push the token higher. It includes the liquidation data, which hints at the uptrend formation. In the last 24 hours, $3.33M shorts were liquidated. Buying pressure is created as the short sellers rush to buy back the token. Hence, a price surge is expected. It currently trades at $0.45 with a market capitalization of $1.45B, so an uptrend can push it toward its ATH. In addition, crypto analyst Rose reveals that the ENA is retesting a major support at $0.2049. As long as ENA holds this support, an uptrend will likely form, as the analyst believes this level acted as a strong demand zone earlier. Moreover, the Ethena token price chart may form a double bottom pattern, indicating that a bullish uptrend will begin. With that, the key support zone lies at $0.2049 (the potential reversal zone), and the key resistance stands at $0.50, $0.75, and $1.00. A successful move past these would result in the $0.75, $1.00, and $1.50 price targets per Ethena price prediction. Final Thoughts Ethena token’s strong 20% price recovery reveals its position in the market. Despite the drop, the investors’ trading activity remained high, showcasing strong investor interest. The positive investor sentiments, bullish derivatives data, and short liquidation are the prime reasons behind this recovery. Interestingly, the uptrend will continue if the trend reversal happens at $0.2049 and tokens move towards the key resistances at $0.50, $0.75, and $1.00. With this, the ENA price can achieve new highs, especially if the Bitcoin price recovers.

Powell reaffirmed the Fed’s openness to leaving interest rates unchanged, stating, “We do not have to be in a hurry, and are well placed to wait for more clarity.” He added that the Fed will continue to monitor economic data before it makes any adjustment to policy. Labor Market Resilience Powell pointed to the strength of the U.S. labor market, with employers adding 151,000 jobs in February and an average of 191,000 a month since September. The unemployment rate edged up to 4.1% but remained in a range of 3.9% to 4.2% over the past year. He also noted that wages growth has slowed, balancing demand and supply for labor and mitigating inflationary pressures. “With wages growth slowing, the labor market is not a big source of inflationary pressure,” said Powell. Inflation Trends and Monetary Policy Powell acknowledged the decline in inflation from above 7% in mid-2022 to 2.5% in January. But he also warned that recent data remains somewhat above the Fed’s 2% target. “The path to sustainably getting inflation back to our objective has been uneven, and we expect that will be the case,” he said, reiterating the Fed’s strategy of not overreacting to short-term volatility. Trade Policies and Economic Outlook The Federal Reserve Chairman also addressed recent trade policies, namely import tariffs affecting trade relations with Mexico, Canada, and China. He noted that the changes have contributed to market volatility and complicated economic projections. Powell reiterated that the Fed would keep its primary interest rate steady in the coming months. The central bank had already lowered the benchmark rate by 100 basis points in late 2024, keeping it in the 4.25% to 4.5% range. Crypto Market Reaction The crypto market reacted with cautious optimism to Powell’s remarks. Investors appeared to be comforted by the Fed’s patience, even as they feared potential stagflation and the repercussions of former President Trump’s crypto summit. Powell’s remarks underscore the Fed’s commitment to stability, balancing inflation control with economic growth, as financial markets grapple for certainty.",Blockchain|Regulation|Web3,EN,0,0,MARKET|FIAT|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|ASIA,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-03-08 15:02:00

SBF has been incarcerated at Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center since August 2023. NEW: SBF now in solitary confinement after giving unauthorized Tucker Carlson interview. Since the illicit interview aired, the odds of an SBF pardon have nearly doubled. 👀 https://t.co/LDzKAFH5cG — Polymarket (@Polymarket) March 8, 2025 The Bureau of Prisons has strict rules about who can talk to prisoners and how they can do it. A representative for the US Bureau of Prisons said , “This particular interview was not approved.” The interview with Tucker Carlson Before his 33rd birthday, SBF did yet another interview from jail. This comes after SBF was given a 25-year prison term in 2024 for misusing customers’ funds tied to FTX and its sister company – Alameda Research. FTX filed for bankruptcy in November 2022. When the exchange went down because of cash flow problems, Bankman-Fried and four other officials were charged with crimes in the US. Three people were sent to prison: SBF, Caroline Ellison, who used to be CEO of Alameda Research, and Ryan Salame, who used to be co-CEO of FTX Digital Markets. Bankman-Fried told Carlson , “I don’t think I was a criminal.” He also said that he thought Salame had been charged with “totally bogus crimes,” possibly because he was a Republican. SBF also talked about his time in jail and what he thinks about regulating crypto in the US. Bankman-Fried told Carlson that he was cautiously optimistic about Trump’s ability to change the crypto industry. Carlson did not ask the former CEO of FTX exactly if he thought he would get a pardon from US President Donald Trump. However, SBF seemed to agree with some Republican ideas during the interview. In fact he said, “I had as a good relationship, probably better, with Republicans in DC as with Democrats by that point in time, although that wasn’t what the public thought.” Since 2024, SBF has only given one other interview, to the conservative New York Sun. This suggests that they are trying to get along with Trump and the majority of politicians. SBF said that he “didn’t want to do something inappropriate” when he asked US politicians to help him in 2022, even though he was facing criminal charges. Bankman-Fried was a well-known Democratic fundraiser who had given money to campaigns for Democrats and former US President Joe Biden. However, he said he had probably given just as much money to Republicans. SBF is in the same prison as rapper Sean “Diddy” Combs who is being held on charges of sexual assault and sex trafficking. He said that he mostly ate rice and beans and that no one from FTX had come to see him. SBF’s efforts for an appeal Bankman-Fried’s family and supporters, including his parents, law professors Joe Bankman and Barbara Fried, are apparently talking to a lawyer with ties to Trump’s 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns about getting their son a pardon. They haven’t talked to Trump directly yet, but sources say they want to use the president’s “transactional approach” to pardon to their advantage. In the interview, he indirectly suggested that Trump’s ties to Republicans in Washington might help his case. However, the call for mercy has not gained much support, and it is still unclear whether the efforts will be successful in persuading the president. Another thing is, a group of doctors filed an amicus brief in support of Sam Bankman-Fried’s appeal, saying that his neurodivergence disorders may have had a big impact on his criminal trial. The co-founder of FTX has been identified with autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Doctors say he had “serious challenges” in court. The brief, which eight neurodivergence experts signed, said that some of the decisions made during the hearing were bad for Bankman-Fried because of his condition. From the crypto predictions platform Polymarket, the odds of an SBF pardon have nearly doubled since the interview was published. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

With major exchanges backing top teams, the F1 paddock has become a showcase for the crypto’s biggest names. Podium finish or a pit lane disaster? Crypto.com, one of the biggest crypto exchanges, is one of the eleven global partners of Formula One Group. It is in an exclusive group that includes other global companies like Qatar Airways, DHL, Salesforce, Lenovo, and LVMH. Most Formula 1 teams have also received sponsorships from some of the biggest companies in the crypto industry. Gate.io, a top crypto exchange, is sponsoring Red Bull Racing for the 2025 season after it ended its partnership with Bybit. Coinbase, the biggest U.S. crypto exchange, recently inked a deal to sponsor Aston Martin. This deal was a big milestone as it was the first one to be settled fully using USD Coin ( USDC ), a popular stablecoin. You might also like: Aston Martin Aramco partners with Coinbase in USDC-paid deal OKX, another large crypto exchange, will continue its sponsorship of McLaren, the 2024 champions. It is one of the three major sponsors of the team, with the other two being Mastercard and Google. Alpine counts Binance and ApeCoin ( APE ) as official sponsors. Binance is the biggest crypto exchange with over 200 million customers, while ApeCoin is a cryptocurrency started by Yuga Labs, the creator of Bored Ape Yacht Club. Kick Sauber has two crypto sponsors: Stake and CoinPayments. Stake is a large crypto-focused casino and sports betting company, while CoinPayments is an Alchemy Pay ( ACH ) rival that offers fiat offramp solutions. Cash App, an American payment company owned by Square, is a big sponsor of Racing Bull, Red Bull’s sister team. While Cash App is not primarily a crypto company, it handles billions of crypto payments a year. MoneyGram, a top money transfer company that has integrated stablecoin payments, is the title sponsor of Haas. Kraken, the second-biggest crypto exchange in the US, is a key sponsor of the Atlassian Williams Racing team . Only Mercedes and Ferrari have no crypto sponsorships. Mercedes is still reeling from its association with FTX, the crypto exchange that collapsed in 2022. Ferrari’s last crypto sponsor was Velas, a blockchain company whose token has crashed in the past few years. Its market cap has dropped from over $1.2 billion in 2022 to $13 million today. Crypto companies are seeking to benefit from Formula 1’s popularity. Estimates are that its audience has been growing in the U.S. and other countries. The 2025 season could see an uptick in viewers as top teams like Ferrari, Red Bull, McLaren, and Mercedes compete for the last time before next year’s regulation changes. Lessons Learned? When other sports leagues embraced crypto, it ended up being a fool’s errand. Recall FTX’s Super Bowl ad campaign in 2022. It was quickly seen as a symbol of the crypto exchange’s rapid and dramatic downfall . At the time, FTX was riding high, and its ad featuring “Curb Your Enthusiasm” star Larry David humorously dismissing major historical inventions aimed to position FTX as the “next big thing.” The ad’s tagline, “Don’t miss out on the next big thing,” was meant to build trust and encourage mainstream adoption of the platform. Less than a year later, FTX filed for bankruptcy amid allegations of massive financial mismanagement, fraud, and the misappropriation of customer funds by Sam Bankman-Fried and his team. David’s skeptical character in the ad, who said “I don’t think so” to every great invention, became a meme as many wished they had also said “no” to FTX. To make matters worse, the ad ran during one of the most-watched TV events, amplifying the fallout. It became a symbol of the broader recklessness and marketing excess of the crypto boom, leading to skepticism toward crypto ads and influencing regulatory scrutiny. David, along with other celebrity promoters of FTX, even faced lawsuits from investors who felt misled. The National Basketball Association also heavily featured crypto ad campaigns, particularly during the 2021-2022 season when the cryptocurrency market was booming. Companies like Crypto.com, FTX, Coinbase, and others invested millions into partnerships, sponsorships, and ad campaigns within the league. One of the biggest moves was Crypto.com purchasing the naming rights to the iconic Staples Center in Los Angeles, renaming it the Crypto.com Arena in a $700 million deal. The deal was intended to cement crypto’s mainstream presence, but as the market crashed and scandals like FTX’s bankruptcy unfolded, the optics turned sour. The NBA also ran crypto commercials during games and the playoffs, often featuring celebrity endorsements. However, as crypto winter set in and scandals emerged, the enthusiasm for these partnerships cooled significantly. The market downturn and legal troubles of companies like FTX led to a more cautious approach, and some partnerships became liabilities. Overall, while the NBA’s embrace of crypto initially seemed like a smart move to capture a hot trend, it became part of the broader narrative of overhyped promises and market instability in the cryptocurrency sector.

The SHIB price has declined by over 10% during the past month. Meanwhile, IntelMarkets is getting attention through its AI-based trading platform which could offer the potential for a 3,200% growth. Investors are showing strong interest in the platform because its presale phases have already raised over $11 million. Each token is priced at $0.09 and would increase to $0.10 in the next stage. The unpredictable movements of the SHIB price have created uncertainties for investors while this AI utility altcoin is driving the hype. IntelMarkets: AI Utility Altcoin Driving The Hype With Its Presale IntelMarkets is one of the few utility altcoin projects that are focused on artificial intelligence technology. The presale stages of IntelMarkets have raised around $11.3 million. Its current token price is $0.09 in the 10th presale phase. The price would increase to $0.10 in the next stage. The AI-based features make IntelMarkets different from other platforms. A famous feature is the Intelli-M™ robots that learn by themselves to modify their behavior according to market conditions. These self-learning bots analyze real-time data and optimize their strategies to perform better with each trade. Source: IntelMarkets IntelMarkets also offers dual-chain functionality, which operates between Ethereum and Solana blockchains. It can allow traders to make cost-effective decisions while selecting their preferred blockchain. Additionally, the autopilot trading bots analyze market opportunities through Rodeum AI™ technology. These automated robots operate with preset risk parameters to minimize the requirement for manual assistance. The 1000x leverage feature of IntelMarkets could allow traders to maximize returns on their investments. The successful presale and advanced AI features of IntelMarkets are driving the hype in the crypto industry. Could IntelMarkets (INTL) Surge 3,200% After Launch? IntelMarkets is attracting investors through its potential for expansion. If IntelMarkets reaches even 75% of Shiba Inu’s $7.95B market cap, each INTL token would be around $3. This would mean an increase of above 3,200% from the current presale price. The platform's constant updates and developments make it more appealing to investors. IntelMarkets recently performed many stress tests to verify that the platform could maintain speed and security while working at peak transaction volumes. Through its strategic partnerships with major European banks, IntelMarkets could make sure that users have instant access to depositing fiat money. SEPA integration with BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, Santander, and ING would allow live account funding that could improve access and adoption of the platform. The new developments in the platform will improve IntelMarkets’ reputation as a secure and efficient platform compared to other platforms like Shiba Inu. This could allow it to experience a growth above 3,200% after launch. Shiba Inu Faces Growing Market Pressure Shiba Inu (SHIB) was considered an example of a successful meme coin, but the SHIB price has declined in recent weeks. The 2024 price jump of meme coins reached a 500% increase. Yet the SHIB price entered a downward trend in 2025, with a decline of above 10% in a month. After Trump announced his crypto reserve on March 3rd, the Shiba Inu token showed brief price gains that surpassed $0.0000150. However, the SHIB price is again trading below $0.0000140 now. Source: CoinMarketCap Recently, the Shiba Inu burn rate jumped by 5,440%, which resulted in the removal of millions of tokens from circulation. The token’s scarcity might increase through reduced supply, but investors are not very hopeful about the SHIB price growth. The daily trading volume of $111 million is failing to elevate the investors’ concerns about Shiba Inu’s future. The declining SHIB price creates a prime entry point for investors to explore IntelMarkets. Its strong partnerships and projected 3,200% growth potential are attracting attention from big investors. Conclusion The SHIB price is facing challenges, but IntelMarkets' AI-based platform is growing quickly. The platform's advanced trading features, strong presale performance, and continuous developments could allow it to surge 3,200%. This could be the chance for Investors to buy the INTL tokens at $0.09 before the price increases in the next stage.

With over $15.8 million raised in presale, strong fundamentals and a 2x gain expected post-launch, DTX is already proving to be an altcoin worth exploring. As it gears up for listing, those who get in early could be looking at a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The clock is ticking, and this could be the final chance to get in before a potential massive surge! Let’s explore the potential. DTX Exchange: The Hybrid Trading Token with 32,000% Upside DTX Exchange is making waves in the crypto world with strong fundamentals and rising investor confidence. In its presale, it has already raised over $15.8 million, signaling massive interest. The token, currently priced at $0.18, is expected to surge post-launch, with early investors eyeing 2x gains when it reaches $0.36. What makes DTX Exchange stand out is its all-in-one trading ecosystem. It promises to provide users with the option to trade cryptocurrencies, forex, tokenized stocks, and ETFs in one place. These features aim to make diversification easy. Fractional trading lets investors buy into high-value assets with minimal capital. With high-leverage options of up to 1000x, traders would be able to maximize profits with smaller investments. The platform also supports cross-chain compatibility which allows seamless trading across different blockchains. Lastly, automated portfolio management aims to help users grow their investments effortlessly. DTX Exchange is designed to make trading simple, secure, and highly profitable. It is set for major gains upon listing. The total token supply of DTX is 475M. At the token price of $0.36 after listing, if DTX hits even 25% of ETH’s market cap, the new token price would be $131, which means almost 32,000% projected gains. If DTX keeps on attracting institutional interest and making good on the innovative features, investors and crypto traders could get the 32,000% upside upon investment. Can Ethereum Price See Another Major Rally? At the time of writing, Ethereum price is at $2,065 and it is down by almost 30% since last month. It has seen big growth before like in 2017 when the Ethereum price jumped from $8 to $750. Its shift to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) made it more energy-efficient and about 27% of all ETH is now staked which shows strong support from investors. Experts believe the Ethereum price could rise to $6,000 or even $15,000 by March 2025, especially with ETF approvals and network upgrades. But competition is growing fast, with platforms like DTX Exchange offering quicker solutions and AI making blockchain even more advanced. ETH ETFs: The Institutional Catalyst ETH ETFs have seen a strong 13-day inflow streak and accumulating nearly $2 billion in net inflows. Bitcoin’s ETF success displays that traditional investors are eager for crypto exposure and Ethereum price could follow a similar path. If ETH ETF-driven demand aligns with strong network growth, Ethereum price could experience a significant rally. While it may not mirror past gains, ETH ETF approval could be a powerful driver of upward momentum. Meanwhile, DTX Exchange presents an alternative for investors seeking real-world utility and stability. Those who missed Ethereum’s previous surges and are now waiting for ETH ETF approval might find DTX Exchange a promising option in the crypto market. Final Thoughts Ethereum price remains an enigma due to the ETH ETF approval in sight. Ethereum investors turn towards this hybrid trading token. It has the potential for 32,000% gains upon listing which is turning heads across the crypto market. DTX’s strong fundamentals, multi-asset trading, and high-leverage options make it a game-changer in the market. With a token price of $0.36 upon listing, early investors would be able to get 2x gains post-launch. This is your final chance to get in before DTX Exchange takes off.

41334235,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=689470,1741447505,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41334235.jpeg,FDIC resists transparency on crypto’s Operation Chokepoint 2.0 — Coinbase CLO,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/fdic-transparency-on-operation-chokepoint-2/,"The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is not transparent regarding its role in Operation Chokepoint 2.0, a period when crypto and tech firms were allegedly denied banking services under the Biden administration, according to Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal. In a March 8 X thread , Grewal called out the agency for repeatedly refusing to provide details about how it ensured that no documents related to the crackdown were destroyed. “ One of our requests concerns FDIC’s representation in a hearing before the Court that the agency had conducted ‘due diligence’ to ensure that no documents were destroyed ,” Grewal wrote. According to Grewal, Coinbase had asked the FDIC to provide an example of the due diligence it conducted, but the agency failed to do so and took issue with the request to explain its assertion to the court. FDIC’s document redactions raise concerns Grewal went on to criticize the FDIC for redacting large portions of documents related to the agency’s handling of crypto-related banking policies. “ In response to our requests for FDIC guidance or policies on processing FOIA requests, directly relevant to our policy-or-practice claims, the agency has produced only snippets from a few documents that have little to nothing to do with the specific FOIA policies or practices that History Associates has challenged in its amended complaint. What exactly are they hiding? ” he questioned. The attorney also mentioned that 53 pages of documents were fully redacted, while many others were heavily censored to the point of being “unintelligible.” When Coinbase asked for an explanation, the FDIC reportedly refused to provide one for most of the redacted material. He shared a court filing of Coinbase’s plea to the courts to suspend a period the FDIC was given to answer to an amended complaint of unlawful FOIA practices, on February 12. *History Associates respectfully suggests that the Court should dissolve the stay in this case, order a deposition on specific issues the FDIC has refused to address, and require the agency to respond to History Associates’ amended complaint so that litigation of the claims can proceed expeditiously,” the filing stated. Concluding his thread, Grewal called on lawmakers, including Senator Tim Scott, Representative French Hill, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, and Representative Ritchie Torres, to “check” if the FDIC’s actions are any different from those of the previous administration under FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg. OCC eases banking restrictions on crypto Grewal’s comments come against the backdrop of a Washington crypto summit, where President Donald Trump vowed to end restrictions on crypto firms’ access to banking services. Speaking at the White House Crypto Summit, Trump reckoned that he was “ending Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” “ My administration also is working to end the federal bureaucracy’s war on crypto, which was really going on pretty wildly during Biden ,” Trump said. As reported by Cryptopolitan, after the White House Crypto Summit, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) updated its guidelines for financial institutions serving cryptocurrency companies. The new policy grants banks greater autonomy in assessing and mitigating risks related to crypto services, reversing prior restrictions that required regulatory pre-approval. “ The OCC expects banks to have the same strong risk management controls in place to support novel bank activities as they do for traditional ones, ” said Acting Comptroller of the Currency Rodney E. Hood in a statement. “ Today’s action will reduce the burden on banks to engage in crypto-related activities and ensure that these bank activities are treated consistently by the OCC, regardless of the underlying technology .” The updated guidance eliminates a requirement from the OCC’s previous Interpretive Letter #1179, issued in November 2021, which mandated that banks obtain pre-approval before offering crypto-related services such as custody, stablecoin payments, or distributed ledger transactions. Now, banks can independently decide how to engage with the digital asset industry without direct regulatory authorization. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The DOT token was trading at $4.35 on Saturday, down by over 90% from its highest level in 2021. This article lists three reasons why the Polkadot price may exit the three-year consolidation and go parabolic in the next few months. Polkadot price has strong technicals The first main reason why the DOT price may surge soon is that it has strong technicals, especially when you consider the weekly chart. This chart shows that the Polkadot price crash has found a strong support at $3.742. It has attempted and failed to drop below that level at least four times since 2024. All attempts to move below that level faced substantial resistance, meaning that the coin has formed a quadruple bottom whose neckline is at $11. This means that even a jump from the current $4.36 to that neckline would be by a 169% surge from the current level. Most notably, we have seen many cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Solana, and XRP surge to their all-time highs. This means that Solana price needs to jump by 1,153% from the current level. While this seems impossible, some tokens like Mantra have achieved a similar performance in the past few years. DOT price chart by TradingView Spot DOT ETF approval hopes The other potential catalyst for the Polkadot price is that 21Shares and Grayscale have filed for a spot Polkadot ETF with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). There are rising odds that the SEC, under the Trump administration, will approve these crypto ETFs. That’s because the current SEC is much different than during the Gary Gensler era. Gensler focused on litigation, while the current leadership is focusing on working with the crypto industry. For example, officials have already ended lawsuits on some of the biggest companies in crypto like Gemini, Uniswap, and OpenSea. Therefore, there is a likelihood that the SEC will approve a spot DOT ETF, which will lead to more inflows. USA crypto reserves inclusion Donald Trump has signed an executive order that will create Strategic Bitcoin Reserves (SBR). In the same executive order, he directed the Treasury Department to create a stockpile of digital assets. In a recent statement, he identified three coins that will include these stockpiles, including XRP, Solana, and Cardano. Most notably, his statement noted that he will be willing to add other valuable coins into these reserves. Polkadot fits the bill for a such fund. For one, it was established by Gavin Wood, a technology expert who was part of the founding team of Ethereum, the second-biggest crypto in the industry. Additionally, Polkadot has utility in that its ecosystem is made up of several parachains like Astar, Acala Network, Moonbeam, Efinity, and Centrifuge. Polkadot 2.0 upgrade Finally, Polkadot price may surge because of the upcoming Polkadot 2.0 upgrade that will transition it into a more accessible network. One of the biggest changes is known as the Join-Accumulate Machine (JAM), which will boost its scalability, flexibility, and decentralization. JAM will have numerous features, including decentralized supercomputing, parallel processing, and permissionless deployment. The latter one is important because it will ensure that developers can build without going through the parachain auction process that was highly expensive and time consuming. Polkadot 2.0 will also introduce the Polkadot Virtual Machine (PVM), making it easy to deploy smart contracts. Therefore, all these features mean that the Polkadot price will likely continue doing well in the long term. On top of this, it is one of the most rewarding cryptocurrencies with a staking yield of over 10%.

This new challenger entered the meme coin arena recently. With different Shiba Inu price prediction technical indicators suggesting slower growth, many investors wonder whether SHIB can still deliver explosive returns or if SHIBI, the viral panda-themed meme coin taking over the market, is the smarter play. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: Can SHIB Still Deliver Big Returns? Shiba Inu rose to fame as ""the Dogecoin killer"", backed by massive community support and the launch of its Layer 2 blockchain, Shibarium. However, despite all the hype, SHIB’s price has struggled to break key resistance levels. According to a recent CNN report , SHIB suffered a major decline due to investors dumping their tokens in favour of other better-performing meme tokens. A look at SHIB’s chart on TrandingView shows that the token has declined a whopping 65% from its ATH reached in early December 2024. Shiba Inu Price Prediction analysts aren’t even optimistic. Short-term predictions show that SHIB’s price is bound to remain within the $0.000011 and $0.000017 range in the next 3 to 6 months and would break out only if Bitcoin rallies significantly. Meanwhile, some long-term projections suggest the token’s price will reach $0.000025 by 2025, but this would only be a mere 2x return from current price points. Worse yet, there are other concerning issues that trouble investors. For instance, SHIB’s massive token supply (still in the quadrillions) continues to make significant price jumps difficult, even with token burns, which poses key risks for investors. Also, while SHIB still has a strong community, many long-time holders are frustrated by slow price movements and seek alternatives with higher upside potential. These reasons are exactly why a meme project like Panshibi is catching fire—it offers everything SHIB lacks and a chance at 50x and even 100x growth. Panshibi: The Meme Project Built for Explosive Gains Unlike Shiba Inu, which is already well-established, Panshibi is in its high-growth phase, giving early investors a chance to get in before the big surge. As seen on Binance , SHIBI, which is at its Stage 4 Presale stage, has already raised more than $1.2m in funding. While the token's best gains are likely behind it, things are already looking positive for the project, which promises to offer a massive upside before exchange listings. Also, unlike SHIB, which has a quadrillion-token supply, SHIBI has a burn mechanism, ensuring long-term price appreciation. Then there are the massive staking rewards that enable SHIBI stakers to earn up to 1,200% APY, making it a better long-term hold. Sadly, the same can’t be said for SHIB, as it doesn’t allow its holders to earn a passive income. SHIBI also ensures investor confidence with locked liquidity and team tokens, preventing rug pulls and manipulation. Last but not least, even though SHIB was the top meme coin of the last cycle, SHIBI is already positioned to take over in the next bull run, combining viral meme status with DeFi staking rewards. With investors looking for fresh opportunities, SHIBI is proving to be the better meme coin investment. How to Participate in SHIBI’s Presale With Shiba Inu price prediction showing depressing moves, SHIBI is shaping up to be the next 100x meme coin. It is selling out fast currently as early investors secure their positions before the token finally goes viral on major exchanges. Here’s everything you need to know about SHIBI’s ongoing presale: • Presale Price: $0.005• Listing Price: $0.026• Funds Raised: $1.2m+• Staking APY: Up to 1,200%• Liquidity Lock: 10 Years• Team Token Lock: 2 Years Investors can buy with their crypto coins, such as ETH and USDT, or pay with their Visa and MasterCard.

The analyst and trader pseudonymously known as Capo tells his 938,800 followers on the social media platform X that the crypto market looks primed to go up to potentially form a bull trap. A bull trap is a false signal that indicates that the bearish trend is over but then the price abruptly reverses course and witnesses a deeper drawdown. According to the pseudonymous analyst, Bitcoin, Ethereum and altcoins could rally by between 10% and 50% from current levels before a rapid price reversal. “Bitcoin to $100,000 with a quick pump, Ethereum to $3,000, altcoins 10% to 50% up – bull trap soon.” Bitcoin is trading at $89,290 at time of writing while Ethereum is worth $2,205. Capo says the bull trap would lead to Bitcoin, Ethereum and altcoins correcting by double-digit percentage points, potentially triggered by a black swan event. “30% to 60% drop (the second shakeout, possible black swan event) after the bull trap.” A black swan is a rare and unanticipated event that catalyzes a massive market meltdown. The last Black Swan that crushed the markets was the Covid-19 pandemic. Source: Capo/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that Bitcoin will first hit $100,000 only to face rejection and plummet to around $69,000. But after the massive plunge, he sees Bitcoin soaring to a new all-time high of around $116,000. The widely followed analyst also says that an “epic” altcoin season would follow the capitulation event.

Analyst Points To $2 Target,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/could-cardano-be-the-next-big-crypto-winner-analyst-points-to-2-target/,"Cardano (ADA) is once again in the limelight as a crypto analyst emphasizes a technical pattern that has the potential to propel the asset to $2. In the midst of a combination of gains and losses for ADA, the prediction has sparked speculation regarding the possibility of a significant breakout. Related Reading: Bitcoin Slides After Trump Signs Strategic Reserve Executive Order A Pattern That Could Lead To A Big Move According to crypto expert Ali Martinez, ADA has established a right-angled descending wedge pattern on the charts. This technical configuration implies that a surge may occur if Cardano surpasses $1.14. Martinez believes that the price could soar to $2 if that occurs. ADA is much below that important level right now. The altcoin dropped significantly by 5% during the past 24 hours, falling below $0.83. It has subsequently rebounded to about $0.88; but it remains uncertain if the bullish momentum will build up anytime soon.

Considering that the crypto asset has grown by nearly 30% over the past seven days, there are signs buyers are joining the market. ADA has seen a 20% year-over-year rise, indicating strong demand in the token. What Needs To Happen For ADA To Reach $2 ADA faces other difficulties as well, but first it has to overcome $1.14 to reach a notable rise to $2. Should it be able to overcome that, the currency’s next challenge will be to keep on pushing up. Strong buying demand could cause the price to increase to $2 more rapidly; but, limited volume or sellers’ resistance could create problems. Additionally important are external elements and market attitude. If the market for Bitcoin and the other bigger cryptocurrencies keeps strong, ADA has a higher chance of maintaining an upward motion. On the other hand, any market-wide drop could give Cardano more hiccups. Related Reading: Billionaire Warns Of Financial Turmoil—Will Bitcoin Save Investors?

Should ADA start moving toward $1.14, it could give fresh hope. Whether it strikes $2 or not, the following few days will be vital in deciding its next major price route.

This exchange platform has raised $15.8 million in just 100 days, positioning itself as a leading altcoin. With Solana’s price volatility casting doubt on its long-term trajectory, analysts speculate whether DTX Exchange could surpass SOL ETF gains. Offering innovative trading features and exciting presale gains, DTX is emerging as the next big crypto. Let’s take a closer look at it. SOL ETF Hype Builds, Why Is Solana Price Still Dropping? On February 21, Franklin Templeton formally filed an S-1 registration statement with the U.S. SEC to launch an SOL ETF. The suggested fund will follow changes in the Solana price, exposing investors to SOL without owning any shares. This application comes after Delaware established the Franklin Solana Trust, which was a significant step in approving the SOL ETF. With applications being submitted to the SEC by Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, Bitwise, Canary Capital, 21Shares, and VanEck, interest in an SOL ETF is growing. If the SOL ETF gets approved, Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC will manage the safe storage of Solana assets, and the Franklin SOL ETF will be listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange. Franklin Templeton's SOL ETF offers investors an extra source of income through staking incentives, which is one of its primary features. The SEC's classification of staking is still up in the air, though, and might affect the fund's approval procedure. Whereas, the Solana price has entered the red zone during the last day, dropping 14.1% to $136 while trading volume has decreased by 35% to $8.75 billion. The Solana price has failed to reclaim the $200 level it lost some weeks ago. Owing to the market volatility and regulatory uncertainty, some analysts predict the Solana price will decline to the $150–$160 zone. DTX Exchange: The DeFi Project Surpassing Expectations As the Solana price continues to be dominated by bears despite positive SOL ETF developments, analysts believe DTX Exchange (DTX) will surpass Solana. DTX is an upcoming exchange platform that is attracting investor attention by raising over $15.8 million in just 100 days and promising 2x returns upon its listing. This platform further sets itself apart from traditional exchange platforms through its revolutionary offerings. While traditional platforms only provide access to a few assets, DTX allows users to trade over 120,000 financial assets through its single unified interface. This easy accessibility would allow users to diversify their portfolios without the hassle of circling between different platforms to manage different assets. DTX Exchange 's innovative feature takes care of newbie traders. New traders often lack experience and, therefore, experience huge losses. To resolve this issue, DTX is all set to introduce its Automated Investment Manager. Through this feature, users can easily earn profits by automatically making small investments in crypto and stocks. Furthermore, DTX will launch its Copy Trading feature to facilitate new traders further. Copy Trading would let inexperienced traders to easily follow and copy the strategies of global traders to earn maximum returns. With such leading features and stellar presale performance, market experts believe DTX could potentially surpass the SOL ETF rally to become the leading altcoin of 2025. DTX Presale: The Last Chance for Massive Gains? DTX Exchange is currently in its presale phase and has shown a stellar growth trajectory throughout. This utility altcoin has raised over $15.8 million in just 100 days, making new records. The presale has entered a bonus presale round to cater to a massive surge in demand. This round is offering investors a last chance to buy DTX tokens at a discounted price of $0.18. Its listing price is set to be $0.36, giving investors a chance to 2x their capital by acting quickly. Moreover, investors can further 4x their gains by using the code “LIST2X” to get a 100% bonus on their deposits.

Some investors speculate that competition from a new Asia-backed meme coin may be diverting attention away from SHIB. With emerging projects gaining traction among the top 200 crypto tokens, traders are closely monitoring whether SHIB could lose its market share to Panshibi (SHIBI) . This article provides analytics and insights into the current shifts within the meme coin market. Panshibi: The Next Big Meme Coin Taking Over the Market Panshibi could be the new golden child of the meme market. In 43 days, Panshibi has pulled in thousands of investors while others struggle to stay relevant. The project's interactive ecosystem catapults its native SHIBI token from a speculative asset to a key beyond hype. Moreover, Panshibi supports panda conservation, turning every SHIBI-related transaction into more than a buy or sell. A percentage of fees goes toward these endangered animals, making $SHIBI one of the few meme coins with a real-world impact. Instead of being another token with a funny mascot, Panshibi brings value outside the crypto space. Additionally, Panshibi’s smart contract has been audited by Coinsult, verifying that it runs as expected without hidden risks. The liquidity pool is locked for 10 years, preventing sudden dumps that can ruin early investments. This setup keeps the market steady and protects long-term investors. The panda-themed project stands out because it taps into Asian markets, where panda symbolism carries cultural significance. Unlike dog-themed coins that feel overdone, Panshibi offers fresh branding that appeals to a global audience. With presale stages selling fast, excitement continues to build around Panshibi. Experts predict a major price jump when $SHIBI hits exchanges, making it one of the most awaited launches in the meme coin world. Over 60% of SHIB Holders in Loss: Can It Recover? Shiba Inu still struggles to make headway despite the boom of several meme coins in Q1 2025. Over the past month, the SHIB crypto has lost over 14% of its price, hitting new lows as investor interest wanes. According to IntoTheBlock , over 60% of SHIB holders are in lost positions, leading to a serious drop in daily transactions and active wallets. Large-scale sell-offs by major holders have added to the pressure, causing increased sell volume and pushing the SHIB crypto below $0.000014. The token burn rate, once seen as a mechanism to enhance scarcity, has slowed considerably. This reduction in burning activity has raised concerns about long-term supply management and value preservation. With the overall crypto sentiment turning negative, funds have been shifting from doggo-themed coins to more stable assets. CoinMarketCap reports that the meme market has hit its lowest since October 2024, and Shiba Inu appears to be one of the worst affected. Conclusion Amid Shiba Inu's market challenges, investor sentiment is shifting toward new meme coins like Panshibi. With less than 17 days remaining, investors can become citizens of the digital panda world for as low as $0.005. Don't miss your chance to get in before it lists on major exchanges!

The price continued to decline, falling to $85,323 before registering a marginal recovery and moving to its current $85,800. The flagship cryptocurrency is down nearly 4% over the past 24 hours. BTC’s latest decline came as the White House hosted the first-ever crypto summit, meeting top executives from prominent digital asset firms. Donald Trump Endorses Stablecoins President Donald Trump has said he would support legislative efforts to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins to keep the US Dollar as the world’s dominant reserve currency. President Trump and the White House Crypto and AI Czar hosted a meeting of prominent members from the crypto industry, described by the administration as the first-ever White House Digital Assets Summit in Washington. Trump addressed the gathering of executives, stating, “I also want to express my strong support for the efforts of lawmakers in Congress as they work on bills to provide regulatory certainty for dollar-backed stablecoins and the digital assets market. They’re working very hard on that.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also addressed the gathering, stating he would work with regulators and agencies to update the guidance issued by the Biden administration. “We are going to keep the US (dollar) the dominant reserve currency in the world, and we will use stablecoins to do that.” Trump also hit out at the Biden administration, accusing his predecessor of selling billions worth of BTC , adding that the current administration would not sell BTC anymore. “Unfortunately, in recent years, the US government has foolishly sold tens of thousands of additional bitcoins that were worth billions and billions of dollars had they not sold them. From this day on, America will follow the rule that every bitcoin investor knows very well: never sell your bitcoin.” Trump signed an executive order on Thursday, directing officials to create a Bitcoin reserve and a stockpile of other crypto assets. White House Crypto Summit Fails To Impress The White House hosted its first-ever crypto summit, inviting some of the most prominent leaders of the crypto ecosystem. The summit discussed the administration’s commitment to rolling back the aggressive regulatory stance adopted by the previous Biden administration. However, the summit left many disappointed because the administration did not indicate more active support for the industry. As a result, markets remained muted on Friday, with BTC registering a decline to slip below $90,000. White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks announced that the President signed an executive order to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve. While the crypto community wanted a Bitcoin reserve, the order stated the reserve would only comprise Bitcoin holdings previously seized by the federal government. The order also issued directives for creating a separate digital asset stockpile to hold other digital tokens like ETH, XRP, and ADA. However, the order did not say when the government would begin making new cryptocurrency purchases. President Trump doubled down on his promise to make the US the crypto capital of the world and a leader in financial technology. However, some investors were left wanting more. Jeff Park, an executive with Bitwise, said Trump was officially “off the hook” for what the Bitcoin community did for him during his campaign. “Trump is now officially ‘off the hook’ for what the Bitcoin community did for him. We asked for too little. Having only bitcoin and not the rest of the altcoins in the strategic reserve is not a win. Exploring’ or studying concepts is not a win. Not selling is not a win. None of these things at the core require an EO at all to do anything.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) struggled to reclaim $90,000 as selling pressure and volatility impacted investor sentiment. The flagship cryptocurrency is down nearly 3% and trading just above the $86,000 mark. The price faces resistance at $90,000, with the 20-day SMA also acting as a dynamic resistance level. Analysts expect a breakout, but heavy selling around the $90,000 level indicates profit-taking at that level. The White House crypto summit also failed to ignite investor confidence, with price action remaining muted. BTC has encountered substantial volatility this week as wild price swings shook investor confidence. The price plunged below $80,000 on Friday, dropping to a low of $78,173. However, it recovered from this level to reclaim $80,000 and settle at $84,362, ultimately registering a marginal decline. Sentiment changed on Saturday as BTC rose over 2% and settled at $86,812. Markets rallied Sunday after President Trump announced cryptocurrencies to be included in the strategic reserve. As a result, BTC surged over 9% to reclaim $90,000 and settle at $94,322. However, bullish momentum was short-lived as the price fell nearly 9% on Monday, slipping below $90,000 and the 20-day SMA and settling at $86,225. Source: TradingView BTC fell to an intraday low of $81,500 on Tuesday as selling pressure intensified. It recovered from this level to register an increase of 1.27% and settle at $87,316. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as BTC reclaimed $90,000 after an increase of nearly 4% and settled at $90,639. BTC faced considerable volatility on Thursday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Sellers ultimately gained the upper hand, and the price dropped nearly 1%, slipping below $90,000 and settling at $89,957. Bearish sentiment intensified on Friday as BTC dropped 3.53%, falling to a low of $84,718 before settling at $86,781. The current session sees BTC marginally down as buyers look to drive BTC below the 200-day SMA. If sellers retain control, BTC could decline to $83,000, where it is expected to find support. A break below this level could see the price drop to $80,000. On the other hand, if buyers regain control, they will look to drive the price above $90,000. If BTC can break above this level, its next target will be $95,000. The MACD has turned bearish, indicating BTC could see a decline.

In contrast, DTX Exchange is gaining attention with its 120k asset marketplace and the guaranteed 2x returns for early presale investors in 2025. With the listing price at $0.36, early investors have a rare chance to double their investment by buying DTX tokens at $0.18 only. Until now, DTX Exchange has accumulated over $15.8 million in funds and is still in the bonus round of presale. Will DTX be able to give better gains than Ripple in 2025? Let’s find out. DTX’s 120k Asset Marketplace with Instant 2x Gains DTX Exchange is all set to revolutionize the trading landscape with over 120,000 asset classes. These include crypto, forex, stocks, ETFs and much more. This way traders will be able to diversify their portfolio and manage their risk. But that’s not it as this feature will attract traders from many different financial markets. While many traders are focused on the XRP price and where it could move next, DTX is offering something even more compelling. And that is guaranteed 2x gains for early investors in 2025. The current price of DTX tokens in the presale is $0.18 each with a launch price set at $0.36. Moreover, DTX is offering a 100% deposit bonus by using the code “LIST2X”. This means whoever buys DTX tokens now and uses the promo code during checkout their initial investment will become 4x as soon as the token launches on major exchanges. Apart from offering thousands of financial assets, DTX Exchange is also working on providing a high-speed trade execution speed of 200,000 TPS. This means no more delays during trading. Even while Ripple is relying on regulatory developments, DTX is moving forward with real value and innovative trading features. Can Ripple Break Past $3 Amid U.S. Crypto Reserve Hype At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading just below $2.50 with a slight decrease in value after surging up to $2.90 with a 32% up-stick. It happened because, on March 2, 2025, Trump shocked the world by naming Ripple as part of the U.S. Crypto Reserve. This caused a frenzy in the market with major tokens like Cardano, Solana and Ripple enjoying sudden gains. Source: CoinMarketCap Now, one of the key resistance areas for the XRP price is at $3.00, a psychological barrier that investors are waiting for it to breach. However, the technical analysis of the XRP price reveals that there’s a high selling pressure with RSI and some other indicators in the neutral zone. The inclusion of Ripple in the U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve might attract more investors but for now, the hype was short-lived. According to some analysis, the XRP price could reach $8 by mid-2025. However, based on the current performance of Ripple, investors are more inclined towards DTX Exchange knowing that this is a rare opportunity to double their investment instantly. DTX Exchange Elevating Crypto Charity and High-Volume Trading DTX Exchange is continuously pushing the boundaries of blockchain innovations. While many traders are busy focusing on the XRP price movements and what innovations Ripple might be bringing, DTX Exchange is solving real-world challenges. According to the latest developer updates, DTX is integrating crypto donations, high-volume trading, and fiat-to-crypto accessibility into its ecosystem. This means that only verified NGOs will be able to access funds upon meeting present milestones. Another impressive update is that DTX can manage extreme volumes. Their team used different stress tests which revealed that this platform can handle 200,000 simultaneous transactions with 99.98% uptime. Final Thoughts Investors are now closely watching the XRP price due to the news about the U.S. Crypto Reserve. However, many are attracted to DTX as it is offering 4x profit to early investors on the official listing at $0.36, an immediate jump from $0.18. The DTX presale is nearing its final stages, and with less than 40% of the bonus round remaining, this is truly the last chance to secure DTX tokens at the lowest price possible. Investors should not miss out on this chance to quadruple their investment.

According to a survey carried out by Bitpanda, about 50% of female crypto investors prefer to hold their assets for long, stacking their portfolio with low-risk assets like Bitcoin. While the risks of volatility will continue to be present in digital assets, assets like Bitcoin have the fundamentals to be less susceptible to volatility, which may lead to the loss of a heavy percentage of its value. According to the survey, 50% of the female respondents prefer long-term financial growth, 49% prefer to hold assets for up to five years, and 39% prefer to hold for more than five years. Survey results showing female crypto investment habits. Source: Bitpanda The survey also looked at the investment pattern of the women, with most of them favouring assets with lesser risks. Bitcoin remained the most popular choice among the respondents, with 30% choosing it as their first point of contact when choosing assets to invest in. The figure is quite high compared to the men, where 24% of the respondents chose Bitcoin as their first investment. Female crypto investors favor diverse portfolio According to the CEO of crypto exchange Bitget, Gracy Chen, women prefer to build a diverse portfolio which enables them to hold on to their assets long-term. This way, they don’t chase short gains as they focus on wealth creation. “This measured approach is exactly what the crypto ecosystem needs — investors who understand technological fundamentals and look beyond market noise,” Gracy Chen said. Chen also cited a Charles Stanley study, noting that women adopt a ‘sit on their hands’ investment style, which means that they trade less frequently compared to men. “While men made 13 trades annually on average, women executed only 9. This patience and strategic thinking translates beautifully to crypto markets, where emotional reactions to volatility often lead to losses,” Chen added. The reaction was also shared by the co-founder of liquidity platform Mansa, Nkiru Uwaje, who believes that the results of the survey show the glaring difference between men and women when it comes to investment psychology and strategy. “Women approach investing differently as part of a broader wealth-building strategy. When we invest in Bitcoin, we often consider its place within a diversified portfolio rather than viewing it in isolation,” she said. She also noted that the investment strategy also depends on how they analyze the market, with most favoring a waiting-out style instead of selling during dumps. “Preference of holding may also lie in analyzing how investments may change. Instead of reactively selling during dips, female investors tend to observe how assets behave through market cycles,” she added. Women are entering the crypto industry amid the challenges While most women prefer to invest in Bitcoin , it is not due to their instinct to evade risks. According to the founder of INPUT Comms blockchain and tech-focused communications agency, Mary Pedler, this approach is due to their knack for thorough research and patience. “Many women I’ve worked and communicated with do deep research before investing and seldom make FOMO-driven decisions,” she said. The emergence of female crypto investors is a commendable feat in the crypto market, but the issue regarding education has been the main challenge for wider adoption among women. In the survey, over 81% noted that they lacked the required experience, with 24% noting that their biggest challenge is a lack of investment knowledge, while 41% mentioned financial constraints. However, female crypto accounts on Bitpanda have grown steadily, with women who began their crypto investment journey in January 2024 already seeing an 8.1% rise in their investments in the period. According to Chen, about 26% of crypto holders are women. To solve the issue of inexperience, initiatives like the Woman in Ethereum Protocol (WiEP) have drummed up the need for more education and structured support for women who want to enter the crypto sector.

This Altcoin Is Set Top 10x Before Then,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/solana-price-prediction-is-200-on-the-cards-for-solana-this-altcoin-is-set-top-10x-before-then,"Solana Price Prediction is sparking intense discussion as traders and experts alike wonder if the top altcoin's upward journey could soon breach the $200 barrier. Market news about strategic alliances and technological developments has restored Solana's market attractiveness since analysts expect its value will double during this rising cycle. All the same, a sophisticated payment system operates in the background, using an innovative framework to transform international money transfers. Let's find out which and why this is big for 2025. Solana News and Price Stats: Solana Price Prediction Insights The market discussion about Solana Price Prediction centers on the current trading price of $143 while daily price fluctuations range between $133 and $155 . Price data shows SOL is forming a bullish megaphone pattern which hits a crucial price support area in its current phase. The maintenance of current support represents a potential opportunity for a price increase although analysts warn traders need to demonstrate patience. A support breakdown would lead to additional price drops that might encourage traders to open short positions. The optimistic outlook for Solana’s future growth stems from its new relationships with top financial institutions including the US strategic reserve initiative as well as fintech developers that strengthen the project’s long-term direction. Recent market commentary shows a developing trend where Solana Price Prediction receives repeated mentions as rapid price surges become more common. The price of Solana has been boosted by its recent network advancements and strategic deals which drive investors towards the altcoin while Remittix presents a previously undiscovered investment opportunity with substantial growth potential. Analysts’ Solana Price prediction hinges on robust network activity and ecosystem growth as critical factors yet Remittix stands apart because of its currently low entry cost alongside potential for 10x growth thus making it an attractive choice for investors looking for exceptional returns. Analysts predict Solana will surpass $160 in April to reach $200 before November 2025 but experts agree Remittix offers investors a chance to capture greater gains than Solana because it remains under the radar. Remittix Is 2025’s Cross-Border Remittance Powerhouse Redefining Global Finance The rapid market shifts accompanied by continuous Solana Price Prediction assessments are eventually giving way to an innovative financial solution that is positioned to transform international transfer operations and cross-border payments. Remittix is a Defi company that has received increasing praise because of its advanced capabilities to perform quick and efficient cross-border remittances. The Defi company has achieved major successes having sold over 515 million RTX tokens while raising 13.7 Million to address Payfi problems. Remittix utilizes modern technology to create a bridge between crypto and traditional financial systems to enable fast borderless transactions while minimizing transfer expenses. The top Defi coin stands out to investors as a dependable practical alternative to altcoins because it provides real-world utility to fix the inefficiencies of conventional cross-border payments. The true breakthrough of investing in Solana emerges through platforms which unite security measures with efficiency and worldwide operational capabilities and this is what the Remittixwallet affords its users. Solana May Surge To $200 Soon But Remittix offers 1000% Gains Market watchers remain deeply interested in Solana Price Prediction discussions because they analyze both the potential for Solana to reach $200 and its ability to achieve smaller gains before that level. Analysts are certain that the innovative financial solution of Remittix will prepare the way for upcoming generations of global transactions which will offer essential equilibrium to the fast-paced altcoin trading environment.

Currently, Pi coin is trading at around $1.80, down almost 35% from last week’s high. While the coin has shown strong momentum, market trends suggest that more price swings could happen in the short term. Will Binance List Pi Coin? Pi Network has a large and growing community, but there’s still no confirmation from Binance about listing it. Recently, Binance introduced a new “Vote to List” and “Vote to Delist” system, allowing users to help decide which coins get added or removed. Interestingly, Pi Network’s community has already voted, with 88% supporting a Binance listing. Despite this, Binance has not yet made an official announcement. While waiting for a Binance listing, Pi Coin is seeing more real-world use . Many businesses in the USA, China, Vietnam, Thailand, and India are accepting Pi as payment. This growing adoption has helped strengthen Pi Coin’s position in the crypto market 14th March: Pi Day March is one of the most important months for Pi Coin. The Pi Network community celebrates “ Pi Day ” on March 14, and in past years, this event has led to price increases. Many experts predict that the Pi coin price will hit $3.14 on the same. Can Pi Break the $2 Resistance Level? Pi Coin is showing strong momentum, holding steady despite the overall market decline. Meanwhile, the Bollinger Bands, which help predict price movements, indicate that a significant move could be on the horizon. As of now, Pi Coin is struggling to break above the $2 resistance level. It has tried multiple times but failed. Currently, the price is around $1.80 , down 1.5%, but its market cap remains strong at $12.85 billion.

For example, both Ali and Javon Marks have made some bold price predictions for these members of the best altcoin list. With the recent announcement for a US crypto reserve by Donald Trump, these predictions may come true. However, investors are also gravitating towards IntelMarkets (INTL) , a phase ten presale star that has already surged by 911%. Once a Tier-1 crypto exchange like Uniswap lists it soon, another 361% price increase will come. Unlike ADA and DOGE, this price pump is guaranteed. Thus, many traders look at INTL as the altcoin with the highest upside potential this year. IntelMarkets (INTL) To Reward Early Buyers With a 361% Return While the price of Cardano and the Dogecoin price are showing some good bullish signs, IntelMarkets (INTL) is also turning some heads in the market. This is because early buyers are already seeing a 911% return. This percentage will rise by another 361% after a top-tier CEX lists INTL soon. IntelMarkets was already making headlines as it excited traders with its upcoming AI-driven trading platform. Unlike traditional trading robots that make the same mistake twice, IntelMarkets will introduce self-learning trading robots that improve their performance over time. Plus, the Intelli-M tool will offer consolidated info from over 10K data platforms in one place. These AI features will make IntelMarkets stand out from its rivals like Coinbase or Binance. Those interested in supporting it are now buying the INTL token to get governance voting rights and up to 30% discounts on trading fees. One INTL costs only $0.091 but this altcoin price will hit $0.10 after phase eleven of the presale begins. Additionally, INTL will be worth $0.42 after a Tier-1 CEX lists it soon - a 362% increase overnight. Thus, countless traders rush to buy INTL and capitalize on its growth before time runs out. Ali: The Price of Cardano (ADA) Will See a 40% Move Cardano (ADA) is currently among the top 10 altcoins. CoinMarketCap shows that the price of Cardano jumped nearly 40% in the past week alone. During that time, its value moved from around $0.70 to over $0.90. Market expert Ali also excited traders as he thinks this bullish trend will continue for Cardano (ADA). According to his X post, the price of Cardano will see a potential 40% move soon. In other words, this altcoin could soar to $1.25. While this Cardano price prediction has made some waves in the market, many traders are rushing to INTL instead. This is because the price of Cardano has soared over 30% on the YTD charts. Therefore, its highest upswings may have passed. Expert Claims the Dogecoin Price Will Skyrocket by 261% Although one of the top meme coins, Dogecoin (DOGE) has seen some red price charts. On the one-month chart, the Dogecoin price has fallen from around $0.30 to nearly $0.20, as per CoinMarketCap. In other words, it has nearly dropped 25% in just a few short weeks. However, crypto expert Javon Marks remains bullish for Dogecoin (DOGE). In a recent X post, he said this meme coin looks well on track to a significant surge to new ATHs above the $0.73 level. He claims the Dogecoin price will surge by 261%. Although many traders are excited about this Dogecoin price prediction, some are still cautious. This is because its high market cap, at $30B, means a lot of new money needs to roll in for the Dogecoin price to surge. But altcoins like INTL will not have this issue. IntelMarkets (INTL) vs. Cardano (ADA) vs. Dogecoin (DOGE) – Which Altcoin Will See the Fastest Price Gains? IntelMarkets (INTL), Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are all altcoins to watch this year. They all could see big price gains. However, IntelMarkets stands out. Unlike meme coins like DOGE, INTL will have actual utility while also tied to the AI market. Since Statista predicts this market will be worth $826B by 2030, INTL could have better long-term growth potential and more stability in volatile markets. Not only that, but INTL boasts a smaller market cap than altcoins like ADA. This means faster price growth with less new money needed. Due to all these factors, plus the upcoming Tier-1 CEX listing pushing its value up by another 361%, many investors are gravitating to INTL this altcoin season.

The comments from US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has given life to the theories for future XRP relevance but the spectre of its long-running case with the SEC looms behind. RLUSD Will Change The Narrative For XRP XRP’s community is buzzing with optimism that the asset could play a significant role in America’s ambition to keep the US dollar as the global reserve currency. Pundits are hinging their theories on recent comments by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent at the White House Crypto Summit . Bessent confirmed plans to maintain the US dollar’s supremacy but disclosed a changing stance from fiat. According to Bessent, the US will explore other options including stablecoins to keep the dollar’s dominance as the primary currency for global trade. “We will keep the US the dominant reserve currency and use stablecoins to do that,” said Bessent. Right out the bat, XRP’s community is tipping RLUSD, Ripple’s USD-backed stablecoin to lead the new financial renaissance. Optimists say RLUSD has raft of positives to justify its bid to spearhead the US stablecoin ambitions. RLUSD Surging Growth And Regulatory Compliance Gives It An Edge RLUSD, live on the XRP Ledger and Ethereum, is recording impressive growth metrics in recent months. At the moment, RLUSD has a market capitalization of $140 million, rising by leaps and bounds. Adoption rates for RLUSD have reached new highs with a 327% volume growth recorded over the last year. Furthermore, its cross-border payments capabilities puts it in prime position but it will have to stave off competition from Circle’s USDC following a string of regulatory victories the Middle East. Experts are tagging RLUSD as a regulatory compliant stablecoin in the US, noting that the government’s decision to lean on the stablecoin will be “huge” for XRP. Higher RLUSD adoption will trigger an increased demand for XRP as the bridge asset, sending asset prices to new levels. OCC Clears The Pathway For Increased Adoption The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has announced that financial institutions in the US can carry out stablecoin transactions. The OCC, via its Interpretive Letter 1183, confirmed the end of Operation Chokepoint 2.o, allowing banks adopt RLUSD for transactions. The inclusion of XRP in the Crypto Strategic Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile signals broader regulatory acceptance for the assets. A masterstroke for XRP will be the dismissal of the Ripple SEC case as whales gobble up large coin volumes.

As Trump teased on Sunday, altcoins like Solana , XRP , and Cardano were eyed for the reserve. With that prospect off the table and cryptocurrencies selling off after the announcement, several promising digital coins now hint at substantial growth. Dive in to see which cryptos are poised to capture the market's attention. TRON Price Action: Recent Gains and Key Market Levels TRON showed a nearly 12% price rise over one month and an impressive gain topping 60% over six months. Price performance reflected stronger investor interest and growing momentum. The coin maintained steady upward movement with increasing volume, demonstrating clear growth without abrupt reversals. Current trading sits between $0.20 and $0.26, with immediate resistance at $0.29 and support near $0.17. Bulls appear active behind the solid support while resistance challenges are keeping bears in check. The market lacks a distinct trend yet offers trading ideas such as buying near support to target the $0.29 level, with caution advised if prices reach the second resistance around $0.35. MANTRA Price Analysis: Strong Long-Term Surge Amid Short-Term Volatility The past month showed a 14.91% increase and a substantial 654.65% surge over the last six months. A recent drop of 11.76% in one week indicates some weakness. Price movements have been uneven, with long-term gains overshadowing short-term fluctuations. The overall strength remains significant, but current volatility suggests caution among traders. The price currently ranges between $4.90 and $9.68. The nearest resistance is at $11.81, while immediate support sits at $2.26. Bulls may take control if prices break above $11.81, though some negative momentum allows bears to maintain influence. With no clear trend present, trading strategies should focus on buying near support and monitoring for upward movement towards resistance. Pi Network Retreat Faces Strong Resistance Amid Bearish Trends Price activity indicates a steep decline, with nearly a 95% drop in one month and a 94% decrease over six months. A further 15% loss has occurred in the last week, highlighting a coin that has consistently trended downward and faced significant pressure throughout its historical performance. The coin is currently trading at a low price level, facing strong resistance at $266.97, with another hurdle at $466.37. Bears dominate the market, evidenced by a weak momentum at -1.00, an Awesome Oscillator reading of -32.30, and an RSI around 35.86. Traders may look to short-sell within these resistance levels while keeping an eye out for potential support below these markers. Conclusion The President's crypto reserve has left many in the crypto community feeling deflated. However, some cryptos are showing promise. TRX continues to develop strong use cases and partnerships. OM is gaining traction with its focus on social trading. PI is rapidly building a dedicated user base. All these cryptos are worth watching for potential growth. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

The market analysts expect substantial price fluctuations for XRP and MUTM based on the current industry dynamics and investor attitudes as well as their essential functions within decentralized finance. The market questions forecast the maximum potential of XRP and MUTM tokens because BTC’s influence controls the entire field. Ripple (XRP): A Potential Surge to $30 by 2025 The digital crypto currency Ripple (XRP) attracts extensive attention from analysts who predict the token value will reach $30 during May 2025. XRP’s projected value at $30 in 2025 stems from analyzing past market movements through weekly indicators that resemble the 2017 bull trend. Analysts expect XRP to repeat its previous 2,500% price increase during the same cycle in the future. XRP may ascend to exceptional heights because of market excitement formed by Bitcoin reaching $200,000. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): A DeFi Gem Poised for Explosive Growth The successful future of XRP depends on market sentiment yet Mutuum Finance (MUTM) secures its position in DeFi through its lending model which includes a built-in buy pressure system. MUTM continues its presale in the second stage where it offers tokens at $0.015 supported by $2.4 million in raised funds and attracting 4,500 investors. The project’s systematic token structure together with its practical financial usage positions it as a distinguished choice among an enormous market competition. Through its lending platform Mutuum Finance enables users to lock ETH along with DAI assets to get mtTokens that increase in value as interest accrues. MUTM operates as a solution that generates passive income while preserving both liquidity and utility between different DeFi tools. MUTM token demand grows consistently due to platform revenue being used for token acquisitions through the project’s buy-and-distribute system. This innovative approach has analysts predicting a 400% return at launch, with the token expected to list at $0.06. Beyond current potential the system possesses other opportunities for growth. After its launch MUTM could potentially boost more so that some analysts predict price estimates from $1 to $5 within the market. Existing investors have an extraordinary chance to participate in this potential buildup. At the presale price of $2,500 a person might receive more than $60,000 when MUTM rises to $0.60. Opportunity is running out fast given the quick pace of presale success which reduces the available time to purchase MUTM at its minimum price point. The unique features of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance delivers practical functionality to crypto investors because it operates with a decentralized lending and borrowing solution. The platform bases its stability on collateralization practices and matches different investor risk levels through interest rates that change frequently. Security enhancements achieved through reputable firm audits of smart contracts increase investor confidence in the project. The approaching $200,000 price mark for Bitcoin will have multiplier effects on the growth of MUTM within the crypto market. The DeFi market find this token as a top choice due to its special features аnd successful presale outcomes. The present phase of the presale represents an optimal period to acquire MUTM before its value increases. Bitcoin’s predicted rise to $200,000 creates conditions which will help XRP and MUTM and other altcoins rise together as major crypto-market participants. XRP’s path to reaching $30 price will confront numerous difficulties but demonstrates strong prospects for the long-term period. Mutuum Finance stands out as an exceptional investment because of its disruptive decentralized finance model and its successful pre-sale activities. MUTM stands out as a token that requires attention because market projections indicate a 400% initial return upon launch followed by additional substantial gains afterward.

The price action near this range is critical and decisive for the market, as a bearish breakdown could trigger a major sell-off. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart Bitcoin’s price has found support at the 200-day MA ($83K), leading to a sideways consolidation. This support zone aligns with the 0.5-0.618 Fibonacci retracement range, reinforcing its importance. A break below this level could signal a trend shift toward a bearish market, while holding above it may initiate a bullish rebound. For now, Bitcoin is trapped between the 100-day ($95K) and 200-day MAs ($83K). Until a decisive breakout occurs, consolidation within this range is the most probable scenario for the short term. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, Bitcoin broke below its ascending channel, followed by a retracement to the broken support, a classic bearish confirmation. This pattern suggests further downside risk if the cryptocurrency breaks below the wedge’s lower boundary, potentially pushing the price below $80K. However, the 0.5-0.618 Fibonacci range remains a strong support zone, increasing the likelihood of a mid-term bullish reversal. Given the uncertain price action, Bitcoin is expected to consolidate between $80K-$95K in the short term until a breakout determines the next major trend. Source: TradingView On-chain Analysis By Shayan While Bitcoin’s bullish momentum appears to be fading, analyzing investor behavior provides key insights into market sentiment. One valuable metric in this regard is the Spent Output Age Bands of exchange inflows, which measures the proportion of deposited BTC based on how long investors have held their coins. Examining the 1-week to 6-month age band, recent sell-offs have been primarily driven by short-term holders, investors who typically react quickly to price swings. This suggests that panic selling and profit-taking among these traders have contributed to the price retracement. On the other hand, long-term investors (holding for over 6 months) show no signs of aggressive selling pressure. Instead, their activity aligns with gradual profit-taking, a characteristic of any healthy bullish trend. This implies that these investors expect higher prices before distributing, reducing immediate supply in the market. If sufficient demand enters the market, this supply shrinkage could fuel further price appreciation.

JPMorgan Chase’s head of global market intelligence Andrew Tyler says the lender’s trading desk is flipping short-term bearish on the stock market amid a deteriorating macroeconomic backdrop, reports Bloomberg. All in all, the US stock market has wiped out $3.4 trillion this year, giving up all of the gains witnessed since Trump won the election in November. Tyler’s team sees President Donald Trump’s trade war as a headwind that could limit the US economy’s growth. “With this in mind, we are changing our view to tactically bearish… Given the uncertainty, positioning, and potential for a negative feedback loop to push people to using the recession playbook, we think the bearish position makes the most sense.” Earlier this week, Trump imposed 25% tariffs against both Canada and Mexico, leading to a 500-point drop in the Dow, alongside small drops in the Nasdaq and S&P 500. As the equity market retreats, Goldman Sachs analyst David Kostin says in an investor note that equity valuations are not yet low enough to trigger a significant bounce. He also believes that the stock market will only regain bullish momentum if the US economy begins to show signs of strength. “An improvement in the US economic growth outlook will be required to fully reverse the recent equity market weakness.” On his forecast for stocks this year, Kostin says, “Equity returns will be more modest than last year and match the trajectory of earnings growth.” Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley believes that the stock market will see “muted” gains this year. Andrew Slimmon, the firm’s head of applied equity advisors team, says stocks have been in a bull market since 2023, leading to concerns that the market may be overvalued. Slimmon also says that the third year of an equities bull market typically prints mediocre gains on average based on historical data. “With enough negatives out there, including higher-for-longer interest rates and geopolitical noise, to cause a subpar year, the recently minted optimists could revert to being skeptics, only to have the market roar again in 2026. In that case, 2025 could be more of a pause year than anything more sinister.” Last year, all three firms predicted that the S&P 500 would soar to greater heights this year, believing that a Trump presidency would create a favorable macroeconomic environment. JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley predicted that the S&P 500 will reach a new all-time high of 6,500 points in 2025.

February and early March have been no different, with Pepe crypto posting a huge loss, though the last 24 hours has seen a period of consolidation. Some spectators are now wondering whether this might be the calm before the storm, and if Pepe crypto is in line for a meteoric rise before Q1 wraps up. Meanwhile, investors have been flocking into the Panshibi presale to grab their share of SHIBI tokens. This revolutionary meme coin comes kitted out with utility for investors, real world impact, and all the best makings of meme coin culture. It has stormed past $1.2 million in presale, and has been hailed as a frontrunner for 2025. So how will these projects stack up against each other in Q2 and beyond? Pepe: Poised for a Comeback? Pepe (PEPE) has had a rough ride lately, plunging 30% over the past month. But in the last 24 hours, things have started to stabilize, and that could be the first sign of a turnaround. However, technical indicators still paint a bearish picture despite the recent uptick. TradingView’s breakdown of Pepe’s on-chain stats is given strong sell signals across the board . So what could be contributing to Pepe’s price movements? Well, it’s no secret that Q1 has seen a lot of volatility rock the crypto space, and projects with limited utility have struggled the most. Pepe, as well as Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, have each taken big hits largely owing to their purely speculative nature. On the plus side though, Pepe’s relatively new staking mechanisms have been well received, and helped Pepe to gain at least a small amount of utility. Though it will take more impressive technical updates for Pepe to shed this reputation altogether. Panshibi’s Meteoric Rise Meme coins have always been a fast-moving space, but Panshibi (SHIBI) is proving that smart tokenomics and real investor benefits can separate the best from the rest. Unlike many projects that rely solely on hype, Panshibi has structured its presale for long-term success, offering staking rewards, exclusive VIP perks, and a fully audited smart contract. Panshibi is a well-structured project designed to deliver value beyond simple speculation. Its staking platform offers an industry-leading 1,200% APY, meaning investors can earn massive rewards just for holding their tokens . Unlike many meme coins that encourage quick flips, Panshibi rewards long-term commitment with real earning potential. Another major factor driving demand is its structured presale pricing model, which ensures that early buyers secure lower prices before each stage sells out. At the current stage 4 price of $0.005, investors are locking in their positions before the price climbs higher. Beyond financial incentives, Panshibi also introduces interactive Social-Fi mechanics, allowing holders to compete in challenges, earn rewards, and engage with the ecosystem in a way that goes beyond simple trading. The Bamboo Private VIP Members Club offers additional perks for presale investors, creating an exclusive tier within the Panshibiecosystem. Adding to its appeal, Panshibi is committing a portion of its funds to panda conservation efforts, making it one of the few meme coins with a real-world mission alongside its financial potential. Investors Race to Secure Their SHIBI Tokens With more than $1.2 million already raised and momentum continuing to build, investors are moving quickly to secure SHIBI at its current presale price before the next stage kicks in. The 1,200% price increase expected during the presale has made this one of the most discussed opportunities in the realm of meme coins. For those looking to get ahead of the next big wave in the meme coin sector, Panshibi is certainly not a project to gloss over.

Reports say that the company is in talks with investment bankers about a public listing, a sign of a possible revival in the sluggish US IPO market. The initial public offering (IPO) market hasn’t been very active lately in both the UK and the US. However, experts think it will pick up in 2025. Discord is still exploring IPO plans Discord could be the next big company to go public in the US, even though they put off their plans to do so for four years. A spokesperson for Discord said, “We understand there is a lot of interest around Discord’s future plans. [However] we do not comment on rumors or speculation. Our focus remains on delivering the best possible experience for our users and building a strong, sustainable business.” An IPO of a well-known tech company could give private companies that are thinking about going public a much-needed boost. A volatile market due to an uncertain economy and high prices for privately owned businesses have made the IPO market start the year slowly. The chat app has more than 200 million users every month. 93% are using the app while gaming. The business makes money with a “freemium” strategy. Users can download the apps for free, but they have to pay to get extra features like custom emojis and better voice and video chat. It’s not necessary for ads to bring in money for Discord. The people who asked to stay anonymous because the talks are private said that the talks were just the beginning and that plans for the IPO could still change. Some companies have already had their IPOs An IPO allows private companies to list on stock exchanges. This allows other funds, businesses, or individual investors to buy their shares, raising money for further investment in the company’s growth and for existing shareholders. Often, it is up to founders, employees, or early backers to sell up and claim a profit. There are companies that are already operating. Canal+, a French media company that went public in December 2024 with a market value of about £2.5bn, was the biggest new company to list on the London Stock Exchange in recent months. This year, Shein has also been doing well in the UK. But the Chinese fast fashion business is still having trouble with the government. They already took a lot of damage in 2025, when MPs criticized them in a Business and Trade Committee meeting and investors pushed them to lower the value they were planning to set. Although there are still legal and moral problems for both sides, a float of £23bn would be good for the London Stock Exchange. On the other hand, the AI cloud computing company CoreWeave opted to file for an IPO in New York this month. The IPO could raise about $4bn and value the company at more than $35bn, making it the biggest tech IPO of the year. Others may be open to IPOs According to reports , Klarna could file as early as next week in order to get a $15bn value in a New York listing. A valuation is expected to be set in April. Klarna is famous for letting people buy things now and pay for them later. It has about 85 million customers worldwide. Reports say the company’s value has fluctuated, from over $45bn in 2021 to less than $7bn the next year. Monzo is another company that might go public later this year. If it goes the same way, it will definitely have big financial and political effects. There is no set date for when the digital bank will go public, but it has been a big hit in the British fintech scene, so many people hope it will stay in London. This is because it will be good for the LSE as well. A possible £4–5bn deal could still go either way, though, because the board and CEO are said to be split on which exchange would be best for their needs. Also, payments firm Ebury, which Santander mostly owns, will likely go public in London this summer, with a value of around £2.5bn. Shawbrook, a British bank, also wants to float at around £2bn, but only if the market conditions allow it. Many important start-ups, like the fintech companies Stripe and Chime and the data platform Databricks, had to stay private for much longer than planned. Now, they are likely to start planning to list their shares again. The founder of EquityZen, a company that helps private companies and their employees sell their stock, said that the IPO calendar went from fully booked to wide open in a span of about three weeks. This means that companies like car rental company Turo, AI chip company Cerebras, and financial services platform Stripe are now thinking again about going public after being ready to do so before. Phil Haslett of EquityZen said it would take a few brave companies to come out to get IPOs going again. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) has dropped by 61% and crashed to its lowest level since September 5, 2024. This crash has coincided with the overall weakness in the crypto industry, especially meme coins. Most meme coins, including the likes of Dogecoin ( DOGE ), Pepe ( PEPE ), and Floki ( FLOKI ) have fallen by double digits. Shiba Inu price has three potential catalysts that may push it higher in the coming days. First, its burn rate has jumped in the past few days. The daily burn rate rose by 3,253% to 29.3 million on March 8. This means that the network has incinerated over 410 trillion coins since its inception, leaving the circulating supply at 584 trillion. A token burn is a mechanism where cryptocurrencies are transferred to an inaccessible address. You might also like: Wonder why Bitcoin dropped following the US BTC reserve launch? Wolf of All Streets podcast host Scott Melker explains Second, Shiba Inu price has become a bargain, according to the Z score of the Market Value to Realized Value or MVRV indicator. Santiment data shows that the MVRV-Z score has crashed to minus 2.143, its lowest level since August last year. It has fallen from the December high of 0.35. The last time the MVRV indicator dropped to these levels it triggered a 215% surge to its December highs. That could be a sign that investors will start buying the dip. SHIB MVRV-Z score | Source: Santiment SHIB technicals SHIB price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the SHIB price has crashed to a key support level, where it failed to move below four times since July last year. That is a sign that bears are afraid of shorting the coin below that level. The accumulation and distribution indicator has continued rising, a sign that smart money investors are buying. Also, the Relative Strength Index and the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) indicators have formed a bullish divergence pattern. Additionally, Shiba Inu price has formed a falling wedge pattern, with the two lines about to converge. Therefore, the coin will likely have a strong bullish breakout, with the next target to watch being the December high of $0.00003325, up by 155% from the current level.

Experts Think This Altcoin Is A Better Buy This March!",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/is-a-5000-ethereum-price-prediction-realistic-experts-think-this-altcoin-is-a-better-buy-this-march,"It is indeed a “big day” for the crypto market today following the US crypto summit , which experts are projecting could be the big step the market has been waiting for. This is giving a big boost to optimism right now, with some analysts suggesting an Ethereum price predictionup to $5000. But even with this heightened optimism, the coin market cap fear-greed index remains below average, remaining at 30 for the fourth consecutive day. Is a $5000 Ethereum price prediction possible or just another overprojection of the altcoin price? Let's conduct a deep analysis to attempt to answer this question. While doing that, we'll also touch on a new altcoin experts have identified as the best buy this month. Is The Current Ethereum Price Prediction Realistic With The Price Action? Altcoins have been on a fast nosedive these last few weeks, with many of the top altcoins, including Ethereum, losing as much as 50% in the last five weeks. The Ethereum price has seen a drawdown in the last 90 days, hitting past 45% and losing most of the early profit this year. The Ethereum price prediction, however, has been largely motivated by the recent activities in the crypto landscape, especially with the Trump crypto reserve announcement. President Trump's executive order on the US crypto reserve has seen a strong wave of optimism and investor confidence return to the market. This optimism continues to drive the Ethereum price prediction higher, hitting as high as $6000. But these price predictions could be more long-term. The price action across timeframes shows the coin is on a strong downtrend as the Ethereum price crosses below the short-term, mid-term, and long-term Moving Averages. Most analysts predicted the Ethereum price would average $5000 this year as a follow-up to the Trump crypto reserve, but the $3200 support still looks farfetched. For the prediction to hit, the Ethereum price needs to reclaim $3200 as a major support, which could help it see a smooth ride towards the old ATH at $4891. Why Remittix Is Better Than Ethereum This Month Remittix presale is projected for a 5x surge this month in a continuous streak that could see the presale ROI hit 10x. The Remittix presale price growth has been influencing a surging ROI that has hit a homerun, which has continued to impress investors this year. Starting on a clean slate, the Remittix token has sold over $13.7M in its pre-launch funding round, also known as the presale, in which investors add more to their holdings. A simple trick doing all this magic is that the price grows higher with every presale stage. The Remittix exchange has promised to revolutionize the crypto payment sector and investors are betting big on it. A projection of the big breakout of this new altcoin is why it has continued to perform better than other altcoins, even in the current bearish market. While the coin market cap altcoin index remains at a new low, showing the index around 14, investors have continued showing confidence in the Remittix token. Hence, while the uncertainty grows around the Ethereum price prediction, Remittix's potential to hit 50x keeps increasing. The Remittix presale is closing in on its final lap, helping investors to lock in profit earlier while others wait to buy the token at a higher price. However, with about 180 million tokens remaining from 700,000,000 in the soft cap, getting in today could still get you a good portion of the Remittix presale tokens. This could help you invest early while allowing you to buy the token at the best price. Here is an opportunity to start today with the Remittix token.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM), currently priced at just $0.015 in its presale, is quickly becoming a standout investment due to its structured financial model and growing adoption. Unlike speculative tokens driven solely by hype, Mutuum Finance introduces a decentralized lending ecosystem that allows users to borrow, lend, and earn passive income while maintaining full control over their assets. With its presale advancing rapidly and demand increasing, analysts predict that MUTM could see a significant surge, making it one of the most promising tokens for 2025. Why MUTM is expected to surge 1,100% Mutuum Finance is more than just a new crypto token—it is a fully structured decentralized lending protocol designed to provide real financial value. The platform allows users to borrow funds without selling their holdings and earn passive income through lending. This utility-driven approach has attracted experienced crypto investors looking for assets with long-term potential rather than short-term speculation. Unlike many meme-based tokens or unsustainable projects, Mutuum Finance operates on a dual lending model: peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P). The P2C system enables users to supply liquidity to automated pools, earning yield based on utilization. Meanwhile, P2P lending allows users to negotiate loan terms directly, even supporting assets typically unavailable in standard lending markets, such as PEPE or SHIB. This flexibility increases demand for the platform, driving investor confidence. An investor who secures MUTM tokens at the presale price of $0.015 and holds until launch, where the price is set at $0.06, would already see a 400% return. However, with analysts predicting a surge of 1,100%, the potential returns become even more attractive. For example, a $3,000 investment at the current presale price would yield approximately 200,000 MUTM tokens. When the token reaches a projected value of $0.18, that same investment would be worth $36,000, offering a significant opportunity for early investors looking to maximize their returns. Mutuum Finance has already raised over $2.4 million, with 4,500 holders securing their positions early. The presale is now over 75% complete in its second phase, and as it nears the next pricing tier, demand is expected to grow further. Investors are moving quickly to take advantage of the lowest price before the next 50% price increase in Phase 3. Adding to its appeal, the team plans to release a beta version of the platform at launch, allowing investors to experience its lending and borrowing features firsthand. This real-world functionality is expected to drive further demand, increasing the token’s value post-launch. Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 giveaway to reward its early investors and supporters. This initiative is designed to encourage participation in the growing ecosystem while giving back to the community. As the presale continues to gain momentum, the giveaway adds another layer of excitement, attracting more investors looking to capitalize on the project’s potential. The combination of real financial use cases, a structured lending ecosystem, and rapid presale success makes Mutuum Finance one of the most promising altcoins for 2025. With a limited supply and a growing community, many experienced investors see it as an opportunity to secure high returns before it goes live on exchanges. As the presale moves closer to its next phase and the project gains further traction, the window to invest at the lowest price is closing fast. Those looking for a high-growth crypto with real utility are turning to MUTM, anticipating significant gains in the months ahead.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $3.98 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $6.46. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $0.520 Market cap $519,205,836.25 Trading volume $307,311,501.4 Circulating supply 998,841,023.82 WIF All-time high $4.85 on March 31, 2024 All-time low $0.000023 on November 2023 24-hour high $0.5715 24-hour low $0.5156 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 8.89% 50-day SMA $0.953 14-Day RSI 36.95 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 28 (Fear) Green days 9/30 (30%) 200-Day SMA $1.99 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis: WIF remains in the red zone TL;DR Breakdown WIF is currently in the oversold region. Dogwifhat (WIF) resistance is present at around $0.584. WIF’s immediate support level is present at $0.520. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart: WIF trades near support at $0.503 WIF/USDT is in a downtrend on March 8, trading near $0.520, with key support at $0.503. The MACD is slightly bullish, suggesting potential for a rebound, but the RSI (38.14) shows weak buying pressure. If $0.503 holds, a move toward $0.584, $0.649, or $0.702 is possible. A breakdown below $0.503 could lead to further declines. WIF trades near support at $0.503 Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart: WIF to retest $0.560 soon? The 4-hour WIF/USDT shows a clear decline in price after a peak, with bearish momentum taking over. Dogwifhat currently trades just above the lower Bollinger Band (a short-term support level). A bounce from this level could lead to another attempt at the $0.560 resistance level. WIF to retest $0.560 soon? The Balance of Power (BOP) suggests potential buying opportunities. The BOP reflects that sellers have more control in the market compared to buyers, indicating bearish sentiment. To confirm the position of the BOP indicator, WIF needs to recapture the $0.560 price level and break past resistance at $0.610. Dogwifhat technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.9132 SELL SMA 5 $ 0.7956 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.8280 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.7114 SELL SMA 50 $ 0.9532 SELL SMA 100 $ 1.6472 SELL SMA 200 $ 1.9910 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.7105 SELL EMA 5 $ 0.8561 SELL EMA 10 $ 1.1381 SELL EMA 21 $ 1.4998 SELL EMA 50 $ 1.9943 SELL EMA 100 $ 2.24 SELL EMA 200 $ 2.27 SELL What to expect from WIF price analysis? The broader outlook for WIF is bearish. In the meantime, a recapture and break out of the $0.560 – $0.610 price level is needed to confirm a possible bullish reversal, while a long-term push above $0.702 could signal a sustainable uptrend. A failed bullish attempt could result in further price declines towards $0.503. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a meme coin on the Solana blockchain. Its value is driven by community interest and speculation. Projections indicate that by 2025, the price could recover to about $1 to $1.5. While it may have potential for short-term gains, it’s equally risky. Only invest after thorough research. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank and several other s . Why is $WIF down? WIF is down after facing rejection at $0.7876. The coin is down due to diminishing market interest and folding liquidity triggered by massive selloffs and a shift to other assets that investors consider more profitable. Dogwifhat (WIF) price chart | Coinmarketcap Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $99.9 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $1.2 by the end of 2025 and about $5 to $7 by 2031. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

ETH has crashed in the last two consecutive weeks, and is hovering at its lowest level since December 2023. Let’s explore why the value of Ethereum coin may continue falling in the near term. Ethereum price has weak technicals The weekly chart shows that the coin has been in a strong downward trend in the past few months. It has formed a triple-top chart pattern at about $4,050. This pattern is made up of three twin peaks and a neckline, which in this case, is at $2,153. It is one of the most bearish patterns in the market. Ethereum price has moved to the neckline at $2,153, meaning that it may have a strong bearish breakdown soon. This pattern’s depth is about 46%, meaning that a similar crash from the neckline is at $1,142, which is about 45% below the current level. Ethereum price has also crashed below the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level at $2,475. It has also moved below the 50-week and 100-week Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the MACD indicators have pointed downwards. Therefore, the coin will likely continue falling in the coming months, with the initial target to watch being at $1,500. This bullish view will become invalid if the coin rises above the 38.2% retracement point at $3,000. ETH price chart | Source: TradingView ETH ETF outflows Further, Ethereum price has crashed because of the waning demand among Wall Street investors. Recent data shows that all ETFs have accumulated over $2.7 billion in assets since their approvals. On the other hand, spot Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated over $40 billion in assets. Ethereum ETFs have struggled partly because of the opportunity cost of holding the coin vs its ETFs. Holding Ethereum itself is more profitable than ETFs because of its staking features. Data shows that Ethereum has a staking market cap of over $72.8 billion, much higher than the total assets in ETFs, which stand at $7.7 billion. Data by SoSoValue shows that spot Ethereum ETFs have been shedding assets in the past few weeks. It shed over $23 million in assets on Friday, after losing $35 million and $63 milion in the previous two days. Altogether, spot Ethereum ETFs have shed over $455 million in the last two weeks. Ethereum network fees have tanked Further, Ethereum is no longer making as much money as it used to in the past. It has made $206 million this year, making it the third most profitable layer-1 networks after Tron and Solana, which have made over $593 million and $346 million, respectively. Ethereum was the most profitable blockchain network in the crypto industry and has now been overtaken. One of the main reasons for this is that Ethereum has been overtaken by Tron in terms of stablecoin transactions. Tron regularly handles over $60 billion worth of stablecoins each day, higher than Ethereum because of its higher fees. Ethereum network has also lost market share against other chains like Solana, Arbitrum, and Base. Data shows that Ethereum network handled over $81 billion in the last 30 days, lower than Solana’s $92 billion. Ethereum layer-2 networks like Arbitrum and Base handled $24 billion and $30 billion. Therefore, all these factors, coupled with the weak on-chain metrics mean that the token will struggle to gain market share in the coming months.

As CryptoPotato reported earlier this week, the President of the United States signed an Executive Order, confirming the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve, as well as a strategic national stockpile of digital assets. Commenting on the matter was the administration’s AI and crypto czar David Sachs, who said: The Executive Order establishes a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile, consisting of digital assets other than bitcoin forfeited in criminal or civil proceedings. The government will not acquire additional assets for the Stockpile beyond those obtained through forfeiture proceedings. The purpose of the Stockpile is responsible stewardship of the government’s digital assets under the Treasury Department. Markets Tanked, but is the XRP Price in More Danger? Immediately following the announcement, most of the altcoins dropped substantially, erasing a lot of the gains that they had previously charted. The reason for this is, perhaps, because the Executive Order was largely a non-event. It didn’t establish anything that investors didn’t expect and it produces little to no tangible benefits for these assets because the US Government will not be spending money to acquire them. This has put altcoins such as XRP and ADA under the spotlight and many suspected that the contributions of their respective companies to Donald Trump’s presidential eleciton campaign had played a serious role for his announcement which caused the surge in the first place. But, on the other hand, now that the hype is through and this catalyst has effectively died, some analysts are worried that this could cause XRP’s price to lose steam, given its massive increase throughout the past few months. The cryptocurrency is up by almost 300% in the past year alone. There Are Other Catalysts Nonetheless Recall that the US Securities and Exchange Commission is in a massive legal battle againt Ripple Labs over the classification of XRP as a security. So far, it appears that the company has the upper hand. What is worth mentioning here is the latest developments following the Crypto Summit in the White House held yesterday. “Never sell your Bitcoin.” – Donald Trump at the first White House Crypto Summit America’s path to Bitcoin superpower status The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve = “Digital Fort Knox” Treasury & Commerce to explore new BTC acquisitions Lawmakers get strong backing… pic.twitter.com/jNoV53vUGk — CryptoPotato Official (@Crypto_Potato) March 7, 2025 Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed that the regulatory crackdown on digital asset is over, which could spell even more good news for XRP’s price in the future. Recall also that the SEC has dropped a few major cases against prominent crypto companies without any further enforcement actions. That said, if the same happens with Ripple Labs, then the XRP price could be in for another considerable rally.

PEPE, for instance, has dropped to multi-month lows and is losing investor confidence. Remittix (RTX) , however, is gaining traction with its cutting-edge PayFi platform that unites legacy finance and blockchain technology and emerging as a strong contender in the crypto space. PEPE’s Struggles: A Meme Coin in Decline PEPE, like all other meme coins, has been on an epic 3-month slide, reaching an all-time low price of $0.057047 just recently, falling by 30% for this month alone. PEPE and this slide symbolize other more fundamental concerns at issue in the meme coin space, such as poor underlying value and increasingly cynical investor sentiment. Macro-events like Trump's tariffs were not trivial drivers of its decline, and PEPE had fallen 18% in response. Now, 68% of PEPE holders are perplexed, and this further diminishes investor optimism. The fall in PEPE's price is explained by growing disappointment with meme coins, usually driven by social media perception and not by underlying utility. The $4.5 billion failure of Libra, which also impacted Solana and the broader meme coin sector, has also contributed to bearishness. Without any underlying drivers to reverse it, PEPE is failing to find any catalyst that will help its price reverse, showing the weakness of meme cryptocurrencies. Remittix: A Game-Changer in Cross-Border Payments Remittix is fast emerging as the largest dog in the crypto space, particularly where meme coins like PEPE are struggling with plummeting prices. Having raised over $13.7 million in its presale, Remittix has already sold over 515 million RTX tokens at a token price of $0.0734 . In contrast to the meme speculative tokens, Remittix offers a tangible solution to cross-border payments through the introduction of its groundbreaking PayFi platform with seamless crypto-to-fiat conversion. This system is revolutionizing the inefficiencies of cross-border remittances, instant transactions and without foreign exchange fees, a giant leap from the conventional financial institutions, which are costly and time-consuming. The ease of adoption of Remittix because of its compatibility with existing merchant systems makes it an easy one for corporate and individual customers to adopt. Further, its compliance-focused design makes it sure to be compliant with the regulations, hence a safe and reliable solution for institutions. As increasingly more users look for crypto with practical applications every day, Remittix is paving the way, propelling humanity's worldwide financial needs with technology of enduring wealth. Its utility focus places it on the verge of explosive growth, and Remittix will be dominating over speculative meme coins such as PEPE. The Growing Appeal of Remittix: Why It’s a Stronger Investment Than PEPE While PEPE's price prediction remains in limbo with no imminent catalyst for revival, Remittix'sdestiny will be rosy. Institutional investment in blockchain-based solutions for cross-border payments is increasing perpetually and initiatives such as Remittix are being considered against their potential for providing real-world utility and ending the inefficiencies inherent within current payment architecture. Unlike meaningless meme coins, which are only driven by social media frenzy alone, Remittix'sPayFi solution is solving an actual issue that is experienced by billions of individuals and organizations worldwide. Besides, Remittix presale success is a reflection of the long-term success the investors have in it. The project has already generated millions and is poised to revolutionize the global remittance market worth $189 trillion. Focusing on the cross-border payments market, Remittix is poised to capture a substantial percentage of this market, hence becoming a force to reckon with among the masses like XRP and Solana. Conclusion: Remittix Is the Better Option for Long-Term Growth As PEPE is struggling due to speculative purchases and an unstable future, Remittix dominates the crypto world through its actual applications in real life. Its new PayFi platform offers a natural solution for the global remittance market that renders it a better investment option compared to PEPE. Through such immense monolithic presale popularity and augmented user base, Remittix can emerge as a market champion of cross-border payments and financial solutions. In contrast to utility-less meme coins, Remittix's innovative and real-world practicality render it a better potential long-term investment. While PEPE's price forecast is wanting, Remittix is the better choice to grow.

These innovative solutions aim to improve blockchain efficiency and could offer strong returns. Investors are curious about the potential growth of Arbitrum , ZkSync , and Starknet . Discover which of these promising projects might be set to surge in value. Arbitrum Price Decline: Steady Downtrend with Key Support Zones Arbitrum experienced a price drop of 17.26% over the past month and 23.41% over the last six months, alongside a recent one-week decline of 7.60%. Price action has consistently trended downward, reflecting bearish pressure and reduced investor confidence. The coin has shown a gradual loss of value during these periods, indicating a persistent negative trend that traders have observed. The current trading range is between $0.30 and $0.60, with key support at $0.17 and resistance near $0.78. Bears appear to dominate the market as technical indicators, such as a low RSI and negative momentum, suggest weakness. Traders may look for potential bounces at support or consider a breakout above the $0.78 resistance level for future strategies. Starknet (STRK) Price Recap and Key Levels Amid Bearish Trends STRK lost nearly 28% of its value in the last month and dropped about 58% over the past six months. Weekly losses around 16% contributed to a steady decline that underscores a growing bearish sentiment among traders. Volatility has increased, reflecting a prolonged downturn with noticeable price swings that demand caution. The coin now trades between $0.1447 and $0.3219 dollars, with a near-term resistance at $0.43 dollars and additional resistance at $0.61 dollars, while support sits at roughly $0.07 dollars. The RSI close to 34 along with slightly negative oscillators indicates bearish momentum. Traders may consider buying near support for a potential bounce or selling near resistance if downtrends strengthen. zkSync Price Trends: Past Declines and Key Levels zkSync experienced a steady decline over the past month and six months, with its price falling by about 28.67% and 23.16% respectively. A one-week drop of 17.42% highlights a consistent bearish trend and limited upward movement. The price has faced ongoing pressure without a sustained rebound in recent periods. Current prices range between $0.066 and $0.141 dollars, with key support at $0.034 dollars and resistance near $0.186 dollars. A second resistance level is at $0.262 dollars. The low RSI of 32.935 and negative oscillators indicate bears are currently in control. However, the established levels suggest there may be opportunities for range-bound trading or a breakout if bullish sentiment returns. Conclusion ARB, STRK, and ZK each show strong potential. ARB offers a promising future due to its growing adoption. STRK benefits from its innovative approach. ZK stands out with its security features. Each presents unique opportunities.

The statement came in a new interpretive letter and accompanying memorandum published by the agency. According to the OCC, national banks and federal savings associations are legally allowed to provide crypto custody services, conduct certain stablecoin activities, and operate blockchain nodes. The move is expected to provide regulatory certainty for banks exploring digital asset services. “The OCC expects banks to have the same strong risk management controls in place to support new banking activities as they do for traditional banking activities,” Acting Comptroller of the Currency Rodney E. Hood said. Hood noted that the decision reduces regulatory burdens while ensuring consistent oversight of crypto-related banking activities.

Recent Pepe Price Prediction reports show potential for growth in 2025. However, some experts point to strong alternatives in XRP and RTX. They call these projects the best crypto to buy in tough markets. For RTX , the current DeFi coin price offers an interesting entry point. PEPE Price Prediction: A Meme Coin Under Pressure Pepe continues to gain strength through recent days while its value rose by 3% during the last 24 hours to reach $0.000007061. Numerous Pepe Price Prediction reports indicate this marks the start of future price growth. According to Experts PEPE stands ready to break out into the market. The Pepe Price Prediction indicates that the coin faces promising market conditions despite its past failures to satisfy increasing market requirements. According to Pepe price predictionreports the coin will increase by 223.74% to achieve a value of $0.00002304 by April 6. Multiple analysts have selected alternative cryptocurrencies which they believe will outperform PEPE during the year 2025. The payment network utilizes two major tokens named XRP and RTX because of their essential functions in global transactions. XRP: A Trusted Bridge in Global Finance The XRP market shows weak performance as its value has decreased by 8% to reach $2.39 during the last 24 hours. The market movement is interpreted differently between those who consider it a warning sign and those who view it as an attractive purchase opportunity. A segment of investors looks optimistically at the potential outcomes from the US crypto summit being held by President Donald Trump. XRP investors view the current market situation as an opportunity to purchase the token because they expect it to rise if all development plans succeed. The token's applications within traditional finance systems create value that strengthens its market price stability. The XRP token shows an anticipated 16.79% increase to reach $2.84 during April 6.

The decision to isolate him has raised concerns regarding the conditions of his incarceration and the broader implications for high-profile financial crime cases. Sources indicate that Bankman-Fried’s legal team has expressed concerns about his treatment, arguing that solitary confinement could severely impact his mental and physical well-being. His lawyers continue to advocate for improved conditions and fair treatment within the prison system. Media Attention and Public Reaction The situation has drawn significant public attention, particularly given the scale of the FTX collapse and the allegations surrounding Bankman-Fried’s financial misconduct. Discussions around his prison conditions have fueled debates on how high-profile white-collar criminals are treated within the justice system. Speculation has also arisen regarding the motivations behind his confinement, with some suggesting it is a precautionary measure due to the nature of his case, while others believe it reflects broader issues within the prison system. Legal and Judicial Developments Bankman-Fried’s legal battles continue as his defense team works to challenge aspects of his conviction and sentencing. The case remains a focal point in discussions about cryptocurrency regulation, financial accountability, and the consequences of corporate fraud.

This marks a significant change for the cryptocurrency industry, signaling a shift away from previous restrictions and offering more flexibility for banks to integrate digital assets into their operations. This move also follows growing industry calls to end policies such as Operation Choke Point 2.0, which had limited crypto-related banking activities. The new directive, known as Interpretive Letter 1183, allows banks to carry out these activities under the existing banking laws without needing to first receive a supervisory non-objection. While this change makes it easier for banks to engage with digital assets, the OCC stressed that banks must continue to maintain strong risk management controls similar to those in traditional banking. Rodney E. Hood, the acting Comptroller of the Currency, emphasized that these controls are necessary to ensure that new activities, like crypto custody, are supported with the same level of security and oversight as traditional financial services. The industry has largely welcomed the new regulations. Key figures, such as Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, celebrated the shift, expressing enthusiasm about banks using USDC and integrating the financial system with blockchain technology. Many analysts view the decision as a step forward in allowing U.S. banks to serve as validators on public networks, hold crypto assets for customers, and provide stablecoin services. This development could also encourage major financial institutions, such as Bank of America, to move forward with plans to launch their own stablecoins, a prospect previously delayed due to regulatory uncertainty. However, despite the optimistic reactions, some experts remain cautious. Caitlin Long, the CEO of Custodia Bank, pointed out that although the OCC’s guidance is a positive step, several hurdles remain. Specifically, she noted that the Federal Reserve and FDIC still have anti-crypto policies in place, which continue to create significant barriers for banks hoping to fully embrace digital asset services. Long referred to this situation as part of Operation Choke Point 2.0, which continues to affect banks, including Custodia Bank, that seek access to the Fed’s liquidity facilities. Ben El-Baz, a founding member of HashKey Group, took a more hopeful view, suggesting that the OCC's actions might encourage the Fed and FDIC to reconsider their stance on crypto. He argued that the OCC's move, while significant, could pave the way for further regulatory alignment across financial institutions. However, he acknowledged that it may take time for banks to fully adopt these changes, given the complexities of the regulatory environment. This shift by the OCC is a positive step for the cryptocurrency sector, but industry players will need to navigate ongoing regulatory challenges in order for banks to fully integrate digital assets into their services. While this development opens the door for greater crypto adoption in traditional banking, it is clear that full integration will depend on further regulatory changes and the resolution of remaining issues with the Fed and FDIC. The OCC’s new guidelines signal progress, but the path to seamless integration of crypto in the banking sector remains a work in progress . Ongoing regulatory challenges will shape the future of crypto adoption in U.S. banks . The full impact of these changes will unfold over time, depending on how the industry responds .",,EN,0,0,FIAT|BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY|USDC,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-08 16:57:27

The company is working with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. to explore the listing, which could take place as soon as this year. The move follows the resolution of regulatory issues, including the closure of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into the exchange, as noted by Cameron Winklevoss in a February post on X (formerly Twitter). Earlier this year, Gemini paid $5 million to settle a lawsuit with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a January filing showed. In February, the Winklevoss, brothers were in discussions with bankers about a potential listing, though no final decision had been made at the time . Today, the deliberations are still ongoing.

The Winklevoss twins, who rose to fame thanks to their legal battle with Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, were among approximately 30 crypto executives attending the Digital Assets Summit at the White House on Friday. The brothers, early adopters of Bitcoin, have a long-standing interest in promoting cryptocurrency adoption and innovation. Gemini, which operates offices in New York, Seattle, Singapore, London, and Dublin, has grown to more than 500 employees. Representatives for Gemini, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup declined to comment on the IPO plans. With the recent regulatory tailwinds, a successful Gemini IPO could signal a new wave of public offerings in the crypto sector, potentially attracting significant interest from investors eager to capitalize on the evolving digital assets landscape.

MUTM displays its potential beyond being a regular token through its current presale success which has gathered more than $2.4 million and obtained over 4,500 holders. The project maintains a price of $0.015 during its second presale phase which draws investors through its unique lending solution and promising return possibility. The question emerges about what features draw DOGE millionaires to MUTM since they choose this DeFi project. Mutuum Finance’s Unique Appeal The crypto market differentiates MUTM from other projects through its decentralized lending and borrowing services which actively serve real financial needs. Users who deposit their assets into MUTM access established financial services because the platform allows them to generate passive income by utilizing lending pools while creating the tokenized deposit representation of mtTokens. Users that deposit ETH into the system receive mtETH tokens that grow in value because of time-related interest accumulation. mtTokens from this system bring combined advantages of financial liquidity with their ability to function across DeFi platforms. The project maintains long-term stability through its secure lending system that exceeds the value of borrowed amounts. Borrowers need to supply assets with a value higher than their loan amount because this protects lenders from loss and guarantees loan repayment. Mutuum Finance has a built-in peer-to-peer (P2P) lending component which allows users to conduct negotiations directly for their loan conditions. The support for DOGE along with other unsupportable assets becomes feasible at this platform due to its particular lending pool capabilities. Presale Momentum and Investor Confidence The first stage of Mutuum Finance ’s presale achieved full depletion immediately after its launch. The current phase costing $0.015 attracts increased investor interest since it will go up to $0.02 before the next price rise. Participating in Mutuum Finance during its early phases allows investors to receive a 33% value increase if they keep their tokens until the next phase commences. Investors can access the highest possible return of 300% by purchasing Mutuum Finance tokens at their current listing value of $0.06. The project’s buy-and-redistribute approach accelerates its expansion. A segment of platform earnings is allocated to acquire MUTM tokens from the market, which are subsequently given to mtToken stakers. This establishes persistent buying pressure, guaranteeing enduring demand and price stability. With such a solid framework, it’s not surprising that DOGE whales are enhancing their investments with MUTM. Why DOGE Whales Are Investing in MUTM The meme-based cryptocurrency Dogecoin went through multiple value fluctuations since its inception. The creation of millionaires through Dogecoin exists alongside its lack of practical use which forces investors to consider stable investment opportunities. The MUTM platform delivers DeFi financial solutions with practical uses and shows promising advancement potential. The DOGE whales who excel at strategic planning view the structured tokenomics and innovative features of MUTM with great potential. The project generates passive income through its buy-and-redistribute model which makes it a better investment than speculative assets. The present presale value at $0.015 presents an exclusive opportunity to join MUTM at its initial development stage before its future market appreciation occurs. The Path Ahead for Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance continues to draw growing interest from investors as it conducts its presale phases. The forthcoming listing price will provide early backers substantial benefits at $0.06. Beyond its current potential exists even more value to explore. Analysts predict MUTM will reach $1.50 after its launch which represents an incredible 9,900% investment return for those who buy tokens at the present price of $0.015. Security measures as well as transparency initiatives make the project more attractive to users. Mutuum Finance works with an established auditing company to check their smart contracts which ensures users get access to a secure platform. Security assurances along with disruptive features make MUTM an outstanding choice within the DeFi sector. The MUTM token serves as an entry point to achieve long-lasting development within the crypto economy. MUTM has gained international investor interest through its distinctive lending model combined with buy-and-distribute features which has resulted in strong presale results that caught the attention of worldwide DOGE whales. Investors should act promptly to obtain positions within the revolutionary project since its presale momentum continues to build. Mutuum Finance represents a chance to participate in DeFi’s upcoming great success so make your investment in Mutuum Finance right now.

High-utility projects typically have more potential to grow than low-utility crypto projects. While established projects such as Cardano grow gradually, new upcoming utility projects have the potential to grow exponentially. Analysts have narrowed their focus on a new utility project that is set to outperform Cardano in the next 5 months. A new crypto project set to outperform Cardano in 2025 Smart contracting platforms such as Cardano form an integral part of the DeFi ecosystem. Smart contracts strengthen security and foster trust in financial transactions. Cardano is the first blockchain network to emerge as a result of scientific peer review and cryptographic research methods. The project launched in 2017 crediting its engineering to an Ethereum co-founder by the name Charles Hoskinson. Cardano quickly emerged in the spotlight and attracted investments from crypto enthusiasts. At the time of this publication, Cardano has a market capitalization of $29.6 billion and claims the 9th position among the top largest crypto projects by market capitalization. Despite Cardano’s contribution to the crypto ecosystem, analysts believe a new crypto project has a better return on investment than the established proof of stake blockchain. News about BinoFi’s presale has been spreading like wildfire. The DeFi project has a unique utility tied to a hybrid crypto exchange. Experts believe that the project will outperform Cardano’s performance in the next 5 months despite being in its early development stages. Cardano’s limitations drive investors to BinoFi’s presale Cardano is an established crypto project with a strong team behind its development. However, the protocol faces a lot of weaknesses that have recently drawn investors to BoniFi’s presale. Cardano exists in a highly competitive niche with general-purpose, smart contract, Proof-of-Stake blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, Cosmos, and others. On the other hand, BinoFi is a first-to-market crypto project pioneering the first hybrid cryptocurrency exchange. Unlike Cardano, BinoFi’s hybrid crypto exchange is the first digital asset exchange platform of its kind. The project is trekking in uncharted territory making it more attractive to investors. While Cardano aims to challenge Ethereum’s dominance in the space, BinoFi’s main goal is revolutionizing the trading environment for crypto traders and investors. Starting at $0.02, investors can purchase BinoFi’s native digital asset BINO. Although no one can accurately predict the future, a detailed analysis of the project’s long-term performance reveals that the project may experience an upsurge due to an influx of investors. BinoFi unveils the first hybrid crypto exchange platform for Web3 users BinoFi’s crypto exchange will reveal a more promising look for crypto adoption for both retail and institutional investors. The hybrid exchange combines liquidity from centralized order books and decentralized liquidity pools to ensure low slippage and optimal trading conditions. Additionally, users can choose between custodial and non-custodial execution depending on their preferences and risk appetite. The hybrid exchange leverages modern technology to automatically route orders to the most liquid market on its CEX order book or through on-chain DEX pools. This ensures optimum trading conditions are always met and users get the best price, lowest fees, and fastest execution. BinoFi’s presale will unlock generational wealth for early adopters. Buying and holding BINO tokens could make all the difference, especially for retail investors looking for projects with exponential growth potential.

Notably, prominent market analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted a critical market condition that could result in a market surge. Related Reading: Litecoin Holds Bullish Outlook As the MVRV Ratio Signals Strength – Analyst Ethereum’s Next Move: Price Rally To $3,260? Being the second largest cryptocurrency in the market, Ethereum’s price action remains important to traders, especially with the current doubts over an altseason. In an X post on March 7, Ali Martinez shared an insightful analysis of the ETH market based on the MVRV extreme deviation pricing bands drawn by analytics firm Glassnode. Generally, the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) metric is used to determine whether an asset is overvalued or undervalued. Meanwhile, the MVRV pricing bands offer insights into an asset’s valuation relative to historical price trends. These bands identify overbought or oversold conditions with deviation levels acting as critical resistance and support zones. According to Glassnode data shared by Martinez, the MVRV pricing bands suggest that Ethereum’s immediate challenge in any uptrend lies at the -0.5σ pricing band around $2,350. If ETH bulls can produce enough demand to reclaim this support level, it may propel further price gains according to patterns from previous market cycles. Martinez states that the initial possible price target for such a rally is the mean pricing band around $3,528 representing a potential 51.95% gain from ETH’s present market price. With a formidable bullish momentum, a further price gain is also possible with a potential target at the+1.0σ pricing band around $4,164. However, a failure to reclaim the support level at $2,350 could push ETH to a deeper correction than present. In such a scenario, Glassnode’s data reveals ETH could crash to around the -1.0σ pricing band at $1,444.

Furthermore, weekly losses stand at 4.77% contributing to a total decline of 23.58% in the past 30 days suggesting a dominant bearish sentiment among ETH traders. However, amid this price fall, Ethereum whales are showing much optimism with a strong accumulation behavior. According to more data shared by Martinez, these whales recently acquired 1.1 million ETH in 48 hours demonstrating their robust confidence in Ethereum’s potential for a future price appreciation. Meanwhile, 330,000 ETH have been moved off exchanges in another bullish move. In other developments, other analysts continue to speculate on the potential of an altseason. Renowned crypto expert Michael Van De Poppe has backed altseason to happen nudging investors to increase their exposure to “blue-chip altcoins”. Meanwhile, former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has referred market enthusiasts to the CoinMarketCap altseason index which is currently at 14 highly in favour of Bitcoin dominance.

This dip has accrued losses for SOL investors and holders, causing them to run frantically to DuragDoge ($DURAG) for gains. DuragDoge might be a new crypto, but it has quickly exceeded all expectations as it continues to deliver gains to holders amidst the crypto dip. DuragDoge is doing more than a meme coin should do by spicing things up with a mix of fun, utility, and an ultimate drip backed by $DURAG. The $DURAG token comes with many features that ensure holders and investors are constantly in the gain, which is why DuragDoge is recording one of the best crypto presales in the market. Read on to discover why SOL holders are turning to $DURAG for profits. Solana (SOL) Takes a Deep Crash as Whales Unstake Their Tokens Solana is feeling the heat of the crypto dip, with SOL’s price crashing by over 16% within the last 24 hours. Following the bearish sentiments, crypto whales are beginning to turn their backs on the SOL token. Lookonchain recently reported that a whale unstaked 79,530 SOL tokens, an amount equivalent to about $10.86 million, and based on the current situation, more whales might unstake their SOL tokens soon. A reason for SOL’s price crash might be the talks about token releases from the bankrupt FTX crypto exchange, which are set to happen this month, March. Investors and token holders fear the massive dump will cause SOL to lose value, resulting in more losses. This is making them doubt Solana’s future and prospects. Even crypto analysts are unsure about Solana’s future in the crypto market as SOL continues to plummet with each new day.

California resident Kenneth Gould, who ran a payroll services firm, has pleaded guilty to bank larceny after stealing $830,000 from the banking giant, reports FOX 26 News. Court documents show Gould executed fraudulent ACH payments from a client’s account to his own payroll company’s account at Wells Fargo, withdrawing the funds with cashier’s checks. Gould’s payroll services firm had a prior relationship with Wells Fargo where the bank would credit all or a portion of the payments to the receiving account before the ACH transfers clear. When Wells Fargo discovered that the sending account had insufficient funds to cover the transfers, it abruptly blocked the payments and tried to recover the money initially sent. But it was already too late. Gould promised Wells Fargo that he would return the funds, but he never did. In addition to a maximum 10-year sentence, Gould is facing a $250,000 fine. He is slated for sentencing on June 2nd.

Some critics even called out both him and Trump for directing billions of dollars to their own pockets and went as far as labeling their administration plans as a high-level heist. Sacks argued that all these accusations were very serious since they were alleging he committed a crime; nonetheless, he dismissed all of them, denouncing them as slander. He further stated that he sold all his crypto holdings before taking office to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest. He even argued that he could have waited and did not have to sell all his holdings as he did, but since the assets are prone to so many fluctuations, he chose to do so to avoid conspiracy theories springing up over his profits. Moreover, he claimed that he and his venture firm Craft liquidated roughly $200 million in crypto assets. He also withdrew from multiple crypto-focused investment funds, including Bitwise, Multicoin Capital, and Blockchain Capital. Kyle Samani, Co-Founder and Managing Partner at Multicoin Capital, even commented, “David understands the role he’s in. His team reached out to us a few months ago and found a buyer for Craft’s remaining Multicoin-related assets. David is above board, as you can be.” Sacks insists that he did not use his office for personal gain Sacks said it is a “lazy and stupid narrative” that people think someone who is already successful joins the government to be more successful. He said he was already making money before joining the government, adding that taking the czar position substantially disrupted his business interests. He argued that even in divesting, he has to either pay more taxes or take a significant discount that still costs money, claiming there’s no truth in people’s claims that he used his office for personal gain. He, however, claimed that he was pleased to serve his country, the people, and Donald Trump, regardless of how much he lost. Aside from claims that he used his office to manipulate his markets, some, like Senator Elizabeth Warren , have accused him of influencing Trump to choose altcoins, which he could benefit from to add to the digital asset stockpile. Sacks defended himself, saying Trump only picked XRP, SOL and ADA for the stockpile because of their high market caps. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Notably, as of press time, XRP was trading at $2.35, having plunged over 6% in the last 24 hours, while on the weekly timeframe, the asset has rallied almost 10%. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold The 50-day Simple Moving Average ( SMA ) is $2.64, slightly above the current price, while the 200-day SMA is significantly lower at $1.56, suggesting a longer-term upward trend. XRP’s 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) is 48.28, indicating a neutral market condition, neither overbought nor oversold. XRP’s next price breakout As things stand, the sentiment around XRP leans bearish , yet cryptocurrency trading expert Ali Martinez suggests the asset may be poised for a breakout. In an X post on March 7, he highlighted a chart pattern indicating a potential 23% price movement. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/Ali_charts Martinez noted that XRP is consolidating within a symmetrical triangle, a setup often linked to significant price shifts. The asset has been tracing higher lows and lower highs, narrowing toward the triangle’s upper edge, hinting at an impending decisive move. Whether XRP breaches the upper or lower trendline determines the breakout’s bullish or bearish direction. A symmetrical triangle typically triggers a price move that matches its initial height. Martinez estimates that a breakout above the upper line could push XRP to $3.00, while a drop below might drag it under $2. Meanwhile, Dark Defender’s analysis in an X post on March 8 pointed to a bullish Coffee Cup pattern that could push the XRP price as high as $44.22. This pattern, a U-shaped formation, suggests a major trend reversal after a prolonged downtrend. XRP price analysis chart. Source: Dark Defender According to Dark Defender, XRP has formed this structure since 2023, when the token was trading around $0.50. By integrating the Elliott Wave theory, the analysis paints a bullish picture of XRP’s future price movements. The third wave is projected to push the price between $5.85 and $18.22, followed by the fifth wave could send XRP soaring to $36. The full depth of the cup, combined with the momentum of the pattern, suggests a potential final target of $44.22. Such a price would place XRP’s market cap at $2.54 trillion, making the token the top-ranked digital asset if Bitcoin ( BTC ) stagnates. Currently, a key level to watch in this structure is $1.96, which acts as the formation’s neckline. A confirmed breakout above this resistance would validate the pattern and set the stage for a significant bullish run. XRP whale accumulation spikes Although XRP continues to face bearish pressure in the short term, there seems to be confidence in the token based on interest from whale investors. On March 6, Martinez shared data from the onchain cryptocurrency analytics platform Santiment , indicating that whales accumulated 90 million XRP tokens in 72 hours. Such an increase in whale transactions has often preceded notable price growth. Whales bought over 90 million $XRP in the last 72 hours! pic.twitter.com/lfE1k6UIdA — Ali (@ali_charts) March 6, 2025 XRP fundamentals Looking ahead, XRP’s price will likely be influenced by several factors, with the legal battle between Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) ranking at the top. A pivotal moment for XRP came in July 2023, when Judge Analisa Torres ruled it was not a security in retail transactions, though institutional sales violated securities laws. The SEC appealed in October, but with pro-crypto legislation gaining traction and President Donald Trump’s administration signaling a softer regulatory stance, analysts anticipate the appeal could be dropped by mid-2025. Adding to the bullish outlook, Trump’s March 2025 announcement of a multi-crypto reserve— Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), XRP , Solana ( SOL ), and Cardano ( ADA )—has sparked speculation about XRP’s role in U.S. financial strategy. Given its cross-border payment efficiency and RippleNet’s banking partnerships, inclusion in the reserve could reduce XRP’s circulating supply and boost institutional demand. Finally, the prospect of an XRP exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) could further drive institutional interest. With Bitwise’s filing in 2024 and Grayscale’s proposal acknowledged by the SEC, approval could unlock billions in inflows, pushing XRP’s price toward new highs.

According to a Bloomberg report , the company has confidentially filed for an initial public offering (IPO) and has enlisted financial giants Goldman Sachs and Citigroup to guide the process. Regulatory Clearance Paves the Way It’s worth stating that Gemini’s move for an IPO listing follows recent development regulatory decisions by the present that have eased some legal hurdles. Just like other firms such as coinbase, Kraken, and Uniswap, the SEC has dropped their legal cases against. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) concluded its investigation into Gemini without taking any enforcement action. Additionally, Gemini reached a $5 million settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) over a separate lawsuit. These latest decisions by the security agency and the CFTC simply show that a more favorable regulatory environment is on the radar in the American crypto market. Experts believe that this may have encouraged the company’s decision to explore public listing options. Growing Interest in Crypto IPOs Notably, Gemini is not the only organization considering a public debut. For context, several other leading crypto firms, including Kraken, Circle, Bullish, and Blockchain.com, are also preparing for potential U.S. listings. For instance, Kraken is reportedly eyeing an IPO by early 2026. This trend shows an important shift in market sentiment. Crypto companies are looking to leverage public funding opportunities amid reduced regulatory pressure. What This Means for the Industry The wave of IPO considerations among crypto firms signals a maturing industry eager to establish stronger ties with traditional financial markets. By going public, companies like Gemini strengthen their credibility, attract institutional investors, and secure long-term capital for expansion. However, challenges remain despite the easing regulatory stance, including market volatility and evolving compliance requirements. The success of these IPOs will likely shape the future trajectory of cryptocurrency businesses in the U.S. financial ecosystem. In addition, Singapore-based crypto mining rig manufacturer Bgin Blockchain Limited also filed for an initial public offering (IPO) in the United States. According to the filing they want to raise $50 million.

Positioned as a low-risk asset comparable to Ethereum or Bitcoin, RXS combines the reliability of real-world asset tokenization with the high-reward appeal of meme coins like Shiba Inu or PEPE. Since launching its presale in September 2024 at $0.03, RXS has surged 6.6x to $0.20 in its 12th and final stage. With over $46 million raised and 90.3% of presale tokens sold, Rexas Finance is drawing attention from retail investors and crypto whales alike. An AI model analyzing market patterns identifies RXS as a unique hybrid—grounded in tangible assets yet primed for rapid value growth. Rexas Finance Bridges Real-World Assets and Blockchain Rexas Finance is redefining ownership by tokenizing real-world assets like real estate, gold, and commodities. The global real estate market alone exceeds $300 trillion, while gold and commodities add trillions more. Rexas breaks geographical and financial barriers, allowing anyone to purchase full or fractional ownership of these assets through blockchain. Imagine a teacher in Nigeria owning a share of a Tokyo apartment or a student in Brazil investing in a Dubai hotel. The platform’s ERC-20 token standard ensures compatibility across major blockchain networks, while tools like the Rexas Token Builder let users convert physical assets into tradable tokens effortlessly. The Rexas Launchpad empowers entrepreneurs to raise funds by listing asset-backed tokens, while the Quickmint Bot simplifies token creation in seconds. With AI-driven features like Rexas GenAI (optimizing asset portfolios) and AI Shield (detecting fraud), the platform merges innovation with security. By removing intermediaries, Rexas cuts costs and democratizes access to high-value investments traditionally reserved for the wealthy. RXS Tokenomics Fuel Long-Term Growth Rexas Finance prioritizes sustainable growth through strategic token distribution. Of the 1 billion RXS tokens, 50% are allocated to the presale—a deliberate move to involve the public instead of relying on venture capital. Another 22.5% supports staking rewards, incentivizing holders to lock tokens and reduce market volatility. Liquidity pools (15%) and treasury reserves (10%) ensure trading stability and fund future developments. The remaining tokens cover marketing, partnerships, giveaways, and team incentives. The presale has sold 451,796,480 tokens (90.3% of its 500 million goal), reflecting massive demand. Early buyers at $0.03 have already seen 580% gains, while the confirmed listing price of $0.25 offers a 25% upside for current participants. Post-launch projections suggest RXS could reach double digits, delivering 50x returns from today’s price. Why Rexas Finance Stands Out in the Crypto Market Rexas Finance distinguishes itself through transparency and community focus. A CertiK audit verifies the integrity of its smart contracts, addressing security concerns common in newer projects. Listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko amplify visibility, placing RXS before 100 million monthly users. Plans to launch on three top-tier exchanges in 2025 will further boost liquidity and accessibility. The ongoing $1 million giveaway—offering 20 winners $50,000 each—has attracted 1.2 million entries, driving engagement. Participants submit ERC-20 wallet addresses, complete tasks, and earn bonus entries through referrals. This campaign not only rewards the community but also highlights Rexas’s commitment to decentralization. Seizing the Moment Before Presale Ends Rexas Finance is closing its presale soon, with a launch set to follow immediately. Analysts link its potential to Solana’s 2021 breakout, where early investors saw life-changing returns. The project’s fusion of real-world assets, AI tools, and fair tokenomics creates a compelling case for growth. For those seeking a balance between Ethereum’s stability and Shiba Inu’s upside, RXS offers a calculated entry point.

Without it, most crypto networks wouldn’t be able to secure their primary mechanism for security and transaction validation. That’s how important it is. Staking also ensures that validators have a financial incentive to act honestly, as their staked tokens can be slashed, either partially or fully, for engaging in malicious behavior or failure to perform their respective duties. Another key point is that staking is crucial for keeping blockchain ecosystems decentralized. It provides a structured way to reward participants for contributing to a network’s health and overall functionality. This article takes a deep dive into the best crypto staking platforms, each reviewed carefully by their functionalities and amount of assets supported. It also goes through the basics of staking and how to stake crypto in multiple ways. Quick Navigation What is DeFi Staking? Benefits of Crypto Staking Best Crypto Staking Platforms in 2025: Our Top Picks Jito – Solana’s Largest Liquid Staking Platform EigenLayer – The Restaking King Lido Staking Binance Earn Ethena – A Yield-Bearing Stablecoin Backed by Crypto How to Stake Crypto In a Few Steps Staking With Crypto Wallets Using a Staking Platform Node Staking Exchange Staking Frequently Asked Questions What Is DeFi Staking? Staking is the process of locking up cryptocurrency in a wallet to help secure and maintain a blockchain network that uses a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. In return for committing your tokens, you earn rewards—typically in the form of additional cryptocurrency. By staking, you contribute to the network’s security, validate transactions, and help create new blocks on the blockchain. In essence, staking incentivizes honest behavior. Users who stake their coins can gain rewards for supporting the network, while malicious or negligent validators risk having their tokens “slashed” (i.e., a portion of their stake is removed). This setup encourages active participation and maintains the blockchain’s integrity. Benefits of Crypto Staking There are several advantages to crypto staking, not just for users but also for blockchain networks and DeFi protocols: Passive yield generation: Staking allows you to earn rewards without selling cryptocurrency, creating a consistent passive income stream. If reinvested, these rewards can compound, boosting your overall returns. Higher returns: Depending on the blockchain and market environment, annual percentage yields (APYs) can range from single digits to over 20%, making them a more lucrative option than many conventional financial instruments. More accessibility and network support: Unlike PoW blockchains, staking requires no specialized hardware or heavy energy use because PoS networks only require relatively smaller amounts, making it accessible to a broad range of participants. Moreover, by locking up tokens, you help validate transactions on the blockchain, protecting it against threats like 51% attacks and maintaining long-term stability. This rewards users for their role in network health. Liquidity options: Liquid staking derivatives (Lido’s stETH, Rocket Pool’s rETH, etc) let you access your staked assets in DeFi while still earning staking rewards, providing flexibility for additional trading or lending activities. Restaking: Some popular protocols like EigenLayer allow you to “restake” your already-staked tokens, using them as collateral or deploying them in other staking systems. This strategy can compound yields further and increase engagement within the DeFi ecosystem. But, the biggest perk is that restaking allows DeFi projects to leverage the security and capital of already established networks. This will be explained further in the article, but for now, note that restaking is far more complex than traditional or liquid staking, requiring more responsibilities and technical knowledge to carry out the process. Best Crypto Staking Platforms in 2025: Our Top Picks Below are some of the best staking platforms, providing a comprehensive breakdown of their features, supported assets, and other important information. Jito – Solana’s Largest Liquid Staking Platform Jito is the largest liquid staking platform on the Solana blockchain. Participants stake SOL and receive JitoSOL in exchange, which is a liquid staking token (LST) that can be used in other Solana-based dApps. This allows users to lock their staked tokens but use a tokenized version in other DeFi projects to generate more yields. Image Source: Jito The project’s MEV approach—often controversial—has drawn attention. Some critics argue that MEV exploits traders by front-running orders or reordering transactions, while others see it as a way to improve market efficiency and ensure lenders are repaid. Jito tackles MEV by implementing an auction system where traders bid on profitable transaction sequences. Third-party block engines simulate these bids to identify the most valuable transaction groupings. The resulting profits are funneled back to validators and JitoSOL holders, effectively curbing spam benefits and increasing staking rewards. Key Features of Jito Liquid staking with JitoSOL : Users stake SOL and receive JitoSOL, representing their staked assets. JitoSOL can be deployed across DeFi (e.g., lending, trading, or liquidity pools) while continuing to earn staking rewards. MEV Integration : Jito captures MEV by optimizing transaction ordering within blocks, redistributing extra revenue to JitoSOL holders, and boosting overall staking yields. Full decentralization : The protocol’s governance token, JTO, grants holders voting rights on delegation strategies, treasury management, and protocol updates, while the Jito DAO ensures community-driven oversight. Security and transparency : Jito relies on audited smart contracts and delegates SOL to established validators within the Solana ecosystem. Governance by the Jito DAO further enhances transparency. Supported Assets Given Jito’s exclusive integration with the Solana blockchain, it only supports SOL tokens. EigenLayer – The Restaking King EigenLayer is a middleware protocol built on Ethereum that pioneered the idea of restaking, meaning you can deposit staked ETH (like stETH) into a new set of liquidity pools. These staked tokens are then distributed across various decentralized applications or AVS (Actively Validated Services), oracles, Layer 2s, data availability layers, cross-chain bridges, and more. Image Source: EigenLayer By doing so, EigenLayer allows these services to tap into Ethereum’s robust security without creating their own separate validator networks. Key Features of EigenLayer Restaking marketplace : In a sense, EigenLayer is a sort of marketplace where validators and protocols negotiate pooled security for a cost. Protocols can buy staked tokens or stETH as an “extra layer” of security. Meanwhile, validators can choose which protocols they want to secure, evaluating them for risk and reward. They also control how much staked capital is allocated, preventing overexposure to any single protocol. Flexible staking options: Users can opt for solo staking, run their own nodes, delegate their stake to third parties, and even perform dual staking, requiring both ETH and a native token to be staked. This way, the protocol welcomes more advanced validators, users, and developers. Programmability: Developers can customize validation rules and security parameters for their EigenLayer-based applications, allowing for more nuanced protection, including multi-token quorums tailored to specific risk profiles. Modular security : EigenLayer supports a modular approach, letting stakers secure specific functionalities or “modules,” such as decentralized storage, DeFi applications, or cross-chain bridges. This flexibility tailors security to each project’s unique requirements. Supported Assets EigenLayer only supports ETH, any ERC-20 token, and liquid staking tokens such as Lido’s stETH and Rocketpool’s rETH. Lido Staking Lido is the largest decentralized liquid staking platform in the industry, reaching a peak of roughly $40B in total value locked (TVL) in mid-2024, representing a massive share of the total DeFi TVL. Image Source: DefiLlama Lido’s appeal is straightforward: It allows users to earn staking rewards on various PoS cryptocurrencies without requiring them to unstake their assets. This makes Lido the pioneer of liquid staking: The protocol issues a tokenized version of ETH, stETH, which represents the staked assets. Users can deploy stETH across several DeFi projects in Ethereum, allowing them to earn additional yield on top of their staked assets. Key Features of Lido Liquid Staking : When you stake with Lido, you receive a derivative token, like stETH, on a 1:1 basis. Moreover, users can stake any amount of crypto, except for validators, which require the typical 32 ETH deposit. Validator Distribution: Staked tokens are spread across a network of professional validators chosen by the Lido DAO, reducing risks tied to validator downtime or slashing penalties. Open source and audited: Lido’s smart contracts are publicly available and regularly audited. Audits can be found on GitHub . Fee structure : Lido charges a 10% fee on staking rewards, which is shared between node operators and the Lido DAO treasury. Supported Assets Lido supports a wide variety of crypto assets, including: ETH is the most widely used staking option on Lido. Polygon (MATIC): Tokenized as stMATIC. Kusama (KSM): Tokenized as stKSM. Polkadot (DOT): Tokenized as stDOT. However, support for SOL was discontinued due to disagreements and community votes over unsustainable long-term fees on both blockchains. Binance Earn Binance Earn is a yield-focused offering within the Binance ecosystem, designed to help both novice and experienced investors earn passive income on their cryptocurrency holdings. Image Source: Binance Earn It serves as a one-stop solution for several investment products, championed by its extensive staking program, where users can choose Locked Staking, where they deposit their crypto for a set duration (e.g., 30, 60, or 90 days) to earn higher rewards. Key Features of Binance Earn DeFi and liquid staking : Connects users to external protocols, offering higher APYs but carrying general risks associated with using these DeFi platforms. Binance also supports ETH 2.0 Staking, enabling participants to stake Ethereum without operating their own validator node; in return, users receive BETH as a tokenized representation of their staked ETH. Savings products : Besides staking, Binance Earn provides Flexible Savings, which allows immediate access to funds but offers more modest interest rates. Locked Savings, on the other hand, require users to commit their assets for a predefined period in exchange for higher yields. Dual investment : The platform offers more advanced products like Dual Investment, a high-yield option involving two different cryptocurrencies with returns contingent on market conditions. BNB Vault: A popular feature for Binance Coin (BNB) holders. It combines blending staking, savings, and liquidity farming all in one to maximize returns on BNB holdings. Supported Assets Binance Earn supports over 180 cryptocurrencies up for staking, including major assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano, as well as stablecoins such as USDT and USDC. Ethena – A Yield-Bearing Stablecoin Backed by Crypto Ethena USDe is a synthetic dollar stablecoin built on Ethereum, designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the U.S. dollar through delta-neutral hedging and on-chain collateral. Image Source: Ethena.fi Launched by Ethena Labs, the platform offers a censorship-resistant alternative to traditional stablecoins. It is backed entirely by crypto assets such as ETH, BTC, and liquid staking derivatives. Key Features of Ethena USDe : Ethena’s USDe employs a delta-neutral hedging model to balance any fluctuations in the value of its underlying collateral. The protocol takes short positions on derivatives contracts to keep the stablecoin pegged at $1 without depending on fiat reserves or traditional custodians. Crypto collateral : All minted USDe is backed by on-chain cryptocurrencies, including ETH, stETH, BTC, and various other stablecoins. This maintains a consistent ratio of collateral to outstanding tokens. Yield-bearing token : One of Ethena’s most popular offerings is the ability to stake USDe to earn sUSDe, a yield-bearing derivative token that appreciates over time. All returns on investments are generated through 1) Ethereum staking rewards and 2) the funding spreads earned through delta-neutral derivatives positions. The staking process follows the ERC-4626 Token Vault standard . Insurance fund: Ethena is one of the few DeFi protocols to offer a reserve fund that acts as a buyer of last resort. This fund is a safety net in case of extreme scenarios, like negative funding rates or sudden market shocks. Supported Assets for Staking Ethena supports staking primarily with its native token, USDe. Upon staking, users receive sUSDe, which captures accumulated rewards from both derivatives funding spreads and Ethereum staking yields. How to Stake Crypto In a Few Steps There are several ways to stake crypto. But whichever way, you must first get a proper crypto wallet to begin your staking journey. You can look at our guide on the best DeFi wallets to analyze and compare some of the top options in 2025. Staking With Crypto Wallets Some crypto wallets like Trust Wallet, Exodus, and Phantom allow you to stake assets directly without leaving the app. For example, if you want to stake using the Phantom wallet , simply go to your account and choose an asset. Next, click on the asset and select Staking. Phantom offers two options: native staking, where you simply lock up assets in the Solana blockchain, and liquid staking using Jito. If you choose native staking, then you have to pick a validator. The Phantom Validator is the most popular due to its trustworthiness and security, but rewards are usually lower. Afterward, just enter the amount you wish to stake. Note that with native staking, your assets are locked, so you cannot use them across dApps for extra yield until the cooldown period ends. On the other hand, staking with Jito may result in bigger rewards and lower fees. Once you deposit your assets, you’ll get JitSOL, which you can use across DeFi protocols to win some extra rewards. Using a Staking Platform Using a crypto wallet, you can join a crypto staking pool where users deposit their funds to increase the chances of earning rewards. This is ideal for those with smaller amounts of crypto or who can’t meet minimum staking requirements in a given protocol. For example, if you want to stake ETH, you can simply go to Lido, choose the number of tokens you wish to stake, click on proceed, and, once you have done so, receive stETH tokens representing the staked amount. This allows you to use the tokenized version of your funds across Ethereum-based DeFi protocols. Image source: Lido Finance. Node Staking Node staking is more complicated and reserved for those who run a validator node on Solana or Ethereum. This means validators get to stake their own currency plus the currency of other liquid stakers. You earn rewards on your own staked assets and a commission fee based on the rewards your node generates for liquid stakers. One of the best pools for node staking is Rocketpool, one of the largest ETH staking pools. It requires at least 16 ETH to operate a node but comes with a 14% cut from rewards. Other platforms are StakeWise V3 and Marinade Finance for Solana users. Exchange Staking An alternative option would be centralized staking, in which exchanges like Binance or Coinbase handle the staking process on your behalf, simplifying the experience but requiring trust in their security measures. For instance, Binance Earn allows you to choose from different staking products, from popular cryptocurrencies to stablecoins, with different durations and APRs. Image source: Binance Earn. Frequently Asked Questions Can I Unstake My Assets? Yes, you can unstake assets after a cooldown period, which depends on the protocol you’re using. This is to prevent validators from immediately withdrawing their funds, which could allow malicious actors to avoid penalties, such as slashing. It also helps maintain economic stability by preventing large-scale, sudden withdrawals. What’s the Difference Between Native Staking and Liquid Staking? Native staking requires the user to lock assets to generate rewards. Meanwhile, Liquid staking platforms give users a tokenized version of their already staked assets, which can be used across different DeFi projects, boosting their earning potential. What Makes Restaking More Complex Than Traditional Staking? Restaking allows you to reuse already staked tokens as collateral in other protocols. This allows users to compound rewards while offering extra security for multiple decentralized applications and blockchain protocols. The issue is that restaking requires a lot of technical expertise in DeFi since the user is interacting with multiple smart contracts and DeFi projects and must manage a higher level of risk.

In a new announcement, Coinbase says it is onboarding the development team of layer-1 project Iron Fish ( IRON ) to help develop “privacy-preserving primitives” on Base, the crypto exchange’s proprietary blockchain. Coinbase highlights that it is not acquiring Iron Fish itself, its token or its technology. “Privacy isn’t just a feature, it’s a right – and it’s critical for unlocking the full potential of crypto. Today, we’re taking a major step toward that future by acquiring the team behind Iron Fish… This team brings a strong track record of helping builders by developing privacy-preserving tools and technology that are safe, accessible and compliance-friendly.” According to Coinbase, the Iron Fish team will help the firm establish new standards for privacy, make development easier for builders and reinforce anonymity for everyday users. “With the Iron Fish team joining Base, we’re making a long-term investment in privacy as a core pillar of the on-chain economy… Base’s scalability and privacy stack will help developers create the next generation of private, secure and compliant on-chain apps… Privacy tools will get easier to use, giving people more control while keeping transactions fast and low-cost. This means anyone can trade, transact and engage on-chain while protecting sensitive information.” Iron Fish, which launched in April 2023, is a privacy-focused proof-of-work blockchain backed by the asset management giant Andreessen Horowitz that encrypts every transaction with zero-knowledge (ZK) proof. IRON is trading for $0.266 at time of writing, a 9.5% decrease during the last 24 hours.

Gox Wallet to Cold Storage,https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-whale-transfers-large-amount-of-btc-from-mt-gox-wallet-to-cold-storage/,"Mt. Gox associated wallet moved 11,834 BTC to a new wallet address, while 166.5 BTC was sent to cold storage. The move comes as Mt. Gox continues to compensate victims of the 2011 exchange hack. The bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange has once again transferred large sums of Bitcoin . The transfers raise questions about the long-term repayment plans imposed upon the exchange. The cold wallet transfer was sent to a known Mt. Gox wallet, while the smaller transfer was sent to an unidentified wallet. Mt. Gox still has around 36,000 BTC, worth around $3 billion, located on wallets associated with the exchange. These large transactions broke a long period of idleness, with the last major transfer occurring in December 2024, totalling around $172 million. Mt. Gox extended its repayment deadline from October 31, 2024, to October 31, 2025, citing verification and processing requirements slowing down the process. Some creditors require fiat currency in repayments, while others prefer Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash. This transfer occurs just a month after the last one, which involved a smaller transfer of just 4 BTC from two internal wallets associated with Mt. Gox. While the reasons for these exact transactions remain unclear, they form a pattern of regular fund movements, most likely linked to the repayment scheme. In 2011, up to 950,000 BTC was stolen from the Mt. Gox exchange. Around 140,000 BTC was recovered, meaning that this amount, worth billions at today’s prices, could be returned to people who lost their money in the hack. Gregory Greene, one of the victims of the hack, filed a class action against Mt. Gox in 2014 not long after the exchange declared bankruptcy. His account had been frozen, so he could not access his $25,000 in Bitcoin. In 2011, two Russian nationals, Alexander Verner and Alexey Bilyuchenko, hacked Mt. Gox and extracted most of the crypto from it. Mt. Gox declared bankruptcy in 2014. Verner and Bilyuchenko accessed the users’ data and private keys owned by the exchange. Between 2011 and 2014 they funneled around 650,000 Bitcoins out of the Mt. Gox wallets. Around 300,000 BTC was funneled to the now-closed exchange BTC-E, which the FBI shut down in 2017.

But trends don’t last forever, and a turning point seems to be emerging. Increasingly, traders are stepping away from these meme-centric coins and turning their attention to BinoFi (BINO) . Offered at just $0.02, this token is offering something significantly more than memes—it’s delivering innovative tools, revolutionary features, and real potential for growth. What’s driving this shift? And why are traders betting on a project like BinoFi instead of sticking with their favored memes? The Appeal of Memecoins is Fading Memecoins have always operated on a simple principle: hype. Dogecoin’s rise to fame, backed by social media frenzy and mentions from high-profile figures, showcased how far memes can carry a coin. Pepe followed a similar trajectory, promising nothing more than amusement and speculative gains. For a while, it worked. People traded these coins with the hope that a tweet or viral moment would skyrocket their value. But memecoins are beginning to show their flaws. Their reliance on fleeting hype leaves them vulnerable to drastic price swings, a nightmare for traders seeking a semblance of stability. Add to that their lack of utility, most memecoins provide little to no functional value and it’s clear why some traders are looking for alternatives. PEPE, for example, saw explosive early growth, but without any real-world application or technological backbone, sustaining that momentum has proven nearly impossible. Similarly, while DOGE enjoys occasional spikes thanks to endorsements or nostalgia, its novelty has worn thin for those prioritizing purpose over gimmick. After all, hype may bring initial profits, but long-term sustainability and innovative features are what keep traders loyal. Memecoins don’t deliver on that front and BinoFi is stepping in to prove why it’s different. Why Traders Are Turning to BinoFi While memecoins rely on momentary trends, BinoFi is rooted in solving actual problems that traders face in the crypto world. Its hybrid exchange model, which bridges the divide between centralized and decentralized exchanges, is just one of the reasons traders are sitting up and taking notice. BinoFi turns what can feel like an overwhelming, fragmented trading experience into something smooth and efficient. By merging centralized exchange order books with decentralized liquidity pools, it ensures deep liquidity and faster transactions without forcing traders to compromise. No one in the market is offering this hybrid model quite like BinoFi. Even more exciting is its focus on cross-chain trading. Traditionally, moving funds between different blockchains has been a boring and complex process involving bridges, tools that often come with significant risk. BinoFi eliminates this hassle entirely through its cross-chain trading capabilities, which allow for direct swaps across multiple blockchains in one step. Less time wasted, fewer complications, and safer transactions, these are the kinds of features traders are looking for. Security is another major factor. Unlike memecoins, which aren’t exactly known for innovative development or advanced security, BinoFi is putting control into the hands of its users with Multi-Party Computation (MPC) wallets. The Value of Getting in Early The BinoFi presale is quickly capturing the spotlight in the crypto space, offering a golden opportunity for forward-thinking investors to get in. With the token priced at an attractive $0.02 in its current presale phase, early participants are positioning themselves ahead of a project set to revolutionize the trading industry. Those participating in early phases not only secure an exceptional entry point but also stand to benefit from some exclusive perks. These include reduced trading fees, priority access to staking rewards, and even early involvement in shaping the platform’s governance, a unique chance to influence the future of such a project. The potential for significant returns bolsters the word once BINO hits the mainstream market. Analysts are already projecting enormous growth, with estimates suggesting a staggering 9900% increase for those capitalizing on the presale’s discounted entry point. The listing price after the presale ends is $0,30 per token so even in case predictions don’t work, early supporters benefit from at least a massive 1200% growth of their investment. For crypto enthusiasts who recognize the power of early investments, the BinoFi presale is a huge opportunity. With the first phase filling up fast and excitement building across the community, now is the time to act and become part of what could be the next major success story in crypto. The Future is Looking to Utility, Not Memes While memecoins like DOGE and PEPE will always have their place as lighthearted pieces of crypto culture, their lack of utility makes them hard to justify as long-term investments. The days of investing in coins for memes alone seem to be waning. Traders are increasingly choosing projects like BinoFi that promise not just short-term gains, but lasting impact.

During the scandal, around $110 million was accumulated. Authorities seek international assistance to track down the transactions and freeze the assets. Taiano’s strategy includes blacklisting digital addresses to slow down the dispersion of funds across the world. He is also obtaining international warrants to obtain data from foreign cryptocurrency exchanges. He has further been collaborating with foreign agencies to investigate money laundering attempts. The focus will be on the Solana token $LIBRA, which suddenly jumped to a $2 billion market cap before losing 90% of its value. The token crashed after insider-related wallets withdrew at the height of the pump. Taiano is further investigating President Milei, obtaining phone logs and visitor records to the presidential offices. He is also investigating people close to Milei, especially those with cryptocurrency ties. The scandal has been called Libragate and there have been calls for Milei to be impeached. On February 14, Milei posted on X describing the Libra coin as promoting Argentine business and supporting new startups. He included a link to the token’s website and the Solana address for the token. One of the wallets associated with the pump and dump has transferred $4.5 million to a new address, with some funds allocated to the meme coin POPE. This could be an attempt at laundering the token. Authorities are investigating whether there are any legal frameworks in Argentina to prosecute insider trading. Alternatively, there could be a case that Milei was set up. It is not uncommon in politics for a hit job to occur so that Milei would face impeachment. What better way to set up the president than to take a photo with him and link him with a pump-and-dump scheme? Needless to say, the event has certainly embarrassed President Milei and instead of focusing on economic recovery, he is focusing on bad press.",Cryptocurrency|News|Argentina|Cryptocurrency News,EN,0,0,REGULATION|SOL|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-08 18:05:41

He argued that FTX was a legitimate service, and although there was a crisis, the company was still solvent. Bankman spoke candidly about his prison experience and shared his thoughts on crypto regulation under a Trump presidency. Tucker Carlson, a right-wing commentator, interviewed him on March 5. Although he did not ask Bankman whether he wished for a pardon from Trump, the conversation ultimately led to whether Bankman supported Democrats or Republicans. The interview occurred in a little side room in Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Centre. Bankman turned 33 on the day of the interview. He discussed details about his sharing a cell block with rapper Sean Combs. In November 2022, the FTX exchange filed for bankruptcy after suffering from liquidity issues due to its complete collapse. This led to U.S. criminal charges against Bankman and four executives, but only Bankman, Caroline Ellison, and Ryan Salame received prison time. “One fact that might be relevant”, said Bankman in the interview. “In 2020, I was center-left, and I gave to Biden’s campaign. I was optimistic he’d be a sort of solid center-left president. I spent the next few years in D.C. a lot. I made dozens of trips there and was really, really shocked by what I saw – not in a good direction – from the administration”. “By late 2022, I was giving to Republicans privately as much as Democrats. And that started becoming known right around FTX’s collapse, so that probably played a role”. Bankman described prison life as “dystopian” and lamented that every day seems to be the same with one day melding with the next. He also said that he feels safe in prison and that the only issue concerning him is getting enough time to prepare his legal cases. He spends most of his time reading books, playing chess with other inmates, and working on his legal case. He describes prison life as soul-crushing because there are few meaningful activities. Bankman gave over $30 million to support predominantly Democratic causes, making him the second-largest contributor to the 2022 midterm election. He is currently waiting for an appeal in Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Centre. He mainly eats rice and beans and laments that no former FTX employees have visited him. Lewis Kaplan, U.S. District Judge, presided over Bankman’s case, and also presided over Jean Carroll’s case against Trump, who successfully sued the president for defamation. “I know President Trump had a lot of frustrations with Judge Kaplan. I certainly did as well”, said Bankman in a separate prison interview with the Sun. In August 2023, the indictment read that Bankman “misappropriated and embezzled FTX customer deposits, and used billions of dollars in stolen funds for a variety of purposes, including to help fund over a hundred million dollars in campaign contributions to Democrats and Republicans to seek to influence cryptocurrency regulation”. However, Bankman showed a lack of remorse in his interview with Tucker Carlson, failing to acknowledge the pain he caused his customers by using their deposits to cover his trading losses in his investment firm. He preferred to focus on his ties with the republican party to gain favor with Trump. Bankman may alternatively argue that banks often use deposits to invest in assets. He has indicated that he plans to appeal the case and may make such arguments at a later date. He further criticised SEC chairman Gary Gensler, claiming he was politically biased and sought power simply by blocking crypto industries. The SEC has recently dropped cases against Bankman’s colleagues. Gensler has also dropped out of the SEC, ending his four-year war against crypto. President Trump has taken a positive approach to regulating the crypto industry. Bankman suggested that he may not be able to survive his entire sentence. He pointed out that studies show that one ages at 3 times the rate when living in prison. “The hardest thing is just not having something meaningful to be doing in here. There are studies, no idea how good they are, but they show you age at roughly three times the normal rate in prison. So you know, you have three times 25 to my 32 years when I was convicted. That gets you an answer, maybe”.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News|FTX,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-08 18:09:42

Known for its dominance in decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts, Ethereum has long been a pillar of the crypto ecosystem. However, the sudden crash has prompted many to rethink their strategies, looking for potential alternatives that offer innovation without the hefty price tag. Enter BinoFi (BINO) , a new player causing waves in the market. Experts are increasingly pointing to BinoFi as the best alternative for those looking to diversify their portfolios or reposition their investments in the face of Ethereum’s struggles. Why Ethereum’s Crash Has Investors Looking Elsewhere Ethereum’s decline to the $2000 point has brought up serious questions about its market stability. Part of the issue stems from mounting concerns about scalability, even after the much-anticipated Ethereum upgrade. With competition from newer blockchains that offer faster speeds and lower costs, Ethereum’s once unshakable position now seems more vulnerable. For smaller investors, Ethereum’s high token price is another barrier. Owning even a fraction of an ETH feels unattainable for some, especially when they seek assets with a higher potential for exponential gains. Combined with ongoing volatility and fears of losing market dominance, Ethereum’s recent crash has sparked a search for alternatives that combine accessibility with innovation. This is where BinoFi steps into the spotlight. Offering solutions to many of the issues plaguing current crypto giants, BinoFi has become a discussion theme among investors looking for the “next big thing.” BinoFi: The Next Big Crypto Project At the heart of BinoFi’s appeal is its revolutionary hybrid cryptocurrency exchange . The platform is expertly crafted to tackle the divide between centralized exchanges (CEXs) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs), blending their strengths while eliminating common weaknesses. Unlike traditional trading platforms, BinoFi uses a hybrid liquidity model. By integrating centralized order books with decentralized liquidity pools, traders benefit from low slippage, faster transaction times, and better pricing. It’s a system designed to cater to both retail investors and institutions, creating an efficient trading environment that bridges gaps in the market. What sets BinoFi even further apart is its focus on cross-chain trading. Unlike Ethereum, which relies heavily on wrapped tokens and bridges, BinoFi enables direct trading across multiple blockchains. This not only simplifies the process but also significantly reduces transaction costs. BinoFi was recently listed on CoinMarketCap. This milestone has placed BinoFi firmly in the spotlight, signaling to investors worldwide that the project has passed rigorous scrutiny and is ready for broader adoption. BinoFi’s Presale and Future Potential While BinoFi’s innovative features make it a standout, its ongoing presale is fast becoming the talk of the crypto community. At just $0.02 per token, the potential for breathtaking returns is hard to ignore. Analysts are increasingly bullish about BinoFi’s trajectory. Some have predicted that the token could climb to $1.00 by the end of the year. For early investors, this represents a staggering 50x return—a 5,000% increase from the presale price. Beyond these short-term gains, the project’s roadmap promises even greater rewards. For investors frustrated by Ethereum’s stagnation, BinoFi represents not just an alternative but a leap forward in technology and investment potential. The Verdict Ethereum’s crash to the $2000 mark has served as a wake-up call for many in the crypto space. While it remains a significant player, its current challenges highlight the need for diversification and innovation. For those seeking alternatives, BinoFi isn’t just a substitute—it’s a reimagining of what crypto trading can be.

Momentum behind the initiative has been growing rapidly, with a Change.org petition directed at Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein surpassing 16,666 signatures as of press time. Meanwhile, influential SHIB group “Shibzens” have recently outlined compelling reasons why SHIB deserves ETF status, drawing parallels to the recent success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. As per the group, one of the strongest arguments for a SHIB ETF is the cryptocurrency’s massive and highly engaged community. With millions of holders actively participating in the SHIB ecosystem, it argued that the token enjoys a loyal user base that could drive demand, liquidity, and long-term price stability, key factors for a successful ETF. Shiba Inu’s Layer-2 blockchain, Shibarium, further strengthens its case. Since its launch in August 2023, the group emphasized that Shibarium has introduced real-world utility by powering decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, gaming projects, and payment solutions. The network also supports ecosystem tokens like BONE, used for gas fees, and TREAT, which could be incorporated into a diversified SHIB ETF , expanding its investment appeal. Another major factor is affordability. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, which can be expensive for small investors, SHIB’s low price per token makes it an accessible entry point for retail traders. This inclusivity allows a broader investor base to gain crypto exposure, while SHIB’s high trading volume and strong liquidity provide a solid foundation for institutional ETF products. A SHIB ETF could also align with Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investment strategies. The Shib Karma Foundation, a philanthropic initiative within the SHIB ecosystem, highlights the community’s commitment to social good. Additionally, SHIB’s growing adoption across industries, including gaming and payments, demonstrates its increasing real-world relevance and utility. This push comes amid significant political and institutional shifts that signal a growing acceptance of cryptocurrency, further strengthening the case for a SHIB ETF. Former U.S. President Donald Trump recently acknowledged major digital assets like XRP, Solana, and Cardano, fueling speculation that increased regulatory clarity could benefit altcoins like SHIB . On Friday, the President hosted the first-ever White House Crypto Summit, bringing together key figures in the crypto industry. Among them was Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, a well-known advocate for meme-based assets whose involvement has further bolstered optimism. The SHIB community led by lead developer Shytoshi Kusama have expressed optimism that Tenev could play a role in advocating for the inclusion of meme coins like SHIB and Dogecoin in the discussions. That said, while BlackRock and Grayscale have yet to submit a formal application for a SHIB ETF, the precedent set by Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs proves that crypto-based investment products are viable. With strong community backing, increasing adoption, and favorable market trends, Shibizens believe SHIB is next in line.",Cryptocurrency|Featured|News|SHIB|SHIBA INU,EN,0,0,SHIB|BTC|ETH|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-08 18:21:10

President Gianni Infantino spoke about this idea at the White House Crypto Summit on March 7. He expressed FIFA’s interest in creating a digital token that could connect with billions of soccer fans worldwide. This shows that FIFA is interested in using blockchain technology to connect better with fans. However, Infantino did not share many details or say when the project would start. His short speech suggested that FIFA wants to enter the digital world in a big way. The FIFA Big Cryptocurrency Move FIFA plans to launch a digital token in the U.S. to connect with billions of soccer fans. President Trump welcomed the idea, saying the FIFA coin could become valuable. His comment highlighted how digital assets could impact sports and other industries. The token could allow fans to buy tickets, merchandise, and exclusive content, making transactions easier before the 2026 World Cup in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. However, FIFA has not yet shared the full details of the project. Infantino’s statement suggests FIFA is exploring cryptocurrency as part of soccer’s future, which could change how fans engage with the sport. Meanwhile, the White House Crypto Summit introduced major regulatory changes under President Trump. One key plan discussed was the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . The government plans to hold Bitcoin (BTC) and other crypto assets without using taxpayer money. UnRelated FIFA Coin Saw Unexpected Surge Infantino’s statement had an immediate effect on the crypto market. Soon after his speech, a digital asset named “FIFA” skyrocketed by 357,000%. It reached a market value of about $8.2 million in just one day. However, this coin is not connected to the FIFA soccer organization. The price increased because investors were confused and thought the coin was attached to the soccer organization. FIFA’s Growing Interest in Crypto and Blockchain Initiatives Over the years, FIFA has partnered with crypto initiatives and leveraged blockchain platforms to connect with fans and improve its operations. In 2022, the organization created its first Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs) collections , dubbed FIFA + Collect, utilizing the Algorand blockchain technology, its official blockchain platform for the organization . In late November, FIFA announced a partnership with Mythical Games to develop “FIFA Rivals,” a free mobile soccer game that uses blockchain technology. The game will launch later in 2025 and let players create and manage teams while owning unique digital items.

The ongoing wave of optimism surrounding Ethereum (ETH) stems from developers solving a crucial problem on the Sepolia testnet as they prepare to implement its Pectra upgrade. Deadlock Finance (MUTM) demonstrates rapid market growth through its new decentralized financial services approach alongside a presale that has collected $2.4 million up to this point. MUTM offers tremendous potential for early investors to earn up to 400% return since it currently holds 4,500 holders while trading at $0.015. Ethereum’s Technical Breakthrough and Price Potential The recent technical advancements made by Ethereum attracted greater investor belief. The Sepolia testnet developers resolved a transaction processing halt which marked an essential stage for preparing the Pectra network update. A recent fix instigated market analysts to anticipate ETH prices reaching between $3,000 and $4,000. Crypto analyst Ali Charts reports that Ethereum’s price is currently testing the support line of its parallel channel and investors believe a successful rally will start when Ethereum regains the $2,350 level. The CME price gaps at $2,600 together with $3,000 have proven significant in validating an upcoming price increase. Industries seeking Ethereum as well as market reinflation support its upward trajectory and make it a crucial component for the 2025 bull market. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Success and Unique Value Proposition The groundbreaking DeFi model of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gathers increasing attention as Ethereum strengthens its position on the market. The second stage of MUTM presale currently offers investors an opportunity to acquire tokens at $0.015 with expectations for a future listing value of $0.06. The price has the potential to increase by 400% for current buyers of MUTM. Mutuum Finance showcases distinctive strength through its decentralized lending and borrowing platform that lets users acquire passive earnings using mtTokens. The user deposits which are represented by mtTokens increase their value as interest builds up over time and users can utilize these tokens within multiple DeFi platforms thus powering up the ecosystem. The platform’s buy-and-distribute protocol generates lasting homeowner rewards through constant market buying activities. Mutuum Finance Excels Mutuum Finance stands out as a remarkable DeFi project thanks to its successful presale and its innovative features and dealer buy-and-distribute mechanism. MUTM commands extensive demand because it already collected $2.4 million dollars and gained 4,500 holders during its rollout. Users benefit from a safe lending platform supported by its overcomplementary funds structure and adaptable borrowing features that include peer-to-peer financing and responsive interest rates. MUTM tokens acquire long-lasting market demand through its buy-and-distribute system which makes them an ideal selection for investors dedicated to steady returns. Experts believe that the MUTM token price will hit $1.50 after its launch and early investors stand to earn 9,900% profit. The upcoming 2025 bull cycle presents Ethereum along with Mutuum Finance as the leading elements in the cryptocurrency domain. Ethereum provides investors with dependable storage value along with high price growth potential while Mutuum Finance stands as an appealing high-growth opportunity because of its DeFi model and successful presale. Shiba Inu remains susceptible to market changes because its low utility and speculative investment model fails to offer practical applications which the competitive marketplace now demands. For investors looking to capitalize on the next big wave in crypto, Ethereum and Mutuum Finance offer the best prospects for substantial returns. Don’t miss out on the opportunity to invest in MUTM at its current presale price of $0.015—this is your chance to be part of a project set to redefine DeFi in 2025.

Bulls have struggled to regain momentum, and market sentiment suggests that the crypto market is not in a healthy condition for a strong recovery. As uncertainty continues, investors remain cautious, watching for signals of a potential trend shift. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Key Support Amid Volatility – Can Bulls Break $2.3K To Regain Momentum? However, despite the bearish outlook, some analysts believe that this correction could be nearing its end. Many are now looking for key technical confirmations that could indicate a reversal or breakout in the near future. A top crypto analyst, Ali Martinez, shared a technical analysis on X, revealing that Solana remains in consolidation within a wide range pattern. This type of formation often suggests increasing volatility before a potential breakout to higher prices. If SOL follows the historical behavior of this pattern, it could be positioning for a significant move upward once market conditions stabilize. With Solana hovering near crucial price levels, the coming days will be key in determining whether bulls can reclaim control or if further downside awaits. Traders are now watching for a decisive breakout or another leg down before making their next move. Solana Struggles Around Crucial Demand Solana is struggling to hold the $140 support level after failing to reclaim higher price levels, keeping sentiment bearish as price action continues in a downtrend. Analysts remain cautious, warning that SOL could see further declines unless bulls regain control and establish stronger momentum. The past few weeks have been marked by unpredictable events, adding to the market’s uncertainty. The ongoing trade war developments between the United States, Mexico, Canada, and China have put additional pressure on financial markets, including crypto assets like Solana. Meanwhile, President Trump’s executive order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve had an underwhelming effect on the market, failing to generate the bullish reaction many investors had hoped for. Despite these challenges, some technical indicators suggest that Solana may be gearing up for a significant move. Martinez’s analysis highlights that SOL remains in consolidation within a right-angled ascending broadening pattern. Historically, this formation has led to high volatility and a breakout in either direction, hinting that a major price move could be coming soon. If Solana breaks below $140, it could trigger a deeper correction, further reinforcing the bearish trend. However, if bulls manage to push SOL above key resistance levels, it could reverse the downtrend and set the stage for a strong recovery rally. Related Reading: Litecoin Holds Bullish Outlook As the MVRV Ratio Signals Strength – Analyst For now, traders are closely monitoring SOL’s price action, waiting for a decisive move that could determine its next major trend. The coming days will be crucial in assessing whether Solana can stabilize and rebound or face further downside pressure. Solana Battles To Hold Ground At Lower Levels Solana is currently trading at $139 after failing to reclaim the 200-day Moving Average (MA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which sit around the $184-$186 resistance zone. The inability to break above these critical levels has left bulls in trouble, as SOL struggles to hold the $140 support and now risks setting fresh lows below $125. The bearish momentum has kept SOL under pressure, with price action confirming a continued downtrend. If sellers gain more control and $140 fails to hold, a breakdown below $125 could trigger further downside, forcing SOL into lower demand zones. However, despite the current weakness, there’s still a chance for recovery. If bulls can push SOL back above $180, reclaiming this critical level could shift market sentiment and trigger a strong recovery move. A decisive breakout above this zone would invalidate the bearish outlook, signaling a potential push toward higher resistance levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Gain Momentum For A Move To $150,000 If Bulls Reclaim This Level – Details For now, traders are watching closely to see whether Solana can hold its key support or if another leg down is inevitable.

This regulatory shift, announced on Friday, paves the way for a surge in institutional investment, potentially driving significant adoption and growth for major crypto assets like XRP, Ethereum , Bitcoin , Cardano , and others. Notably, the OCC, the chief regulator of national banks, has historically fluctuated in its stance on crypto, depending on leadership. Under President Trump’s first administration, crypto-friendly policies flourished, particularly during Brian Brooks’ tenure, encouraging institutional participation. However, this progress was partially reversed by Michael Hsu, who enforced stricter oversight on digital assets. With a pro-crypto administration in place, the latest letter thus signals a return to a pro-blockchain stance. By eliminating the requirement for banks to obtain special approvals for crypto activities, the OCC has streamlined financial institutions’ path to blockchain adoption. “ This letter reaffirms that crypto-asset custody, distributed ledger, and stablecoin activities discussed in prior letters are permissible,” stated acting OCC Chair Rodney Hood in the announcement . “ This rescission is intended to reduce burden, encourage responsible innovation, and enhance transparency. The rescission will also ensure that bank activities will be treated consistently, regardless of the underlying technology.” That said, this policy shift could be transformative for XRP and Ripple, whose XRP Ledger (XRPL) is designed for high-speed, low-cost cross-border transactions. Ripple’s recent launch of the RLUSD stablecoin aligns seamlessly with the OCC’s pro-crypto stance, positioning XRP as an attractive option for banks looking to integrate blockchain-based payment solutions. With financial institutions now authorized to hold and operate digital assets, XRPL adoption could surge, boosting XRP’s utility and demand. Ethereum and Bitcoin are also set to benefit. Ethereum’s extensive smart contract ecosystem could see increased institutional adoption as banks explore blockchain-powered financial products. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s role as a store of value may strengthen under clearer regulatory guidelines for bank custody and transactions. The OCC’s decision comes amid a broader federal push toward embracing crypto. President Trump’s recent executive order on digital assets underscores a pro-blockchain stance, while his nomination of Jonathan Gould, a former Bitfury lawyer, to lead the OCC signals a continuation of policies favoring blockchain innovation. Moreover, major financial institutions are already responding to the shift. Bank of America is preparing to launch a stablecoin on Ethereum, highlighting the network’s banking relevance. JPMorgan Chase is exploring stablecoin integration alongside its digital deposit tokens. Meanwhile, UK-based fintech firm Revolut is considering issuing its stablecoin and expanding its crypto-friendly offerings.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Ethereum News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,XRP|ETH|BTC|FIAT|WALLET,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-08 18:30:45

This is a huge deal,” he said. The move signals that the U.S. is recognizing Bitcoin’s role as a strategic financial asset, which could have far-reaching geopolitical and economic consequences. Beyond the Bitcoin reserve, the billionaire specifically highlighted the impact of regulatory changes that allow banks to participate in the crypto ecosystem. “Allowing banks to participate will greatly increase institutional adoption. That could be more important than the reserve,” he said. The integration of traditional financial institutions into the crypto space could accelerate mainstream adoption, paving the way for greater liquidity and stability. One of the key takeaways from Novogratz’s analysis was that the Treasury Department has endorsed dollar-backed stablecoins as a tool to protect the dollar’s status as the global reserve currency. “Hearing the Treasury Secretary talk about the importance of dollar-backed stablecoins to ensure that the dollar remains the world’s reserve currency tells me that we have a team that understands that. It’s very bullish,” Novogratz said. Related News: After Donald Trump's Statements Yesterday, The First Cryptocurrency-Friendly Move Came From a US Federal Agency Despite his long-term bullish outlook, Novogratz acknowledged the hurdles facing the crypto market in 2025. He cited the enthusiastic fourth rally of 2024 that peaked during the presidential inauguration and resulted in an overheated market. He also mentioned several factors contributing to the current price stagnation: The lack of a new transformative Web3 application that drives mainstream adoption. The collapse of the memecoin craze, especially TRUMP Coin. A shift in global investment flows, with Chinese tech stocks like Alibaba significantly outperforming crypto assets. A sell-off in US stock markets as investors turn to Chinese and European markets. Novogratz provided insight into Bitcoin’s price trajectory going forward. He noted that Bitcoin needs to reclaim $91,000 to gain upward momentum, while the current trading range remains between $75,000 and $90,000. He also noted that individual investor participation is important for a broader market recovery. “The rest of crypto needs an army of individuals. What I know is, every time you think they’re gone, they come back. We need to see that for the market to turn around,” he said. Meanwhile, he expects Ethereum (ETH) to find support at $2,000, a critical level to maintain confidence in the broader altcoin market. Despite short-term market volatility, Novogratz maintains a bullish outlook for the medium to long term. *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin (BTC) Finds Support at $86,000 after Volatile Week Bitcoin’s price has experienced significant volatility over the past week, influenced by various economic and political developments. As of Saturday, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $86,000, reflecting a 7% decline from its peak earlier in the week. Several key factors have contributed to this price movement, including President Donald Trump’s announcement of a strategic cryptocurrency reserve, the implementation of new tariffs, the outcomes of a White House summit on digital assets, and the latest U.S. Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report. 1. Trump Announces Strategic Cryptocurrency Reserve On March 2, President Trump unveiled plans for a U.S. strategic cryptocurrency reserve, dubbed the “Digital Fort Knox,” aiming to bolster the nation’s position in the digital asset space. This reserve is set to include major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). Bitcoin Price Action, March 8, 2025 The announcement led to a swift market reaction, with Bitcoin surging 13% moving from local lows around $78,200 to hit a monthly time frame peak of $95,000 within 48 hours of Trump’s crypto strategic reserve announcement . Altcoins like XRP and Cardano saw even more substantial gains, with XRP rising by 40% and Cardano doubling in value. While the inclusion of altcoins sparked debate among Bitcoin purists, the administration defended the decision as a move to support a diverse range of blockchain projects. However, further market events prompted short-term traders to take profits, causing Bitcoin’s momentum to record 4 consecutive losing days as the week unfolded. 2) Implementation of New Tariffs Introduces Volatility On March 3, President Trump announced a 25% blanket tariff on all imports from China and Mexico, aiming to protect domestic industries. This policy shift rattled global financial markets, leading to a sharp sell-off in risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin’s price retraced its earlier gains, dipping to a weekly low of $81,400 by March 4. In response to retaliatory measures from the affected countries and domestic pushback, the administration partially rolled back the tariffs. On March 6, the U.S. Secretary of Commerce announced exemptions for Mexican imports and a one-month delay for auto import tariffs. This policy reversal provided a relief rally for Bitcoin, as BTC closed trading above the $89,000 mark on Thursday. 3) White House Summit on Digital Assets The week ended with the White House Crypto Summit , where industry leaders and policymakers convened at Washington to discuss the future of cryptocurrencies in the U.S. Prior to the summit, David Sacks, the administration’s crypto and AI policy advisor, criticized the previous administration for missing out on potential profits from seized Bitcoin assets. He highlighted that the government currently holds approximately 200,000 BTC, valued at over $17 billion, acquired through legal seizures. During the summit, President Trump signed an executive order to formalize the creation of the “Digital Fort Knox,” reinforcing the administration’s commitment to integrating cryptocurrencies into the national financial infrastructure. However, the lack of immediate actionable policies led to a 4% decline in Bitcoin’s value post-summit, reflecting market disappointment over the absence of concrete regulatory framework. 4) Impact of Non-Farm Payrolls Report The latest U.S. Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report, released on March 7, revealed an increase in unemployment rates, raising concerns about persistent inflation and the potential for more aggressive monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve. These macroeconomic factors have added downward pressure on Bitcoin, as investors reassess risk exposures in light of potential interest rate hikes. Bitcoin Price Outlook: Bulls must hold $85,000 Support to Maintain Upside Prospects BTC price stabilization around the $86,000 level suggests a consolidation phase as the market digests recent developments. Traders will closely monitor upcoming economic indicators, Federal Reserve communications, and any further policy announcements related to digital assets will likely dictate the next directional move in the coming days. Bitcoin price forecast signals on the the 12-hour chart shows Bitcoin trading within a tight range, with Bollinger Bands compressing, indicating lower volatility. The price hovers near the 50-day moving average, acting as immediate support, while the upper Bollinger Band at $93,822 serves as resistance. Bitcoin Price Forecast Momentum indicators suggest mixed signals. The MACD histogram shows declining bullish momentum, with the signal line approaching a bearish crossover. However, the overall structure remains intact, as long as Bitcoin holds above $85,000. A break below this level could trigger further downside towards $80,800, the lower Bollinger Band, while a rebound could send Bitcoin toward the $87,346 mid-band resistance before a possible push to the $90,000 psychological level. Leverage remains a key factor, with increased open interest potentially amplifying Bitcoin’s next move. Traders should watch volume trends and liquidity imbalances, as a sharp liquidation event could define the next major price swing.

Speaking at the first-ever White House Crypto Summit on Friday, Trump declared his ambition to make the United States the “Bitcoin superpower of the world and the crypto capital of the planet” emphasizing that his administration is taking historic steps to realize this vision. “As you know, around the table yesterday, I signed an executive order officially creating our Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,” Trump stated . “ This will be a virtual Fort Knox for digital gold, housed within the U.S. Treasury. That’s a big thing.” Notably, the U.S. government holds nearly 200,000 Bitcoin, seized through civil forfeitures and enforcement actions. Trump made it clear that these holdings would form the foundation of the newly established reserve while blasting the Biden administration’s decision to liquidate tens of thousands of Bitcoin in recent years. “Unfortunately, in recent years, the U.S. government has foolishly sold tens of thousands of additional Bitcoin worth billions and billions of dollars,” Trump said. “ From this day on, America will follow the rule that every Bitcoiner knows well: Never sell your Bitcoin. That’s a little phrase they have…so far, it’s been right, so let’s keep it that way.” To reinforce this long-term Bitcoin strategy, Trump has directed the Treasury and Commerce Departments to explore ways of accumulating additional Bitcoin holdings, without imposing costs on taxpayers. His executive order also mandates a federal inventory of all government-held crypto assets, with plans to consolidate them into a newly created U.S. digital asset stockpile. Beyond securing Bitcoin reserves, Trump aimed at what he described as the Biden administration’s hostility toward the crypto industry. He accused regulators of targeting crypto businesses and blocking financial institutions from facilitating crypto transactions. “All of that will soon be over. We are ending Operation Choke Point 2.0 ,” Trump asserted, referring to alleged regulatory efforts to stifle the crypto sector. He also supported lawmakers drafting legislation to provide regulatory clarity for stablecoins and digital assets, calling it a “tremendous opportunity for economic growth and innovation.” Trump’s move comes amid reports that China is considering establishing its own Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. According to Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey, Beijing began closed-door meetings shortly after the November 2024 U.S. elections. While the Chinese government has yet to make an official announcement, Bailey claims several influential Bitcoin advocates are involved in discussions. Meanwhile, Deputy Anton Gorelkin says the establishment of a strategic reserve of cryptocurrencies (SBR) is “not yet being discussed” at the state level in Russia. That said, creating a U.S. Bitcoin reserve marks a significant shift in how governments view digital assets, potentially accelerating Bitcoin’s role in global finance.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Donald Trump|Joe Biden,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|ASIA|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-08 18:57:12

Despite attempts to stabilize, BTC remains under pressure, with traders looking for signs of a potential trend reversal or deeper correction. On Thursday, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, a move that many believed would boost market confidence. However, Bitcoin fell after the announcement as the executive order failed to meet investor expectations, leading to further sell-offs and volatility. The market reaction suggests that traders were expecting more clarity on how the US government plans to manage and utilize the reserve. Despite the price drop , key on-chain data from Santiment reveals that whales have accumulated over 30,000 Bitcoin in the past two weeks, signaling a strong buying trend. This suggests that large investors are positioning themselves for a potential market shift, even as BTC struggles in the short term. Bitcoin Fundamentals Differ From Market Sentiment Bitcoin is struggling to reclaim the $90,000 mark but continues to hold firm above $85,000, a critical support level that could serve as a definitive point of inflection if bulls fail to defend it. With market sentiment still bearish, BTC remains under pressure, unable to generate the momentum needed for a decisive breakout. The decline in cryptocurrencies has mirrored the downtrend in U.S. stock markets as investors react to fears of a widening global trade war. Macroeconomic uncertainty, combined with ongoing regulatory concerns, has kept risk assets, including Bitcoin, in a volatile state. However, this turbulence could fade if upcoming developments, such as tax cuts and regulatory clarity, provide benefits for investors. These factors could serve as catalysts for renewed confidence in both traditional markets and crypto. Despite the current weakness, top analyst Ali Martinez shared on-chain data from Santiment, revealing that whales have accumulated over 30,000 Bitcoin in the past two weeks. This strong accumulation trend stands in contrast to the broader market sentiment, which continues to send BTC toward lower levels. Historically, whale accumulation is a bullish signal, as large investors typically buy during periods of fear and uncertainty to position themselves ahead of the next market move. If Bitcoin maintains support above $85,000 and whales continue to accumulate, a potential recovery could be on the horizon. However, if BTC fails to hold its current range, another leg down toward lower demand zones may follow. With Bitcoin’s price action at a critical juncture, the coming days will be key in determining whether BTC can break out above resistance or if bears will regain control and push prices lower. BTC Holding Above $85K Bitcoin (BTC) is currently holding above $85,000 despite persistent selling pressure and bulls struggling to reclaim key resistance levels. The market remains highly uncertain, with BTC failing to confirm a move into higher supply zones or a breakdown into lower demand levels. For bulls to regain momentum, Bitcoin must push above $90,000 with strength and aim for a quick move toward $100,000. A decisive reclaim of these levels would shift sentiment bullish and potentially trigger a new uptrend. However, without a clear breakout, BTC remains vulnerable to further downside pressure. If Bitcoin fails to hold $90K and loses support at $85K, the market could see another wave of selling, leading to a drop toward $78,000 or lower. This level would be critical, as breaking below it could trigger panic selling and a more extended correction. For now, traders are watching BTC’s ability to defend $85K and push higher. The next few days will be crucial in determining whether Bitcoin can reclaim key resistance levels or if bears will regain control and send the price lower. Uncertainty continues to dominate, keeping both bulls and bears on edge.

The altcoin has been trading below key resistance levels, with its movement showing signs of consolidation near a critical support zone. As bearish sentiment grows, traders are closely watching the price action to determine whether ADA will break below or attempt a recovery. Will Cardano Price Hold Key Support? Analyst Winghaven Crypto has taken to X , pointing out that Cardano broke below a symmetrical triangle on the 4-hour chart, confirming a bearish trend. The breakdown suggests that the selling momentum is increasing, pushing ADA toward lower support levels. The current market structure indicates a continuation of downward pressure unless buyers step in to defend key price zones. The immediate resistance level for Cardano price is at $0.85, where previous price rejections have occurred. If ADA fails to reclaim this level, the probability of further declines increases. On the downside, support is identified at $0.76, a level that has held firm in recent sessions. A failure to maintain this support could open the door for a deeper decline toward $0.68, a level that aligns with previous demand zones. Source: X Despite the bearish outlook, Cardano whales have been aggressively accumulating, adding 420 million ADA since Donald Trump’s announcement about the US Crypto Reserve, including altcoins like XRP, ADA, and SOL. Analysts believe that if bullish momentum sustains, ADA price could rally toward $12, marking a long-term breakout. Trend Reversal or Further Decline? A sustained move above the $0.85–$0.90 range could signal a potential shift in momentum, possibly reversing the bearish outlook. If Cardano price manages to break above this resistance, it could regain bullish strength and attract renewed buying interest. However, the downward-sloping trendline continues to act as a strong barrier, limiting upward movement. In contrast, if the current selling pressure persists, ADA may struggle to hold its support. A confirmed break below $0.76 would likely lead to additional downside moves, potentially testing $0.70 or lower. The declining trading volume further indicates weak buyer participation, which may hinder any immediate recovery efforts. Analyst Ali Martinez Weighs In Analyst Ali Martinez has also provided insights into the current Cardano price action. According to his latest analysis, ADA is consolidating within a descending triangle pattern, which is often considered a bearish continuation structure. His analysis suggests that the breakout direction will determine the next major price movement, with potential for a 33% price swing. Source: X Martinez emphasizes that if Cardano price breaks below key support, further losses could follow. However, if buyers manage to push the price above the descending trendline, it could spark an altcoin rally, leading to a strong recovery. In the meantime, Cardano investors remain optimistic, closely watching for a breakout above the $1.14 resistance level to confirm a rally toward $2. Despite the recent price dip, analysts highlight the right-angled descending broadening wedge pattern as a bullish signal.

SEI was one of those golden tickets. Its early adopters watched their portfolios multiply while those who hesitated were left kicking themselves. SEI’s early days offered massive potential at a fraction of today’s value, but hesitation meant missing out on game-changing gains. If the regret of skipping SEI still stings, there’s a new name that could redefine the category—Qubetics ($TICS). Qubetics isn’t just another token; it’s a disruptive force in cross-border transactions, bridging the gap between traditional finance and blockchain innovation. While SEI’s biggest gains are in the past, Qubetics’ best crypto presale is still unfolding. The current stage offers early buyers a rare shot at massive multipliers, but time is ticking. Missed Qubetics’ Early Stages? The Window Is Closing Fast Qubetics didn’t just appear overnight. Early supporters who joined its whitelist had the chance to secure $TICS at just $0.01 with zero upfront investment. But if that opportunity slipped through the cracks, here’s the reality check: Every new presale stage increases the price by 10%, and each stage lasts just seven days. With the 24th stage already in motion at $0.0976 per $TICS, waiting any longer could mean paying significantly more for the same token. For those still hesitating, here’s why the Qubetics presale is a strategic move: the ROI potential is staggering. At the current price: If $TICS reaches $0.25, the ROI is 155.93%. If $TICS hits $1, it’s a 923.72% gain. If $TICS soars to $10 after the mainnet launch, early buyers stand to gain 10,137.16%—a once-in-a-lifetime return. With $14.7M+ already raised and 497M+ tokens sold, this isn’t just hype—it’s a wealth-building moment in real time. Real-Life Utility: Qubetics’ Cross-Border Payment Solution Qubetics isn’t just a speculative asset—it’s solving real-world problems. Imagine a freelancer in Argentina struggling with high remittance fees and slow bank transfers. With Qubetics’ non-custodial multi-chain wallet, funds arrive instantly with minimal transaction costs. For businesses handling global transactions, Qubetics enables fast, cost-effective payments without intermediaries, giving companies an edge in competitive international markets. And with the Qubetics mainnet launching in Q2 2025, this isn’t just a temporary trend. It’s a long-term disruptor that’s poised to shake up the financial world. The question is—will it be another missed opportunity, or will this be the move that finally pays off? SEI: The One That Got Away SEI’s journey is a classic tale of missed opportunities in the crypto world. Launched in September 2023 at an initial price of $0.1397, SEI presented early participants with a chance to get in at the ground level. As the project gained traction, its value soared, reaching an all-time high of $1.14 in March 2024—a staggering increase that rewarded early adopters handsomely. ​ The SEI ecosystem expanded rapidly, delving into decentralized finance (DeFi) and interoperability solutions, making it a significant player in the blockchain space. However, those who waited for the “perfect moment” to join found themselves priced out as the value climbed, missing the most profitable entry points.​ The lesson here is clear: the best performing crypto opportunities favor the bold. SEI’s trajectory underscores that early action can lead to substantial rewards. While SEI’s meteoric rise is now part of crypto history, Qubetics stands at the precipice of its journey, offering a fresh opportunity for those looking to capitalize on the next potential breakout in the crypto market.​ Final Call: Don’t Let Qubetics Be Another SEI for You SEI’s past success is a reminder that hesitation costs more than a missed trade—it’s a lost financial transformation. The next big opportunity is here, and it’s happening with Qubetics ($TICS). The Qubetics presale is at a pivotal stage, and early adopters are locking in tokens before the next price jump. With the mainnet launch set for Q2 2025, this is the last chance to secure an early position before $TICS enters a new era of price discovery. Don’t watch from the sidelines—join this crypto presale and be part of the next best performing crypto success story before it’s too late.

But the attendees reportedly left feeling deflated. Here’s where prices stand over the past 24 hours: CRYPTOCURRENCY PRICE GAINS +/- Bitcoin ( BTC ) $86,052 -0.8% Ethereum ( ETH ) $2,182 +1.5% Solana ( SOL ) $136 -4.3% XRP ( XRP ) $2.33 -2.5% Cardano ( ADA ) $0.811 -0.9% Dogecoin ( DOGE ) $0.1925 -3.5% The event came three days after Trump’s first address to Congress since returning to office, in which he spouted several statements, including one about the economy that doesn’t quite align with the facts . “As you know, we inherited an economic disaster and an inflation crisis from the previous administration,” Trump stated . Here are the facts Gross Domestic Product : Under Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, real GDP growth averaged around 3.4% over the first three years, including a 2.5% growth in 2023. Compare that to Trump’s first term: Not counting the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020-, the economy experienced an average annual real GDP growth of approximately 2.5%. By 2020, the pandemic led to a significant contraction and resulted in an overall average annual growth rate of about 1.6% for Trump’s term. Inflation : Trump has claimed that the U.S. has faced “the worst inflation we’ve ever had.” However, that’s inaccurate – inflation last exceeded 9% in 1981, and has been much higher at various points throughout U.S. history. Indeed, prices surged considerably during the initial two years of Biden’s presidency, reaching a high of 9.1% in June 2022. By December 2024, the annual inflation rate was 2.9% . S&P 500 Performance: Since Biden’s inauguration on Jan. 20, 2021, the S&P 500 has risen by approximately 50%, despite a 19% drop in 2022 due to the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes aimed at combating inflation. Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) Milestones: The DJIA surpassed several significant milestones during Biden’s tenure, including: Crossing 30,000 points on Nov. 24, 2020 — some 20 days after Biden was elected. Reaching 35,000 points on July 23, 2021. Surpassing 40,000 points on May 17, 2024. Under Trump presently, consumer confidence is down ; stocks just suffered their worst week in six months (h/t Forbes); and inflation worsened . As for crypto, it’s still a mystery how Trump plans to pay for the digital asset stockpile that’s currently in the works . Will he raise taxes? We’re told there would be “no incremental costs on American taxpayers.” It’s no wonder why both Republicans and Democrats are worried. See below. 🟡 NEW: Republicans and Democrats who hope to legitimize crypto by pushing regulatory overhauls through Congress are scrambling to come to terms with Trump’s proposal to create a US ""strategic reserve"" of digital assets.

Source: CoinGecko The big guns of crypto (i.e., Michael Saylor, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev) attended. It was a clear shift in attitude compared to the Biden era, when the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) drew the ire of those in the industry who felt that the Gary Gensler-led crackdowns were unfair. After all, not everyone in the industry was a scammer (although 2024 had plenty of rug pulls ). Today, these honchos have Trump whose federal government — according to Axios’ Felix Salmon and Zachary Basu — has become “the primary driver of the chaos.” What could go wrong?

A report found that only 13% of Web3 founding teams include at least one woman. Industry leaders emphasize mentorship, representation, and practical solutions to close the gender gap. Women are demonstrably leading the charge in Web3 and crypto. They are actively spearheading leadership, technical, and strategic roles. However, a report from CCN highlights several challenges they continue to face in the sector. These challenges include limited funding access, exclusion from key networks, and biases within the industry that can still impede full participation. A study by the Boston Consulting Group and People of Crypto Lab found that only 13% of Web3 founding teams include at least one woman. Even more striking is that only 3% of teams are composed entirely of women. The report also notes that all-male teams secure nearly four times more capital than all-female teams, highlighting persistent funding disparities that make it tougher for women-led projects to compete on equal footing.

Solana battles to stay above important support lines yet Cardano faces doubts about entering a U.S. crypto reserve system. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) establishes itself as a distinguished DeFi project through its distinctive lending framework while its presale initiative secures $2.4 million from investors. MUTM maintains its position as an improved investment alternative to SOL and ADA through its 4,500 holders and current value of $0.015. Solana’s Rocky Road The payment network SOL is encountering major negative market trends at the present time. Expert analysts predict SOL will plummet to $60 after its price drops under $125 support as this event may completely reverse its price appreciation. The ascending wedge pattern formed by SOL did not lead to sustained upward movement after investors became reluctant to invest further due to its lack of price momentum stability. The market presents ADA as a risky speculation vehicle due to its high volatility level linked with speculative trading activities. Cardano’s Uncertain Future Since the beginning of the week ADA maintained its achieved price points by demonstrating a 27% upswing. The future of Cardano (ADA) as a strategic crypto reserve candidate faces uncertainty since experts doubt its reserve potential. Providing governance to the token through community participation might be viewed as innovative yet this method faces widespread doubt from stakeholders. The current price of ADA remains stable at $0.85 but another bearish trend might lead to significant loss of its recent gains. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): A DeFi Game-Changer Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerges as the rising DeFi project which provides real-world utility beyond the market struggles faced by Solana and Cardano. MUTM functions beyond speculative tokens to offer decentralized borrowing and lending because its mtTokens system allows users to generate passive income. The project’s current price is $0.015 after raising $2.4 million during its presale period. The value of early investment in MUTM will generate 300% returns until the token reaches a $0.06 exchange price. Mutuum Finance operates a mechanism which combines buying and distribution that maintains continuous MUTM token demand. A revenue share purchased from the platform keeps purchasing tokens which distribute to staking users while maintaining steady market demand. Through this system investors receive continued motivation to maintain token ownership while achieving financial stability of its value. Why MUTM Outshines SOL and ADA The practical features and tokenomics system of Mutuum Finance distinguish it as a superior platform versus Solana and Cardano. Lasting financial value exists in MUTM because its platform provides lending services compared to SOL and ADA which depend on market prediction. Through its overcollateralized structure the project reduces risks for lenders and its peer-to-peer lending functionality offers adaptable options to borrowers. The presale phase displays strong market confidence in MUTM token. Current investors will benefit substantially from the upcoming token price boost to $0.02 during the next phase. Moving beyond its initial public release experts anticipate that MUTM tokens will surge to $1.50 which would deliver early adopters approximately 10 thousand percent profits. Real-world utility combined with a defined expansion path sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart as a DeFi initiative operating within the sector of speculative assets. The valuable lending system of MUTM and its successful pre-sale activities create a strong investment opportunity despite the present uncertainties for Solana and Cardano. Investors should not wait since the presale phase of Mutuum Finance will provide optimal investment potential which will increase with time. Secure your MUTM tokens today at the presale price of $0.015 and position yourself for substantial gains as the project gears up for its exchange listing.

In a post on X, the Binance-backed blockchain network said the much-anticipated upgrade is now ready to go after the successful implementation of the Hardfork on its testnet. According to the announcement , the Pascal Hardfork will improve BNB Chain’s Ethereum compatibility and developer flexibility. It noted that one of the expected features of the upgrade, the EIP-7702 smart contract wallets, had already been successfully implemented on the BNB Chain testnet through Hardfork. The announcement reads: “BNB Chain’s testnet has successfully implemented EIP-7702 through the Pascal hardfork. This makes it one of the earliest chains to adopt this EVM upgrade.” EIP-7702 is a smart contract wallet feature that temporarily allows Ethereum wallets to have native smart contract capabilities. The feature is part of the upcoming Ethereum Pectra upgrade and will enable wallets to execute batch transactions and spending limits. Additionally, this feature is expected to improve security as it enables multisig support while allowing gasless transactions via payments. With this feature coming to the Ethereum wallet, stakeholders believe onboarding new users to Web3 would be easier as it would also improve user experience. Binance co-founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao described the upgrade as an “important hardfork.” Meanwhile, announcing the Hardfork date also gives participants within the BNB ecosystem sufficient time to upgrade their technology and software. According to BNB Chain, node operators, exchanges, and validators must update to v1.5.7 on BNB Smart Chain or v0.5.6 on opBNB before the upgrade on March 20, or their node could become out of sync after the upgrade. Developers must also test and update their decentralized applications for new transaction types. Beyond Pascal, the BNB Chain has two other Hardforks planned for 2025. These are the Lorentz Hardfork in April, which will reduce block intervals to 1.5 seconds, followed by the Maxwell Hardfork in June, which will cut the time to 0.75 seconds. BNB Chain sees growth due to AI and memecoins The upcoming upgrade to BNB Chain is coming at the heel of increased activity on the BNB Chain over the past few weeks. The EVM-compatible L1 network has fallen in the pecking order over the last few years behind the likes of Ethereum and Solana. However, it has seen a resurgence in recent weeks due to memecoins generating significant activity on the network even as Solana sees meme activity decline. While Zhao disclosing his dog is named Brocolli caused the initial memecoin frenzy on BNB Chain, the network has also shown support for the sector by providing liquidity for top memecoins. BNB Chain gave $4.4 million in liquidity to top memecoins (Source: BNB Chain/X) Aside from the memecoins, AI-focused projects are also growing rapidly on the network. BNB Chain now hosts over 50 AI projects across various categories, including applications, chatbots, infrastructure, launchpads, data, etc. Binance is also revamping its listing process to introduce community participation with voting to list and delist. All that activity has translated into increased decentralized trading volume, with BNB Smart Chain having the third-highest DEX volume on Defillama in the last 30 days, behind only Solana and Ethereum.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, the firm says a joint investigation with cybersecurity firm Mandiant revealed that the hacker used a multi-pronged process to breach Bybit’s security protocols. “The attack involved the compromise of a Safe Wallet developer’s laptop (Developer1) and the hijacking of AWS session tokens to bypass multi-factor authentication controls. This developer was one of the very few personnel that had higher access in order to perform their duties.” Source: Safe Wallet/X AWS session tokens are temporary security credentials that allow users and apps to make secure API (application programming interface) calls. Safe Wallet notes that the investigation hasn’t concluded and that further inquiry is needed to understand the hacker’s activity following the compromise of Developer1’s workstation. However, the firm says that it has bolstered its security measures beyond those of what they were before the heist. In February, Bybit suffered a major breach linked to its Ethereum ( ETH ) warm wallet. At the time, data from crypto analytics firm Arkham revealed that a staggering $1.4 billion worth of ETH and Lido Staked Ethereum ( stETH ) were stolen, the largest crypto hack in history. Safe Wallet says the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has connected the exploit to TraderTraitor, a hacker group associated with the Democratic People’s Republic of North Korea (DPRK).

Au faces a single felony count of subscribing to a false tax return and is expected to appear in the United States District Court in Los Angeles in the coming days. Fraud Investigation According to the Department of Justice’s announcement , her plea agreement revealed that her then-boyfriend, identified as Iza, orchestrated various fraudulent schemes from 2020 to 2024 which included unlawfully obtaining access to advertising accounts and credit lines from Facebook Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. He profited significantly from selling access to these accounts and ended up accumulating millions in unreported earnings. Additionally, Iza engaged Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department deputies to provide private security and directed them to secure search warrants and access confidential law enforcement information to target individuals with whom he had financial and personal disputes. Under Iza’s direction, Au established shell corporations and opened bank accounts in their names, which were then used to conceal illicit funds. These funds were used to pay approximately $1 million to the deputies, primarily in cash, and to finance a lavish lifestyle that included luxury real estate, high-end vehicles, jewelry, designer clothing, and recreational activities amounting to nearly $10 million. Au Faces 3 Years, Iza Faces 35 Au is alleged to have facilitated the acquisition of approximately $16 million in cryptocurrency for Iza. In her plea agreement, Au admitted to transferring over $2.6 million from these accounts into her personal bank accounts between 2020 and 2023. However, she knowingly failed to report this income to the IRS on her federal tax returns. If convicted, Au faces a maximum sentence of three years in federal prison. Her former partner, Iza, pleaded guilty to conspiracy against rights, wire fraud, and tax evasion on January 30.

The latest trends include the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) opening doors for banks, the SEC changing its enforcement tactics, and stablecoins regulation gaining government support. Novogratz believes these recent changes will have a lasting impact on Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Mike Novogratz on Key Crypto Regulation Trends According to his X post, Mike asserted that having a national BTC reserve sends a strong message to other countries. He believes this is a significant step toward Bitcoin’s global adoption and a turning point for the financial system. Second, Novogratz stressed the importance of allowing banks to participate in crypto. He argued that banks can now provide crypto custody and transaction services with the OCC easing restrictions . He believes this will encourage more institutional adoption than the reserve announcement itself. Crypto musings… 1. The announcements yesterday were huge. Historical. That we have a $BTC reserve will send a message to every country. This is a very big deal. 2. Allowing Banks to participate will greatly increase institutional adoption. This might be more important… — Mike Novogratz (@novogratz) March 8, 2025 Similarly, he reacted to the U.S. Treasury Secretary’s recent comments about stablecoins. Acknowledging their role in maintaining the dollar’s dominance, the government now sees stablecoins as a key financial tool. Mike Novogratz considers this crypto regulation shift extremely bullish, suggesting that policymakers finally understand the value of digital assets. Meanwhile, he addressed why crypto prices have been struggling in 2025. He explained that the market hit a frenzy in late 2024, peaking with the high-profile Crypto Ball event during the U.S. inauguration. Since then, institutions have taken a cautious approach, Chinese investors have favored stocks over crypto, and meme coin speculation has collapsed. Additionally, U.S. stock market shifts have affected crypto’s momentum, while the industry still lacks a new Web3 breakthrough to drive excitement. The SEC and CFTC Shift on Crypto Regulation In other news, the crypto regulatory environment is changing in the US. One important sign is the SEC’s withdrawal from crypto lawsuits. Likewise, the CFTC is also easing crackdowns on crypto firms. These moves complement the OCC, which makes it easier for banks to engage with crypto. Banks and other financial institutions will now be privileged to participate in custodial services and DeFi staking. This has been one of the positive developments for the crypto community since President Trump’s emergency in the US. President. Importantly, these changes might see more regular and institutional investors acquire and invest more in the digital asset economy. Crypto Exchanges and IPO Pursuit It is also important to note that major crypto exchanges like Kraken and Gemini are preparing for IPOs as the regulatory outlook improves. Like many other market experts who have shared their opinions, Mike Novogratz believes public listings will boost investor confidence and push the industry further into mainstream finance. However, he noted that the crypto market needs fresh retail interest and a new narrative to regain momentum. Still, the industry leader remains bullish on crypto in the medium to long term. However, in the short term, he warns of counterbalancing forces and the need for Bitcoin to break $91,000 for a full market recovery.

Ripple (XRP) Finds Support at $2.30 as White Summit Disappoints Ripple (XRP) price experienced additional downside pressure on March 8, closing the week in a lukewarm state. The White House Crypto Summit generated significant media attention throughout the week, prompting traders to take strategic positions. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s confirmed attendance had raised hopes that the event could yield positive regulatory developments for altcoins, potentially sparking another breakout similar to when former President Trump included XRP in the crypto strategic reserve on Sunday. Ripple (XRP) Price Action However, the outcome of the event was underwhelming, as no significant regulatory clarity emerged, leaving doubts about congressional approval of executive orders. Additionally, bearish macroeconomic data—particularly the U.S. Non-Farm Payroll ( NFP ) report showing rising unemployment—exerted further downward pressure, preventing XRP from extending gains post-summit. Market volatility in response to these events saw XRP price dip another 2% on Friday, March 7, bringing total weekly losses to 13%. However, bulls staged a mild recovery, triggering a 2% upswing to the $2.34 level at press time on Saturday, March 9. Short Traders Reduce Exposure as White House Summit Ends with no Sell-the-News Triggers Ripple price initially plunged another 3% before stabilizing above $2.30, but key derivatives market metrics suggest that the majority of short traders had positioned for a much deeper correction on Friday. As these traders adjust their overleveraged positions, XRP price could inadvertently score mild gains over the weekend. 5 critical XRP derivatives trading metrics from Coinglass reinforce this narrative. Firstly, trading volume witnessed a significant 45% decline, a common precursor to momentum shifts. With XRP posting its first green candle in four days, the volume contraction signals a imminent directional shift from last week’s dominant bearish sentiment. XRP Derivatives Market data, March 8 | Source: Coinglass Additionally, open interest declined by 6%, approximately during the day while prices rose 2%, suggesting capital outflows from short traders closing their positions rather than fresh capital entering on the long side. This development points to a short squeeze scenario where shorts covering positions could drive a gradual price recovery. Another crucial indicator is the long/short ratio, which remains in favor of long positions across major exchanges. Binance XRP/USDT accounts show a long/short ratio of 3.6642, while OKX traders hold a 2.71 long/short ratio, reinforcing that bullish sentiment is returning despite the broader market’s hesitation. Lastly, the options market also reflects this shift. While options volume has dropped 73%, options open interest has increased by nearly 19%, indicating that traders are repositioning rather than exiting entirely. This repositioning suggests confidence among options traders that XRP could hold the $2.30 level and potentially advance higher without additional bearish catalysts. XRP Near-term Outlook The prevailing derivatives data suggests that most short traders had anticipated a much larger price correction following the White House Summit. However, with no major post-event euphoria materializing, these traders are unlikely to book amplified gains in the near term. The data indicates that short traders are now repositioning, which could help XRP price hold the $2.30 support level or even advance toward $2.50 in the absence of additional bearish catalysts. Should bullish momentum continue building over the weekend, a potential retest of $2.50 remains within reach, setting the stage for further upside in the coming week. XRP Price Forecast: XRP Eyes $2.50 Amid Support Rebound XRP price remains resilient at the $2.35 level despite recent selling pressure, with technical indicators suggesting a potential rebound toward $2.50. The daily chart displays price action consolidating within the Keltner Channel, with the middle band at $2.47 acting as the nearest resistance. A decisive breakout above this level could open the door for a retest of $2.98, aligning with the upper boundary of the channel. XRP Technical Price Analysis The Bull-Bear Power (BBP) indicator currently sits at -0.1796, reflecting bearish sentiment. However, historical data suggests that similar BBP levels have preceded bullish reversals, particularly when coinciding with price stabilization near key support. If buyers sustain momentum, a shift into positive BBP territory could confirm a breakout scenario. Conversely, failure to hold above the $2.30 support level would expose XRP to further downside, potentially testing the lower Keltner Channel boundary at $1.95. The Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) at $2.35 is a crucial pivot level; a strong close above it would strengthen the bullish case. With leverage likely playing a role in upcoming moves, traders should watch for increasing open interest and funding rate shifts as key signals of directional conviction.

While buyers are attempting to regain control, technical indicators suggest that bullish strength remains fragile, raising concerns about whether BTC can sustain its rebound or face another pullback. With key resistance levels ahead and market sentiment still uncertain, Bitcoin’s next move remains unpredictable. If buyers fail to build enough momentum, BTC could struggle to push higher, leaving it vulnerable to renewed selling pressure. Bitcoin Tries To Bounce Back BTC’s current price action indicates that bulls are making an effort to stage a rebound from the $85,211 support level after a sharp decline. This attempt follows a period of strong bearish pressure, which intensified when Bitcoin faced heavy resistance at $93,257 and failed to move upward. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Attempts a Comeback—Is a Recovery Rally on the Horizon? Despite some signs of stabilization, technical indicators suggest that bullish momentum remains weak. The lack of strong buying pressure raises concerns about whether BTC can maintain its current attempt at a rebound or if another downturn is imminent. Additionally, the price remains below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), signaling that bears still dominate the market. Furthermore, the MACD line and the signal line are edging lower, hinting at a possible decline in bullish momentum. If both lines continue downward and cross into negative territory, it could signal a shift in trend favoring the bears. This weakening performance suggests that buying pressure is not strong enough to sustain a meaningful recovery, increasing the risk of further downside. A confirmed bearish crossover might reinforce selling dominance, making it difficult for BTC to regain an uptrend. For the bulls to regain control, a surge in buying activity is needed to push the MACD indicators back into a positive trend. Traders should watch key support and resistance levels closely for confirmation of the next trend direction Potential Scenarios: Rebound Or Another Leg Down? If bulls successfully defend the $85,211 support level, Bitcoin could stage a relief rally, driving prices toward the immediate resistance at $93,257. A decisive break above this critical level could open the door for a stronger bullish push, propelling BTC toward $100,000. Such a move would restore market confidence and attract more buyers, increasing the likelihood of continued upside expansion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reclaims $90K But This Indicator Signals Possible Consolidation Phase However, once Bitcoin fails to gain momentum, a drop below $85,211 may accelerate losses.

According to Sun, TRX’s price will reach a new all-time high (ATH) despite the current on-chain indicators and fundamentals around the asset. Justin Sun Targets New All-Time High For TRX Barely three months after TRX hit an all-time high, Justin Sun says the asset will surpass its previous milestone. The project’s founder took to X (formerly Twitter) to predict the future price of TRX amid a cloud of uncertainty. For Justin Sun, TRX will set another all-time high in the coming months following a steep drop in asset prices. TRX set a new all-time high of $0.44 in December 2024 on the back of a broader altcoin rally but recent prices pale in comparison. “TRX will hit ATH no matter what happens,” said Sun in an X post. With prices at $0.24, TRX has fallen by 44.22% from its all-time high but analysts are still sharing a similar sentiment with Justin Sun. TRX’s seven-day chart indicates a steady upward climb of nearly 7%, sparking speculation that TRX will reach $1 . Tron Network’s Activity Heats Up To A Boil Despite trading at nearly 50% from its all-time high, the Tron network is recording impressive network activity. Onchain analyst Ali Martinez confirmed that active addresses have reached 2.94 million, marking a two-month high. Pseudonymous analyst Crypto Patel revealed that TRX is barrelling toward $1, expressing confidence that the asset will reach the target in this bull run. A hefty investment by Justin Sun in the Trump family-backed World Liberty tokens has fuelled speculation for an upward climb for TRX. However, the exclusion of the TRX in the Crypto Strategic Reserve has left a bad taste in the mouth of investors. Amid speculation involving TRX, the Chinese-born entrepreneur is grappling with his fair share of legal troubles. Justin Sun is staring down at the possibility of a lawsuit from blockchain protocol Chain for market manipulation. The US SEC is exploring a resolution to Justin Sun’s civil fraud case following the securities watchdog dismissal of Kraken’s case .
