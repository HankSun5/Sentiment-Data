41301602,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=688626,1741388400,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41301602.jpeg,Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Targets $4 In 2025 To Surpass Leading DeFi Giant Ripple (XRP),https://www.cryptopolitan.com/mutuum-finance-mutm-targets-4-in-2025-to-surpass-leading-defi-giant-ripple-xrp/,"The crypto market shows growing interest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) because its existing presale phase achieved $2.3 million and accumulated more than 4,300 token owners. The project currently operates during its second phase of pre-sale at $0.015 while investors have an exceptional opportunity to acquire tokens at this price point before upcoming price increases push the token value to $0.02. Early MUTM participants would have earned a 300% return on their investment through presale prices before reaching the anticipated $0.06 official exchange value. After the launch date MUTM will rise dramatically according to expert estimations amounting to $4 by 2025 while surpassing the market position of Ripple (XRP). Mutuum Finance (MUTM): A DeFi Powerhouse in the Making The decentralized finance platform Mutuum Finance (MUTM) functions as much more than a typical token since it operates to reshape lending and borrowing systems through DeFi capabilities. MUTM provides valuable practical applicability which allows users to generate passive income through its distinct borrowing solution. As part of the unique mtTokens system on the platform users can execute assets such as ETH or DAI to acquire interest-generating tokens. The worth of these tokens increases with time so users get a steady cash flow from their investments and still have easy access to funds. The successful outcome of the presale demonstrates that investors see huge potential in MUTM. Demand for the second phase increases while initial stocks sold out rapidly among investors. The project draws investors through its organized token structure that implements a mechanism for token purchasing combined with distribution. The distribution system purchases platform-derived funds to obtain MUTM tokens from exchanges before distributing them back to stakeholders to maintain steady buying assets. Through this method investors receive benefits for maintaining their investment position and enhanced price stability goes hand in hand with investor retention. Ripple (XRP) Facing Challenges Amid Market Volatility The rising value of MUTM Finance continues while the unpredictable market conditions of Ripple (XRP) occur. According to CasiTrades the XRP cryptocurrency will decline to $1.50 after breaking its essential support level at $2.42. Several experts believe XRP will achieve $30 by May 2025 yet its market stability remains inconsistent. Many influential cryptocurrencies face multiple risks which emerge from regulatory hurdles and wild market price movements. MUTM distinguishes itself from other entities by delivering operational financial services through methods that provide sustainability at every stage of transformation. Stability within this lending system comes from its excess collateral mechanism and its ability to adjust interest rates for investors through two separate rates. The main reason that sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart from its competitors Mutuum Finance (MUTM) was built to fulfill extended-term goals. The presale schedule of Mutuum Finance ensures investors obtain large profits because token prices increase during different stages of the process. The current price of $0.015 gives investors the potential to make 300% profit when MUTM lists at $0.06. MUTM experts forecast a remarkable price increase to $4 during the next five years which translates to a 26500% return on investment. P2P lending on the platform helps users directly agree on their terms for loans. The platform provides a beneficial function when users need to borrow meme coins because standard lending pools typically offer limited access to these specific assets. The $100,000 MUTM giveaway from Mutuum Finance creates an investment time pressure and boosts total participant numbers. The cryptocurrency platform Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to dominate the decentralized finance market through its combination of trailblazing technology and functional services and capital expansion potential. The MUTM presale builds momentum as the project moves toward surpassing Ripple (XRP) and other established giants in the market. The current presale phase presents a limited-time opportunity to invest at the lowest price, with the potential for substantial gains as the project evolves. For investors seeking a high-yield, real-utility token, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a compelling choice. Don’t miss out on the chance to be part of this groundbreaking project, secure your tokens today before the next price increase.

41301412,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=708607,1741388445,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,"Bitcoin Price Crash Incoming? Why A Fall To $63,000 Is Possible If This Resistance Holds",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crash-incoming/,"The recent Bitcoin price crash below $90,000 came as a shock to the broader crypto community, especially amid expectations of a continued bull market rally. Despite the volatility and ongoing declines, a crypto analyst projects an even greater crash, suggesting that Bitcoin could fall as low as $63,000 if a certain resistance level holds. TradingView crypto analyst Alixjey has declared that the Bitcoin price must break past $99,500 to continue moving higher. He highlights that if this resistance holds and Bitcoin fails to break it, the pioneer cryptocurrency will likely face a steeper price decline to new lows of $63,000. The last time Bitcoin was around the $60,000 range was during its massive price rally in 2024 after the launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Considering that Bitcoin has risen as high as $104,000 at one point this year, a crash toward $60,000 would be a devastating blow to investors and its market. Bitcoin Price Crash Imminent The TradingView analyst shared a chart suggesting that Bitcoin could rise as high as $106,000 or drop toward the $60,000 to $65,000 range if it fails to break resistance. This price drop is highlighted as a strong buying and accumulation opportunity for long-term investors, as it presents a low entry point into the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin 77% Correction To $25,000, Will History Repeat Itself During its price highs, many retail investors were likely unable to buy Bitcoin due to its increasing cost. Most accumulations were from whales who had purchased millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin in one swoop. Alixjey has also labeled his projected $60,000 – $65,000 downturn as the last chance to re-enter the Bitcoin market, emphasizing that it was a prime HODLing point for potential profits in Q3 and Q4 of 2025. This implies that the analyst anticipates a price rebound in Bitcoin later in the year. Moving on, the TradingView expert highlighted two liquidity levels in the 4-hour timeframe that are likely to be cleared soon. He also acknowledged that he was solely bearish on Bitcoin’s price outlook, indicating that his projected short-term pullback will not be invalidated unless the cryptocurrency crosses the resistance between $94,000 and $98,000. Other factors that could contribute to Bitcoin’s already heightened volatility are the Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) data. AlixJey predicts that once released, this data could lead to high volatility in both stocks and crypto. He urges investors and traders to be cautious, as major economic reports often influence market movements. Analyst Sees Upside Potential After BTC Crashes Due to Bitcoin’s recent declines, many analysts have shared bearish projections of the cryptocurrency, expecting a severe price correction before a potential recovery. One such analyst is Herbert Sim, the Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) of AICean. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Suffers Bearish Deviation After Filling CME Gap, Is This Good Or Bad? Sim projects that Bitcoin will crash to new lows, especially with the recent approval of a crypto reserve in the United States (US). He expects a crash to $40,000 but highlights that it will be short-lived, spanning from weeks, months, and possibly years. However, the AICean CMO suggested that investors who can HODL for the long-term are likely to see more profits once BTC rebounds from bearish trends.

The world of artificial intelligence is not just evolving in code and algorithms, but also in the halls of US lawmakers. We’re barely into 2025, and the legislative landscape around AI is already exploding. If you thought 2024 was busy with AI developments, think again. The sheer volume of US AI bills being introduced this year is nothing short of astonishing. Unprecedented Wave of US AI Bills: What’s Driving the Surge? According to MultiState, a consulting firm tracking these developments, a staggering 781 US AI bills are already pending in the US as of early March 2025. Let that sink in. This number eclipses the total of 743 AI bills proposed throughout the entirety of 2024. And to put it in even starker perspective, 2023 saw fewer than 200 such bills. We’re witnessing an unprecedented legislative frenzy around AI. just 66 days into 2025 and the number of artificial intelligence bills pending in the US now officially exceeds the total for ALL of 2024. 2024: 743 AI bills total for the year 2025: 781 AI bills in just 66 days pic.twitter.com/xrYPVDYgR1 — Adam Thierer (@AdamThierer) March 7, 2025 This legislative surge can be largely attributed to a vacuum at the federal level. The absence of a comprehensive national AI legislation framework, akin to the EU’s AI Act, is pushing individual states and lawmakers to take matters into their own hands. Congress has, so far, struggled to coalesce around a unified approach, leaving a patchwork of proposed regulations across the nation. Federal Inaction Fuels State-Level AI Regulation Spree Why is federal action on AI governance proving so elusive? Several factors are likely at play: Political Gridlock: Partisan divides in Congress make consensus on complex tech policy issues notoriously difficult. Industry Lobbying: The AI industry, with its diverse range of stakeholders, likely has varied and sometimes conflicting lobbying priorities, further complicating federal action. Lack of Urgency (Perceived): Despite the rapid advancements in AI, some lawmakers may not yet perceive the societal or economic urgency for comprehensive federal regulation, especially compared to more immediate political concerns. The Trump administration’s approach, while aiming to foster AI development, hasn’t translated into strong federal AI regulation . President Trump’s executive order in January focused on promoting AI innovation and removing ideological bias, but it stopped short of endorsing or pushing for major Congressional legislation. This hands-off approach from the executive branch further empowers state-level initiatives. What Does This Mean for the Future of AI and Crypto? For the crypto world, heavily intertwined with technological innovation and often utilizing AI in various applications, this explosion of 2025 AI bills has significant implications. Here’s what you need to consider: Compliance Complexity: A fragmented regulatory landscape across different states could create a compliance nightmare for crypto companies utilizing AI. Navigating 781+ potential laws is far more complex than dealing with a unified federal framework. Innovation Chilling Effect?: Overly restrictive or inconsistent state-level regulations could stifle AI innovation within the US, potentially pushing development and talent overseas. This could indirectly impact crypto projects reliant on cutting-edge AI. Opportunities for Clarity: Conversely, this flurry of legislative activity presents an opportunity for the crypto and AI industries to engage with lawmakers and shape regulations that are both responsible and innovation-friendly. Proactive engagement is crucial. Navigating the AI Regulatory Maze: Key Takeaways The sheer volume of pending AI legislation is a clear signal: AI is no longer a futuristic concept; it’s a present-day reality demanding immediate policy attention. Here are some key takeaways: Aspect Implication Volume of Bills Indicates urgency and widespread concern about AI, but also potential for regulatory fragmentation. Federal Inaction Drives state-level activity, leading to a potentially inconsistent and complex regulatory environment. Industry Engagement Needed Crypto and AI sectors must actively participate in legislative discussions to ensure balanced and effective regulations. Global Regulatory Landscape US developments should be viewed in the context of global AI regulation efforts (e.g., EU AI Act) to understand broader trends. The coming months will be critical in shaping the regulatory contours of AI in the US. For those in the crypto space, staying informed and engaged with these legislative developments is no longer optional – it’s essential for navigating the evolving landscape.

""It's only been, what, 50 days or something like that, and it's already created enough of a tailwind that we feel more confident in investing in the United States and growing our business here,"" Armstrong told CoinDesk. He said the hiring would take place this year. Coinbase, specifically, watched the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission completely abandon its pivotal enforcement action against the leading U.S. crypto platform. The company had been fighting the expensive legal dispute in federal courts over fundamental questions in regulatory jurisdiction over digital assets. That question is now in Congress' hands rather than continuing as a court fight and a drag on Coinbase's resources. Armstrong was among dozens of people crowded into the White House's State Dining Room for the first crypto summit with the White House, leading regulators and senior Republican members of Congress. The big news coming into the meeting was Trump's executive order the night before that called for the establishment of a bitcoin (BTC) reserve, which Armstrong endorsed. ""You can't really have a better holder of this asset than the United States government,"" he said. ""It's becoming a core piece of the financial system, and I think it's going to be a part of every diversified portfolio over time."" Coinbase was a pivotal player during the 2024 election, putting tens of millions of dollars toward the crypto-focused political action committee Fairshake. He said Coinbase will keep backing the super PAC, which did ""an incredible job"" in boosting pro-crypto candidates. Bo Hines, the executive director of the President’s Working Group on Digital Assets, told CoinDesk that Friday's summit represented Trump's commitment to the industry. ""The president made a promise that he's going to make this country the crypto capital of the planet, and we're well on our way in delivering that promise,"" he said in an interview after the close of the summit, in which the crypto reserve ideas played a significant part. ""We were just with 30 or so of the greatest luminaries in the space, and I think everyone was tremendously pleased,"" he said. In answer to industry concerns that the bitcoin reserve isn't initially organized to include new investment, he pointed out that the secretaries of the U.S. Treasury and Commerce departments are ordered to weigh methods of buying bitcoins without burdening taxpayers, and ""both of them are excited to look into ways to do it.""",Policy|Coinbase|Donald Trump|Hiring|Regulation,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BTC|FIAT|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-07 23:06:58

Investors who strategically place their investments in skyrocketing crypto assets make significant gains in a short duration. Dogecoin and BinoFi are among the projects that analysts have flagged could face an imminent surge in price. According to experts, Dogecoin has the potential to double before the year ends. However, BinoFi stands out as the most promising project that could easily turn $3k into $500k within a short duration. BinoFi is a new DeFi protocol whose presale offers investors a chance to invest in BINO tokens at discounted rates. The presale is currently in its first phase pricing and each BINO token is sold at $0.02. BINO is the utility and governance token of the hybrid exchange platform. Traders and investors interacting with crypto assets on BinoFi’s hybrid exchange will earn staking rewards, and accrue discounted trading fees using BINO tokens. Dogecoin price prediction Crypto experts have concluded that Dogecoin and BinoFi are on track to reward investors this year with each project hosting significant potential to explode to the upside. Dogecoin has recently been crashing as U.S. crypto reserve hype fades. According to data from Coinglass, Dogecoin has witnessed liquidations worth $10 million in long positions and $1.39 million in short positions in the last 24 hours. Analysts have predicted that the downward movement is a temporary pullback and that the crypto asset will soon resume its uptrend trajectory towards new all-time highs. Some Dogecoin whales have begun offloading their DOGE holdings and channeling investments in BinoFi’s ongoing presale. BinoFi is pioneering a first-to-market hybrid exchange to facilitate trading activities by creating suitable conditions for investors and frequent market participants. The move mimics Dogecoin's first first-to-market advantage which positioned the project as the first memecoin to enter the crypto scene. BinoFi could mimic Dogecoin's success or perform even better than the memecoin in the long run due to the project’s high utility and application. One important feature that sets BinoFi apart is its cross-chain trading capacity. The technological upgrade makes interoperability simpler and more efficient which is something the Web3 community is constantly trying to solve. The cross-chain element will facilitate asset transfer from one blockchain to another without traders and market participants sourcing risky third parties or using wrapped tokens. Will BinoFi’s BINO reach $1 in 2025? BinoFi’s presale is performing better than what developers had anticipated. The project has met high demand in the industry as retail and institutional players pile in for a slice of the cake. Although the current price of BINO tokens is only $0.02, experts anticipate a 5,000% upsurge in 2025 that will drive BINO tokens past the $1 mark. Dogecoin will need to grow its market capitalization to a $1.4 trillion market cap for its investors to witness the same level of growth. The growth is not impossible but highly unlikely especially with macro headwinds intensifying the ongoing crypto market sell-off. BinoFi’s presale is the best investment vehicle for long-term investors looking for massive gains.

According to Arkham Intelligence, on 7 March 2025, the wallets received $77.5 million in Bitcoin and transferred this amount to three new addresses. This is the first time since the platform suddenly vanished in April 2016 that funds have been moved. ANCIENT DARKNET MARKET WAKES UP AFTER 9 YEARS WITH OVER $400M $BTC Wallets belonging to Nucleus Marketplace woke up this morning after 9 years of inactivity, transferring $77.5M worth of Bitcoin to 3 new wallets. Nucleus Marketplace wallets still hold $365M BTC. New addresses:… pic.twitter.com/JtPXBK8Aec — Arkham (@arkham) March 7, 2025 Nucleus Marketplace was an online marketplace active from 2014 to 2016 that used Bitcoin to sell various prohibited products, such as drugs and other products. It abruptly vanished in rather murky circumstances, which ignited discussions of an exit scam or a hack. Before it disappeared, it was said to hold more than 5,000 BTC, valued at over $2.25 million at that time. As such, these remaining funds are estimated to be worth $365 million due to the appreciation of Bitcoin. According to the blockchain explorers, some of the addresses involved in the transactions include 1GGe3, which was last active in April 2016. The three new wallets this money is being sent to are “bc1qm8,” “bc1qm0,” and “bc1qsh.” Speculations on the resurgence The activation of this wallet has raised issues regarding the individuals behind it, as well as the motive for those operations. The individuals can be the original admins, police, hackers or anyone else who could have access to the private keys. Some have joked that the funds might be going to the newly launched strategic Bitcoin reserve in the United States. In the new executive order, Bitcoin received from criminal activities will be used in the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. However, the nature or purpose of the transactions is still unknown. One user on X noted , “Right.. Just before the Summit.” In the ongoing White House crypto summit, President Trump has echoed dissatisfaction with the government’s approach to Bitcoin.

41301960,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=138269,1741389354,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Threatening AI Agents: Signal President Exposes Profound AI Privacy Risks,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/agentic-ai-privacy-security-risks/,"Are you ready to hand over your digital life to AI? Signal President Meredith Whittaker has issued a stark warning about agentic AI, painting a picture where convenience clashes head-on with critical AI privacy and security. At SXSW, Whittaker didn’t mince words, describing the burgeoning field of AI agents as potentially putting “your brain in a jar.” For crypto enthusiasts and tech-savvy individuals who value decentralization and data control, Whittaker’s concerns about agentic AI should resonate deeply. Let’s dive into why this advocate for secure communication is sounding the alarm on these seemingly helpful AI assistants. The Allure and the Abyss of Agentic AI: Understanding the Security Risks Imagine an AI that manages your daily digital grind – from booking concert tickets to coordinating with friends. Sounds like a dream, right? This is the promise of agentic AI . These intelligent systems are designed to act on your behalf, learning your preferences and automating tasks across the web. Whittaker illustrates this with a vivid example: Task Automation: AI agents can look up concerts, purchase tickets, add events to your calendar, and even message your friends about plans. Seamless Convenience: The goal is a hands-free digital experience, where the AI handles the mundane, freeing up your time. However, this convenience comes at a steep price, according to Whittaker. To perform these actions, agentic AI needs unprecedented access to your personal data and systems. This is where the security risks begin to surface. Deep Dive into the Privacy Issues: Why Agentic AI Raises Red Flags Whittaker meticulously breaks down the level of access agentic AI requires, revealing a concerning landscape of potential privacy issues : Access Point Privacy Implication Web Browser Control AI needs to navigate and operate your browser, potentially monitoring browsing history and online behavior. Financial Data Access Access to credit card information for purchases exposes sensitive financial details. Calendar and Messaging App Integration Access to personal schedules and communications reveals private conversations and plans. System-Wide Permissions “Root-like” access across your devices and databases means potentially unrestricted data visibility. Cloud Processing Data likely processed on remote servers, raising concerns about data storage, jurisdiction, and potential breaches. Whittaker emphasizes that this level of access, often “in the clear” due to encryption limitations in current models, creates significant privacy issues . The data needed to power these sophisticated agentic AI systems is unlikely to be processed locally on your device. Instead, it’s almost certainly transmitted to cloud servers, amplifying the security risks and potential for data exploitation. The Blood-Brain Barrier Breach: Agentic AI and Data Confluence Whittaker uses a powerful metaphor to describe the architectural shift agentic AI represents: breaching the “blood-brain barrier” between the application layer and the operating system layer. What does this mean in practical terms? Data Muddying: Agentic AI blurs the lines between separate services, conjoining data from various applications into a single, accessible pool. Privacy Undermining: If privacy-focused apps like Signal integrate with agentic AI, the very privacy they offer could be compromised as the AI needs access to message content. Surveillance Model Amplification: Whittaker connects the rise of agentic AI to the existing “bigger is better AI paradigm,” built on mass data collection and surveillance, warning of further privacy erosion. Her concerns echo broader anxieties within the cryptocurrency and privacy communities about centralized data control and the potential for misuse of personal information. The promise of a “magic genie bot” shouldn’t blind us to the underlying security risks and privacy issues inherent in agentic AI . Actionable Insights: Navigating the Agentic AI Landscape So, what can you do to stay informed and protect your AI privacy as agentic AI evolves? Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date on the developments in agentic AI and the ongoing discussions around its implications. Question Integration: Be critical of applications and services proposing agentic AI features, especially concerning data access and processing. Prioritize Privacy Tools: Continue to support and utilize privacy-focused technologies and platforms that minimize data collection and maximize user control. Advocate for Regulation: Engage in conversations and advocate for responsible AI development and regulations that prioritize user privacy and data security. Conclusion: A Call for Caution in the Age of Agentic AI Meredith Whittaker’s warning serves as a crucial reality check amidst the hype surrounding agentic AI . While the allure of AI assistants managing our digital lives is strong, the potential security risks and privacy issues are equally profound. As we venture further into the age of AI, maintaining a critical perspective and prioritizing user privacy will be paramount. The future of AI privacy and security depends on informed choices and proactive measures to ensure convenience doesn’t come at the cost of fundamental rights.

The technology applications automate executions including actions and transactions in a blockchain transaction. These contracts facilitate trusted transactions and agreements between pseudonymous buyers to auto-execute when certain predetermined conditions are met. Some of the largest smart contracting platforms include Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano. Although these projects have growth potential, investors have discovered a new DeFi gem that could yield better returns this year. Smart contracts shape how traders interact with crypto assets Smart contracts have now cemented their use cases and applications in the crypto arena through projects like Solana and Cardano. These automated technology applications have become part and parcel of everyday activities for crypto participants, traders, and investors. Meanwhile, BinoFi is taking the crypto industry on a different trajectory by introducing a unique product that DeFi users should find interesting. BinoFi developers plan to unveil a one-of-one cryptocurrency exchange. And no, this will not be your typical centralized platform like Binance or decentralized exchange like Uniswap. BinoFi’s crypto exchange is a hybrid crypto exchange platform with improved features from both centralized and decentralized exchanges. The platform has unveiled a presale that is distributing BINO tokens to investors at the rate of $0.02 per token. The presale is barely days old but has analysts speaking about its undervalued state. Many believe the project will experience an upsurge after going live once all 20 presale phases are completed. What makes the presale unique is the ICO organization. BinoFi’s presale has organized gradual price increases in each phase to ensure both early adopters and long-term holders can benefit from it. The presale also promotes fair distribution of the crypto assets to earn the trust of retail traders. The team guarantees that the project does not have any private sales and that 100% is public sale to prevent manipulation from larger players and institutions. The team has also set measures in place to encourage ICO participants to hold their crypto assets even after launch. ICO participants have a chance to stake their BINO holdings immediately after the Token Generation Event (TGE) for an early staking bonus. BinoFi ICO participants qualify to join BinoFi DAO The ICO participants will also be eligible to join the BinoFi DAO for governance and decision-making on major issues influencing the protocol. Holding BINO tokens will also unlock exclusive trading benefits for users. Traders will get up to 50% discounts on trading fees from just holding BINO tokens. BinoFi aspires to be a self-sustaining ecosystem with inbuilt revenue sources that make it more resilient to harsh crypto conditions. The protocol’s primary revenue streams will emanate from trading fees through its hybrid crypto exchange platform. BINO is among the few projects that have shown interest in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI). AI-powered trading tools provide a premium revenue stream that could serve both retail and institutional investors. The BinoFi team is developing AI Trade Bots, Institutional API & HFT tools, and AI-driven Market Sentiment and insights providers. Users will be required to pay a monthly subscription fee for pro-level trading automation & insights, fees will be used in the buy-back and burn of BINO tokens, liquidity and community rewards.

The body, which comprises the securities regulators in all the US states, Canadian provinces, and Mexico, described it as a “critical threat.” According to its press release , it developed a list of major risks facing retail investors by surveying securities regulators in the US and Canada and examining what they spent the most time investigating. The survey showed that most of the scams used marketing tactics that manipulated investors’ emotions. While most scams involved marketing digital assets and AI investments, NASAA observed that the scammers used traditional social media platforms to target their victims. In terms of the prevalence of use, Facebook had 31.7%, text-based platforms like WhatsApp and Instagram had 31.3%, short-form video platforms such as Instagram reels and TikTok had 19%, while long-form video platforms like Vimeo and YouTube had 14.1%. As the Association noted, scams are prevalent on digital platforms because they are effective in reaching a wide audience as quickly as possible. This allowed these scammers to have access to a wide group of victims. AI functioned as both a scam tool and a tactic Meanwhile, the group also observed that scammers are increasingly relying on artificial intelligence tools to create content and graphics and deepfake audio and videos. It expects this to increase in 2025 and highlights the market for it. It wrote: “The bad actors are creating and selling AI-powered trading bots, selling equity in companies, purportedly developing an AI model, or perpetrating account takeover scams.” Beyond using it as a tool, NASAA noted that scammers are also promoting AI-related financial instruments. According to the president of the Association, Leslie Van Buskirk, AI technology’s rapid growth has given scammers new tools to steal from users Buskirk said: “AI investing is the latest technology to make waves in the investing landscape and fraudsters are pitching new investments that often have nothing to do with the latest tech developments and instead play on fear of missing out or get rich quick schemes along with other heightened emotions.” In order to protect investors from these scams, state securities administrators believe that registration at the state level is essential. The NASAA enforcement section committee co-chair Amanda Senn noted that investors need to confirm the registration status of anyone promoting a financial institution to them on the internet or social media before they invest. Crypto-related scams and losses continue to happen The statement from NASAA only confirms earlier opinions from other regulators, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), about the prevalence of financial scams connected to digital assets. Last month, the FBI revealed that it has saved almost $300 million in crypto-related investment fraud for thousands of victims. Interestingly, scams are not the only challenge that retail investors face. Even those who avoid investing in fraudulent crypto assets and buy real ones are still at risk of losing their funds to phishing attacks, hacks, and other security compromises like the Bybit hack that resulted in the loss of more than $1.4 billion worth of Ethereum. Onchain transaction data showing phishing attack (Source: Scam Sniffer on X) Today, ScamSniffer reported that a victim lost over $117,000 in two phishing attacks. The attacker used the Permit2 phishing signature to steal the funds without the victim’s knowledge. Unsurprisingly, most of these phishing links are also scam promotions on social media.

Whispers are turning into announcements as leading cryptocurrency exchange Kraken reportedly sets its sights on a public offering. According to a recent report from Bloomberg, amplified by Unfolded on X, Kraken is aiming for a Q1 2026 Initial Public Offering (IPO). This exciting development positions Kraken alongside other major crypto players like Gemini, Bullish, and Circle, all considered frontrunners in the race to become publicly traded crypto companies. Let’s dive into what this Kraken IPO could mean for the crypto landscape and for you as an investor. Why is a Kraken IPO a Big Deal for the Crypto Space? A Kraken IPO isn’t just another company going public; it’s a potential watershed moment for the entire cryptocurrency industry. For years, the crypto market has been viewed by some as a nascent, volatile, and somewhat fringe financial sector. However, the increasing maturity of companies like Kraken and their pursuit of IPOs signals a significant shift towards mainstream acceptance and institutional legitimacy. Here’s why this is such a pivotal development: Validation of the Crypto Industry: A successful crypto IPO by a major exchange like Kraken would send a powerful message to traditional financial markets and regulators. It would demonstrate that cryptocurrency businesses can achieve the scale, stability, and transparency required to operate as public companies. Increased Investor Confidence: Publicly traded companies are subject to stringent regulatory oversight and reporting requirements. This added layer of accountability could boost investor confidence in the crypto market, attracting both retail and institutional investors who may have been hesitant to enter the space before. Access to Capital for Growth: An IPO provides Kraken with access to significant capital. This influx of funds can be strategically deployed to fuel further expansion, enhance technology infrastructure, develop innovative products and services, and potentially acquire other companies in the crypto ecosystem. Enhanced Brand Recognition and Trust: Becoming a public company can significantly elevate Kraken’s brand profile and build trust among users. Public scrutiny and reporting can foster greater transparency and accountability, which are crucial for long-term success in the competitive crypto exchange market. What Does Q1 2026 Target Mean for the Kraken Exchange IPO Timeline? While Q1 2026 might seem like a distant target, it’s important to understand that preparing for a cryptocurrency IPO is a complex and time-consuming process. Several factors influence the timeline, and Q1 2026 likely represents a carefully considered target date. Here’s a breakdown of potential steps and considerations: Phase Activities Timeline Considerations Pre-IPO Planning & Preparation Legal and regulatory compliance Financial audits and reporting Corporate governance structure enhancement Underwriter selection Drafting of prospectus Can take 12-18 months or longer depending on complexity and regulatory requirements. Regulatory Review & Approval SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) review in the US (if applicable) or relevant regulatory body in chosen jurisdiction. Addressing regulatory queries and revisions. Varies depending on regulatory workload and complexity of the filing. Can take several months. Marketing & Roadshow Investor presentations and roadshows to gauge interest. Refinement of IPO pricing and share allocation strategy. Typically a few weeks leading up to the IPO date. Market conditions and investor sentiment play a crucial role. IPO Launch & Trading Pricing of shares and IPO launch. Commencement of trading on a stock exchange. Final step, dependent on successful completion of previous phases. The Q1 2026 timeframe suggests that Kraken is already well into the pre-IPO planning phase and is aiming for a launch window that allows sufficient time for regulatory approvals and market conditions to align favorably. It’s crucial to remember that IPO timelines are not set in stone and can be subject to delays based on various internal and external factors. What Challenges Might Kraken Face on its Path to a Crypto IPO? While the prospect of a Kraken exchange IPO is exciting, the path to becoming a publicly traded crypto company is not without its hurdles. Kraken, like other crypto firms considering this route, will need to navigate a complex landscape of challenges: Regulatory Scrutiny: The cryptocurrency industry is still under intense regulatory scrutiny globally. Kraken will need to demonstrate robust compliance frameworks and address any potential regulatory concerns to gain approval for its IPO. This includes navigating varying regulations across different jurisdictions if they operate internationally. Market Volatility: The crypto market is known for its volatility. This inherent volatility could impact investor sentiment and Kraken’s valuation during the IPO process. Maintaining consistent performance and demonstrating resilience in the face of market fluctuations will be key. Competition: The crypto exchange market is highly competitive. Kraken competes with numerous established players and emerging platforms. They will need to clearly articulate their competitive advantages and growth strategies to attract investors in the public market. Public Market Demands: Operating as a public company comes with increased demands for transparency, quarterly reporting, and shareholder accountability. Kraken will need to adapt its operational structure and culture to meet these new requirements and manage investor expectations effectively. Beyond Kraken: Why are Other Crypto Companies Eyeing IPOs? The report highlighting Kraken’s IPO ambitions also mentions Gemini, Bullish, and Circle as potential crypto companies IPO candidates. This trend of crypto firms exploring public listings reflects a broader evolution within the industry. Several factors are driving this movement: Maturity of the Crypto Market: The crypto market has matured significantly over the past decade. Companies like Kraken, Gemini, Bullish, and Circle have grown into substantial businesses with established user bases, revenue streams, and operational infrastructure. They are reaching a stage where an IPO becomes a logical next step for growth and expansion. Investor Demand: There is growing investor appetite for exposure to the cryptocurrency market through traditional investment vehicles. IPOs of reputable crypto companies offer a way for both institutional and retail investors to gain access to this asset class within a regulated and familiar framework. Capital Raising Opportunities: As mentioned earlier, IPOs provide significant capital infusion. This capital is crucial for crypto companies to invest in innovation, expand their services, and scale their operations to meet the growing demand for crypto products and services. Legitimacy and Mainstream Adoption: Public listings contribute to the overall legitimacy and mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. They signal that crypto is moving beyond the fringes and becoming an integral part of the global financial system. Actionable Insights: What Should Crypto Investors Watch For? The potential crypto IPO wave, spearheaded by companies like Kraken, presents exciting opportunities and developments for crypto investors. Here are some actionable insights to keep in mind: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on news and updates regarding Kraken’s IPO plans and the IPO landscape for other crypto companies. Follow reputable crypto news sources and financial media outlets for the latest developments. Due Diligence is Key: If you are considering investing in crypto company IPOs, conduct thorough due diligence. Understand the company’s business model, financial performance, regulatory compliance, and competitive positioning. Don’t invest based on hype alone. Understand IPO Risks: IPOs can be volatile investments, especially in a relatively new and dynamic sector like cryptocurrency. Be aware of the risks involved and invest according to your risk tolerance and investment goals. Long-Term Perspective: Consider crypto company IPOs as long-term investments. The crypto market is still evolving, and the long-term potential of these companies will depend on their ability to adapt, innovate, and navigate the evolving regulatory landscape. Conclusion: A Transformative Moment for Crypto? Kraken’s reported plans for a Kraken IPO in Q1 2026 are more than just company news; they represent a potentially transformative moment for the cryptocurrency industry. As major crypto exchanges like Kraken move towards public listings, they are paving the way for greater mainstream acceptance, increased investor confidence, and accelerated growth of the crypto market. While challenges remain, the momentum is building, and the coming years could witness a significant evolution in how the world perceives and interacts with cryptocurrencies. The cryptocurrency IPO trend is one to watch closely, as it could reshape the financial landscape and unlock new opportunities in the digital asset space.

Newcomers in the industry are better off doubling down on utility projects such as BinoFi while minimizing exposure to crypto assets driven by hype, hope, and trending memes. Memecoin investors were taken by storm after U.S. President Donald Trump entered the space with a memecoin project that has since cost 500,000 investors to lose money. Trump’s memecoin flops as investors eye a new utility project U.S. president and crypto advocate Donald Trump launched his memecoin, OFFICIAL TRUMP days before his inauguration ceremony. The project became an instant hit amassing over $5 billion in market capitalization hours after launch. Early investors greatly benefited from the hype. However, more than 500,000 investors have lost money after the memecoin plummeted. According to data from crypto price aggregator CoinMarketCap, the memecoin is down 82% from its all-time high. OFFICIAL TRUMP's investors are now shifting their focus to BinoFi in an attempt to recover some of their lost funds. BinoFi has proven itself to be a market leader in crypto exchange activities. Unlike memecoins, BinoFi has the real-world utility of supporting the crypto market with exchange-related services and modern trading solutions. BinoFi’s presale is currently underway and investors are rushing before BINO prices surge. Memecoin investors need to take a breather by switching to high-return utility alternatives like BinoFi as they wait for their preferred niche to stabilize. Memecoin activity cools off as BinoFi prepares for a 1200% surge According to data from CoinGecko, memecoin activity has cooled off as investors remain wary of imminent market drops and bad launches. Smart investors have chosen to buy BinoFi’s presale instead of sitting on the sidelines. BinoFi’s presale offers investors a chance to capitalize on an utility project before everyone else joins the bandwagon. The project’s presale has just unveiled its first presale phase where investors rush to get a slice of the cake. BINO tokens are currently available for purchase for only $0.02. The team has set a launch price of $0.3 which automatically makes investments made during the current phase surge by 1,200% when the launch happens. The presale’s demand is increasing day by day and the team expects the ICO to sell out before the dates they had initially planned. Buying BinoFi now presents a similar opportunity to buying Bitcoin in 2009. The BinoFi infrastructure is based on a DeFi crypto exchange platform offering traders unique perks from both centralized and decentralized exchanges. The project seeks to close the gaps by merging the two exchange features. Users will enjoy the security and self-custody of decentralized exchanges while simultaneously exploiting deep liquidity from centralized exchange liquidity pools. BinoFi will create the next wave of millionaires Unlike memecoins that lack utility, BinoFi has unveiled the first-ever hybrid crypto exchange with a purpose-driven ecosystem powered by BINO tokens. The tokens will be used in governance through BinoFi’s decentralized autonomous organization. This implies that BINO holders will automatically qualify to vote and take part in decision-making activities affecting the DeFi protocol.

Former President Donald Trump is reportedly making a bold move, pushing hard for stablecoin legislation to be passed in the United States Congress before the upcoming August recess. This news, initially reported by Unfolded on X, has sent ripples through the digital asset community, sparking both excitement and anticipation. But what exactly does this mean for you, the average crypto enthusiast, investor, or someone just dipping their toes into the world of digital currencies? Let’s dive into the details and unpack what this urgent push for stablecoin regulation could entail. Why is Stablecoin Legislation Suddenly a Priority? The timing of this push from Trump raises some crucial questions. Why now? And why stablecoins specifically? Stablecoins , cryptocurrencies pegged to a stable reserve asset like the US dollar, have become increasingly vital to the crypto ecosystem. They act as a bridge between traditional finance and the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, offering stability for trading, lending, and everyday transactions within the digital economy. Here’s why stablecoin regulation is gaining momentum: Growing Market Cap and Adoption: The stablecoin market has exploded in recent years, with major players like Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC) commanding billions in market capitalization. This growth has caught the attention of regulators globally, concerned about systemic risks and consumer protection. Regulatory Scrutiny Intensifies: Global regulatory bodies like the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and national agencies like the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have been increasingly vocal about the need to regulate stablecoins. Concerns range from money laundering and illicit finance to the potential impact on monetary policy. Political Will and Election Year Dynamics: With the US presidential elections on the horizon, Trump ‘s involvement could be politically motivated. Positioning himself as pro-innovation while also addressing regulatory concerns could be a strategic move to appeal to various voter demographics. Crypto has become a surprisingly hot topic in the current political landscape. Industry Lobbying Efforts: The cryptocurrency industry itself has been actively lobbying for clear and consistent crypto regulation , including for stablecoins. Clarity in regulation can foster innovation and attract more institutional investment, benefiting the industry as a whole. Decoding Trump’s Stance on Crypto Regulation While traditionally perceived as skeptical towards cryptocurrencies, Donald Trump’s recent statements and actions suggest a potential shift in his approach. His administration previously saw some level of regulatory ambiguity around digital assets. However, this new push for stablecoin legislation could indicate a more proactive stance. Is this a genuine interest in fostering responsible innovation, or is it a politically calculated move? Consider these points to understand the nuances of Trump’s potential position: Aspect Potential Interpretation Push for Legislation Before August Recess Indicates urgency and a desire for quick action, possibly to score political points or address immediate economic concerns. Focus on Stablecoins Suggests a targeted approach, recognizing stablecoins as a critical and relatively less volatile segment of the crypto market compared to more speculative cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Alignment with Industry Needs Could signal a willingness to work with the crypto industry to create a regulatory framework that is both effective and innovation-friendly. Potential for Future Crypto Policy Stablecoin legislation could be a stepping stone towards broader crypto regulation in the US, setting a precedent for how other digital assets are treated. What Could Stablecoin Legislation Look Like? The specifics of the potential stablecoin legislation are still unclear, but we can anticipate some key areas it might address: Issuer Licensing and Registration: Legislation could mandate that stablecoin issuers obtain licenses and register with regulatory bodies, ensuring accountability and oversight. Reserve Requirements and Audits: To maintain stability and investor confidence, laws might require stablecoin issuers to hold sufficient reserves backing their tokens, subject to regular audits and transparency requirements. Consumer Protection Measures: Legislation could include provisions to protect consumers from fraud, market manipulation, and other risks associated with stablecoins, similar to protections in traditional finance. Interoperability and Payment Systems: Laws could aim to integrate stablecoins into existing payment systems and promote interoperability with traditional financial infrastructure, fostering wider adoption and utility. Clarity on Regulatory Jurisdiction: Defining which agencies (like the SEC, CFTC, or a newly formed crypto-specific regulator) have jurisdiction over stablecoins will be crucial for regulatory clarity and industry compliance. Impact on the Digital Assets Market and Beyond The passage of comprehensive stablecoin legislation could have far-reaching consequences for the digital assets market and the broader financial landscape: Increased Legitimacy and Institutional Adoption: Clear regulation can legitimize the stablecoin market, attracting more institutional investors and mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. Market Stability and Reduced Volatility: Robust regulatory frameworks can enhance the stability of stablecoins, making them more reliable for payments, trading, and other financial activities. Innovation and Growth in the Crypto Sector: Regulatory clarity can foster innovation by providing a clear roadmap for crypto businesses to operate and grow within the US. Potential for CBDCs: Some argue that regulating stablecoins is a necessary step before the US considers launching its own Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), as it establishes a regulatory framework for digital currencies. Global Regulatory Influence: US stablecoin legislation could set a global precedent, influencing how other countries regulate digital assets and shaping the future of the international crypto landscape. What Should Crypto Enthusiasts Do Now? This development is a call to action for the crypto community. Here’s what you can do to stay informed and potentially influence the outcome: Stay Updated: Follow reputable crypto news sources and regulatory updates closely. Monitor developments in Congress and statements from key policymakers. Engage with Industry Advocacy Groups: Support organizations that are advocating for sensible crypto regulation and engage in discussions about the best way forward. Contact Your Representatives: Reach out to your elected officials to express your views on stablecoin regulation and the importance of fostering innovation in the crypto space. Educate Yourself and Others: Understand the nuances of stablecoins, their benefits, and potential risks. Share accurate information and help dispel misinformation. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Crypto? Trump’s push for stablecoin legislation before the August recess marks a potentially pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry. Whether this initiative stems from genuine conviction, political strategy, or a combination of both, the outcome could significantly shape the future of digital assets in the United States and globally. The coming weeks will be crucial in observing how this unfolds and what concrete legislative steps are taken. One thing is clear: the conversation around crypto regulation is intensifying, and stablecoins are squarely in the spotlight. Stay tuned, the crypto landscape is about to get even more interesting!

The market reaction has kept ETH pinned below $2,142, struggling to establish a bullish recovery as sellers remain in control. Ethereum price dropped below $2,100 on Friday, amid inflation readings in US NFP Ethereum’s price decline below $2,100 on Friday underscores bearish dominance, exacerbated by heightened macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from the latest US NFP report . The payroll data, which came in hotter than expected, showing rising unemployment which raised concerns over persistent inflation, strengthening the case for a hawkish Federal Reserve stance. Ethereum Price Analysis: 4-hourly Chart Bears eyeing $2,000 on 4-Hour Chart Ethereum price remains under downward pressure on the 4-hour chart after failing to break past the $2,319 resistance level. The rejection at this key price ceiling has reinforced bearish momentum, with the latest candlesticks showing increased selling pressure near the $2,156 pivot. A confluence of technical indicators signals potential downside risk toward the $2,000 psychological support level. The Donchian Channel (DC) highlights the recent price contraction, with the upper boundary at $2,319 and the lower support band at $1,993. Ethereum Price Analysis: 4-hourly Chart The failed breakout attempt near the upper band suggests that bulls lack the strength to sustain a move higher, leaving the door open for further declines. The price action is currently hovering around the middle DC line, signaling indecision, but with a tilt toward the downside as volume spikes on red candles. Bearish momentum is further evident in the breakdown from the highlighted price cluster, where Ethereum shed 7.53% over six consecutive 4-hour candles. The red zone illustrates a liquidity flush, likely triggering stop-loss cascades from leveraged long positions, adding to the selling pressure. If the $2,156 support fails, Ethereum could slide toward $2,000, aligning with the lower Donchian boundary. On the flip side, a reclaim of $2,200 could reignite bullish sentiment and set up another test of the $2,319 resistance. Ethereum Price Forecast: Daily time frame chart Bulls Struggles Below $2,142—Will $2,009 Support Hold? Ethereum price forecast signals continue to lean bearish on the 24-hour chart, struggling to hold above the $2,142 level after facing strong resistance at $2,258. The latest daily candle reflects increased selling pressure, with ETH losing 2.73% in the session, confirming persistent bearish sentiment. The Keltner Channel (KC) highlights this downside momentum, as the price remains close to the lower band at $2,009, signaling the potential for further declines if the current support structure collapses. Ethereum Price Analysis: 24-hourly Chart A clear downward trajectory is evident as ETH price has remained below the middle KC line of $2,417, reinforcing the bearish control of market structure. The sharp -7.53% drop over a single daily candle suggests that leverage liquidations could be playing a role in accelerating the selloff. If Ethereum fails to defend $2,100, a deeper retracement toward the $2,009 support appears likely, where buyers might attempt to reestablish control. Despite the bearish setup, a bounce from current levels could shift momentum in favor of the bulls. If Ethereum reclaims $2,200 and sustains a move above the $2,258 resistance, it could target the $2,417 mid-KC level, with an extended rally opening the door for a potential retest of $2,825. However, with volatility increasing and bears dominating, Ethereum risks further downside unless demand steps in decisively. Ethereum Price Outlook Today Ethereum’s technical landscape reflects conflicting signals balance between bearish macroeconomic pressures and potential short-term rebounds. The 24-hour chart highlights key support at $2,009, while the 4-hour ETH price chart signals immediate downside risks following the rejection at $2,319.

41302966,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=138275,1741391114,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Trump’s Bold Bitcoin Stance: US Government to Become a Crypto Hoarder?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-bitcoin-us-government/,"In a surprising turn of events that has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency world, former U.S. President Donald Trump made a powerful declaration at the White House Crypto Summit: “I will never sell Bitcoin.” This statement marks a significant shift in the U.S. government’s approach to digital assets, particularly Bitcoin , and has ignited discussions across the globe. For crypto enthusiasts and investors alike, this news is nothing short of monumental. But what exactly does this mean, and how will it reshape the future of Bitcoin and the U.S.’s role in the crypto ecosystem? Why Trump’s Bitcoin Announcement at the Crypto Summit is Monumental? Imagine the scene: the White House Crypto Summit, a gathering of industry leaders, policymakers, and innovators. Donald Trump , a figure known for his impactful pronouncements, steps up to the podium and states unequivocally, “I will never sell Bitcoin .” This wasn’t just a casual remark; it was a deliberate and strategic announcement with far-reaching implications. Here’s why this moment is being hailed as monumental: Shift in Government Policy: For years, the U.S. government, like many others, has been navigating the complexities of cryptocurrency regulation and management. The fact that a former U.S. President, with potential future political ambitions, is making such a pro- Bitcoin statement signals a potential paradigm shift in how the U.S. government views and handles digital assets. End to Bitcoin Sales: Trump specifically mentioned that the U.S. federal government had seized a substantial amount of Bitcoin – around 200,000 BTC – through legal actions. While a significant portion was reportedly sold under the Biden administration, Trump declared an end to this practice. This effectively removes a potentially large and unpredictable source of selling pressure from the Bitcoin market. New Accumulation Strategy: Perhaps the most intriguing part of Trump’s statement is his assertion that the Treasury and Department of Commerce will actively seek “new ways to accumulate more Bitcoin without burdening taxpayers.” This suggests a proactive approach to Bitcoin adoption by the U.S. government, moving beyond simply seizing and selling to strategically holding and potentially increasing its Bitcoin holding . The US Government’s Bitcoin Stash: From Seller to Holder? The narrative around the U.S. government and Bitcoin has been largely about seizures and subsequent sales. Understanding the context of this shift from seller to potential holder is crucial: Aspect Previous Policy (Pre-Trump’s Announcement) New Policy (Post-Trump’s Announcement) Bitcoin Seizure Government agencies seize Bitcoin through law enforcement actions. Continues (as part of law enforcement). Bitcoin Disposal Majority of seized Bitcoin was sold, particularly during the Biden administration. Cessation of Bitcoin sales from seized holdings, starting from the announcement date. Bitcoin Strategy No clear strategy for holding or leveraging seized Bitcoin beyond liquidation. Active strategy to explore accumulating more Bitcoin without taxpayer burden. Market Impact Sales of seized Bitcoin could contribute to market volatility and downward pressure. Holding seized Bitcoin and potential accumulation could reduce selling pressure and signal long-term confidence. This table highlights the transformative nature of Trump’s declaration. The U.S. government, once a consistent seller, is now signaling a potential transition to a Bitcoin holding strategy. This change in stance could have profound effects on market dynamics and investor sentiment. Trump’s Bitcoin Strategy: What Does ‘Accumulate Without Burdening Taxpayers’ Mean? Trump’s statement about accumulating Bitcoin “without burdening taxpayers” raises intriguing questions. How exactly might the U.S. government achieve this? Here are a few possibilities: Continued Seizures: Law enforcement seizures will likely remain a primary source of Bitcoin acquisition. By simply holding onto seized Bitcoin instead of selling, the government’s holdings will naturally increase over time as criminal activities involving crypto continue to be addressed. Strategic Investments (Indirectly): While direct taxpayer-funded purchases might be politically sensitive, the government could explore indirect methods. For example, revenue generated from fines, penalties, or asset forfeitures related to crypto crimes could be strategically reinvested into acquiring Bitcoin . Public-Private Partnerships: The government could potentially collaborate with private sector entities in the crypto space. This might involve partnerships that allow the government to earn or acquire Bitcoin through various mechanisms, without direct budgetary allocations. Mining Revenue (Hypothetical & Unlikely): Although less probable given current U.S. policy, in a more radical scenario, the government could even explore the possibility of utilizing seized crypto mining equipment or engaging in mining activities using forfeited energy resources. However, this is highly speculative and faces significant political and regulatory hurdles. The exact methods remain to be seen, but Trump’s commitment to Bitcoin accumulation is clear. This proactive approach signals a deeper engagement with the cryptocurrency space and a potential recognition of Bitcoin’s strategic importance. Is This a Game Changer for Bitcoin Adoption? The implications of the U.S. government becoming a significant Bitcoin holder are far-reaching and could indeed be a game changer for Bitcoin adoption globally: Validation and Legitimacy: When a major world power like the U.S. government signals its intention to hold Bitcoin , it lends significant validation to the asset class. This can help to overcome skepticism and encourage broader institutional and retail adoption. Reduced Market Volatility (Potentially): By removing the U.S. government as a potential seller, and perhaps even becoming a buyer, the supply-demand dynamics of Bitcoin could be positively influenced. Reduced selling pressure and increased demand could potentially lead to greater price stability and upward momentum over time. Increased Institutional Interest: Institutional investors often look to government policies and regulatory signals when making investment decisions. A pro- Bitcoin stance from the U.S. government could further incentivize institutional investment in Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Geopolitical Implications: In a world increasingly shaped by digital technologies, nations are vying for leadership in the crypto space. The U.S. government embracing Bitcoin could position the U.S. as a more crypto-friendly nation, potentially attracting talent, innovation, and investment in the blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors. Challenges and Considerations of the US Government Holding Bitcoin While the prospect of the U.S. government holding Bitcoin is exciting for many, it’s important to acknowledge the challenges and considerations that come with such a significant move: Security and Custody: Securing a large Bitcoin holding is a complex undertaking. The government would need to implement robust security measures to protect against theft, hacking, and loss of private keys. Custody solutions, potentially involving hardware wallets and multi-signature setups, would be crucial. Regulatory Clarity: While Trump’s announcement is a strong signal, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. remains evolving. Clear and consistent regulations are needed to provide a stable framework for government Bitcoin holding and operations. Volatility Management: Bitcoin’s price volatility is a well-known characteristic. The government would need to develop strategies to manage the potential fluctuations in the value of its Bitcoin holding , especially for accounting and financial reporting purposes. Transparency and Accountability: Public scrutiny and accountability are paramount when it comes to government assets. Mechanisms for transparency regarding the government’s Bitcoin holding , transactions, and management practices would be essential to maintain public trust. Despite these challenges, Trump’s declaration marks a potentially transformative moment for Bitcoin and the U.S. government’s relationship with cryptocurrency. The shift from seller to holder could usher in a new era of government engagement with digital assets, with significant implications for the future of finance and technology. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Bitcoin and US Crypto Policy? Donald Trump’s announcement at the White House Crypto Summit – “I will never sell Bitcoin ” – is more than just a headline; it’s a powerful signal of a potential sea change in U.S. cryptocurrency policy. By committing to holding seized Bitcoin and exploring ways to accumulate more, the U.S. government could be on the verge of becoming a significant player in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

This has spurred a debate about cypherpunk values. When it became clear that the Lazarus Group hackers were swapping their stolen ETH for bitcoins on THORChain, an immediate vote to halt ETH to BTC swaps was passed, and then almost immediately reverted by other voters. THORChain made $5.5 million from its role as the main conduit for North Korean hackers laundering their ill-gotten gains, according to THORChain Explorer. The protocol saw $5.9 billion in swap volume in the 10 days from Feb. 22 through March 3. After 10 days, the hackers managed to launder all of the nearly 500,000 ether they stole into bitcoin.

The political winds are shifting, and the crypto landscape might be on the verge of a seismic change. Former U.S. President Donald Trump has thrown down the gauntlet, declaring an end to what he terms President Biden’s ‘war on crypto.’ This isn’t just political rhetoric; it’s a direct challenge to the current regulatory environment that many in the digital asset space view as stifling innovation and growth. Let’s dive into what Trump’s bold statements mean for the future of crypto regulation and, more importantly, for your investments. Decoding Trump’s Crypto Promise: What Does ‘Ending the War’ Really Mean? During his Crypto Summit speech, Trump didn’t mince words. He directly addressed the concerns of many in the crypto industry regarding regulatory pressure. He specifically called out ‘Chokepoint 2.0,’ a term that has become synonymous with the alleged strategy of regulators to indirectly target the crypto industry by pressuring banks to cut off services to crypto businesses. According to CoinDesk reports, this pressure has manifested in banks closing accounts of crypto firms and entrepreneurs, effectively creating roadblocks for fund transfers to and from cryptocurrency exchanges. Trump’s promise to ‘end the war’ and roll back ‘Chokepoint 2.0’ suggests a significant shift in approach. But what exactly could this entail? Here’s a breakdown of potential implications: Easing Regulatory Pressure: Trump’s administration could instruct regulatory bodies like the SEC and FinCEN to adopt a less aggressive stance towards the crypto industry. This could mean fewer enforcement actions and a more collaborative approach to rule-making. Unblocking Banking Access for Crypto Businesses: Rolling back ‘Chokepoint 2.0’ implies actively working to ensure crypto businesses have fair access to banking services. This could involve clarifying regulations for banks or even enacting policies that prevent discriminatory practices against crypto firms. Fostering Innovation: By reducing regulatory hurdles and improving banking access, Trump’s policies could aim to create a more favorable environment for crypto innovation and growth within the U.S. Crypto Regulation Under Biden: Understanding the ‘War’ To fully grasp the significance of Trump’s promise, it’s crucial to understand the context of the current regulatory landscape under President Biden. While the Biden administration hasn’t explicitly declared a ‘war on crypto,’ many in the industry feel that recent regulatory actions and pronouncements have been overly restrictive and even hostile. Here are some key aspects of the current crypto regulation environment often cited as evidence of this ‘war’: SEC Enforcement Actions: The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), under Chair Gary Gensler, has taken a firm stance, asserting jurisdiction over a wide range of crypto assets, deeming many as securities. This has led to numerous enforcement actions against crypto companies for alleged securities violations. Operation Chokepoint 2.0 Accusations: As Trump mentioned, the ‘Chokepoint 2.0’ accusation centers around the idea that regulators are using banks to indirectly control the crypto industry. Critics argue that this tactic stifles legitimate crypto businesses and pushes innovation offshore. Lack of Regulatory Clarity: A persistent complaint from the crypto industry is the lack of clear and consistent regulatory guidelines. This uncertainty makes it difficult for businesses to operate compliantly and discourages investment. Treasury Department Scrutiny: The Treasury Department, particularly through FinCEN and OFAC, has also increased its focus on crypto, emphasizing anti-money laundering (AML) and sanctions compliance, sometimes leading to stringent requirements and enforcement. The Potential Benefits of a Crypto-Friendly Trump Administration for Crypto Businesses If Trump’s promise translates into concrete policy changes, the benefits for crypto businesses could be substantial. Imagine a scenario where regulatory burdens are eased, and banking access is normalized. What could this unlock? Reduced Compliance Costs: Less aggressive regulation and clearer guidelines could significantly reduce the compliance costs for crypto companies, freeing up resources for innovation and growth. Increased Investment and Capital Flow: A more welcoming regulatory environment could attract greater investment into the crypto space, both from institutional investors and venture capital. Easier banking access would also facilitate smoother capital flow within the industry. Job Creation and Economic Growth: A thriving crypto sector, fueled by reduced regulatory friction, could lead to significant job creation in areas like software development, cybersecurity, and financial services. This, in turn, could contribute to broader economic growth. Innovation and Technological Advancement: With less fear of regulatory crackdowns, crypto businesses would be more incentivized to innovate and develop new blockchain-based technologies and applications, potentially benefiting various sectors beyond finance. Navigating the Challenges: Will Trump’s Promise Be Fully Realized? While Trump’s promise offers a beacon of hope for the crypto community, it’s crucial to approach it with a balanced perspective. Political promises are often easier made than kept, and the regulatory landscape is complex and influenced by numerous factors. Here are some potential challenges and considerations: Regulatory Inertia: Changing the course of regulatory bodies is not an overnight process. Even with a change in administration, regulatory agencies have established processes and priorities that can be slow to shift. Political and Public Sentiment: Public and political sentiment towards crypto can be volatile. Negative events or scandals in the crypto space could easily derail efforts to ease regulation, regardless of political promises. Global Regulatory Landscape: Crypto regulation is increasingly becoming a global issue. Even if the U.S. adopts a more crypto-friendly approach, international regulations and compliance requirements will still play a significant role for global crypto businesses. The Role of Congress: While presidential actions can influence regulatory agencies, significant and lasting changes in crypto regulation often require legislative action from Congress. The political makeup of Congress and bipartisan support for crypto-friendly legislation will be crucial. Actionable Insights: What Should Crypto Investors and Businesses Do Now? Trump’s statements have injected a dose of optimism into the crypto market. But what practical steps should crypto investors and businesses take in response? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on political developments and regulatory announcements related to crypto. Follow reputable news sources and industry publications to stay ahead of the curve. Engage with Policymakers: Support industry advocacy groups and initiatives that are working to educate policymakers about the benefits of crypto and advocate for sensible regulation. Prepare for Potential Regulatory Shifts: Businesses should review their compliance strategies and be prepared to adapt to potential changes in regulations, whether they become more lenient or stringent. Diversify and Manage Risk: While Trump’s promise is encouraging, the crypto market remains volatile. Diversification and prudent risk management are always essential investment strategies. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Crypto Regulation? Donald Trump’s pledge to end the ‘war on crypto’ marks a potentially pivotal moment for the digital asset industry. His focus on rolling back ‘Chokepoint 2.0’ and easing regulatory pressure resonates deeply with crypto businesses and investors who have long felt stifled by the current environment. While the path forward is uncertain and challenges remain, Trump’s bold promise injects a renewed sense of hope and anticipation into the crypto space. Whether this translates into a true ‘new dawn’ for crypto regulation remains to be seen, but the conversation has undoubtedly shifted, and the potential for significant change is now firmly on the table.

41303674,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=138285,1741392353,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Fierce AI Race: Microsoft Intensifies Efforts to Rival OpenAI’s Dominance,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/microsoft-ai-openai-competition-heats/,"The tech world is witnessing a fascinating power struggle as Microsoft, a long-time partner of OpenAI, is reportedly escalating its artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives. This strategic pivot signals a bold move by Microsoft to not just collaborate, but to directly compete with OpenAI, especially in powering its innovative products like the Copilot bot. For those in the cryptocurrency space, this intense competition mirrors the rapid innovation and rivalry we see in blockchain technologies, where companies constantly push boundaries to lead the next wave of technological advancement. Let’s dive into the details of Microsoft’s ambitious AI strategy and what it means for the future of technology. Why is Microsoft Stepping Up its AI Development Game? Microsoft’s increased focus on in-house AI development stems from a combination of strategic necessity and perhaps, a bit of competitive friction. Recent reports suggest that OpenAI has been less forthcoming with technical specifics about its advanced models, creating some tension in the relationship with Microsoft, despite the latter’s significant $14 billion investment. This has seemingly spurred Microsoft to become more self-reliant and explore diverse avenues for its AI ambitions. Here’s a breakdown of Microsoft’s multi-pronged approach: Building Proprietary AI Models: Microsoft has reportedly developed its own ‘reasoning’ AI models, internally benchmarked against OpenAI’s o1 and o3-mini models. This indicates a serious commitment to creating AI capabilities that are on par with, or even surpass, those of OpenAI. MAI Family of Models: Beyond individual models, Microsoft has also created a family of AI models known as MAI, directly competitive with OpenAI’s offerings. The potential plan to offer these models through an API later this year could position Microsoft as a significant player in the AI model marketplace, offering alternatives to businesses and developers. Exploring Alternative AI Partnerships: To diversify its AI resources, Microsoft is reportedly testing models from various leading AI companies like xAI (Elon Musk’s AI venture), Meta, Anthropic, and DeepSeek. This strategic move suggests Microsoft is hedging its bets, ensuring it isn’t solely reliant on OpenAI’s technology for critical products like Copilot. Strategic Talent Acquisition: The hiring of Mustafa Suleyman, co-founder of DeepMind and Inflection, to spearhead Microsoft’s AI efforts is a clear indication of the company’s seriousness. Suleyman’s expertise and leadership are expected to be pivotal in driving Microsoft’s ambitious AI agenda. OpenAI Competition : A Sign of a Maturing AI Landscape? The evolving relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI, from close collaboration to apparent OpenAI competition , highlights a significant trend in the AI industry. As AI technology matures and becomes more central to business strategies, companies are increasingly seeking control and diversification in their AI capabilities. This competition is not necessarily a negative development; in fact, it can be a catalyst for innovation, pushing both Microsoft and OpenAI to develop even more advanced and beneficial AI technologies. Just as competition in the cryptocurrency space drives innovation in blockchain and decentralized technologies, this rivalry in AI is likely to accelerate progress and broaden the applications of AI across various sectors. What Does This Mean for Microsoft AI and the Tech Industry? Microsoft’s intensified Microsoft AI efforts have several potential implications: Enhanced Copilot and Future Products: By exploring diverse AI models, Microsoft aims to enhance the capabilities of Copilot and future AI-powered products. This could lead to more sophisticated features, improved performance, and greater adaptability to user needs. A More Competitive AI Market: Microsoft’s entry as a direct competitor in AI models could disrupt the current market dynamics, potentially leading to more choices and competitive pricing for businesses seeking AI solutions. Accelerated Innovation: The race between Microsoft and OpenAI, along with other major tech players, is likely to fuel rapid innovation in AI. We can expect faster advancements in model performance, efficiency, and application across industries. Potential Shifts in AI Partnerships: Microsoft’s diversification strategy could signal a broader trend of tech giants seeking multiple AI partnerships and building in-house capabilities to reduce reliance on single providers. Navigating the Future of AI Models : Challenges and Opportunities While Microsoft’s ambitious move presents exciting opportunities, it also comes with challenges: Challenges Opportunities Ensuring seamless integration of diverse AI models into existing products and services. Creating more robust and versatile AI-powered solutions by leveraging the strengths of different models. Managing potential complexities of working with multiple AI providers and in-house development teams. Building a more resilient and adaptable AI infrastructure, less vulnerable to disruptions from a single provider. Maintaining ethical standards and responsible AI development across a broader range of models and partnerships. Fostering a more diverse and inclusive AI ecosystem by engaging with a wider range of AI developers and technologies. Conclusion: The AI Competition is Just Getting Started Microsoft’s ramped-up AI efforts signify a pivotal moment in the tech industry. The AI competition is intensifying, with major players vying for dominance in this transformative technology. For observers in the cryptocurrency world and beyond, this escalating rivalry promises accelerated innovation, diverse AI solutions, and a future where AI is even more deeply integrated into our daily lives and technologies. As Microsoft and OpenAI push the boundaries of AI, the entire tech landscape is set to benefit from this dynamic and evolving competition.

This Thursday, President Trump directed for the establishment of a Bitcoin reserve and digital asset stockpile for the other currencies with crypto seized during legal proceedings. David Sacks believes the government has about 200000 BTC from its seizures White House Czar David Sacks insisted that a crypto audit is necessary given how they’ve never done one. According to Sacks, the government has captured over 400,000 Bitcoins in criminal and civil proceedings over the last ten years. He believes the government is still in control of about half of that. However, he says they cannot be certain of the total crypto holdings since they’ve never done a proper audit. According to Arkham Intelligence, the United States owns roughly $17.5 billion in Bitcoin and about $400 million worth of other digital assets in known digital wallets. Meanwhile, Trump’s executive order mandates that the Treasury and Commerce Departments find “budget-neutral strategies” to acquire Bitcoin for the reserve, limiting them to forfeited assets for now. The US government will also have seized crypto build its separate digital asset stockpile to avoid incurring extra costs in acquisitions. Sacks added, “With the reserve, the goal is long-term preservation. With the stockpile, the goal is responsible stewardship.” Nevertheless, he has compared the BTC reserve and the separate digital asset stockpile to “a digital Fort Knox for cryptocurrency,” likening it to the Kentucky military base that holds part of the country’s gold reserves. However, some crypto analysts and enthusiasts expected Trump to take bolder steps in asset acquisition and are slightly disappointed that the reserve holdings are limited to only seized assets. For instance, Charles Edwards of the Capriole Fund, a Bitcoin and digital asset hedge fund, stated that no active Bitcoin purchases mean that the reserve is just a “fancy title” for already existing assets within the government’s control. Trump will meet some key crypto leaders soon President Donald Trump insisted that he wanted to make the US the global crypto capital, and signing this executive order to create a BTC reserve was a step forward for the crypto industry. So far, the crypto industry has also seen impressive changes in regulations and across regulatory agencies where Trump appointed key crypto supporters. For instance, the Securities and Exchanges Commission has dropped or paused over 10 cases, including its case against crypto exchange Coinbase. Before Trump authorised the formation of a working group that would recommend and develop policies for cryptocurrencies, the group was also supposed to propose strategies for the government to establish crypto strategic reserves. Coinbase Global Inc. CEO Brian Armstrong, Strategy CEO Michael Saylor and Vlad Tenev of Robinhood Markets Inc. are scheduled to meet with Trump, Sacks and Bo Hines to discuss more pro-crypto policies.

While Cardano continues to focus on scalability and sustainability, offering a strong foundation for decentralized applications, Lightchain AI is quickly emerging as a major competitor. Priced at just $0.006 during its presale and already raising $16.9 million, Lightchain AI combines blockchain technology with artificial intelligence, offering decentralized, scalable solutions with real-world applications. As Lightchain AI’s presale gains momentum, it could potentially surpass both ADA and DOGE in growth, making it a top contender for 2025. Cardano Price Prediction for 2025- Can ADA Reach $13? As of February 27, 2025, Cardano (ADA) is trading at approximately $0.65. Analysts predict that by the end of 2025, ADA's price could range between $0.698 and $0.812, with an average around $0.753. Reaching $13 would require a substantial increase of over 1,900% from its current price. While some analysts, like Dan Gambardello, have speculated about such a possibility, these views are considered highly optimistic and not widely supported. Given the current market trends and projections, a $13 price point for ADA by the end of 2025 appears highly unlikely. Investors should approach such predictions with caution and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions. How Dogecoin (DOGE) and Lightchain AI Are Competing for the Top Spot Dogecoin (DOGE) and Lightchain AI are competing for the top spot in the crypto space, but each takes a very different approach. DOGE’s popularity stems from its meme status and community-driven growth, while Lightchain AI is focused on innovation through the integration of artificial intelligence with blockchain. Lightchain AI stands out by mitigating bias in AI models through decentralized contributions, ensuring fairness and inclusivity in decision-making. The platform also emphasizes distributing control through decentralized governance, allowing token holders to vote on key decisions and shape the future of the project. Additionally, interoperability with other blockchain networks allows Lightchain AI to seamlessly integrate with various ecosystems, expanding its reach. These unique features, combined with strong tokenomics, position Lightchain AI to potentially surpass DOGE in both utility and growth in the near future. Why Lightchain AI Could Be Major Player in 2025 As blockchain technology evolves and artificial intelligence takes center stage, their integration is shaping the future of innovation. Enter Lightchain AI —a platform redefining scalability and sustainability in the blockchain space. With industries increasingly adopting blockchain and AI, the opportunities for Lightchain AI are skyrocketing. This growing momentum could drive widespread adoption, boosting demand for its platform and its native token. While some cryptocurrencies, like ADA, may face challenges reaching ambitious targets like $13 by 2025, Lightchain AI is carving out its own path. Its cutting-edge solutions and rising popularity position it as a potential game-changer in the crypto market. Don’t miss your chance to get in early.

The agency emphasized that it permits a range of activities with crypto, and it confirms and reaffirms those activities. It also rescinds guidance from 2021 that banks found burdensome and discriminatory. The OCC’s Interpretive Letter 1183 of March 7 is the first to be issued under Acting Comptroller of the Currency Rodney Hood, who was appointed to his post on Feb. 11. Hood is quoted in a press release as saying that the letter ensures “Bank activities are treated consistently by the OCC, regardless of the underlying technology.” Hood further said he would “continue to work diligently to ensure regulations are effective and not excessive.” The OCC’s letter is about letters Interpretive Letter 1183 begins by saying Letter 1179 has been rescinded. That letter required national banks to notify their supervisory office if they intend to engage in any of the activities permitted in other letters. The supervisory office would then evaluate the banks’ adequacy and reply in writing to object to the proposed activities or confirm its nonobjection. That letter was issued in November 2021 under Hood’s predecessor acting comptroller Michael Hsu. The OCC has gained supervisory experience and realized those measures are no longer necessary, the new letter said. The rescission should reduce banks’ burden, encourage responsible innovation and enhance transparency. It also ensures that bank activities are treated consistently, regardless of the underlying technology. In 2020 and 2021, the OCC issued letters concerning banks providing crypto asset custody ( 1170 ), the use of dollar deposits to back stablecoins ( 1172 ) and the use of public blockchains to verify payments ( 1174 ). All of those letters were issued while Brian Brooks was comptroller. Brooks was a former Coinbase chief legal officer. Now the OCC will examine the activities described in those letters, Letter 1183 said. The letter backpedals on joint policy The press release for the new letter stated that the OCC has also withdrawn its participation in the joint statement on crypto asset risks. That document was issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the OCC in January 2023. The joint statement came on the heels of the collapse of FTX and the rest of the events of the crypto winter. “It is important that risks related to the crypto-asset sector that cannot be mitigated or controlled do not migrate to the banking system,” it said. It went on to list eight specific risks. Banks can provide services to customers of any type, the statement read, but “based on the agencies’ current understanding and experience to date, the agencies believe that issuing or holding as principal crypto-assets … is highly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices.” It’s still early for jubilation Caitlin Long, founder and CEO of crypto-native Custodia Bank and a long-time critic of banking regulation as it applies to crypto, was reticent in her praise of the new OCC letter. “Amid all the jubilation about the OCC news, #OperationChokePoint2.0 isn’t over until: 1. Fed & FDIC also rescind their anti-#crypto guidance, which is still in effect (Fed & FDIC were far more detrimental to crypto banking than OCC) & 2. @custodiabank has its Fed master account,” Long wrote on X. The OCC regulates national banks, while the Federal Reserve regulates state banks (which are otherwise overseen by state agencies and cannot open branches out of state). The FDIC regulates commercial banks, which are a subset of both state and national banks. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The United States is signaling a major policy U-turn. After a period of intense regulatory scrutiny, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has declared an end to the crypto crackdown , paving the way for a more innovation-friendly environment for digital assets. This groundbreaking announcement, delivered at the White House Crypto Summit, suggests a significant change in approach that could reshape the future of cryptocurrency in America and its global influence. Are you ready to explore what this means for you, for the market, and for the future of finance? Why the Sudden Shift Away From Crypto Crackdown? For months, the crypto industry has navigated a complex web of regulations, often feeling like authorities were putting the brakes on innovation. Secretary Bessent’s speech signals a clear departure from this stance. He openly criticized past policies, acknowledging that a heavy-handed crypto crackdown approach was actually hindering progress and pushing innovation overseas. This is a crucial admission and a welcome change for many in the digital asset space. But what exactly prompted this change of heart? Recognizing Stifled Innovation: The Treasury Secretary explicitly stated that previous regulatory measures were ‘stifling innovation.’ This suggests a growing understanding within the government that overly strict rules can push groundbreaking technologies and businesses away from the U.S. President Trump’s Pro-Tech Stance: The announcement is closely aligned with President Trump’s publicly declared pro-technology stance. This political backing gives weight to the policy shift and suggests a long-term commitment to fostering innovation in the digital realm. Global Competitiveness Concerns: It’s likely the U.S. is also considering its global standing. Other nations are actively embracing and regulating crypto, creating hubs for digital asset innovation. A continued crypto crackdown risked the U.S. falling behind in this crucial technological race. Stablecoins: The Unsung Heroes in Maintaining US Dollar Dominance A key highlight of Secretary Bessent’s announcement was the emphasis on stablecoins . He specifically identified them as crucial for maintaining the U.S. dollar’s global dominance in the evolving financial landscape. This is a powerful endorsement of stablecoins and their potential. But why are stablecoins so important in this context? Stablecoins , cryptocurrencies pegged to a stable reserve asset like the US dollar, bridge the gap between traditional finance and the volatile crypto world. They offer the speed and efficiency of blockchain technology while maintaining price stability. Secretary Bessent seems to recognize that: Global Transactions: Stablecoins facilitate faster and cheaper international transactions, potentially strengthening the dollar’s role in global commerce. Digital Dollar Infrastructure: They can be seen as a stepping stone towards a potential central bank digital currency (CBDC) or at least a key component of a future digital dollar ecosystem. Innovation Hub: By supporting stablecoins, the U.S. can become a hub for stablecoin innovation, attracting businesses and talent in this rapidly growing sector. What Does This Mean for Digital Assets? The shift away from a crypto crackdown and towards a more supportive regulatory framework has profound implications for the entire digital assets ecosystem. It’s not just about stablecoins; it’s about creating a fertile ground for all types of crypto innovation. Here’s what we can expect: Area Potential Impact Innovation Expect a surge in crypto startups and projects within the U.S. as regulatory uncertainty decreases. Investment Increased institutional and retail investment in digital assets as the market matures and gains legitimacy. Adoption Wider adoption of cryptocurrencies for payments, investments, and various applications as regulatory hurdles are eased. Job Creation Growth in the crypto industry will lead to new job opportunities in technology, finance, and related sectors. Navigating the New Crypto Regulation Landscape While the announcement signals an end to the crypto crackdown , it doesn’t mean a complete absence of crypto regulation . Instead, it suggests a move towards smarter, more innovation-friendly rules. What should businesses and individuals in the crypto space be prepared for? Clarity, Not Absence of Rules: Expect regulations to become clearer and more targeted, focusing on consumer protection and preventing illicit activities without stifling innovation. Collaboration: The government may seek more collaboration with the crypto industry to develop effective and balanced regulatory frameworks. Focus on Key Areas: Regulation might prioritize areas like stablecoins, exchanges, and DeFi to ensure market stability and investor confidence. Actionable Insights: Preparing for a Crypto-Friendly Future This policy shift presents significant opportunities. Here are some actionable insights to consider: For Businesses: If you’ve been hesitant to launch or expand your crypto business in the U.S. due to regulatory concerns, now might be the time to reconsider. Explore opportunities for innovation and growth within a more supportive environment. For Investors: Stay informed about evolving regulations and market developments. A clearer regulatory landscape could lead to increased market stability and new investment opportunities in digital assets . For Individuals: Educate yourself about cryptocurrencies and stablecoins . Understand their potential benefits and risks as they become more integrated into the financial system. A New Dawn for Crypto in the USA? Secretary Bessent’s announcement is a watershed moment. It signifies a potential turning point in the U.S. approach to cryptocurrency, moving from a period of intense scrutiny to one of cautious embrace. By ending the crypto crackdown and recognizing the strategic importance of digital assets and stablecoins , the U.S. is signaling its intent to remain a leader in technological innovation and global finance. This shift could unleash a wave of innovation, investment, and adoption, shaping the future of money and the internet as we know it. The journey ahead will still require careful navigation and collaboration, but the direction is undeniably more promising for the crypto industry in the United States.

His analysis builds on detailed wave counts, multiple Fibonacci extension targets, and critical moving averages, offering a granular look at the BTC’s near- and mid-term possibilities. What’s Next For Bitcoin? Big Mike’s chart displays a complex Elliott Wave structure consisting of five main impulse waves and interspersed corrective sub-waves. A key area labeled near $72,895 corresponds to wave (c)(iv), representing a major potential bottom if the market breaks below $78,000 and continues lower. Notable corrective waves around $85,000 to $95,000 appear to have formed a larger consolidation phase, which he regards as a precursor to the next directional move. The chart also pinpoints an upside pathway from roughly $95,000, projecting impulse waves (3), (4), and (5) that extend into the $100,000–$140,000 zone. Related Reading: Historic Bitcoin Buy Signal: DXY’s Collapse Signals A Bigger Bull Run Fibonacci extension targets appear at approximately $114,693 (1.618 extension) which could be the target for wave (3), followed by a corrective move to $102,000 before starting wave 5 which aims for $137,727 (2.618 extension), or even a final leg near $150,000 aligns with wave c(3). Moving averages in the $72,000–$90,000 range underscore the significance of support near $78,000–$72,895, while an upper band around $90,000–$95,000 represents a crucial resistance corridor. The analyst observes a descending wedge formation from mid-February to early March, spanning $95,000 down to $85,000, and notes that an upside breakout could herald a renewed push into six-figure territory. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Price Range Could Be The Bulls’ Final Defense Line, Report Says Volume profiles indicate subdued participation during recent corrective phases, alongside a neutral Stochastic RSI reading that suggests momentum could shift decisively depending on which price threshold gives way first. Big Mike emphasizes two critical lines in the sand: “BTC above $95k will trigger the move quickly towards my target of $130-$140k. Below $78k and we test $72k, then run to $140k.” From his perspective, both a direct break above $95,000 and a deeper dip to $72,895 ultimately converge on the same upside target near $130,000–$140,000. At press time, BTC traded at $90,053.

While XRP has had its ups and downs, new and exciting projects are emerging, offering unique value propositions that could drive substantial growth. For those who missed the boat on XRP or are looking to diversify their portfolios, there are several promising cryptocurrencies with strong growth potential. These tokens bring innovative technologies, real-world use cases, and vibrant communities to the table, making them top contenders in the ever-expanding crypto space. In this article, we’ll explore the top 5 best cryptocurrencies to buy now, each with its own unique features and the potential to generate significant returns in the coming years. How Ripple (XRP) Fared and Why You Should Consider Other Cryptocurrencies Ripple (XRP) has experienced significant ups and downs since its inception, with legal battles and regulatory challenges weighing heavily on its performance. Despite its initial success and widespread adoption by financial institutions, XRP has faced roadblocks, especially with the ongoing SEC lawsuit, which has hindered its growth and limited its market potential. While XRP was once considered a top contender in the crypto space, these challenges have led many investors to reconsider their positions. As a result, diversifying into other cryptocurrencies with more promising long-term prospects has become increasingly attractive. There are now numerous alternative projects that offer unique use cases, solid roadmaps, and innovative technologies, making them worthy contenders for investment. In this article, we explore five such cryptocurrencies that could help you recover missed opportunities and potentially deliver greater returns. 5 Currencies to Look out for Besides Ripple (XRP) As Ripple (XRP) faces regulatory challenges, investors are increasingly looking to diversify their portfolios with other promising cryptocurrencies that offer unique features and growth potential. One such option is Lightchain AI (LCAI) , which blends artificial intelligence with blockchain, creating a decentralized platform for AI-powered applications. Cardano (ADA) is another strong contender, offering a scalable and sustainable proof-of-stake network that continues to attract developers and investors. Solana (SOL) stands out for its high-speed, low-cost blockchain, ideal for decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi projects. Polkadot (DOT) provides interoperability between blockchains, positioning it as a key player in the multi-chain future of crypto. Lastly, Chainlink (LINK) remains a valuable asset due to its decentralized oracle network, which bridges the gap between smart contracts and real-world data. These cryptocurrencies offer diverse opportunities for growth beyond Ripple, making them worth considering in 2025. Which One Should You Buy If You Still Want Ripple (XRP)? If you're still interested in investing in a cryptocurrency with strong potential in the cross-border payments space like Ripple (XRP), Lightchain AI (LCAI) is a great alternative to consider.

Armstrong made the statement following the White House Crypto Summit, where he and other industry leaders met with government officials to discuss crypto regulation policies. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong Announces 1,000 New U.S. Jobs After attending the White House Crypto Summit, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong took to X (formerly Twitter) to reveal the company’s hiring plans. He stated that the regulatory landscape in the U.S. is improving, allowing the company to expand its workforce. Armstrong credited the shift to President Trump’s leadership and the administration’s efforts to establish clear guidelines for crypto regulation. He emphasized that this new clarity is enabling businesses like Coinbase to strengthen their presence in the U.S. market. Coinbase CEO added, “Historic day at the Whitehouse Digital Asset Summit. Thanks to Trump’s leadership, along with David Sacks, the U.S. now has a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and emerging regulatory clarity. This is directly translating to economic growth in the U.S. For instance, Coinbase plans to hire about 1,000 employees in the U.S. this year as a result of this renewed growth. During the White House crypto summit , Donald Trump announced plans to end Operation Chokepoint 2.0, signaling a shift toward a more supportive regulatory environment. Additionally, Trump emphasized the urgency of stablecoin legislation, aiming to establish clear regulatory guidelines before Congress adjourns for summer. Regulatory Clarity Boosts Crypto Industry Growth The White House Crypto Summit brought together government officials, industry leaders, and regulatory bodies to discuss the future of digital assets. The event marked a shift in the U.S. government’s stance toward the crypto industry, with an emphasis on fostering innovation. One of the major developments discussed was the U.S. government’s decision to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . Armstrong expressed his support for the initiative, stating that the U.S. government holding Bitcoin signals its recognition as a key financial asset. A major factor influencing Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong’s hiring announcement was the US SEC decision to drop its enforcement action against the company. With the case no longer proceeding, crypto businesses now look to Congress for regulatory clarity. Armstrong stated that this development allows Coinbase to focus on business expansion rather than ongoing legal battles. Donald Trump Administration’s Crypto Policy Donald Trump administration has positioned itself as an advocate for the crypto industry, with officials expressing their commitment to making the U.S. a leader in digital assets. Bo Hines, the executive director of the President’s Working Group on Digital Assets, reaffirmed the administration’s goal of establishing the U.S. as the global center for crypto innovation. Hines stated that government agencies, including the Treasury and Commerce departments, are exploring ways to invest in Bitcoin without increasing the financial burden on taxpayers. Industry leaders, including Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, welcomed these policy changes. Meanwhile, VanEck has shared budget-neutral strategies in which the U.S. government could expand its Bitcoin Reserve without taxpayer funding.

Regulatory Clarity- Recent developments suggest a more favorable regulatory environment for XRP, potentially enhancing its adoption and stability. Market Performance- Analysts predict that XRP could reach $5 to $7 in the first half of 2025, driven by Ripple's advancements and increased adoption.

41305139,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=689129,1741394971,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41305139.jpeg,"David Sacks says Trump’s mention of XRP, SOL, and ADA is being overanalyzed",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/sacks-says-xrp-mentions-being-overanalyzed/,"As speculation surrounding President Donald Trump’s recent statement about creating a U.S. cryptocurrency strategic reserve has reached a fever pitch, White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks spoke out. Sacks attempted to reduce expectation and overinterpretation by noting that mentioning these particular altcoins did not mean any government-endorsed option or preference. Many cryptocurrency executives criticized the specific digital assets included in the report as too far-flung from crypto standards of development, institutional adoption, and decentralization seen in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Some analysts suggested that their addition was a sign the government had changed its approach and was preparing to back other blockchain networks. However, Sacks shot down those theories in an interview on Friday. “The president just listed the top five cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, so I think this is one of those moments where people are reading too much into this,” Sacks said. “There’s no secret motive behind it — he just mentioned the biggest names.” The market’s response to Trump’s comment was nonetheless stark. The name drop of XRP, SOL, and ADA resulted in explosive price movements, with some of these assets ripping up close to 70% over the weekend before pulling back. Such price volatility highlighted the outsized impact political statements and policy signals can have on digital asset markets. Federal government can’t account for all its crypto holdings Sacks said a complete audit was still needed to establish the government’s crypto holdings. He had no doubts that the U.S. government owned Bitcoin and thought there was some Ethereum. However, he noted that there was no clear answer to whether it also held other altcoins such as XRP, Solana, or Cardano. Source: Bloomberg That uncertainty is part of what Thursday night’s executive order required: a full tally of all the digital assets the U.S. government currently holds. The United States federal government has over 198,000 BTC holdings, and Bitcoin Treasuries estimate this to be worth around $17 billion at today’s prices. The order also establishes a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile to manage non-Bitcoin digital assets acquired through criminal and civil seizures. However, it explicitly states that the government will not actively purchase additional cryptocurrencies for this stockpile beyond those obtained through legal recoveries. Federal government is not interested in selling its crypto holdings The executive order sets forth a new way of dealing with these digital assets rather than simply playing accountants. While the federal government may opt to sell some of its holdings, Sacks suggested other strategies, such as lending or staking the cryptocurrencies it owns and earning additional returns, could be used. Sacks said the executive order was meant to establish guidelines for responsible asset management. He said that the first step would be a complete audit and that digital assets would be transferred to a more secure account. The Treasury Secretary and their expertise would then administer a diversified portfolio to long-term custodial oversight to maximize the benefit for Americans. He also said the strategy may be as simple as staking certain assets for passive rewards, portfolio rebalancing to lower risk while gaining a larger return, or selling when appropriate. He said the Treasury Department could consider such options if they served the country’s long-term financial interests. With these policy developments playing out, the crypto industry’s eyes are now fixed on a highly publicized summit in Washington, D.C., where President Trump hosts several top Bitcoin and cryptocurrency executives. The discussions are likely to focus on regulatory approaches, market growth, and how blockchain technology is evolving in the U.S. economy. In the meantime, the market conditions are still turbulent. XRP and ADA have lost around 7% in the last 24 hours following their brief rally last weekend (according to The Block’s crypto price data). Solana (SOL), on the other hand, remained relatively more robust, recording a slight decline of 1.3%. The two leading cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, have also suffered; Bitcoin has fallen 2%, while Ethereum has lost 2.7% during the same time frame. As the government’s crypto blueprint continues, traders, investors, and policymakers will watch how these assets are handled in the new U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile and whether other regulatory changes could affect the broader market.

Priced at just $0.006 during its presale, Lightchain AI has already raised $16.9 million, offering a unique combination of blockchain and artificial intelligence that promises scalable, decentralized solutions for real-world applications. While Ethereum continues to lead with its smart contracts and Cardano focuses on scalability and sustainability, Lightchain AI’s innovative approach positions it for explosive growth. As the presale progresses, Lightchain AI may very well become the best altcoin for long-term investors in 2025 and beyond. Comparing Long-Term Potential- Lightchain AI, Ethereum (ETH), and Cardano (ADA) In 2025, Lightchain AI, Ethereum (ETH), and Cardano (ADA) each present distinct long-term investment opportunities. Ethereum (ETH)- As a leading platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, Ethereum continues to drive innovation in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Analysts project ETH could reach $3,500 by the end of 2025, reflecting its established position and ongoing development. Cardano (ADA)- Known for its proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, Cardano emphasizes scalability, security, and sustainability. Price predictions for ADA in 2025 vary, with some forecasts suggesting a range between $0.69 and $2.22, indicating potential for significant growth. Lightchain AI (LCAI)- An emerging cryptocurrency integrating artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, Lightchain AI has garnered attention for its innovative approach. During its presale, LCAI raised over millions, indicating strong investor confidence. Some projections suggest that a $300 investment could potentially grow to $12,300, highlighting its rapid growth and the confidence investors have in its future prospects. While all three projects offer promising prospects, Lightchain AI's innovative integration of AI and blockchain positions it as a potentially high-return investment. However, it's essential to approach such investments with caution, conducting thorough research and considering the inherent risks associated with the cryptocurrency market. Why Lightchain AI Could Be Best Long-Term Hold for Next 4 Years Lightchain AI could be the best long-term hold for the next 4 years due to its unique integration of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. The platform’s scalability is enhanced by Layer 2 solutions and DAG structures, allowing it to handle high transaction volumes without compromising performance. Lightchain AI also focuses on gas optimization, ensuring cost-efficiency and sustainability for users.

Buy LCAI Tokens Now for Long-Term Growth Potential Investing in LCAI tokens now can offer significant long-term growth potential as the platform continues to develop and establish itself in the cryptocurrency market. With a limited supply of 10 billion tokens, scarcity may contribute to price appreciation over time. As Lightchain AI expands its real-world use cases and partnerships, demand for its token could increase, driving up its value. Invest right now and hold onto your LCAI tokens for the next 4 years to potentially see significant returns on your investment. However, as with any investment, it's crucial to conduct due diligence and only invest what you can afford to lose.

The Solana ( SOL ) rival is witnessing price gains amid a new collaboration with World Liberty Financial (WLFI). Says World Liberty Financial co-founder Zak Folkman in a statement , “We chose Sui for its American-born innovation combined with impressive scale and adoption. It is a natural complement to our mission of bringing decentralized finance to more Americans. Given our plans to support foundational DeFi assets in the coming months, collaborating with Sui was an obvious decision.” World Liberty Financial’s website states that Trump is not an officer, director, founder or employee of the firm or any of its affiliates but lists the president as its chief crypto advocate. The website also notes that DT Marks DEFI LLC, a company affiliated with Trump and some of his family members, holds 22.5 billion WLFI tokens and is entitled to receive fees from the project. SUI is currently trading for $2.76, up by 5.18% over the past 24 hours. Leading altcoins hover in the red zone. The smart contract platform Ethereum ( ETH ) is down by 0.58%, while Solana and Cardano ( ADA ) plunged by 1% and 7.41%, respectively.

The suit claims the closures were driven by political bias, targeting the Trump family’s conservative affiliations back in 2021. “Plaintiffs have reason to believe that Capital One’s unilateral decision came about as a result of political and social motivations and Capital One’s unsubstantiated, “woke” beliefs that it needed to distance itself from President Trump and his conservative political views. In essence, Capital One “de-banked” Plaintiffs’ Accounts because Capital One believed that the political tide at the moment favored doing so. In addition to the considerable financial harm that Plaintiffs and their affiliated entities suffered, Capital One’s reckless decision is part of a growing trend by financial institutions in the United States of America to cut off a consumer’s access to banking services if their political views contradict with those of the financial institution. Capital One’s conduct is but one example of a systemic, subversive industry practice that aims to coerce the public to shift and re-align their political views.” The move comes after Trump openly slammed both Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase. At a World Economic Forum session in January, Trump publicly criticized Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. He accused them of denying services to conservatives, urging them to “open your banks” to those who have allegedly been unfairly kicked out of the banking system. Trump’s remarks touch on a broader debate over alleged discrimination in the financial sector. This month, after meeting with Republican lawmakers, Chase’s Dimon said US banks sometimes “push people out of the system” due to vague federal anti-money laundering rules. Dimon denied political or religious bias at Chase, instead blaming regulatory pressures that force compliance-driven account closures.

While Ethereum and Solana remain dominant players in DeFi, smart contracts, and blockchain adoption, a new contender is rapidly gaining traction— Lightchain AI (LCAI). With $17.1 million raised in presale, Lightchain AI has already demonstrated strong investor confidence, and traders believe it could 20x or more as the broader crypto market continues to rally. But how realistic is a 20x surge for Lightchain AI , and how does it compare to Ethereum and Solana’s growth potential? Let’s break it down. Ethereum (ETH) Eyes $7,000 – A Bull Market on the Horizon? Ethereum (ETH) is making waves, currently trading around $2,228.85, with analysts spotting exciting signs of a potential surge to $7,000. Crypto expert Ali Martinez highlights a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, suggesting that if ETH closes above $4,100, it could kickstart a rally toward $7,000. But that’s not all—Ethereum’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio adds to the momentum. Breaking past the 3.2 MVRV band, now hovering near $7,000, could confirm a major move upward. What does the future hold? Projections vary: some predict ETH will hit $6,000–$7,000 by late 2025, while others take a more cautious stance. One thing’s for sure—reaching $7,000 could mark the beginning of a broader bull market, signaling growing adoption and surging investor confidence in Ethereum’s ecosystem. Buckle up, ETH investors—big things may be on the horizon! Solana’s (SOL) Road to $650 - High-Speed Transactions Fuel Growth Solana (SOL) is currently trading at approximately $147.32, with analysts identifying bullish trends that suggest a potential rise to $650. According to Binance analysts, breaking key resistance levels around $500 could open the path toward this target. Known for its high-speed transaction capabilities—processing up to 65,000 transactions per second with low fees—Solana has become a leading choice for decentralized applications and financial services. This efficiency has spurred significant developer interest, further driving growth in its ecosystem. However, reaching the $650 milestone will depend on broader market conditions, technological progress, and continued adoption. While Solana’s transaction speed positions it as a strong contender in the blockchain space, prospective investors are encouraged to conduct thorough research and account for market volatility when making decisions. As Ethereum and Solana continue to gain traction, traders are exploring high-growth opportunities in this expanding market, with Lightchain AI emerging as a standout option. Why Traders Believe Lightchain AI (LCAI) Could 20x in 2025 Ethereum and Solana may have laid the groundwork for blockchain infrastructure, but Lightchain AI (LCAI) is taking things to the next level by seamlessly blending AI with blockchain technology. What really sets LCAI apart ? Its innovative dynamic gas fee system. Instead of one-size-fits-all pricing, fees adjust based on the complexity of AI tasks. The result? A cost-effective, user-friendly platform that's driving rapid adoption and shaking up the decentralized AI landscape. But that’s just the beginning. Lightchain AI has an ambitious roadmap, from prototype development to global expansion. Its cutting-edge parallelized architecture allows multiple AI tasks to run at once, slashing delays and supercharging performance. With these bold innovations, Lightchain AI isn’t just keeping up—it’s leading the charge in the future of decentralized AI. Buckle up, because the next generation of blockchain technology is here.

While Trump’s proposal to include XRP in a U.S. strategic crypto reserve initially ignited a price rally, macroeconomic headwinds and skepticism from key financial institutions have cut gains in half XRP Bulls Struggle to Hold Gains Amid Conflicting Catalysts XRP price grazed the $3 mark on Monday as rallying 40% after Trump included XRP in the Crypto strategic reserver assets last weekend. However, traders digested multiple market-moving developments this week, those gains have been halved. Trump’s push to establish a cryptocurrency strategic reserve, with XRP included alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano generated strong initial momentum at the start of the week. Further optimism came from the easing of tariffs imposed on Mexico and Canada, boosting broader market sentiment. XRP Price Action However, XRP bulls faced resistance as macroeconomic uncertainties dampened risk appetite. The latest U.S. Non-Farm Payroll ( NFP ) report revealed rising unemployment, fueling concerns about persistent inflation and a potentially more hawkish Federal Reserve. As a result, profit-taking emerged near the $3 mark, halting the upside breakout and forcing consolidation around $2.40. The rejection at $3 suggests traders remain wary of overextending bullish positions amid policy uncertainty. Liquidity remains a key factor, with leveraged long positions likely facing liquidations if XRP fails to hold critical support levels. JPMorgan Director Casts Doubt on Strategic Crypto Reserve Approval for Ripple At press time on March 8, Ripple price was trading at $2.40, with a market capitalization of approximately $140 billion. Bull traders anticipate that a break above $3 could push XRP’s market cap toward $200 billion, especially if U.S. Treasury actions align with Trump’s strategic reserve proposal. Ripple (XRP) Market Data, | Source: CoingeckoRipple (XRP) Market Data, | Source: Coingecko However, JPMorgan’s latest report has thrown cold water on Ripple’s ambitious valuation target, highlighting significant hurdles in gaining congressional approval for a U.S. strategic crypto reserve. According to Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, managing director of global market strategy at JPMorgan, the probability of such a reserve materializing remains below 50%. “We don’t believe an approval of a U.S. strategic crypto reserve is the most likely scenario (assuming congressional approval would be needed). So the chance is less than 50% in our mind. And if a U.S. strategic crypto reserve is eventually approved, it would be difficult to include smaller tokens outside Bitcoin and Ethereum, as the inclusion of such tokens would raise more concerns about risk and volatility” – Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, Maanaging director of global market strategy at JPMorgan The report further noted that similar state-level Bitcoin reserve proposals have recently failed in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming due to concerns over volatility and regulatory hurdles. Skepticsm around approval of Trump’s crypto strategic reserve plan added to the bearish sentiment keeping XRP price below the $2.50 mark on the daily candle. As traders await further clarity, XRP’s technical structure suggests a pivotal battle ahead. XRP Price Forecast: Bulls Eye $3, But Rejection Looms Amid Profit-Taking XRP price is showing early signs of bullish exhaustion after failing to hold above $2.60, suggesting a potential retest of lower support levels. The 12-hour chart highlights a clear rejection near $2.99, coinciding with the upper Donchian Channel boundary, signaling strong resistance. Despite the recent breakout, the inability to sustain momentum above this zone raises the likelihood of profit-taking, particularly with the latest 5.84% decline. XRP Price Forecast The MACD histogram, while still in positive territory, has begun fading, hinting at waning bullish momentum. The MACD line remains above the signal line, supporting a bullish case, but the narrowing gap suggests that if selling pressure persists, bears could regain control. Key support is forming near $2.47, aligned with the midline of the Donchian Channel. A decisive break below this level would expose $2.39, a critical pivot where bulls must step in to prevent a slide toward $1.95. Conversely, if XRP price holds above $2.47 and volume picks up, a renewed push toward $2.99 is likely, with $3.20 as the next bullish target. Leverage traders appear active, making sharp wicks and liquidity hunts a key risk in both directions.

33767162,[object Object],1741397431,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Fold Holdings Acquires 475 Bitcoin To Strengthen Corporate Treasury – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/fold-holdings-acquires-475-bitcoin-to-strengthen-corporate-treasury-details/,"Fold Holdings, a US-based Bitcoin (BTC) financial services firm, announced today the addition of 475 BTC to its corporate treasury. This acquisition positions Fold Holdings among the top 10 US public companies with the largest Bitcoin reserves. Fold Holdings Unveils Bitcoin Purchase Bitcoin adoption among corporations continues to snowball, as Nasdaq-listed Fold has acquired another 475 BTC. This latest purchase marks nearly a 50% increase in the company’s total BTC holdings, which now stand at slightly more than 1,485 BTC. Notably, the firm financed its BTC acquisition through the issuance of a convertible note at a 100% premium, with a conversion price of $12.50 per share. Commenting on the development, Fold CEO Will Reeves stated: We believe Bitcoin will play a key role in the foundation of a new financial era, and Fold will help lead the way. As the first publicly traded bitcoin financial services company, we believe maintaining a significant bitcoin treasury not only drives value for our shareholders, but more importantly, strengthens our ability to power the next generation of financial services built on bitcoin. Reeves further emphasized that Fold’s Bitcoin corporate treasury serves a dual purpose. It not only provides value to investors seeking BTC exposure, but also functions as a strategic reserve to support the firm’s Bitcoin-native financial products. Fold’s share price (FLD) surged by more than 27% yesterday, closing the day at $7.71. However, in pre-market trading, the stock has dipped slightly to $7.50 at the time of writing. On a year-to-date basis, FLD remains down by over 30%. BTC Adoption Likely to Gain Further Traction Yesterday, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) and a Digital Asset Stockpile. The establishment of an SBR further legitimizes BTC as a reliable store of value, now recognized by the world’s largest economy. The formation of a US SBR is expected to trigger a domino effect, prompting other nations to establish their own BTC reserves in an effort to accumulate ‘digital gold.’ Countries like El Salvador and Bhutan already hold significant BTC reserves. As nation-states increasingly embrace BTC as an asset class, corporations worldwide are likely to follow suit. Michael Saylor’s Strategy currently ranks first among public companies in terms of BTC holdings, with more than 440,000 BTC, according to CoinGecko data. Yesterday, Brazilian fintech and publicly traded company Meliuz announced that it had allocated 10% of its total cash reserves to BTC. Similarly, Mexican billionaire Ricardo Salinas recently disclosed that 70% of his portfolio is allocated to BTC and related investments. That said, concerns persist over BTC’s volatility , with some arguing that it behaves more like a speculative asset than a reliable store of value. At press time, BTC is trading at $90,192, up 0.5% in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Adoption|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|FLD|Fold Holdings,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|RUNE|FDUSD,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-03-08 01:30:31

Imagine snagging PEPE at a fraction of a cent and watching it skyrocket by over 1,900%, making millionaires overnight. The regret is real, but here’s the twist—you don’t have to miss out again. BTFD Coin (BTFD) is here, and its 3650% moonshot potential is already creating waves! While PEPE’s time has passed for insane early gains, BTFD Coin is the Best New Meme Coin to Join Today, offering what could be the last low-entry chance before it explodes. The Bulls Squad is rallying behind this project, and the presale is already 99% complete at just $0.00016 per coin. Once the presale ends, BTFD will list at $0.0006, meaning investors who get in now can lock in 275% gains instantly, with a projected moon price of $0.006. The question is, will you seize this golden opportunity—or regret it like PEPE all over again? BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Final Presale Dip Before a 3650% Surge BTFD Coin (BTFD) is more than just another meme coin—it’s a movement built on one of the most legendary investment strategies: Buy The Dip. And right now, the dip is here—but not for long. In just a few months, BTFD has sold over 71 billion tokens, raised over $6.27 million, and gained 11,200+ holders. The presale started at just $0.000004 per coin, and now, at $0.00016, it’s still dirt cheap compared to its expected launch price of $0.0006. But the real excitement? Analysts predict a moon price of $0.006, which means—yes, you read that right—a 3650% ROI potential. Let’s break it down. If you invest $2,500 at today’s price of $0.00016, you’ll get 15.6 million BTFD tokens. Once BTFD hits $0.0006 at launch, your investment would triple to $9,375. But if it reaches the $0.006 moon price, your $2,500 turns into $93,750. Now, imagine sitting on the sidelines, watching this play out, just like with PEPE. This is your shot. This is why so many investors believe BTFD Coin is the Best New Meme Coin to Join Today. Bulls Squad: The Core of BTFD’s Success At the heart of BTFD’s explosive growth is the Bulls Squad, a powerhouse community of diamond-handed investors who believe in the long game. These aren’t your average meme coin gamblers; they’re crypto warriors who turn dips into fortunes. And here’s where it gets even better—BTFD isn’t just hype; it’s utility-driven. Play-to-Earn (P2E) Game: Launched on January 1, 2025, it allows players to earn real BTFD tokens while gaming. 90% APY Staking: Holders can stake their tokens and earn massive passive income. Bulls Squad Rewards: The exclusive Bulls Squad initiative could generate a 3650% return, positioning BTFD as the best new meme coin to join today with real profit potential. If you’ve ever looked at Doge, Shiba, or PEPE and wished you got in early—this is your moment. How Investors Missed PEPE and Lost Their Chance at Millions When Pepe Coin (PEPE) first hit the market, almost nobody took it seriously. A silly frog meme? Sounds ridiculous, right? Well, tell that to the early believers who scooped up billions of PEPE tokens for pennies in its first few months. PEPE started at $0.00000005 in April 2023, and by December 2024, it surged past a market cap of $11 billion. Some early buyers turned a few hundred bucks into life-changing wealth. But most people? They hesitated. They ignored it. And they missed out. The same people who laughed at PEPE were now watching from the sidelines as whales raked in insane profits. Even in 2025, PEPE remains a major player, but the explosive early gains are gone. History is repeating itself with BTFD Coin, and this time, you have a second shot at massive returns—if you act fast. That’s why crypto analysts are calling BTFD the Best New Meme Coin to Join Today, as it mirrors PEPE’s early days but with even bigger potential. Why Presales Are the Smartest Crypto Play The crypto market is volatile, and if you’re sick of watching your portfolio take hits from bearish trends, presales are your best bet. They let you buy at the lowest possible price, avoid market fluctuations, and maximize your gains before public trading begins. BTFD Coin has already proven its strength by raising millions, building a thriving community, and securing major crypto partnerships. Once it hits exchanges, expect a FOMO-fueled buying spree—and prices will never be this low again. That’s why seasoned investors agree that BTFD is the Best New Meme Coin to Join Today. Final Call: Will You Seize the Opportunity or Watch from the Sidelines? PEPE was the missed chance of 2023-2024. BTFD is the Best New Meme Coin to Join Today and the biggest presale opportunity of 2025. With only 1% left in Stage 14, the window to buy at $0.00016 is closing fast. When the presale ends, the launch price of $0.0006 is locked in—and after that, the projected $0.006 moon price will separate the winners from the wish they had. The choice is simple. Either join now and secure your spot in the next crypto success story—or risk regretting it as you did with PEPE. Sign up before the BTFD Coin presale ends!

The upcoming presale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is causing present-day enthusiasm while its ongoing funding campaign races towards reaching its projected $4 value within eight weeks. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has received $2.3 million from its 4,300 second presale investors at $0.015 which guarantees a 300% return when the cryptocurrency lists on exchanges at $0.06. Dogecoin Navigates Market Turbulence Amid Payment Integration Speculation The crypto market volatility causes Dogecoin to lose 14% of its value while its current trading price sits at $0.18. The speculation continues about Elon Musk potentially adding DOGE payments to X despite market fluctuations because of the recent offer from Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson to upgrade Dogecoin’s network. Through his technical proposal Hoskinson aimed to create payment features and AI applications which mirrored Musk’s initial support for using DOGE to buy Tesla products. Technical assessments of the market show a rounding bottom pattern which indicates a probable 266% price increase to $0.65 when support levels remain strong. The approximate rise in price value for this token remains uncertain because it depends on both market perception and partnership stability. Expert analysts agree recovery will be stable when sell-off activities slow down and payment plans advance physically as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) maintains substantial progress with its pre-sale launches. Ripple Faces Macroeconomic Headwinds Despite Bullish Forecasts Ripple (XRP) has experienced a 12% decline which brought prices down to $2.35 as political engagements with U.S. crypto reserves lost their market impact. The cryptocurrency analyst EGRAG CRYPTO predicts a steady price increase of XRP to reach $30 by May 2025 according to past performance indicators. For this forecast to materialize XRP needs to break through the channel pattern established in 2017 which will demand a 2,500% price increase. XRP faces negative short-term investment signals because of macroeconomic factors and new trade restrictions that show its ability to manage market volatility remains unclear. While regulatory clarity and institutional adoption remain tailwinds, Ripple’s path to triple-digit growth appears fraught with hurdles. Contrastingly, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) avoids such dependencies, leveraging its decentralized lending model to drive demand irrespective of macroeconomic shifts. Mutuum Finance Capitalizes on Presale Momentum and Tokenomics The DeFi platform MUTM stands out among DeFi solutions because it delivers practical use cases for users. Mutuum Finance gains investor interest by offering lending protocols and mtTokens that produce interest on deposits. MUTM tokens are currently available during their second presale stage at $0.015 while they will move to $0.02 in a subsequent pricing step following a predicted price boost of 33%. The project benefits from its buy-and-distribute features since revenue produced buybacks sustain market demand alongside staking rewards that encourage hodlers to maintain their assets. The future listing price of $0.06 for MUTM tokens can lead to a 4000% profits for early investors according to analysts who foresee that MUTM prices could potentially rise to $4. More than 4300 investors have participated in MUTM’s presale because they appreciate its open tokenomics and planned P2P lending capabilities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) achieves its growth through planned tokenomics structures and instant token presale gains rather than pursuing speculative achievement targets like XRP and DOGE. The sell-out pace of phase two accelerates while the project establishes increased investor confidence through its $2.3 million fundraise. The eight-week plan leading to $4 provides MUTM investors with an attractive window when they value actual returns instead of future speculations. The timeout for $0.015 token acquisition during presale is shrinking which produces faster FOMO through increased desire for lucrative returns. Secure MUTM tokens at $0.015 right now as the Mutuum Finance presale phase two will reach its conclusion soon. Take part in the presale on the official website to secure potential 300% profit when the platform launches.

After languishing below $85k for days, Bitcoin climbed past $90k last Monday and briefly flirted with the $95k level. However, crypto’s hot streak was brief, making Trump’s latest statement a “sell on news” event. From $94,770 on March 3, Bitcoin dipped to as low as $82,681 on March 4. Leading altcoins also slumped with BTC, creating a ripple effect across the broader crypto industry. Today, Bitcoin is trading wildly between $84k and $91k, more than 10k below its all-time high. Related Reading: Billionaire Warns Of Financial Turmoil—Will Bitcoin Save Investors? What’s Up With The Bitcoin Drop? Bitcoin gradually recovered from a low of $83,000 last week and bounced back to $92k days before the planned White House Crypto Summit this Friday, March 7th. Trump’s latest pronouncement did not specify how the reserve shall be funded beyond what was already included in the US’ crypto holdings. Instead of clarity, the statement was just a commitment to retain crypto holdings, with no specifics on funding. The president’s disclosure on a possible stockpile spurred conversations and debates among analysts and critics. Many crypto holders and supporters backed the possible inclusion of SOL, XRP, and ADA. Stock broker and financial commentator Peter Schiff shared his thoughts on the plan, saying the US government should limit the assets included in the pile. He specifically identified “seized assets”, so the government should not buy additional SOL, ADA, XRP, and ETH. Other Crypto Experts Remain Supportive Of Bitcoin As Bitcoin and other leading altcoins struggle, other crypto personalities publicly announce their support for the project. For example, Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich argued that even though BTC is retreating, there’s no denying the importance of Trump’s latest executive order. Gerovich stated that this new order authorizes the Secretaries of Commerce and Treasury to draft a strategy for buying Bitcoin without burdening American taxpayers. He stated that the order is more aggressive and provides a plan for acquiring more crypto without affecting the national budget. Possible Paths To Acquire BTC Discussed Gerovich further explains that there are two ways the US government can acquire Bitcoins and set up a strategic stockpile: One, Trump can exercise his presidential power by using the Exchange Stabilization Fund, which has $39 billion in assets. Two, the president can rely on Congressional approval. The second option is in line with Senator Lummis’ Bitcoin Bill, where the US government will acquire 200k Bitcoins annually for five years. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Won’t Stop At $150K’ This Year, Research Firm Chief Says Lummis was one of the first personalities to comment on the latest EO. The senator mentioned that the latest order was just the beginning, and encouraged Congress to pass the Bitcoin bill.

The 60% Bonus on FloppyPepe (FPPE) Ends Today FloppyPepe (FPPE) Leads the Best Crypto Presales to Buy Now Meme coins have proven time and time again that they can deliver unbelievable returns, but the key is finding projects that offer something unique. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is exactly that, with a fully functional AI ecosystem that provides tangible utility. While many presales rely on speculation, FloppyPepe has two live AI-powered utilities that set it apart from all competitors. Additionally, FloppyPepe is backed by strong tokenomics, including a deflationary burn mechanism that reduces supply over time.

BTFD Coin (BTFD) – A community-driven token that has generated $6.2 million in presale funding, positioning itself as a speculative meme coin with a strong backing. Both projects may appeal to certain investors, but neither offers the AI-driven engagement and real-time content generation that FloppyPepe (FPPE) provides. Final Chance: The 60% Bonus Ends Today! For those looking for the best crypto presales to buy now, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is the top contender.

Wild. It’s clear that he’s gotten the message that bitcoin is something altogether different than all other digital assets. He’s proven this not only by what he said at today’s Crypto Summit, but also by signing an executive order (EO) last night that established a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) independently of a Digital Asset stockpile. The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Regarding the SBR, the President said today that the U.S. plans to hold onto the bitcoin it has in its possession, unlike previous administrations who have sold massive sums of it. “Unfortunately, in recent years, the U.S. government has foolishly sold tens of thousands of bitcoin (200,000, by some estimates ) that were worth billions and billions of dollars had they not sold them,” said President Trump. That said, the President also shared that members of his administration will pursue avenues to accumulate bitcoin — at no expense to the American public. “The Treasury and Commerce departments will explore new pathways to accumulate additional bitcoin holdings for the reserve, provided it’s done at no cost to the taxpayers,” he said. “We don’t want any cost to the taxpayers,” he reiterated, highlighting the notion that the U.S. government plans to amass bitcoin in a “budget-neutral” (to borrow language from last night’s EO) manner. Attendees Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick were present at the summit alongside approximately 30 prominent members of the Bitcoin and crypto industry, including Strategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, and BTC Inc. CEO David Bailey. President Trump with nearly three dozen notable members of the Bitcoin and crypto industry. Photo credit: Frank Corva Other members of the Trump administration, including head of Small Business Administration Kelly Loeffler and White House Crypto Czar David Sacks, were also in attendance. Both Sacks and Loeffler praised the pace at which Trump is making progress with Bitcoin and crypto executive orders and legislation. “Your administration is moving at tech [startup] speed,” said Sacks. “It’s actually faster than any startup that I’ve been part of,” added the venture capitalist, well-known for investing in many tech startups over the course of his career. Secretary Lutnick vouched for President Trump’s newfound Bitcoin and crypto knowledge, adding that the President has truly come to embrace the technology. “Blockchain and Bitcoin technology are a key part of [the President’s] thinking,” said Lutnick. “We’re using blockchain. We’re using Bitcoin. We’re going to use digital assets to [push] forward, and Donald Trump is leading the way,” he added. Stablecoins As Money, Bitcoin As Store Of Value Now, before you go and get too excited about Secretary Lutnick talking about “using” bitcoin, please know that with all the bullish bitcoin talk at the event, not a word of bitcoin being used as money was uttered. Instead, it was solely referred to as a savings technology. As far as digital assets that the administration views as money, stablecoins stand alone. And Secretary Bessent reinforced this message, most recently pushed at both the first U.S. Press Conference on Digital Assets and the first Subcommittee on Digital Assets hearing , at the summit. “We are going to put a lot of thought into the stablecoin regime,” said Secretary Bessent. “And as President Trump has directed, we are going to keep the U.S. [dollar] the dominant reserve currency in the world, and we will use stablecoins to do that.” (And before you go cursing Secretary Bessent under your breath as you read this, please note that he also dropped an absolutely banger of a pro-bitcoin one-liner at the event: “President Trump is creating assets for the American people while most past presidents have created debt.”) What Wasn’t Discussed What is more, on a summit preview call with senior White House officials this morning, one of the officials dispelled the rumor that the administration would remove the capital gains tax from crypto sales (which is also applicable when you spend bitcoin or crypto), clearly stating that the administration has no plans to do this and that the topic wouldn’t even be broached at the summit. (It wasn’t.) Something else that wasn’t discussed at the summit was whether or not the U.S. Marshalls have provided the Trump administration with a proper audit of the bitcoin and other digital assets in their custody (last it was reported, they apparently have little idea of what they’re holding ). Also unmentioned was how the government plans to secure the private keys to the bitcoin it keeps in the SBR. (I planned to inquire about the latter, but the members of the press present at the event weren’t permitted to ask questions.) But let’s not get lost in some of the currently minor details here. It Was A Good Day Instead, let’s take a queue from Brian Armstrong, and acknowledge that today was, by many standards, a good day. “It was a pretty historic moment for the crypto industry,” Armstrong told Bitcoin Magazine after the summit had concluded. “President Trump really breathed life back into this industry. A few years ago, it felt like we were under attack, and some folks tried to unlawfully kill the whole industry. What a sea change to be invited into the White House and to have the most pro-crypto president ever,” he added. Armstrong also noted that, next, he wants to see legislation passed to help make concrete some of the positive Bitcoin and crypto initiatives set in motion under the Trump administration. “Congress is making really good progress on this with stablecoin and market structure legislation, and hopefully codifying this Strategic Bitcoin Reserve eventually, as well.” This post White House Draws Line Between Bitcoin And Digital Assets At Its First Crypto Summit, In EO first appeared on Bitcoin Magazine and is written by Frank Corva .",NEWS|FEATURED|Bitcoin Policy|crypto|News|Strategic Bitcoin Reserve|White House,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|FIAT|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Bitcoin Magazine', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinmagazine.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinmagazine,2025-03-08 02:38:56

Saylor’s 34-page document, shared directly with Trump and attendees, laid out an entire strategy to restructure the U.S. financial system with crypto at its core. Source: @Saylor on X The main focus here is to make sure Trump’s proposed Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) can erase the national debt, dominate cyberspace, and turn the U.S. into the ultimate financial powerhouse. Saylor told Trump that if the U.S. started buying Bitcoin right now, it could generate $16-81 trillion in wealth for the Treasury by 2045. Within that same timeframe, the SBR could be bringing in over $10 trillion per year—all without selling a single Bitcoin. America could control 25% of all Bitcoins, says Saylor Saylor told Trump that the U.S. must immediately start accumulating Bitcoin through a consistent, programmatic daily purchase strategy. The goal? Control 5-25% of the total Bitcoin supply before 2035, when 99% of all Bitcoin will have been mined. Once locked in, Bitcoin’s fixed supply and long-term price appreciation would turn the reserve into a perpetual wealth engine. “The race to dominate cyberspace has already started,” Saylor warned in his report. “If we don’t lead, someone else will.” His argument was clear: If the U.S. wants to remain a global financial superpower, it must own Bitcoin in massive quantities. ""Welcome to the first-ever White House Digital Asset Summit. Last year, I promised to make America the Bitcoin superpower of the world, AND WE'RE TAKING HISTORIC ACTION TO DELIVER ON THAT PROMISE."" –President Donald J. Trump 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/nqUrHQ1xLl — President Donald J. Trump (@POTUS) March 8, 2025 China, he noted, has already moved aggressively into digital finance. If the U.S. doesn’t act now, it risks losing its economic edge forever. Saylor also made it clear that the U.S. government should never sell its Bitcoin holdings. The plan is simple: Buy. Hold. Repeat. As the supply of new Bitcoin dries up over time, demand will skyrocket, prices will climb, and the U.S. Treasury will be sitting on a goldmine. Saylor suggests a new financial system for an American Bitcoin economy Saylor’s proposal also laid out an entire framework for rebuilding the U.S. financial system around crypto. His plan breaks the term “digital assets” into four categories, making it easier to integrate crypto with traditional markets: Digital Tokens – Corporate-backed assets used for fundraising and innovation. These would allow U.S. companies to raise trillions through tokenized securities, said Saylor. Digital Securities – Tokenized stocks, bonds, and ETFs that would trade on 24/7 global markets, eliminating intermediaries and cutting costs. Digital Currencies – U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins issued by American companies to maintain global financial control, said Saylor. Digital Commodities – Bitcoin, which designed for wealth preservation and long-term value storage. Saylor, who loves Bitcoin more than probably everyone else on the planet, referred to it as “an asset without an issuer, backed by Digital Power, for Capital Preservation & Appreciation.” If followed through, Saylor believes that his framework will add $60-100 trillion to the U.S. economy by the end of the decade. His breakdown is $10 trillion from tokens, $20 trillion from digital securities, $10 trillion from stablecoins, and $20 trillion from Bitcoin. “The dominant Digital Commodity, Bitcoin, will serve as a global standard for capital preservation and appreciation, attracting trillions in capital flows, with the U.S. as the primary beneficiary,” said Saylor in his document. Saylor also called for an immediate and permanent end to hostile policies that are crippling the crypto industry in the U.S. Among his polite demands are: Stop unfair taxation on Bitcoin mining and crypto transactions. Saylor argued that the government should encourage, not punish, mining operations. Force banks to accept crypto businesses. “Debanking crypto firms is a national security risk,” he stated in the document. Give U.S. companies the freedom to issue digital assets without endless regulatory roadblocks. Let digital assets move freely over the internet. The government should not interfere with crypto transactions, Saylor argued. “The government should support, not suppress, Bitcoin and crypto innovation,” Saylor wrote. “If the U.S. takes the lead, capital will flow into the country, jobs will be created, and our economy will thrive.” Trump, who has now fully embraced Bitcoin, was reportedly receptive to Saylor’s vision. His administration has already moved to deregulate parts of the crypto industry and encourage private sector innovation. Saylor’s message only reinforced what Trump has been saying for months: The U.S. must become the Bitcoin superpower of the world. Saylor’s proposal also stressed the geopolitical risks of ignoring Bitcoin. If the U.S. doesn’t take control, China, Russia, and other adversaries will. “This is a matter of national security,” his document warned. “Bitcoin is the most valuable asset in cyberspace. Whoever controls it, controls the future.” The meeting at the White House made one thing clear: The battle for crypto dominance is already underway. With Trump in office and Bitcoin at the center of U.S. financial strategy, the next decade could see a massive economic transformation. $60-100 trillion is at stake, and the only question now is: Will the U.S. move fast enough?

Lucie, the marketing lead for Shiba Inu, addressed concerns within the community, expressing optimism about the token’s long-term success. Never say never SHIB WILL SUCCEED — 𝐋𝐔𝐂𝐈𝐄 (@LucieSHIB) March 3, 2025 SHIB Faces Market Decline Like many cryptocurrencies, SHIB has experienced a significant price drop, reaching a multi-month low of $0.00001228. Although the token has slightly rebounded to $0.00001300, it remains down by 60% from its December 5 peak of $0.000033. The situation is even more pronounced compared to its all-time high of $0.00008845, reflecting an 85.65% decline. Current data indicates that a substantial portion of the token holders are at a loss. Approximately 85.23% of SHIB-holding blockchain addresses, collectively possessing 839.23 trillion tokens (valued at $10.66 billion), are currently in a negative position. Meanwhile, 12.42% of addresses, holding 122.34 trillion SHIB ($1.55 billion), remain in profit. Another 2.34% of holders, with 23.09 trillion tokens, are at breakeven levels. Lucie Reassures Investors Amid Volatility In response to concerns over the token’s performance, Lucie conveyed a message of reassurance to the community. She emphasized her strong belief in SHIB’s long-term potential, asserting that the token will succeed despite current market fluctuations. Lucie did not provide specific reasons for her optimism but has consistently expressed confidence in the ecosystem. She attributes SHIB’s potential future growth to several ongoing initiatives, including Shibarium, ShibaSwap, SHIB: The Metaverse, Shiba Inu games, and the Shib Marketplace. These projects are part of the team’s strategy to transition SHIB from a meme token to a utility-driven asset. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additionally, the team is actively promoting the idea of a Shiba Inu exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. If successful, this initiative could introduce the token to institutional investors, potentially increasing its market adoption. Potential for Recovery Despite recent declines, market analysis suggests that SHIB could end the month with notable gains. Historical data from CryptoRank shows that the asset has experienced an average growth rate of 31.7% in March over the years. In March 2022, SHIB recorded a slight 0.43% increase, while March 2023 saw a 9.65% decline. However, the token rebounded the following year with a substantial 145.2% surge. As of March 2025, SHIB has fallen by 8.56% in the first few days of the month. While past trends indicate potential for recovery, investors are reminded that historical performance does not guarantee future results. Given the volatility of cryptocurrency markets, caution is advised when considering investments in SHIB or similar assets. The Shiba Inu team remains committed to advancing its ecosystem, with ongoing efforts to drive adoption and increase the token’s long-term value. Additionally, they are looking forward to the possibility of being included in the U.S. strategic crypto reserve , which if successful would further enhance the asset’s credibility and global recognition.

Investors of BlockDAG and Solaxy are flocking in to receive 500 free SKYRN coins. It appears that investors can recognize its benefits. Skyren DAO integrates a rewards ecosystem based on staking with tokens that have real world utility. Instead of providing a single time airdrop, SkyrenDAO provides claimants with staking opportunities. They can also participate in governance voting and access premium airdrops. This has resulted in an overwhelming response from the holders of Solaxy and BlockDAG. Why BlockDAG and Solaxy Investors Are interested in SKYRN Solaxy and BlockDAG are known for their scalability and efficiency. Hence, they’re seen as high-value projects. BlockDAG improves the efficiency of the network and transaction throughput. It achieves this via DAG architecture, which allows the parallel processing of transactions. This removes bottlenecks and provides better blockchain performance. Solaxy, on the other hand, is a Layer-2 scaling solution. It is designed to improve congestion and network efficiency in the Solana ecosystem. Hence it automatically improves the transaction speeds and reduces the fees via off-chain processing. Due to this approach, Solaxy is an important tool for projects that require high speed interaction with the blockchain and that too, without congestion. Skyren DAO carries a vision to create a strong ecosystem driven by rewards. It believes that token holders should be able to make passive income via staking and should be able to influence governance decisions. Hence, it has decided to include BlockDAG and Solaxy investors in its Token Surge Event. How BlockDAG and Solaxy Investors Can Claim Their SKYRN Tokens Investors who participated in the BlockDAG or Solaxy presale can claim their 500 SKYRN tokens by following these steps: Go to Skyren.io official website and access the Token Surge Event page. Submit proof of presale participation in BlockDAG or Solaxy. Provide an EVM-compatible wallet address for token distribution. Receive SKYRN tokens instantly once verification is completed. Once claimed, SKYRN can be staked immediately to start earning passive rewards and gain access to exclusive airdrop pools reserved for active platform participants. SKYRN’s token focuses on Staking, Governance, and Airdrops Using the SKYRN token, users can access an ecosystem with structured rewards. The goal is to enable value creation for the long term. Users can stake SKYRN to earn dynamic yields. In these yields, the rate adjusts itself based on the staking volume and participation in the network. This is different from fixed APY models and is an approach the provides higher returns to heavy stakers while also stabilizng liquidity in the ecosystem. Another major benefit is participation in the governance. Holders of the SKYRN token will have a big say in how the platform is run. They can vote on staking rewards along with allocations of new airdrops. Their decisions will also affect major upgrades in the ecosystem. Such a system ensures that the project is run mainly by the community. Airdrop access rounds provide high value tokens to the holders, which is a major utility of SKYRN. It makes sure that users are receiving tokens only from verified and promising blockchain projects. Skyren’s Contributor Keys, a Polygon-based NFT system, further enhance these rewards by boosting staking multipliers, increasing governance influence, and granting VIP access to top-tier airdrops. Crypto League has analyzed Skyren DAO’s staking rewards, governance model, and airdrop system. It has highlighted ways in which the platform ensures long term growth and engagement for investors. Spin The Wheel: Extra Rewards for SKYRN Holders Skyren DAO’s Spin The Wheel feature offers a fun and rewarding way to increase SKYRN holdings. How It Works Every SKYRN purchase earns spin tickets . Spin the wheel for extra SKYRN tokens or staking bonuses . Larger purchases unlock more spins, increasing reward potential . Winners receive instant SKYRN rewards, credited to their wallets . This interactive rewards system keeps participants engaged while offering additional earning potential beyond staking and governance.

In its new interpretive letter, the OCC clarified that national banks and federal savings associations are allowed to offer crypto custody services, handle certain stablecoin activities, and operate nodes. “The OCC expects banks to have the same strong risk management controls in place to support novel bank activities as they do for traditional ones,” said Acting Comptroller of the Currency Rodney E. Hood. It remarked that this decision will ease the pressure on banks involved in crypto activities and ensures that these activities are treated consistently by the OCC, regardless of the technology used. On Friday, the OCC withdrew guidance issued during President Joe Biden’s administration, which had imposed extra requirements on banks wanting to engage in certain crypto activities. The previous letters told banks to brief their supervisors on crypto activities beforehand, explain how they would manage risks, and get approval before proceeding with crypto activities. The OCC also removed joint statements from U.S. regulators that had warned banks against engaging with crypto. A 2023 statement didn’t ban crypto business but cautioned that the sector is highly volatile and that any crypto-related activities by banks would face close scrutiny.

Notably, the cryptocurrency had shown signs of strength earlier this week following a period of decline, but the recovery was short-lived. As of today, Bitcoin slipped below $90,000, marking a 1.8% decrease in the past 24 hours. According to CryptoQuant analyst Crazzyblockk, one key factor contributing to this downward movement appears to be increased selling pressure from large Bitcoin holders. Related Reading: Historic Bitcoin Buy Signal: DXY’s Collapse Signals A Bigger Bull Run Whales and Large Holders Drive Selling Pressure on Binance Crazzyblockk in his latest insight highlights how whales and other large investors on Binance are actively offloading BTC as prices rise. This trend suggests that experienced traders are taking advantage of market optimism to exit their positions, potentially limiting Bitcoin’s short-term upside potential. Whale to Binance Flow Hits 3-Month High at $7.3B Over Last 30 Days “This often happens alongside heavy changes in price and shows that large holders choose Binance as their exchange. Watching whale deposits is important, as their moves can drive the market.” – By @JA_Maartun pic.twitter.com/psD3zuDXf3 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) March 6, 2025 The trend also comes at a time when whale to Binance flow sees a consistent increase. Crazzyblockk’s analysis of on-chain data from Binance particularly indicates that large Bitcoin holders—categorized as fish, sharks, and whales—are selling into market rallies. The data reveals that the larger the holder, the more strategically they distribute their Bitcoin holdings. These entities account for an increasing share of daily sell-side activity on Binance, suggesting that they are actively shaping Bitcoin’s price movements. As Bitcoin’s price trends upward, whale activity on Binance has intensified, with more BTC flowing into the exchange. The report highlights that while retail investors—often referred to as shrimps—have remained relatively inactive, whales and sharks are capitalizing on rising prices to take profits. This consistent distribution from high-value holders has created sustained downward pressure, preventing Bitcoin from making a parabolic move higher. Bitcoin Market Outlook: Can Accumulation Offset Whale Selling? With large holders continuing to offload BTC, the risk remains that any further upside could trigger even more selling pressure, reinforcing resistance levels. This dynamic means that Bitcoin’s price movement could remain constrained unless new accumulation from long-term investors or institutional buyers offsets the selling trend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Signal: $900 Million In BTC Leaves Exchanges Crazzyblockk emphasizes that tracking Binance’s whale activity is crucial for understanding market direction. Since these large holders are not just participants but also price movers, their actions can provide insight into short-term market trends. If whale selling slows and new accumulation picks up, Bitcoin could find support and regain momentum. However, if the current trend continues, further downside pressure remains a possibility.

The company is working with Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, and while no final decision has been made, Bloomberg’s sources reportedly said the IPO could happen this year. The report comes merely hours after the White House crypto summit and two weeks after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officially closed its investigation into Gemini, a probe that had dragged on for 699 days and cost the company tens of millions in legal fees. Cameron confirmed the SEC’s decision in February, posting a photo of the agency’s letter on X. The letter, dated February 24, stated that SEC staff “do not recommend an enforcement action” against Gemini. The probe, which began nearly two years ago, had put a major cloud over Gemini, with the SEC even issuing a Wells Notice 277 days ago, signaling that legal action was on the table. The agency never explained what led to the decision to drop the case, but Gemini’s leadership didn’t hold back their frustration. “It’s wholly unacceptable for an agency like the SEC to bully, harass, and attack a lawful industry and then decide one day to simply say we’re good and walk away,” Cameron wrote. Trump administration’s crypto stance fuels IPO wave Cameron and Tyler were among 30 crypto executives and government officials who attended Donald Trump’s crypto Summit at the White House last night. The event signaled a massive policy shift from the previous administration, as Trump made it clear that his government would be crypto-friendly. On Thursday night, Trump announced that the U.S. would create a Bitcoin national reserve and stockpile other seized crypto assets. The government won’t be using taxpayer money to buy Bitcoin—it will simply hold onto assets that have been confiscated in legal cases. The decision received mixed reactions from the industry. Some investors saw it as a sign of legitimacy for Bitcoin, while others dismissed it as symbolic and unlikely to have real impact. “This is not the aggressive Bitcoin reserve some were pressing for,” Jaret Seiberg, a TD Cowen analyst, said in a note. “We view this as a compromise.” He added that the government is not actually buying crypto, just holding onto what it has seized. Analysts at Compass Point were even less impressed. “An executive order is not legislation, it is an exercise of executive authority, and it is not durable,” Edwin Groshans wrote. He pointed out that without Congress passing a law, Trump’s decision could be easily overturned by a future administration. “To be frank, we view its issuance to be a dud that will not provide support to the value of BTC or any other digital asset, primarily because there is no authorization to purchase BTC,” he added. SEC backs off, crypto companies push forward The SEC’s retreat from aggressive enforcement isn’t limited to Gemini. In recent days, the agency also dropped charges against Coinbase and ended its investigation into Uniswap, signaling a policy shift as Trump’s administration moves to deregulate the crypto industry. For Gemini, the end of the SEC probe clears the way for one of the biggest crypto IPOs to date. The company has more than 500 employees across offices in New York, Seattle, Singapore, London, and Dublin. It has positioned itself as a regulated, compliance-focused alternative to other crypto exchanges, which is why the SEC investigation was such a headache. Cameron and Tyler, who gained fame for their legal fight with Mark Zuckerberg over Facebook, have been strong supporters of Trump’s crypto policies. Both donated Bitcoin beyond the maximum campaign contribution limit and were refunded the excess amount. With the IPO now back on the table, the twins are betting that the crypto market’s recovery—and Trump’s support—will give investors confidence in Gemini’s long-term growth. Bitcoin’s price barely reacted to the executive order, holding steady at $88,000 after a brief dip. Other major cryptocurrencies, including Ether and Solana, inched higher, while XRP and Cardano-linked tokens fell slightly. Despite Trump’s crypto-friendly stance, traditional financial analysts remain skeptical. Noelle Acheson, economist and author of the “Crypto is Macro Now” newsletter, noted that macro conditions are still weighing on crypto markets. “There is nothing on the immediate horizon to suggest relief for the building concern about a slowdown,” she said. She added that investors are still hesitant, despite Trump’s pro-crypto policies. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

Stellar (XLM) is vibing hard lately, crushing a solid 9% price surge within just seven days, even outpacing XRP’s 7% weekly growth. Meanwhile, SEI is catching attention for a monster trading volume spike, hitting a jaw-dropping $6.5 billion in DEX trades—talk about flexing market muscles! These two projects are grabbing headlines and igniting chatter. But while everyone’s glued to Stellar and SEI’s recent moves, another game-changing crypto is quietly brewing beneath the surface— Qubetics ($TICS).

Why the Qubetics Presale Might Be One of the best crypto ICOs to invest Right Now There’s no sugar-coating it—the buzz around the Qubetics presale is intense. At Stage 24, the price sits attractively at just $0.0976 per $TICS, but the clock is ticking because every Sunday at midnight, prices jump by 10%. Already, the presale’s raised over $14.6 million, boasting more than 496 million tokens sold to over 22,400 holders. This isn’t random hype; this is hard evidence that participants see Qubetics as one of the best crypto ICOs to invest . Here’s why these numbers are causing a stir. Imagine a participant puts in just $100 right now—that lands them 1,024 $TICS. When presale wraps up, even if $TICS hits just $0.25, that’s an impressive 155.93% ROI. Now let’s dream bigger—at just $1 per token post-presale, that becomes a dazzling 923.72% ROI. And if this token blasts off to $5? That’s an insane 5,018.58% ROI on that same humble hundred. Numbers don’t lie, and neither do market trends. It’s crystal clear why many community members label Qubetics presale as the best crypto presale—it truly has everything to become one of the best crypto ICOs to invest. Stellar Outshines XRP with a Stellar 9% Weekly Gain Stellar (XLM) recently captured major market attention by posting an impressive 9% weekly price surge, clearly outpacing XRP, which managed only a modest 1.5% gain in the same period. This sudden spike didn’t just happen randomly—it’s tied closely to Stellar’s strategic moves and recent market optimism around its ecosystem developments. At the moment, XLM is trading steadily around $0.1355, reflecting a healthy 1.70% daily price increase, maintaining its positive momentum throughout the week. The crypto community is closely watching Stellar’s technical charts, which now display strong bullish signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 67.31, inching closer to overbought territory but signaling solid buyer strength. Additionally, Stellar’s 200-day moving average (MA) rests firmly below the current trading price, indicating potential for further gains ahead. Trading volume surged as well, indicating increased market confidence, with XLM trading volumes climbing sharply. The growing interest aligns closely with Stellar’s positive price action, marking it as a serious contender among cryptos attracting fresh attention and potential future gains. SEI Records Epic $6.5 Billion DEX Volume—Could a 3x Rally to $0.60 Be Next? SEI Network has suddenly jumped into the crypto spotlight by smashing records with a whopping $6.5 billion in decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume. Crypto traders and community members are all-in, as this record-breaking activity represents a major 41% surge, underscoring SEI’s potential to rally significantly. With analysts now speculating on whether SEI can ride this momentum to reach a potential 3x growth, aiming directly for the $0.60 price mark, excitement around SEI is at an all-time high. Currently hovering around $0.18, SEI has massive room for growth. Considering its significant activity on the decentralized exchange front, analysts believe it could realistically pull off a 233% rally soon. This scenario is especially compelling for traders seeking short-term profits as SEI rapidly gains popularity among decentralized trading enthusiasts. The real question buzzing across the crypto community right now is simple—can SEI sustain this momentum? With traders closely tracking the network’s trading performance and market enthusiasm building by the day, SEI could soon rewrite its own success story, positioning itself as a top token to watch closely. Which Next Big Crypto Could Actually Make You Bank? Stellar’s recent 9% weekly surge has put it firmly in the spotlight, signaling significant growth potential, while SEI’s jaw-dropping $6.5 billion DEX volume positions it perfectly for a massive breakout rally. Yet, the crypto chatter surrounding Qubetics and its groundbreaking tokenization marketplace can’t be ignored—especially when considering the mind-blowing potential returns.

Recently, the whale transaction tracker Whale Alert posted on X (formerly Twitter) that 150 million XRP tokens had been transferred from an unknown wallet. 150,000,000 #XRP (380,084,007 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown wallet https://t.co/vwogddWvFt — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) March 7, 2025 This substantial token transaction is sparking curiosity across the crypto space, raising questions about whether it is the first step toward a dramatic shift in XRP’s price or just another routine move with no impact. Current Price Momentum XRP is currently trading near $2.34 and has experienced a price drop of over 6% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume declined by 15%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. XRP Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, XRP’s recent price drop has brought it to a crucial support level of $2.30, creating a make-or-break situation. Source: Trading View Based on current market sentiment and historical patterns, if the asset manages to hold this level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 20% to reach $2.79 in the coming days. On the other hand, if the price continues to fall, breaches the support level, and closes a four-hour candle below $2.24, there is a strong possibility of a 15% decline, bringing the asset down to $1.90 in the future. At present, XRP is trading below the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe, indicating a downtrend. Most traders and investors use this indicator to make informed decisions. Traders’ Over-Leveraged Levels Besides the make-or-break situation, traders appear to hold a bearish sentiment, strongly betting on a lower price as they believe it won’t rise soon, according to on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Source: Coinglass Data from the XRP exchange liquidation map reveals that traders are over-leveraged at $2.241 on the lower side and $2.6 on the upper side. They have built $46 million worth of long positions and $106 million worth of short positions at these respective levels in the past 24 hours.

41312290,https://timestabloid.com/?p=59593,1741407527,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,10 Reasons SHIB ETF Should Be Listed By BlackRock and Grayscale,https://timestabloid.com/10-reasons-shib-etf-should-be-listed-by-blackrock-and-grayscale/,"A growing movement within the Shiba Inu community advocates for major asset managers, including BlackRock and Grayscale, to introduce an exchange-traded fund (ETF) for SHIB in the U.S. A Shiba Inu-based news channel recently outlined ten key reasons why such an ETF would be a valuable addition to the crypto investment landscape. Increasing Market Demand One of the primary arguments in favor of a SHIB ETF is the strong market demand. Shiba Inu has built a vast and dedicated community, and an ETF could tap into this existing user base, driving significant interest and adoption among retail and institutional investors. Shibarium’s Expanding Ecosystem The launch of Shibarium has strengthened the token’s ecosystem. Since going live in August 2023 , the Layer 2 blockchain has facilitated various applications, including decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain gaming. This growing infrastructure enhances the token’s long-term viability, making it a compelling asset for an ETF. Appeal to Retail Investors Affordability is another key factor for a SHIB ETF. The relatively low cost of the tokens makes them accessible to a broad range of investors, particularly those new to cryptocurrency. If BlackRock or Grayscale were to launch an ETF, it could attract significant retail interest, expanding the reach of crypto-based investment products. Strong Liquidity and Trading Volume The digital asset maintains a high level of liquidity, with billions of dollars in daily trading volume. This liquidity is essential for an ETF, as it ensures smooth market operations and reduces risks related to price manipulation or limited availability. These characteristics make the token a suitable candidate for an ETF offering. Potential for a Diversified Crypto ETF Another advantage would be the ability to bundle multiple assets within the ecosystem. A diversified fund incorporating SHIB alongside ecosystem tokens such as BONE could provide investors with broader exposure to the Shiba Inu network while mitigating risks associated with single-token investments. Alignment with ESG Principles Their commitment to social responsibility aligns with Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investment standards. Through initiatives like the Karma Foundation, the ecosystem has demonstrated a focus on community-driven efforts and sustainability. An ETF incorporating SHIB could attract investors seeking assets that align with socially responsible investment strategies. Global Adoption and Use Cases The token has achieved international adoption, particularly in sectors such as gaming and digital payments. The token’s expanding use cases contribute to its legitimacy as an investment asset and position it well for inclusion in an ETF designed for a global audience. Precedent Set by Existing Crypto ETFs The success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs highlights a growing demand for regulated crypto investment vehicles. These ETFs have attracted substantial capital inflows, demonstrating investor interest in crypto-based funds. A SHIB ETF could follow a similar trajectory, providing an alternative for investors looking to diversify their crypto holdings. Establishing BlackRock and Grayscale as Industry Leaders If BlackRock or Grayscale were to introduce a SHIB ETF, it would reinforce their status as innovators in the digital asset space. Expanding their ETF offerings to include this asset would signal a forward-thinking approach, further strengthening their leadership in the cryptocurrency investment sector. Long-Term Growth Potential The ecosystem’s continuous development and expanding utility suggest strong long-term growth prospects. With its active community, and increasing adoption, the asset presents a viable investment opportunity. An ETF could provide structured exposure to the asset, benefiting both issuers and investors. Despite growing interest, no major asset manager has formally applied for a Shiba Inu ETF in the U.S. However, the community remains optimistic that financial institutions will recognize the potential benefits of the ETF and take steps toward its development. If launched, such a product could boost the asset’s legitimacy while offering investors a regulated way to gain exposure to the asset.

Trump opened the summit with the following remarks: Unfortunately, in recent years, the U.S. Government sold tens of thousands of additional Bitcoin that would have been worth billions of dollars … Never sell your Bitcoin. That’s a phrase they have, I don’t know whether it’s wrong or right. Donald Trump Trump says they will not sell any Bitcoin while promising to eliminate restrictive policies in the industry Joined by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks, Trump addressed more than twenty crypto executives and federal agency reps at the summit, reaffirming his commitment to the crypto industry. During the summit, he stated that he would work to eliminate restrictive crypto policies and hoped lawmakers would submit crypto regulation proposals to his desk before the August recess. Furthermore, he heavily criticized Biden’s administration for imposing stifling crypto policies, arguing that people really suffered under those policies. He also called out the previous administration for softening their stance on the crypto industry only when the election season approached. On Thursday, Trump signed an executive order to establish a BTC reserve and separate digital asset stockpile for the other cryptocurrencies, with the government’s crypto holdings acquired from criminal and civil litigation. From his words at the summit, it seems that none of the government’s Bitcoin, estimated at 200000 BTC, will be sold off, stating that the government will never sell their Bitcoin. However, he said that the Treasury could sell the other assets in the Digital Asset stockpile. He also said that the treasury is still working on more budget-neutral strategies to obtain Bitcoin. Moreover, he likened the crypto race to that of AI, insisting that it’s vital the US takes a lead in the industry just as it has in the AI sector. Trump also claimed that he wanted the US to become the “Bitcoin superpower” of the world. However, contrary to analyst expectations, the president did not address removing taxes on crypto assets at the summit. David Sacks wants the American public to do thorough research before they invest in any crypto assets Sacks told reporters on Friday that Bitcoin is special, seemingly supporting Trump’s decision not to sell the token. He further justified the launch of Trump and his family’s memecoin projects, saying the president’s personal crypto projects are “irrelevant” to the government’s crypto work. Additionally, he stated that the current administration is prioritizing making the country the world capital of crypto, establishing fair and clear regulations, and protecting investors. However, he refrained from trying to persuade Americans to purchase crypto, saying they should research what assets they want to invest in since it is a very volatile industry. He added that the crypto industry is not for everyone. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

The company could go public as soon as this year. The firm, founded by billionaires Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, is partnering with Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, although no final decision has been made on the IPO, the report said. IPO Follows SEC Dropping Investigation Notably, the potential IPO follows the SEC dropping its investigation into Gemini without taking action and the company settling a $5 million lawsuit with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The investigation, which was launched nearly two years ago, primarily focused on allegations that Gemini’s “Earn” program was offering unregistered securities. This program allowed users to lend their crypto assets in exchange for interest, which raised concerns with regulators about whether these activities violated securities laws. Cameron Winkelvoss noted in his X post that the SEC’s retreat “does little to make up for the damage this agency has done to us, our industry, and America.” The SEC ended its probe into Gemini, following similar actions against Uniswap, Robinhood, and OpenSea, and paused litigation against the Tron Foundation and Justin Sun, similar to recent motions in cases against Coinbase and Binance. Crypto IPO’s On The Rise Gemini is one of several crypto firms planning to go public in the U.S. after the SEC scaled back its litigation efforts in the early months of the Trump administration. Besides, in another development, Kraken is also eyeing an IPO by Q1 2026, with other companies like Circle, Bullish, and Blockchain.com also planning U.S. listings. The Winklevoss twins are well-known for their early Bitcoin investment and for leading Gemini, a regulated and secure crypto exchange. They are also strong advocates for establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss were among 30 top crypto leaders at the White House’s Digital Assets Summit on Friday. With President Trump’s administration embracing crypto, the door has swung wide open for IPOs in the industry. In a bold move, Trump also announced plans on Thursday to create a Bitcoin national reserve and stockpile other tokens seized during legal proceedings.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|BTC|FIAT|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-08 04:31:40

As blockchain networks like Ethereum ( ETH ) continue to see exponential growth, layer-two solutions are emerging as a vital component in addressing issues of network congestion and high transaction fees. In this post, we’ll dive into the latest developments in layer-two technology, its impact on blockchain scalability and how it’s paving the way for a more efficient and sustainable future for DeFi (decentralized finance) and beyond. Understanding layer-two solutions Blockchain networks like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum have often been criticized for their limited transaction throughput and scalability. Layer-two solutions aim to solve this problem by providing a secondary framework that operates on top of the main blockchain (layer one), allowing for faster, cheaper and more scalable transactions. There are different types of layer-two solutions, including the following. State channels – These allow two parties to transact off-chain and only settle the final state on the blockchain, reducing congestion. Rollups – Rollups bundle multiple transactions into one, significantly improving transaction speed and lowering fees. Plasma and optimistic rollups – Plasma offers a framework for building scalable applications, while optimistic rollups enable faster execution by assuming transactions are valid until proven otherwise. Layer-two in action – Ethereum’s road to scalability Ethereum – one of the most popular blockchain networks – has been at the forefront of layer-two innovation. The Ethereum network has struggled with high gas fees and slow transaction times due to its PoW (proof-of-work) consensus mechanism. However, Ethereum 2.0 and the integration of layer-two solutions, such as Optimism ( OP ) and Arbitrum ( ARB ), have shown tremendous promise in scaling Ethereum without compromising security. These layer-two solutions are helping to reduce Ethereum’s gas fees by processing transactions off-chain and only committing essential data to the Ethereum mainnet, making Ethereum more accessible to users across the globe. In fact, as Ethereum embraces a hybrid model of layer-one and layer-two, it’s enabling DApps (decentralized applications) to run more efficiently and cost-effectively. Recent updates – Layer-two adoption in the real world Polygon’s expanding ecosystem – Polygon ( MATIC ), one of the most notable layer-two platforms on Ethereum, has recently seen explosive growth. With major projects like Aave ( AAVE ), Decentraland ( MANA ) and even Starbucks utilizing Polygon to enhance scalability and reduce fees, it’s clear that layer-two solutions are becoming an integral part of the DeFi and non-fungible token (NFT) ecosystem. Arbitrum’s airdrop and rise in popularity – Arbitrum’s recent airdrop was one of the most highly anticipated events in the crypto space. This optimistic rollup solution has gained substantial traction for its low-cost transactions and high throughput, making it a go-to choice for developers and users in the Ethereum ecosystem. Solana’s layer-two integration – While Solana ( SOL ) is a layer-one blockchain known for its high-speed and low-cost transactions, it has also been exploring layer-two solutions to enhance its ecosystem further. With the introduction of layer-two protocols like zk-Rollups, Solana is continuing its push to become a global blockchain platform. Why layer-two is the key to unlocking crypto’s potential Layer-two solutions are set to play a critical role in driving the mass adoption of blockchain technology. By reducing transaction costs, improving transaction speed and minimizing network congestion, layer-two platforms are making DeFi, gaming and NFTs more accessible to the broader population. In addition to scalability, layer-two solutions offer enhanced privacy and security. As blockchain adoption grows, and more people enter the world of DeFi and crypto, layer-two will continue to bridge the gap between traditional financial systems and the decentralized world, ensuring that blockchain technology can scale for years to come. The road ahead – A fully scalable blockchain ecosystem As blockchain technology continues to evolve, it’s clear that layer-two solutions are not just a temporary fix but a long-term solution for scalability. The next phase of blockchain innovation will involve further integration of layer-two solutions across multiple blockchain ecosystems, leading to faster, cheaper and more efficient DApps. In the coming years, we can expect even more innovative layer-two protocols to emerge, offering a range of functionalities from secure cross-chain interoperability to privacy-preserving technologies. These developments will play a pivotal role in shaping the future of DeFi, NFTs and beyond. Conclusion Layer-two solutions are a game changer for the blockchain industry. As Ethereum, Polygon and other layer-one blockchains integrate these technologies, we’re seeing real-world applications for DeFi, NFTs and DApps thrive. By tackling scalability and reducing transaction costs, layer-two is helping bring blockchain into the mainstream. For investors, developers and blockchain enthusiasts, keeping an eye on layer-two’s development is crucial to understanding where the future of crypto and blockchain innovation is headed.

Avalanche (AVAX) and SUI, two prominent blockchain platforms, have experienced considerable setbacks recently. Avalanche has fallen 28%, while SUI has dropped 35%. In light of these developments, investors are turning their attention to emerging opportunities, notably Web3bay. Currently in its presale phase, Web3bay (3BAY) has successfully secured $1.60 million, drawing significant interest with its well-structured token sale. Amid the struggles faced by Avalanche and SUI, Web3bay is emerging as an attractive alternative for investors examining the current unpredictable market. Avalanche: Analyzing Recent Setbacks Avalanche, celebrated for its rapid and cost-efficient blockchain solutions, has witnessed its value decrease to $16.25. This represents a 2.37% decline in the last 24 hours and a substantial 28% over the past month. The slowdown in user engagement and the rising competition from similar technologies have influenced this decline. Despite being a preferred platform for numerous DeFi and NFT initiatives due to its low fees and quick processing times, the introduction rate of new projects on Avalanche has slowed. This deceleration has sparked concerns about the platform’s capacity to sustain its previous momentum. Experts believe that Avalanche could revitalize its ecosystem by securing new partnerships, launching innovative applications, and enhancing support for developers, potentially restoring its appeal and broadening its user base. SUI: Navigating Market Challenges SUI, a high-performance blockchain, is currently valued at $0.682. The token has decreased by 3.25% in the last day and 35% over the past month. Initially celebrated for its scalability and accessible tools, SUI is now struggling against a surge of competition from other Layer-1 blockchains, which has intensified the market environment. The growth of SUI’s ecosystem has lagged behind expectations. Although the platform’s technological foundation is robust, its slower-than-expected adoption has resulted in diminished transaction volumes and decreased network activity, adversely affecting the token’s performance. The market’s cooling sentiment towards SUI has investors waiting for more consistent growth indicators. Web3bay: Emerging as a Promising Investment Web3bay is carving out a niche as a viable investment choice. Its presale has already accumulated $1.60 million, with its organized sale strategy and potential for significant gains catching the eye of many. Web3bay’s goal is to establish a decentralized commerce platform that allows users complete control over their transactions. A key strength of Web3bay is its meticulously planned token sale. The current token price stands at $0.00524, with the presale setup poised to offer substantial benefits to early backers. Forecasts suggest a launch price of $0.1959, which could lead to notable profits for early investors. This methodical approach not only promotes a gradual increase in value but also provides investors with a clear picture of the project’s long-term viability. By emphasizing transparency and user empowerment, Web3bay positions itself as an appealing alternative in a landscape where other cryptocurrencies are struggling. Moreover, the platform distinguishes itself by tackling inefficiencies in traditional e-commerce systems. By eliminating middlemen and facilitating secure, direct interactions, Web3bay aspires to create a more streamlined and user-centric marketplace. For investors on the hunt for a high-growth opportunity, Web3bay offers a combination of a transparent roadmap, substantial initial interest, and a distinctive use case. Key Insights Avalanche and SUI each face unique challenges and opportunities. Avalanche, while well-established, is encountering slower growth and heightened competition. Its recent price reductions suggest that strategic innovations are needed to regain its momentum. SUI, despite its advanced technology, is wrestling with lower adoption rates and market pressures. While it retains potential, its slow ecosystem development is pushing investors towards other options. Web3bay stands out with its novel approach. As a decentralized commerce platform , it offers a unique proposition that differentiates it from conventional blockchain projects. Its structured token sale, coupled with a clear growth strategy, is attracting investors looking for potentially higher returns.

Strong Market Performance Fuels Optimism The asset has been among the beneficiaries of Bitcoin’s recent upward momentum, with its price surging past $2.60. This increase has contributed to a 23.79% gain over the past week, reinforcing confidence in the asset’s future potential. The ongoing market rally has led to heightened speculation among investors, with some predicting that XRP could reach triple- or even four-digit price levels in the coming years. Matthew Brienen, Chief Operating Officer at CryptoCharged, has stated that XRP has a strong chance of reaching a price between $100 and $1,000 in the long term. His views were highlighted in a post by a cryptocurrency commentator “Random Crypto Pal,” who described XRP’s market position as highly favorable. Brienen has been investing in XRP for over five years. He made it the largest asset in his portfolio, comprising 50% of his holdings. His investment strategy includes both short-term profit-taking and long-term accumulation. While he plans to sell part of his holdings soon, he intends to keep a substantial amount for the next 5 to 10 years, anticipating significant price appreciation. #XRP will go anywhere from $100 to $1000 in next 5 to 10 years, experts predict!! #XRP IS GIGA BULLISH! pic.twitter.com/7CtQNdBZ5Z — Random Crypto Pal (@RandomCryptoPal) March 2, 2025 Factors That Could Drive Growth According to Brienen, XRP’s potential for substantial growth is closely tied to its role in the global remittance industry. The asset’s ability to facilitate cross-border transactions within seconds and at a minimal cost is a major advantage. He emphasized that this efficiency makes the token a valuable tool for the future of financial transactions, particularly in international payments. Brienen believes that if XRP continues to gain adoption in the financial sector, its value could rise dramatically. However, he acknowledged that market conditions and other unpredictable factors could influence the timeline for achieving these price levels. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Cap Implications of a $1,000 XRP For the asset to reach $1,000 per token, its market capitalization has to grow significantly. Given its current price of $2.50, a move to $1,000 would represent a gain of over 38,000%. This would place XRP’s total market value at approximately $57 trillion, a figure that far exceeds the current size of the entire cryptocurrency market. While this projection may seem ambitious, some analysts argue that the token’s potential use cases in global finance could support long-term growth. However, reaching such a high valuation would require widespread adoption and favorable regulatory developments. Differing Opinions on the Token’s Long-Term Outlook Brienen is not the only analyst predicting substantial price increases for XRP as others in the crypto community have expressed similar expectations. Some foresee XRP reaching $100 soon, while others take a more cautious stance. Meanwhile, the prophet who predicted Trump’s reserve pick is also bullish on the digital asset . For example, research from Telegaon suggests that while the token could eventually reach $500, this milestone may not be achieved until 2050. This timeline contrasts with Brienen’s prediction of a $1,000 valuation by 2035, highlighting the range of opinions on how quickly XRP could experience such a dramatic increase in value. While the asset’s future remains uncertain, its recent market performance and growing use in cross-border payments have fueled optimism among investors. However, as with any cryptocurrency investment, potential risks and market fluctuations should be carefully considered.

The legal expert suggested that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might be waiting for new leadership before making a final decision. This has led to discussions about whether Ripple could negotiate a reduced penalty or alternative settlement. Ripple vs. SEC Lawsuit Could End with $125M Judgment The US SEC, currently led by a 2-1 pro-crypto commission under acting Chair Mark Uyeda, has not dropped its case against Ripple, despite withdrawing other cryptocurrency-related lawsuits. Legal analysts Fred Rispoli in an X post believes the agency is waiting for new SEC Chair candidate Paul Atkins to take office before making further decisions on the case. Fred Rispoli has argued that dropping the appeal while keeping the $125 million fine would save the SEC from further legal battles. “The best satisfaction of this, if true, is that it nullifies the thousands of hours of work put in by SEC staff to get the $125M judgment,” Rispoli stated in a post on X. The Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit remains one of the most complex legal battles in the cryptocurrency industry. While the SEC recently closed cases against Kraken, Coinbase, and ConsenSys, it has yet to take similar action against Ripple. Some legal experts believe the injunction on Ripple’s institutional sales of XRP may be a key factor in the delay. Speculation Over XRP Payments and Strategic Reserves There has been speculation that Ripple could settle the $125 million fine by transferring XRP instead of cash. Vincent Van Code, a market analyst, suggested that Ripple might be negotiating to pay the fine in XRP, which could then be allocated to a government-controlled cryptocurrency reserve. According to Van Code, “Some are speculating that Ripple, rather than pay $125 million in dollars, provides the equivalent in XRP to the new crypto strategic reserve.” However, attorney Rispoli doubts that such an arrangement is likely, given the slow progress in legal proceedings. Meanwhile, Ripple’s escrow holdings, which contain approximately 37.1 billion XRP, have been at the center of discussions regarding potential government acquisitions. Over the weekend, U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed that XRP would be part of the country’s digital asset reserve, fueling speculation that Ripple’s escrow could be involved in the legal negotiations. XRP Sales Restrictions Remain a Key Issue The Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit has focused on whether XRP should be classified as a security. In 2023, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple’s institutional sales of XRP were securities transactions, leading to the $125 million fine. Ripple has since been working to challenge the injunction that restricts certain sales of XRP to banks and payment processors. According to legal experts, Ripple’s efforts to overturn the injunction could be a reason why the SEC has not yet dropped its case. Attorney Jeremy Hogan has suggested that Ripple may be engaging with the Second Circuit Court of Appeals to contest the ruling. Meanwhile, Ripple Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz has dismissed concerns about XRP inflation. Schwartz reaffirmed that XRP’s total supply cannot be increased under the XRP Ledger’s code. “There is literally no function to create any more XRP. The code to do such a thing does not exist,” he stated. As for the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit, it is currently under review at the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. The SEC submitted its arguments to the court on January 15, 2025, and Ripple has until April 16 to file its response.

BTFD Coin’s $0.006 Target Price Could Be the Opportunity You Can’t Afford to Miss,https://thecoinrise.com/wish-you-had-a-time-machine-for-brett-btfd-coins-0-006-target-price-could-be-the-opportunity-you-cant-afford-to-miss/,"The crypto market is filled with moments you look back on and think, “If only I had bought in earlier.” Brett ($BRETT) is one of those stories. As the official meme coin of the Base Chain, Brett has skyrocketed in value, turning early believers into massive winners. But let’s be real—there’s no time machine to go back and grab Brett at its lowest price. However, there’s an even bigger opportunity unfolding right now with BTFD Coin ($BTFD). With BTFD Coin already raising over $6.27 million in presale, this isn’t just another meme coin hype cycle—it’s the next big thing. Packed with a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that’s already live, 90% APY staking rewards, and an explosive Bulls Squad referral program, BTFD is gearing up for a major market debut. And here’s where things get interesting: BTFD is currently priced at just $0.00016, but analysts predict it could hit $0.006 post-launch. That’s a massive 3,650% ROI potential, making it one of the top cryptos to join for short term gains right now. BTFD Coin’s Presale Is Smashing Records—Are You In? If you’ve been searching for top cryptos to join for short term, it’s time to take a serious look at BTFD Coin . Right now, Stage 14 of the presale is in full swing, and this discounted price won’t last long. With over 11,200 Bulls already on board and 71 billion $BTFD sold, demand is surging—and for good reason. Here’s what makes BTFD different from your average meme coin: Presale Strength – Over $6.27 million raised, proving major investor confidence. Staking Rewards – 90% APY on staking, allowing holders to earn passive income. P2E Game – Already live since January 1st, 2025, bringing real use cases to the ecosystem. Bulls Squad Referral Program – Giving investors extra ways to earn rewards by bringing in new holders. Now, let’s talk numbers. If you drop $5,000 into $BTFD at its current presale price of $0.00016, you’d be sitting on 31,250,000 BTFD tokens. When BTFD lists at $0.0006, your investment would already be worth $18,750—more than 3x your money. But what if BTFD reaches its projected $0.006 moon price? That’s where things get wild—your $5,000 turns into $187,500, delivering a 3,650% ROI. That’s the kind of second chance most investors dream of. And let’s not forget the keyword here—BTFD is one of the top cryptos to join for short term gains, and missing out on this presale could be just as painful as missing Brett’s initial run. How to Buy BTFD Coins? Getting in on one of the top cryptos to join for short term is simple: Set up your wallet – Use MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Load up with BNB, ETH, or USDT – These are your go-to purchase options. Connect to the presale – Visit the buy page and select your investment amount. Confirm your purchase – Approve the transaction in your wallet. Claim your tokens – Once the presale ends, your $BTFD will be ready to claim. With Stage 14 already here, this price won’t last forever. Top cryptos to join for short term don’t stay cheap for long—BTFD is proving that right now. Brett’s Success Story—What You Missed Brett ($BRETT) launched as the mascot of the Base Chain, quickly gaining traction among meme coin lovers. Inspired by Matt Furie’s “Boys’ Club” comic, this token became a cultural icon within the crypto space. It has a fixed supply of 10 billion tokens, which helped fuel its rapid rise in value. What made Brett explode? Community hype, strong branding, and Base Chain backing. It was one of those projects that caught fire overnight, turning small investments into serious gains. But let’s be real—most people didn’t get in early enough to ride the biggest part of the wave. Now, if you’re searching for the top cryptos to join for short term, Brett has already made its move. The next big opportunity? BTFD Coin. The Final Thoughts Based on what we’ve seen with Brett and countless meme coins before it, the pattern is clear—those who jump in early make the biggest gains. BTFD Coin is still in presale, and that means you have the chance to get in at the lowest possible price before the big exchange listings happen. Right now, BTFD is sitting at $0.00016, but that price is moving fast. With $6.27M+ already raised and analysts predicting a $0.006 post-listing price, this is one of the top cryptos to join for short term if you’re looking for high-ROI opportunities. There are no second chances in crypto—except when there are. This is yours. So, don’t wait and join the BTFD Coin presale before it’s too late. FAQs What makes BTFD Coin one of the top cryptos to join for short term gains? BTFD Coin combines a strong presale performance ($6.27M raised), a live P2E game, 90% APY staking, and a bullish community. With a listing price of $0.0006 and a moon target of $0.006, it’s positioned for major upside. Is it too late to invest in BTFD Coin? No, but time is running out. Stage 14 of the presale is live, and once it ends, the price will move up. Getting in now at $0.00016 means you’re still ahead of the crowd. Can BTFD Coin reach its predicted $0.006 price?

Doge Uprising Staking & Presale Offer Huge Returns,https://coinpedia.org/sponsored/best-altcoins-to-buy-this-week-doge-uprising-staking-presale-offer-huge-returns/,"The post Best Altcoins to Buy This Week? Doge Uprising Staking & Presale Offer Huge Returns appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market is entering a critical phase, and many investors are looking for the best altcoins to buy this week before major price movements occur. With multiple opportunities across different sectors, there are several altcoins that could deliver significant returns. This week, five altcoins stand out as strong contenders for investors looking to maximize their portfolios: Doge Uprising (DUP) – A presale meme coin with staking and high ROI potential Tron (TRX) – A blockchain powering stablecoins and decentralized applications Toncoin (TON) – The Telegram-backed cryptocurrency gaining widespread adoption Raydium (RAY) – A decentralized exchange driving liquidity in the Solana ecosystem Tezos (XTZ) – A smart contract platform known for its self-upgrading governance Among these, Doge Uprising presents the strongest opportunity, offering a low-cost entry point through its presale and a staking platform that allows investors to earn passive income while holding their tokens. Doge Uprising: The Best Altcoin to Buy This Week Doge Uprising has become one of the most talked-about presales in 2025, having raised over $415,000 and currently sitting in stage 9 of its presale. With each new stage, the price of $DUP tokens increases, meaning early investors get the best possible entry point before the token is listed on exchanges. The current price per $DUP token is $0.00002595, but as the presale progresses to stage 10, the price will increase again. Investors who secure tokens now will be in a strong position when Doge Uprising launches on major exchanges, where early presale participants historically see the highest returns. Unlike many meme coins that rely purely on speculation, Doge Uprising provides a staking mechanism that allows holders to earn rewards simply by holding $DUP tokens. This feature makes it more than just a speculative asset—it becomes a passive income-generating investment that appeals to both traders and long-term holders. Low Market Cap with High Upside Potential With Doge Uprising still in its early stages, the token has significant room for growth. Compared to established meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, Doge Uprising offers a much higher upside potential, making it an attractive option for those looking for a high-risk, high-reward opportunity. Tron (TRX) – A Blockchain Powering Stablecoin Transactions Tron is one of the most widely used blockchain networks, particularly in the stablecoin sector, where it handles high transaction volumes for Tether (USDT). Its fast and low-cost transactions make it a solid choice for long-term investment. However, because Tron is already an established asset, its growth potential is more limited compared to low-cap presales like Doge Uprising, which have yet to experience explosive growth. Toncoin (TON) – The Cryptocurrency Backed by Telegram Toncoin has gained traction due to its strong connection with Telegram’s massive user base. The blockchain is optimized for fast transactions and scalability, making it a promising investment for those looking at long-term adoption. However, because Toncoin has already seen significant price increases, it does not offer the same level of upside as Doge Uprising, which is still in its presale stage with room for rapid price appreciation. Raydium (RAY) – A Key Player in the Solana Ecosystem Raydium is a decentralized exchange and liquidity provider that plays a central role in the Solana network. As Solana continues to grow, Raydium is likely to benefit from increased trading activity and liquidity incentives. While Raydium is a strong project in the decentralized finance sector, its growth potential is limited compared to Doge Uprising, which has a lower initial market cap and the potential for massive returns once it enters the public market. Tezos (XTZ) – A Smart Contract Platform with Built-In Governance Tezos is a self-upgrading smart contract blockchain known for its governance model, which allows it to implement changes without hard forks. The platform has been widely adopted in the NFT and enterprise blockchain sectors. Although Tezos is a solid investment for long-term security, it does not have the same high-risk, high-reward potential as Doge Uprising. Investors looking for quick gains are more likely to find better opportunities in presales like $DUP. The Best Altcoin to Buy This Week For investors seeking high-growth opportunities, Doge Uprising presents the best risk-reward ratio this week. The combination of a rapidly growing presale, an upcoming exchange listing, and a fully operational staking platform makes it one of the most promising altcoins in 2025. With a low current price and an increasing presale valuation, Doge Uprising offers investors a rare opportunity to secure an early position in what could be one of the biggest meme coins of the year. The crypto market moves fast, and those who recognize potential early often see the highest returns. Doge Uprising Is The Best Altcoin To Buy This Week!

However, due to bearish market sentiment, it has been continuously struggling to gain momentum. Today, March 8, 2025, amid market uncertainty, the asset has registered a 5% price drop and has reached a crucial support level. Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels As ADA reaches a crucial support area, concerns are rising about whether the price will hold this level or fall below it due to bearish market sentiment. Let’s see what happens in the coming days. Source: Trading View According to expert technical analysis, the $0.81 level is a strong support zone with significant buying pressure and potential for a price reversal. If the current sentiment persists and the price falls, closing a four-hour candle below $0.81, there is a strong possibility of an 18% decline to $0.68. On the other hand, if ADA holds this level, it has the potential to rebound and surge by 35%, reaching $1.15 in the future. At present, ADA is trading at the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which provides strong support and indicates that the asset is still in an uptrend. Current Price Momentum At press time, ADA is trading near $0.827, having registered a 5% price drop in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume declined by 10%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. Despite market uncertainty, traders are currently over-leveraged at $0.804 on the lower side and $0.84 on the upper side, according to on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Additionally, these levels hold $9.11 million worth of long positions and $5.45 million worth of short positions, indicating that bulls are strong and could support the asset in holding this level.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|ADA|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-08 05:37:11

Over the past week, its price surged by 46.76%, with a monthly increase of 16.97%. Over the last six months, ADA has soared by an impressive 202%, showcasing strong bullish momentum. Currently, ADA trades between $0.76 and $1.33, reflecting both volatility and potential trading opportunities. Technical indicators support a continued uptrend. The 10-day simple moving average (SMA) is at $0.95, slightly above the 100-day SMA of $0.92, signaling short-term bullish strength. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 49.17, leaning toward oversold territory, while the stochastic oscillator at 18.46 suggests a potential rebound. Additionally, the MACD remains positive at 0.001651, reinforcing a bullish outlook. ADA faces its nearest resistance at $1.53, with a breakthrough potentially leading to $2, offering significant upside potential. On the downside, key support lies at $0.384, acting as a crucial level to monitor. Traders are closely watching these levels as ADA’s price action unfolds. Ripple Ripple (XRP) has seen strong momentum recently, gaining 17% over the past week while ranging between $2.26 and $3.32. Despite a slight 5% decline in the last month, its six-month performance remains exceptional, with a 394% surge. Technical indicators hint at further gains. The 10-day and 100-day SMAs are both near $2.50, indicating stability. The RSI stands at 64.39, nearing overbought territory, while the stochastic indicator at 71.07 suggests strong momentum. A positive MACD of 0.02169 further supports the bullish trend. If the uptrend continues, XRP could test resistance at $3.70, with a successful breakout paving the way toward $4.76. Conversely, a pullback could see support at $1.58, approximately 30% below current levels. Traders are closely monitoring these levels for potential moves.

FIFA President Teases FIFA-linked Crypto Launch FIFA President Gianni Infantino hinted at launching a FIFA-linked cryptocurrency at the White House Crypto Summit on March 7, ahead of the 2026 World Cup. President Trump suggested the coin could even exceed FIFA’s value. President Donald Trump spoke about the potential of FIFA Coin, joking, “It could be quite a coin,” and added, “That coin could be more than FIFA.” His comments quickly sparked speculation in the crypto community about the possibility of a FIFA-branded cryptocurrency becoming real. FIFA COIN’s Reaches $3M Market Cap After Trump’s comments, a cryptocurrency called FIFA COIN (FIFA) soared by 142,000%, reaching a market cap of around $3 million. FIFA COIN, traded on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, saw a spike in trading activity, with a 24-hour volume of $0.65 and a price of $0.0645. However, it has no official connection to FIFA or the 2026 World Cup. Crypto investors are cautioned about meme coins that often pop up after major events or statements from influential figures, that could lead to significant losses. Speaking at the event, Infantino said that FIFA, under his stewardship, is “very, very interested under my presidency to develop the FIFA coin.”So if there is anyone interested in teaming up with FIFA, we’ll conquer the world of soccer with the FIFA coin,” he added. The 2026 FIFA World Cup will be hosted by Canada, Mexico, and the United States, marking the first time three nations will co-host the tournament. With a new 48-team format, it will feature 104 matches, making it the biggest World Cup ever. Trump Pushes For U.S. Crypto Leadership At the White House Crypto Summit, key crypto leaders like Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong and Kraken’s Arjun Sethi joined President Trump, who emphasized making the U.S. a crypto leader. Trump also confirmed that his administration will hold seized Bitcoin in a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, criticizing Biden’s crypto policies for hurting the industry.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-08 05:53:18
