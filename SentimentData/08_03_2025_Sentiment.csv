41301602,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=688626,1741388400,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41301602.jpeg,Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Targets $4 In 2025 To Surpass Leading DeFi Giant Ripple (XRP),https://www.cryptopolitan.com/mutuum-finance-mutm-targets-4-in-2025-to-surpass-leading-defi-giant-ripple-xrp/,"The crypto market shows growing interest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) because its existing presale phase achieved $2.3 million and accumulated more than 4,300 token owners. The project currently operates during its second phase of pre-sale at $0.015 while investors have an exceptional opportunity to acquire tokens at this price point before upcoming price increases push the token value to $0.02. Early MUTM participants would have earned a 300% return on their investment through presale prices before reaching the anticipated $0.06 official exchange value. After the launch date MUTM will rise dramatically according to expert estimations amounting to $4 by 2025 while surpassing the market position of Ripple (XRP). Mutuum Finance (MUTM): A DeFi Powerhouse in the Making The decentralized finance platform Mutuum Finance (MUTM) functions as much more than a typical token since it operates to reshape lending and borrowing systems through DeFi capabilities. MUTM provides valuable practical applicability which allows users to generate passive income through its distinct borrowing solution. As part of the unique mtTokens system on the platform users can execute assets such as ETH or DAI to acquire interest-generating tokens. The worth of these tokens increases with time so users get a steady cash flow from their investments and still have easy access to funds. The successful outcome of the presale demonstrates that investors see huge potential in MUTM. Demand for the second phase increases while initial stocks sold out rapidly among investors. The project draws investors through its organized token structure that implements a mechanism for token purchasing combined with distribution. The distribution system purchases platform-derived funds to obtain MUTM tokens from exchanges before distributing them back to stakeholders to maintain steady buying assets. Through this method investors receive benefits for maintaining their investment position and enhanced price stability goes hand in hand with investor retention. Ripple (XRP) Facing Challenges Amid Market Volatility The rising value of MUTM Finance continues while the unpredictable market conditions of Ripple (XRP) occur. According to CasiTrades the XRP cryptocurrency will decline to $1.50 after breaking its essential support level at $2.42. Several experts believe XRP will achieve $30 by May 2025 yet its market stability remains inconsistent. Many influential cryptocurrencies face multiple risks which emerge from regulatory hurdles and wild market price movements. MUTM distinguishes itself from other entities by delivering operational financial services through methods that provide sustainability at every stage of transformation. Stability within this lending system comes from its excess collateral mechanism and its ability to adjust interest rates for investors through two separate rates. The main reason that sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart from its competitors Mutuum Finance (MUTM) was built to fulfill extended-term goals. The presale schedule of Mutuum Finance ensures investors obtain large profits because token prices increase during different stages of the process. The current price of $0.015 gives investors the potential to make 300% profit when MUTM lists at $0.06. MUTM experts forecast a remarkable price increase to $4 during the next five years which translates to a 26500% return on investment. P2P lending on the platform helps users directly agree on their terms for loans. The platform provides a beneficial function when users need to borrow meme coins because standard lending pools typically offer limited access to these specific assets. The $100,000 MUTM giveaway from Mutuum Finance creates an investment time pressure and boosts total participant numbers. The cryptocurrency platform Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to dominate the decentralized finance market through its combination of trailblazing technology and functional services and capital expansion potential. The MUTM presale builds momentum as the project moves toward surpassing Ripple (XRP) and other established giants in the market. The current presale phase presents a limited-time opportunity to invest at the lowest price, with the potential for substantial gains as the project evolves. For investors seeking a high-yield, real-utility token, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a compelling choice. Don’t miss out on the chance to be part of this groundbreaking project, secure your tokens today before the next price increase.

41301412,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=708607,1741388445,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,"Bitcoin Price Crash Incoming? Why A Fall To $63,000 Is Possible If This Resistance Holds",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crash-incoming/,"The recent Bitcoin price crash below $90,000 came as a shock to the broader crypto community, especially amid expectations of a continued bull market rally. Despite the volatility and ongoing declines, a crypto analyst projects an even greater crash, suggesting that Bitcoin could fall as low as $63,000 if a certain resistance level holds. TradingView crypto analyst Alixjey has declared that the Bitcoin price must break past $99,500 to continue moving higher. He highlights that if this resistance holds and Bitcoin fails to break it, the pioneer cryptocurrency will likely face a steeper price decline to new lows of $63,000. The last time Bitcoin was around the $60,000 range was during its massive price rally in 2024 after the launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Considering that Bitcoin has risen as high as $104,000 at one point this year, a crash toward $60,000 would be a devastating blow to investors and its market. Bitcoin Price Crash Imminent The TradingView analyst shared a chart suggesting that Bitcoin could rise as high as $106,000 or drop toward the $60,000 to $65,000 range if it fails to break resistance. This price drop is highlighted as a strong buying and accumulation opportunity for long-term investors, as it presents a low entry point into the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin 77% Correction To $25,000, Will History Repeat Itself During its price highs, many retail investors were likely unable to buy Bitcoin due to its increasing cost. Most accumulations were from whales who had purchased millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin in one swoop. Alixjey has also labeled his projected $60,000 – $65,000 downturn as the last chance to re-enter the Bitcoin market, emphasizing that it was a prime HODLing point for potential profits in Q3 and Q4 of 2025. This implies that the analyst anticipates a price rebound in Bitcoin later in the year. Moving on, the TradingView expert highlighted two liquidity levels in the 4-hour timeframe that are likely to be cleared soon. He also acknowledged that he was solely bearish on Bitcoin’s price outlook, indicating that his projected short-term pullback will not be invalidated unless the cryptocurrency crosses the resistance between $94,000 and $98,000. Other factors that could contribute to Bitcoin’s already heightened volatility are the Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) data. AlixJey predicts that once released, this data could lead to high volatility in both stocks and crypto. He urges investors and traders to be cautious, as major economic reports often influence market movements. Analyst Sees Upside Potential After BTC Crashes Due to Bitcoin’s recent declines, many analysts have shared bearish projections of the cryptocurrency, expecting a severe price correction before a potential recovery. One such analyst is Herbert Sim, the Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) of AICean. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Suffers Bearish Deviation After Filling CME Gap, Is This Good Or Bad? Sim projects that Bitcoin will crash to new lows, especially with the recent approval of a crypto reserve in the United States (US). He expects a crash to $40,000 but highlights that it will be short-lived, spanning from weeks, months, and possibly years. However, the AICean CMO suggested that investors who can HODL for the long-term are likely to see more profits once BTC rebounds from bearish trends.

The world of artificial intelligence is not just evolving in code and algorithms, but also in the halls of US lawmakers. We’re barely into 2025, and the legislative landscape around AI is already exploding. If you thought 2024 was busy with AI developments, think again. The sheer volume of US AI bills being introduced this year is nothing short of astonishing. Unprecedented Wave of US AI Bills: What’s Driving the Surge? According to MultiState, a consulting firm tracking these developments, a staggering 781 US AI bills are already pending in the US as of early March 2025. Let that sink in. This number eclipses the total of 743 AI bills proposed throughout the entirety of 2024. And to put it in even starker perspective, 2023 saw fewer than 200 such bills. We’re witnessing an unprecedented legislative frenzy around AI. just 66 days into 2025 and the number of artificial intelligence bills pending in the US now officially exceeds the total for ALL of 2024. 2024: 743 AI bills total for the year 2025: 781 AI bills in just 66 days pic.twitter.com/xrYPVDYgR1 — Adam Thierer (@AdamThierer) March 7, 2025 This legislative surge can be largely attributed to a vacuum at the federal level. The absence of a comprehensive national AI legislation framework, akin to the EU’s AI Act, is pushing individual states and lawmakers to take matters into their own hands. Congress has, so far, struggled to coalesce around a unified approach, leaving a patchwork of proposed regulations across the nation. Federal Inaction Fuels State-Level AI Regulation Spree Why is federal action on AI governance proving so elusive? Several factors are likely at play: Political Gridlock: Partisan divides in Congress make consensus on complex tech policy issues notoriously difficult. Industry Lobbying: The AI industry, with its diverse range of stakeholders, likely has varied and sometimes conflicting lobbying priorities, further complicating federal action. Lack of Urgency (Perceived): Despite the rapid advancements in AI, some lawmakers may not yet perceive the societal or economic urgency for comprehensive federal regulation, especially compared to more immediate political concerns. The Trump administration’s approach, while aiming to foster AI development, hasn’t translated into strong federal AI regulation . President Trump’s executive order in January focused on promoting AI innovation and removing ideological bias, but it stopped short of endorsing or pushing for major Congressional legislation. This hands-off approach from the executive branch further empowers state-level initiatives. What Does This Mean for the Future of AI and Crypto? For the crypto world, heavily intertwined with technological innovation and often utilizing AI in various applications, this explosion of 2025 AI bills has significant implications. Here’s what you need to consider: Compliance Complexity: A fragmented regulatory landscape across different states could create a compliance nightmare for crypto companies utilizing AI. Navigating 781+ potential laws is far more complex than dealing with a unified federal framework. Innovation Chilling Effect?: Overly restrictive or inconsistent state-level regulations could stifle AI innovation within the US, potentially pushing development and talent overseas. This could indirectly impact crypto projects reliant on cutting-edge AI. Opportunities for Clarity: Conversely, this flurry of legislative activity presents an opportunity for the crypto and AI industries to engage with lawmakers and shape regulations that are both responsible and innovation-friendly. Proactive engagement is crucial. Navigating the AI Regulatory Maze: Key Takeaways The sheer volume of pending AI legislation is a clear signal: AI is no longer a futuristic concept; it’s a present-day reality demanding immediate policy attention. Here are some key takeaways: Aspect Implication Volume of Bills Indicates urgency and widespread concern about AI, but also potential for regulatory fragmentation. Federal Inaction Drives state-level activity, leading to a potentially inconsistent and complex regulatory environment. Industry Engagement Needed Crypto and AI sectors must actively participate in legislative discussions to ensure balanced and effective regulations. Global Regulatory Landscape US developments should be viewed in the context of global AI regulation efforts (e.g., EU AI Act) to understand broader trends. The coming months will be critical in shaping the regulatory contours of AI in the US. For those in the crypto space, staying informed and engaged with these legislative developments is no longer optional – it’s essential for navigating the evolving landscape.

""It's only been, what, 50 days or something like that, and it's already created enough of a tailwind that we feel more confident in investing in the United States and growing our business here,"" Armstrong told CoinDesk. He said the hiring would take place this year. Coinbase, specifically, watched the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission completely abandon its pivotal enforcement action against the leading U.S. crypto platform. The company had been fighting the expensive legal dispute in federal courts over fundamental questions in regulatory jurisdiction over digital assets. That question is now in Congress' hands rather than continuing as a court fight and a drag on Coinbase's resources. Armstrong was among dozens of people crowded into the White House's State Dining Room for the first crypto summit with the White House, leading regulators and senior Republican members of Congress. The big news coming into the meeting was Trump's executive order the night before that called for the establishment of a bitcoin (BTC) reserve, which Armstrong endorsed. ""You can't really have a better holder of this asset than the United States government,"" he said. ""It's becoming a core piece of the financial system, and I think it's going to be a part of every diversified portfolio over time."" Coinbase was a pivotal player during the 2024 election, putting tens of millions of dollars toward the crypto-focused political action committee Fairshake. He said Coinbase will keep backing the super PAC, which did ""an incredible job"" in boosting pro-crypto candidates. Bo Hines, the executive director of the President’s Working Group on Digital Assets, told CoinDesk that Friday's summit represented Trump's commitment to the industry. ""The president made a promise that he's going to make this country the crypto capital of the planet, and we're well on our way in delivering that promise,"" he said in an interview after the close of the summit, in which the crypto reserve ideas played a significant part. ""We were just with 30 or so of the greatest luminaries in the space, and I think everyone was tremendously pleased,"" he said. In answer to industry concerns that the bitcoin reserve isn't initially organized to include new investment, he pointed out that the secretaries of the U.S. Treasury and Commerce departments are ordered to weigh methods of buying bitcoins without burdening taxpayers, and ""both of them are excited to look into ways to do it.""",Policy|Coinbase|Donald Trump|Hiring|Regulation,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BTC|FIAT|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-07 23:06:58

Investors who strategically place their investments in skyrocketing crypto assets make significant gains in a short duration. Dogecoin and BinoFi are among the projects that analysts have flagged could face an imminent surge in price. According to experts, Dogecoin has the potential to double before the year ends. However, BinoFi stands out as the most promising project that could easily turn $3k into $500k within a short duration. BinoFi is a new DeFi protocol whose presale offers investors a chance to invest in BINO tokens at discounted rates. The presale is currently in its first phase pricing and each BINO token is sold at $0.02. BINO is the utility and governance token of the hybrid exchange platform. Traders and investors interacting with crypto assets on BinoFi’s hybrid exchange will earn staking rewards, and accrue discounted trading fees using BINO tokens. Dogecoin price prediction Crypto experts have concluded that Dogecoin and BinoFi are on track to reward investors this year with each project hosting significant potential to explode to the upside. Dogecoin has recently been crashing as U.S. crypto reserve hype fades. According to data from Coinglass, Dogecoin has witnessed liquidations worth $10 million in long positions and $1.39 million in short positions in the last 24 hours. Analysts have predicted that the downward movement is a temporary pullback and that the crypto asset will soon resume its uptrend trajectory towards new all-time highs. Some Dogecoin whales have begun offloading their DOGE holdings and channeling investments in BinoFi’s ongoing presale. BinoFi is pioneering a first-to-market hybrid exchange to facilitate trading activities by creating suitable conditions for investors and frequent market participants. The move mimics Dogecoin's first first-to-market advantage which positioned the project as the first memecoin to enter the crypto scene. BinoFi could mimic Dogecoin's success or perform even better than the memecoin in the long run due to the project’s high utility and application. One important feature that sets BinoFi apart is its cross-chain trading capacity. The technological upgrade makes interoperability simpler and more efficient which is something the Web3 community is constantly trying to solve. The cross-chain element will facilitate asset transfer from one blockchain to another without traders and market participants sourcing risky third parties or using wrapped tokens. Will BinoFi’s BINO reach $1 in 2025? BinoFi’s presale is performing better than what developers had anticipated. The project has met high demand in the industry as retail and institutional players pile in for a slice of the cake. Although the current price of BINO tokens is only $0.02, experts anticipate a 5,000% upsurge in 2025 that will drive BINO tokens past the $1 mark. Dogecoin will need to grow its market capitalization to a $1.4 trillion market cap for its investors to witness the same level of growth. The growth is not impossible but highly unlikely especially with macro headwinds intensifying the ongoing crypto market sell-off. BinoFi’s presale is the best investment vehicle for long-term investors looking for massive gains.

According to Arkham Intelligence, on 7 March 2025, the wallets received $77.5 million in Bitcoin and transferred this amount to three new addresses. This is the first time since the platform suddenly vanished in April 2016 that funds have been moved. ANCIENT DARKNET MARKET WAKES UP AFTER 9 YEARS WITH OVER $400M $BTC Wallets belonging to Nucleus Marketplace woke up this morning after 9 years of inactivity, transferring $77.5M worth of Bitcoin to 3 new wallets. Nucleus Marketplace wallets still hold $365M BTC. New addresses:… pic.twitter.com/JtPXBK8Aec — Arkham (@arkham) March 7, 2025 Nucleus Marketplace was an online marketplace active from 2014 to 2016 that used Bitcoin to sell various prohibited products, such as drugs and other products. It abruptly vanished in rather murky circumstances, which ignited discussions of an exit scam or a hack. Before it disappeared, it was said to hold more than 5,000 BTC, valued at over $2.25 million at that time. As such, these remaining funds are estimated to be worth $365 million due to the appreciation of Bitcoin. According to the blockchain explorers, some of the addresses involved in the transactions include 1GGe3, which was last active in April 2016. The three new wallets this money is being sent to are “bc1qm8,” “bc1qm0,” and “bc1qsh.” Speculations on the resurgence The activation of this wallet has raised issues regarding the individuals behind it, as well as the motive for those operations. The individuals can be the original admins, police, hackers or anyone else who could have access to the private keys. Some have joked that the funds might be going to the newly launched strategic Bitcoin reserve in the United States. In the new executive order, Bitcoin received from criminal activities will be used in the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. However, the nature or purpose of the transactions is still unknown. One user on X noted , “Right.. Just before the Summit.” In the ongoing White House crypto summit, President Trump has echoed dissatisfaction with the government’s approach to Bitcoin.

41301960,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=138269,1741389354,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Threatening AI Agents: Signal President Exposes Profound AI Privacy Risks,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/agentic-ai-privacy-security-risks/,"Are you ready to hand over your digital life to AI? Signal President Meredith Whittaker has issued a stark warning about agentic AI, painting a picture where convenience clashes head-on with critical AI privacy and security. At SXSW, Whittaker didn’t mince words, describing the burgeoning field of AI agents as potentially putting “your brain in a jar.” For crypto enthusiasts and tech-savvy individuals who value decentralization and data control, Whittaker’s concerns about agentic AI should resonate deeply. Let’s dive into why this advocate for secure communication is sounding the alarm on these seemingly helpful AI assistants. The Allure and the Abyss of Agentic AI: Understanding the Security Risks Imagine an AI that manages your daily digital grind – from booking concert tickets to coordinating with friends. Sounds like a dream, right? This is the promise of agentic AI . These intelligent systems are designed to act on your behalf, learning your preferences and automating tasks across the web. Whittaker illustrates this with a vivid example: Task Automation: AI agents can look up concerts, purchase tickets, add events to your calendar, and even message your friends about plans. Seamless Convenience: The goal is a hands-free digital experience, where the AI handles the mundane, freeing up your time. However, this convenience comes at a steep price, according to Whittaker. To perform these actions, agentic AI needs unprecedented access to your personal data and systems. This is where the security risks begin to surface. Deep Dive into the Privacy Issues: Why Agentic AI Raises Red Flags Whittaker meticulously breaks down the level of access agentic AI requires, revealing a concerning landscape of potential privacy issues : Access Point Privacy Implication Web Browser Control AI needs to navigate and operate your browser, potentially monitoring browsing history and online behavior. Financial Data Access Access to credit card information for purchases exposes sensitive financial details. Calendar and Messaging App Integration Access to personal schedules and communications reveals private conversations and plans. System-Wide Permissions “Root-like” access across your devices and databases means potentially unrestricted data visibility. Cloud Processing Data likely processed on remote servers, raising concerns about data storage, jurisdiction, and potential breaches. Whittaker emphasizes that this level of access, often “in the clear” due to encryption limitations in current models, creates significant privacy issues . The data needed to power these sophisticated agentic AI systems is unlikely to be processed locally on your device. Instead, it’s almost certainly transmitted to cloud servers, amplifying the security risks and potential for data exploitation. The Blood-Brain Barrier Breach: Agentic AI and Data Confluence Whittaker uses a powerful metaphor to describe the architectural shift agentic AI represents: breaching the “blood-brain barrier” between the application layer and the operating system layer. What does this mean in practical terms? Data Muddying: Agentic AI blurs the lines between separate services, conjoining data from various applications into a single, accessible pool. Privacy Undermining: If privacy-focused apps like Signal integrate with agentic AI, the very privacy they offer could be compromised as the AI needs access to message content. Surveillance Model Amplification: Whittaker connects the rise of agentic AI to the existing “bigger is better AI paradigm,” built on mass data collection and surveillance, warning of further privacy erosion. Her concerns echo broader anxieties within the cryptocurrency and privacy communities about centralized data control and the potential for misuse of personal information. The promise of a “magic genie bot” shouldn’t blind us to the underlying security risks and privacy issues inherent in agentic AI . Actionable Insights: Navigating the Agentic AI Landscape So, what can you do to stay informed and protect your AI privacy as agentic AI evolves? Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date on the developments in agentic AI and the ongoing discussions around its implications. Question Integration: Be critical of applications and services proposing agentic AI features, especially concerning data access and processing. Prioritize Privacy Tools: Continue to support and utilize privacy-focused technologies and platforms that minimize data collection and maximize user control. Advocate for Regulation: Engage in conversations and advocate for responsible AI development and regulations that prioritize user privacy and data security. Conclusion: A Call for Caution in the Age of Agentic AI Meredith Whittaker’s warning serves as a crucial reality check amidst the hype surrounding agentic AI . While the allure of AI assistants managing our digital lives is strong, the potential security risks and privacy issues are equally profound. As we venture further into the age of AI, maintaining a critical perspective and prioritizing user privacy will be paramount. The future of AI privacy and security depends on informed choices and proactive measures to ensure convenience doesn’t come at the cost of fundamental rights.

The technology applications automate executions including actions and transactions in a blockchain transaction. These contracts facilitate trusted transactions and agreements between pseudonymous buyers to auto-execute when certain predetermined conditions are met. Some of the largest smart contracting platforms include Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano. Although these projects have growth potential, investors have discovered a new DeFi gem that could yield better returns this year. Smart contracts shape how traders interact with crypto assets Smart contracts have now cemented their use cases and applications in the crypto arena through projects like Solana and Cardano. These automated technology applications have become part and parcel of everyday activities for crypto participants, traders, and investors. Meanwhile, BinoFi is taking the crypto industry on a different trajectory by introducing a unique product that DeFi users should find interesting. BinoFi developers plan to unveil a one-of-one cryptocurrency exchange. And no, this will not be your typical centralized platform like Binance or decentralized exchange like Uniswap. BinoFi’s crypto exchange is a hybrid crypto exchange platform with improved features from both centralized and decentralized exchanges. The platform has unveiled a presale that is distributing BINO tokens to investors at the rate of $0.02 per token. The presale is barely days old but has analysts speaking about its undervalued state. Many believe the project will experience an upsurge after going live once all 20 presale phases are completed. What makes the presale unique is the ICO organization. BinoFi’s presale has organized gradual price increases in each phase to ensure both early adopters and long-term holders can benefit from it. The presale also promotes fair distribution of the crypto assets to earn the trust of retail traders. The team guarantees that the project does not have any private sales and that 100% is public sale to prevent manipulation from larger players and institutions. The team has also set measures in place to encourage ICO participants to hold their crypto assets even after launch. ICO participants have a chance to stake their BINO holdings immediately after the Token Generation Event (TGE) for an early staking bonus. BinoFi ICO participants qualify to join BinoFi DAO The ICO participants will also be eligible to join the BinoFi DAO for governance and decision-making on major issues influencing the protocol. Holding BINO tokens will also unlock exclusive trading benefits for users. Traders will get up to 50% discounts on trading fees from just holding BINO tokens. BinoFi aspires to be a self-sustaining ecosystem with inbuilt revenue sources that make it more resilient to harsh crypto conditions. The protocol’s primary revenue streams will emanate from trading fees through its hybrid crypto exchange platform. BINO is among the few projects that have shown interest in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI). AI-powered trading tools provide a premium revenue stream that could serve both retail and institutional investors. The BinoFi team is developing AI Trade Bots, Institutional API & HFT tools, and AI-driven Market Sentiment and insights providers. Users will be required to pay a monthly subscription fee for pro-level trading automation & insights, fees will be used in the buy-back and burn of BINO tokens, liquidity and community rewards.

The body, which comprises the securities regulators in all the US states, Canadian provinces, and Mexico, described it as a “critical threat.” According to its press release , it developed a list of major risks facing retail investors by surveying securities regulators in the US and Canada and examining what they spent the most time investigating. The survey showed that most of the scams used marketing tactics that manipulated investors’ emotions. While most scams involved marketing digital assets and AI investments, NASAA observed that the scammers used traditional social media platforms to target their victims. In terms of the prevalence of use, Facebook had 31.7%, text-based platforms like WhatsApp and Instagram had 31.3%, short-form video platforms such as Instagram reels and TikTok had 19%, while long-form video platforms like Vimeo and YouTube had 14.1%. As the Association noted, scams are prevalent on digital platforms because they are effective in reaching a wide audience as quickly as possible. This allowed these scammers to have access to a wide group of victims. AI functioned as both a scam tool and a tactic Meanwhile, the group also observed that scammers are increasingly relying on artificial intelligence tools to create content and graphics and deepfake audio and videos. It expects this to increase in 2025 and highlights the market for it. It wrote: “The bad actors are creating and selling AI-powered trading bots, selling equity in companies, purportedly developing an AI model, or perpetrating account takeover scams.” Beyond using it as a tool, NASAA noted that scammers are also promoting AI-related financial instruments. According to the president of the Association, Leslie Van Buskirk, AI technology’s rapid growth has given scammers new tools to steal from users Buskirk said: “AI investing is the latest technology to make waves in the investing landscape and fraudsters are pitching new investments that often have nothing to do with the latest tech developments and instead play on fear of missing out or get rich quick schemes along with other heightened emotions.” In order to protect investors from these scams, state securities administrators believe that registration at the state level is essential. The NASAA enforcement section committee co-chair Amanda Senn noted that investors need to confirm the registration status of anyone promoting a financial institution to them on the internet or social media before they invest. Crypto-related scams and losses continue to happen The statement from NASAA only confirms earlier opinions from other regulators, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), about the prevalence of financial scams connected to digital assets. Last month, the FBI revealed that it has saved almost $300 million in crypto-related investment fraud for thousands of victims. Interestingly, scams are not the only challenge that retail investors face. Even those who avoid investing in fraudulent crypto assets and buy real ones are still at risk of losing their funds to phishing attacks, hacks, and other security compromises like the Bybit hack that resulted in the loss of more than $1.4 billion worth of Ethereum. Onchain transaction data showing phishing attack (Source: Scam Sniffer on X) Today, ScamSniffer reported that a victim lost over $117,000 in two phishing attacks. The attacker used the Permit2 phishing signature to steal the funds without the victim’s knowledge. Unsurprisingly, most of these phishing links are also scam promotions on social media.

Whispers are turning into announcements as leading cryptocurrency exchange Kraken reportedly sets its sights on a public offering. According to a recent report from Bloomberg, amplified by Unfolded on X, Kraken is aiming for a Q1 2026 Initial Public Offering (IPO). This exciting development positions Kraken alongside other major crypto players like Gemini, Bullish, and Circle, all considered frontrunners in the race to become publicly traded crypto companies. Let’s dive into what this Kraken IPO could mean for the crypto landscape and for you as an investor. Why is a Kraken IPO a Big Deal for the Crypto Space? A Kraken IPO isn’t just another company going public; it’s a potential watershed moment for the entire cryptocurrency industry. For years, the crypto market has been viewed by some as a nascent, volatile, and somewhat fringe financial sector. However, the increasing maturity of companies like Kraken and their pursuit of IPOs signals a significant shift towards mainstream acceptance and institutional legitimacy. Here’s why this is such a pivotal development: Validation of the Crypto Industry: A successful crypto IPO by a major exchange like Kraken would send a powerful message to traditional financial markets and regulators. It would demonstrate that cryptocurrency businesses can achieve the scale, stability, and transparency required to operate as public companies. Increased Investor Confidence: Publicly traded companies are subject to stringent regulatory oversight and reporting requirements. This added layer of accountability could boost investor confidence in the crypto market, attracting both retail and institutional investors who may have been hesitant to enter the space before. Access to Capital for Growth: An IPO provides Kraken with access to significant capital. This influx of funds can be strategically deployed to fuel further expansion, enhance technology infrastructure, develop innovative products and services, and potentially acquire other companies in the crypto ecosystem. Enhanced Brand Recognition and Trust: Becoming a public company can significantly elevate Kraken’s brand profile and build trust among users. Public scrutiny and reporting can foster greater transparency and accountability, which are crucial for long-term success in the competitive crypto exchange market. What Does Q1 2026 Target Mean for the Kraken Exchange IPO Timeline? While Q1 2026 might seem like a distant target, it’s important to understand that preparing for a cryptocurrency IPO is a complex and time-consuming process. Several factors influence the timeline, and Q1 2026 likely represents a carefully considered target date. Here’s a breakdown of potential steps and considerations: Phase Activities Timeline Considerations Pre-IPO Planning & Preparation Legal and regulatory compliance Financial audits and reporting Corporate governance structure enhancement Underwriter selection Drafting of prospectus Can take 12-18 months or longer depending on complexity and regulatory requirements. Regulatory Review & Approval SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) review in the US (if applicable) or relevant regulatory body in chosen jurisdiction. Addressing regulatory queries and revisions. Varies depending on regulatory workload and complexity of the filing. Can take several months. Marketing & Roadshow Investor presentations and roadshows to gauge interest. Refinement of IPO pricing and share allocation strategy. Typically a few weeks leading up to the IPO date. Market conditions and investor sentiment play a crucial role. IPO Launch & Trading Pricing of shares and IPO launch. Commencement of trading on a stock exchange. Final step, dependent on successful completion of previous phases. The Q1 2026 timeframe suggests that Kraken is already well into the pre-IPO planning phase and is aiming for a launch window that allows sufficient time for regulatory approvals and market conditions to align favorably. It’s crucial to remember that IPO timelines are not set in stone and can be subject to delays based on various internal and external factors. What Challenges Might Kraken Face on its Path to a Crypto IPO? While the prospect of a Kraken exchange IPO is exciting, the path to becoming a publicly traded crypto company is not without its hurdles. Kraken, like other crypto firms considering this route, will need to navigate a complex landscape of challenges: Regulatory Scrutiny: The cryptocurrency industry is still under intense regulatory scrutiny globally. Kraken will need to demonstrate robust compliance frameworks and address any potential regulatory concerns to gain approval for its IPO. This includes navigating varying regulations across different jurisdictions if they operate internationally. Market Volatility: The crypto market is known for its volatility. This inherent volatility could impact investor sentiment and Kraken’s valuation during the IPO process. Maintaining consistent performance and demonstrating resilience in the face of market fluctuations will be key. Competition: The crypto exchange market is highly competitive. Kraken competes with numerous established players and emerging platforms. They will need to clearly articulate their competitive advantages and growth strategies to attract investors in the public market. Public Market Demands: Operating as a public company comes with increased demands for transparency, quarterly reporting, and shareholder accountability. Kraken will need to adapt its operational structure and culture to meet these new requirements and manage investor expectations effectively. Beyond Kraken: Why are Other Crypto Companies Eyeing IPOs? The report highlighting Kraken’s IPO ambitions also mentions Gemini, Bullish, and Circle as potential crypto companies IPO candidates. This trend of crypto firms exploring public listings reflects a broader evolution within the industry. Several factors are driving this movement: Maturity of the Crypto Market: The crypto market has matured significantly over the past decade. Companies like Kraken, Gemini, Bullish, and Circle have grown into substantial businesses with established user bases, revenue streams, and operational infrastructure. They are reaching a stage where an IPO becomes a logical next step for growth and expansion. Investor Demand: There is growing investor appetite for exposure to the cryptocurrency market through traditional investment vehicles. IPOs of reputable crypto companies offer a way for both institutional and retail investors to gain access to this asset class within a regulated and familiar framework. Capital Raising Opportunities: As mentioned earlier, IPOs provide significant capital infusion. This capital is crucial for crypto companies to invest in innovation, expand their services, and scale their operations to meet the growing demand for crypto products and services. Legitimacy and Mainstream Adoption: Public listings contribute to the overall legitimacy and mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. They signal that crypto is moving beyond the fringes and becoming an integral part of the global financial system. Actionable Insights: What Should Crypto Investors Watch For? The potential crypto IPO wave, spearheaded by companies like Kraken, presents exciting opportunities and developments for crypto investors. Here are some actionable insights to keep in mind: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on news and updates regarding Kraken’s IPO plans and the IPO landscape for other crypto companies. Follow reputable crypto news sources and financial media outlets for the latest developments. Due Diligence is Key: If you are considering investing in crypto company IPOs, conduct thorough due diligence. Understand the company’s business model, financial performance, regulatory compliance, and competitive positioning. Don’t invest based on hype alone. Understand IPO Risks: IPOs can be volatile investments, especially in a relatively new and dynamic sector like cryptocurrency. Be aware of the risks involved and invest according to your risk tolerance and investment goals. Long-Term Perspective: Consider crypto company IPOs as long-term investments. The crypto market is still evolving, and the long-term potential of these companies will depend on their ability to adapt, innovate, and navigate the evolving regulatory landscape. Conclusion: A Transformative Moment for Crypto? Kraken’s reported plans for a Kraken IPO in Q1 2026 are more than just company news; they represent a potentially transformative moment for the cryptocurrency industry. As major crypto exchanges like Kraken move towards public listings, they are paving the way for greater mainstream acceptance, increased investor confidence, and accelerated growth of the crypto market. While challenges remain, the momentum is building, and the coming years could witness a significant evolution in how the world perceives and interacts with cryptocurrencies. The cryptocurrency IPO trend is one to watch closely, as it could reshape the financial landscape and unlock new opportunities in the digital asset space.

Newcomers in the industry are better off doubling down on utility projects such as BinoFi while minimizing exposure to crypto assets driven by hype, hope, and trending memes. Memecoin investors were taken by storm after U.S. President Donald Trump entered the space with a memecoin project that has since cost 500,000 investors to lose money. Trump’s memecoin flops as investors eye a new utility project U.S. president and crypto advocate Donald Trump launched his memecoin, OFFICIAL TRUMP days before his inauguration ceremony. The project became an instant hit amassing over $5 billion in market capitalization hours after launch. Early investors greatly benefited from the hype. However, more than 500,000 investors have lost money after the memecoin plummeted. According to data from crypto price aggregator CoinMarketCap, the memecoin is down 82% from its all-time high. OFFICIAL TRUMP's investors are now shifting their focus to BinoFi in an attempt to recover some of their lost funds. BinoFi has proven itself to be a market leader in crypto exchange activities. Unlike memecoins, BinoFi has the real-world utility of supporting the crypto market with exchange-related services and modern trading solutions. BinoFi’s presale is currently underway and investors are rushing before BINO prices surge. Memecoin investors need to take a breather by switching to high-return utility alternatives like BinoFi as they wait for their preferred niche to stabilize. Memecoin activity cools off as BinoFi prepares for a 1200% surge According to data from CoinGecko, memecoin activity has cooled off as investors remain wary of imminent market drops and bad launches. Smart investors have chosen to buy BinoFi’s presale instead of sitting on the sidelines. BinoFi’s presale offers investors a chance to capitalize on an utility project before everyone else joins the bandwagon. The project’s presale has just unveiled its first presale phase where investors rush to get a slice of the cake. BINO tokens are currently available for purchase for only $0.02. The team has set a launch price of $0.3 which automatically makes investments made during the current phase surge by 1,200% when the launch happens. The presale’s demand is increasing day by day and the team expects the ICO to sell out before the dates they had initially planned. Buying BinoFi now presents a similar opportunity to buying Bitcoin in 2009. The BinoFi infrastructure is based on a DeFi crypto exchange platform offering traders unique perks from both centralized and decentralized exchanges. The project seeks to close the gaps by merging the two exchange features. Users will enjoy the security and self-custody of decentralized exchanges while simultaneously exploiting deep liquidity from centralized exchange liquidity pools. BinoFi will create the next wave of millionaires Unlike memecoins that lack utility, BinoFi has unveiled the first-ever hybrid crypto exchange with a purpose-driven ecosystem powered by BINO tokens. The tokens will be used in governance through BinoFi’s decentralized autonomous organization. This implies that BINO holders will automatically qualify to vote and take part in decision-making activities affecting the DeFi protocol.

Former President Donald Trump is reportedly making a bold move, pushing hard for stablecoin legislation to be passed in the United States Congress before the upcoming August recess. This news, initially reported by Unfolded on X, has sent ripples through the digital asset community, sparking both excitement and anticipation. But what exactly does this mean for you, the average crypto enthusiast, investor, or someone just dipping their toes into the world of digital currencies? Let’s dive into the details and unpack what this urgent push for stablecoin regulation could entail. Why is Stablecoin Legislation Suddenly a Priority? The timing of this push from Trump raises some crucial questions. Why now? And why stablecoins specifically? Stablecoins , cryptocurrencies pegged to a stable reserve asset like the US dollar, have become increasingly vital to the crypto ecosystem. They act as a bridge between traditional finance and the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, offering stability for trading, lending, and everyday transactions within the digital economy. Here’s why stablecoin regulation is gaining momentum: Growing Market Cap and Adoption: The stablecoin market has exploded in recent years, with major players like Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC) commanding billions in market capitalization. This growth has caught the attention of regulators globally, concerned about systemic risks and consumer protection. Regulatory Scrutiny Intensifies: Global regulatory bodies like the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and national agencies like the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have been increasingly vocal about the need to regulate stablecoins. Concerns range from money laundering and illicit finance to the potential impact on monetary policy. Political Will and Election Year Dynamics: With the US presidential elections on the horizon, Trump ‘s involvement could be politically motivated. Positioning himself as pro-innovation while also addressing regulatory concerns could be a strategic move to appeal to various voter demographics. Crypto has become a surprisingly hot topic in the current political landscape. Industry Lobbying Efforts: The cryptocurrency industry itself has been actively lobbying for clear and consistent crypto regulation , including for stablecoins. Clarity in regulation can foster innovation and attract more institutional investment, benefiting the industry as a whole. Decoding Trump’s Stance on Crypto Regulation While traditionally perceived as skeptical towards cryptocurrencies, Donald Trump’s recent statements and actions suggest a potential shift in his approach. His administration previously saw some level of regulatory ambiguity around digital assets. However, this new push for stablecoin legislation could indicate a more proactive stance. Is this a genuine interest in fostering responsible innovation, or is it a politically calculated move? Consider these points to understand the nuances of Trump’s potential position: Aspect Potential Interpretation Push for Legislation Before August Recess Indicates urgency and a desire for quick action, possibly to score political points or address immediate economic concerns. Focus on Stablecoins Suggests a targeted approach, recognizing stablecoins as a critical and relatively less volatile segment of the crypto market compared to more speculative cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Alignment with Industry Needs Could signal a willingness to work with the crypto industry to create a regulatory framework that is both effective and innovation-friendly. Potential for Future Crypto Policy Stablecoin legislation could be a stepping stone towards broader crypto regulation in the US, setting a precedent for how other digital assets are treated. What Could Stablecoin Legislation Look Like? The specifics of the potential stablecoin legislation are still unclear, but we can anticipate some key areas it might address: Issuer Licensing and Registration: Legislation could mandate that stablecoin issuers obtain licenses and register with regulatory bodies, ensuring accountability and oversight. Reserve Requirements and Audits: To maintain stability and investor confidence, laws might require stablecoin issuers to hold sufficient reserves backing their tokens, subject to regular audits and transparency requirements. Consumer Protection Measures: Legislation could include provisions to protect consumers from fraud, market manipulation, and other risks associated with stablecoins, similar to protections in traditional finance. Interoperability and Payment Systems: Laws could aim to integrate stablecoins into existing payment systems and promote interoperability with traditional financial infrastructure, fostering wider adoption and utility. Clarity on Regulatory Jurisdiction: Defining which agencies (like the SEC, CFTC, or a newly formed crypto-specific regulator) have jurisdiction over stablecoins will be crucial for regulatory clarity and industry compliance. Impact on the Digital Assets Market and Beyond The passage of comprehensive stablecoin legislation could have far-reaching consequences for the digital assets market and the broader financial landscape: Increased Legitimacy and Institutional Adoption: Clear regulation can legitimize the stablecoin market, attracting more institutional investors and mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. Market Stability and Reduced Volatility: Robust regulatory frameworks can enhance the stability of stablecoins, making them more reliable for payments, trading, and other financial activities. Innovation and Growth in the Crypto Sector: Regulatory clarity can foster innovation by providing a clear roadmap for crypto businesses to operate and grow within the US. Potential for CBDCs: Some argue that regulating stablecoins is a necessary step before the US considers launching its own Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), as it establishes a regulatory framework for digital currencies. Global Regulatory Influence: US stablecoin legislation could set a global precedent, influencing how other countries regulate digital assets and shaping the future of the international crypto landscape. What Should Crypto Enthusiasts Do Now? This development is a call to action for the crypto community. Here’s what you can do to stay informed and potentially influence the outcome: Stay Updated: Follow reputable crypto news sources and regulatory updates closely. Monitor developments in Congress and statements from key policymakers. Engage with Industry Advocacy Groups: Support organizations that are advocating for sensible crypto regulation and engage in discussions about the best way forward. Contact Your Representatives: Reach out to your elected officials to express your views on stablecoin regulation and the importance of fostering innovation in the crypto space. Educate Yourself and Others: Understand the nuances of stablecoins, their benefits, and potential risks. Share accurate information and help dispel misinformation. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Crypto? Trump’s push for stablecoin legislation before the August recess marks a potentially pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry. Whether this initiative stems from genuine conviction, political strategy, or a combination of both, the outcome could significantly shape the future of digital assets in the United States and globally. The coming weeks will be crucial in observing how this unfolds and what concrete legislative steps are taken. One thing is clear: the conversation around crypto regulation is intensifying, and stablecoins are squarely in the spotlight. Stay tuned, the crypto landscape is about to get even more interesting!

The market reaction has kept ETH pinned below $2,142, struggling to establish a bullish recovery as sellers remain in control. Ethereum price dropped below $2,100 on Friday, amid inflation readings in US NFP Ethereum’s price decline below $2,100 on Friday underscores bearish dominance, exacerbated by heightened macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from the latest US NFP report . The payroll data, which came in hotter than expected, showing rising unemployment which raised concerns over persistent inflation, strengthening the case for a hawkish Federal Reserve stance. Ethereum Price Analysis: 4-hourly Chart Bears eyeing $2,000 on 4-Hour Chart Ethereum price remains under downward pressure on the 4-hour chart after failing to break past the $2,319 resistance level. The rejection at this key price ceiling has reinforced bearish momentum, with the latest candlesticks showing increased selling pressure near the $2,156 pivot. A confluence of technical indicators signals potential downside risk toward the $2,000 psychological support level. The Donchian Channel (DC) highlights the recent price contraction, with the upper boundary at $2,319 and the lower support band at $1,993. Ethereum Price Analysis: 4-hourly Chart The failed breakout attempt near the upper band suggests that bulls lack the strength to sustain a move higher, leaving the door open for further declines. The price action is currently hovering around the middle DC line, signaling indecision, but with a tilt toward the downside as volume spikes on red candles. Bearish momentum is further evident in the breakdown from the highlighted price cluster, where Ethereum shed 7.53% over six consecutive 4-hour candles. The red zone illustrates a liquidity flush, likely triggering stop-loss cascades from leveraged long positions, adding to the selling pressure. If the $2,156 support fails, Ethereum could slide toward $2,000, aligning with the lower Donchian boundary. On the flip side, a reclaim of $2,200 could reignite bullish sentiment and set up another test of the $2,319 resistance. Ethereum Price Forecast: Daily time frame chart Bulls Struggles Below $2,142—Will $2,009 Support Hold? Ethereum price forecast signals continue to lean bearish on the 24-hour chart, struggling to hold above the $2,142 level after facing strong resistance at $2,258. The latest daily candle reflects increased selling pressure, with ETH losing 2.73% in the session, confirming persistent bearish sentiment. The Keltner Channel (KC) highlights this downside momentum, as the price remains close to the lower band at $2,009, signaling the potential for further declines if the current support structure collapses. Ethereum Price Analysis: 24-hourly Chart A clear downward trajectory is evident as ETH price has remained below the middle KC line of $2,417, reinforcing the bearish control of market structure. The sharp -7.53% drop over a single daily candle suggests that leverage liquidations could be playing a role in accelerating the selloff. If Ethereum fails to defend $2,100, a deeper retracement toward the $2,009 support appears likely, where buyers might attempt to reestablish control. Despite the bearish setup, a bounce from current levels could shift momentum in favor of the bulls. If Ethereum reclaims $2,200 and sustains a move above the $2,258 resistance, it could target the $2,417 mid-KC level, with an extended rally opening the door for a potential retest of $2,825. However, with volatility increasing and bears dominating, Ethereum risks further downside unless demand steps in decisively. Ethereum Price Outlook Today Ethereum’s technical landscape reflects conflicting signals balance between bearish macroeconomic pressures and potential short-term rebounds. The 24-hour chart highlights key support at $2,009, while the 4-hour ETH price chart signals immediate downside risks following the rejection at $2,319.

41302966,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=138275,1741391114,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Trump’s Bold Bitcoin Stance: US Government to Become a Crypto Hoarder?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-bitcoin-us-government/,"In a surprising turn of events that has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency world, former U.S. President Donald Trump made a powerful declaration at the White House Crypto Summit: “I will never sell Bitcoin.” This statement marks a significant shift in the U.S. government’s approach to digital assets, particularly Bitcoin , and has ignited discussions across the globe. For crypto enthusiasts and investors alike, this news is nothing short of monumental. But what exactly does this mean, and how will it reshape the future of Bitcoin and the U.S.’s role in the crypto ecosystem? Why Trump’s Bitcoin Announcement at the Crypto Summit is Monumental? Imagine the scene: the White House Crypto Summit, a gathering of industry leaders, policymakers, and innovators. Donald Trump , a figure known for his impactful pronouncements, steps up to the podium and states unequivocally, “I will never sell Bitcoin .” This wasn’t just a casual remark; it was a deliberate and strategic announcement with far-reaching implications. Here’s why this moment is being hailed as monumental: Shift in Government Policy: For years, the U.S. government, like many others, has been navigating the complexities of cryptocurrency regulation and management. The fact that a former U.S. President, with potential future political ambitions, is making such a pro- Bitcoin statement signals a potential paradigm shift in how the U.S. government views and handles digital assets. End to Bitcoin Sales: Trump specifically mentioned that the U.S. federal government had seized a substantial amount of Bitcoin – around 200,000 BTC – through legal actions. While a significant portion was reportedly sold under the Biden administration, Trump declared an end to this practice. This effectively removes a potentially large and unpredictable source of selling pressure from the Bitcoin market. New Accumulation Strategy: Perhaps the most intriguing part of Trump’s statement is his assertion that the Treasury and Department of Commerce will actively seek “new ways to accumulate more Bitcoin without burdening taxpayers.” This suggests a proactive approach to Bitcoin adoption by the U.S. government, moving beyond simply seizing and selling to strategically holding and potentially increasing its Bitcoin holding . The US Government’s Bitcoin Stash: From Seller to Holder? The narrative around the U.S. government and Bitcoin has been largely about seizures and subsequent sales. Understanding the context of this shift from seller to potential holder is crucial: Aspect Previous Policy (Pre-Trump’s Announcement) New Policy (Post-Trump’s Announcement) Bitcoin Seizure Government agencies seize Bitcoin through law enforcement actions. Continues (as part of law enforcement). Bitcoin Disposal Majority of seized Bitcoin was sold, particularly during the Biden administration. Cessation of Bitcoin sales from seized holdings, starting from the announcement date. Bitcoin Strategy No clear strategy for holding or leveraging seized Bitcoin beyond liquidation. Active strategy to explore accumulating more Bitcoin without taxpayer burden. Market Impact Sales of seized Bitcoin could contribute to market volatility and downward pressure. Holding seized Bitcoin and potential accumulation could reduce selling pressure and signal long-term confidence. This table highlights the transformative nature of Trump’s declaration. The U.S. government, once a consistent seller, is now signaling a potential transition to a Bitcoin holding strategy. This change in stance could have profound effects on market dynamics and investor sentiment. Trump’s Bitcoin Strategy: What Does ‘Accumulate Without Burdening Taxpayers’ Mean? Trump’s statement about accumulating Bitcoin “without burdening taxpayers” raises intriguing questions. How exactly might the U.S. government achieve this? Here are a few possibilities: Continued Seizures: Law enforcement seizures will likely remain a primary source of Bitcoin acquisition. By simply holding onto seized Bitcoin instead of selling, the government’s holdings will naturally increase over time as criminal activities involving crypto continue to be addressed. Strategic Investments (Indirectly): While direct taxpayer-funded purchases might be politically sensitive, the government could explore indirect methods. For example, revenue generated from fines, penalties, or asset forfeitures related to crypto crimes could be strategically reinvested into acquiring Bitcoin . Public-Private Partnerships: The government could potentially collaborate with private sector entities in the crypto space. This might involve partnerships that allow the government to earn or acquire Bitcoin through various mechanisms, without direct budgetary allocations. Mining Revenue (Hypothetical & Unlikely): Although less probable given current U.S. policy, in a more radical scenario, the government could even explore the possibility of utilizing seized crypto mining equipment or engaging in mining activities using forfeited energy resources. However, this is highly speculative and faces significant political and regulatory hurdles. The exact methods remain to be seen, but Trump’s commitment to Bitcoin accumulation is clear. This proactive approach signals a deeper engagement with the cryptocurrency space and a potential recognition of Bitcoin’s strategic importance. Is This a Game Changer for Bitcoin Adoption? The implications of the U.S. government becoming a significant Bitcoin holder are far-reaching and could indeed be a game changer for Bitcoin adoption globally: Validation and Legitimacy: When a major world power like the U.S. government signals its intention to hold Bitcoin , it lends significant validation to the asset class. This can help to overcome skepticism and encourage broader institutional and retail adoption. Reduced Market Volatility (Potentially): By removing the U.S. government as a potential seller, and perhaps even becoming a buyer, the supply-demand dynamics of Bitcoin could be positively influenced. Reduced selling pressure and increased demand could potentially lead to greater price stability and upward momentum over time. Increased Institutional Interest: Institutional investors often look to government policies and regulatory signals when making investment decisions. A pro- Bitcoin stance from the U.S. government could further incentivize institutional investment in Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Geopolitical Implications: In a world increasingly shaped by digital technologies, nations are vying for leadership in the crypto space. The U.S. government embracing Bitcoin could position the U.S. as a more crypto-friendly nation, potentially attracting talent, innovation, and investment in the blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors. Challenges and Considerations of the US Government Holding Bitcoin While the prospect of the U.S. government holding Bitcoin is exciting for many, it’s important to acknowledge the challenges and considerations that come with such a significant move: Security and Custody: Securing a large Bitcoin holding is a complex undertaking. The government would need to implement robust security measures to protect against theft, hacking, and loss of private keys. Custody solutions, potentially involving hardware wallets and multi-signature setups, would be crucial. Regulatory Clarity: While Trump’s announcement is a strong signal, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. remains evolving. Clear and consistent regulations are needed to provide a stable framework for government Bitcoin holding and operations. Volatility Management: Bitcoin’s price volatility is a well-known characteristic. The government would need to develop strategies to manage the potential fluctuations in the value of its Bitcoin holding , especially for accounting and financial reporting purposes. Transparency and Accountability: Public scrutiny and accountability are paramount when it comes to government assets. Mechanisms for transparency regarding the government’s Bitcoin holding , transactions, and management practices would be essential to maintain public trust. Despite these challenges, Trump’s declaration marks a potentially transformative moment for Bitcoin and the U.S. government’s relationship with cryptocurrency. The shift from seller to holder could usher in a new era of government engagement with digital assets, with significant implications for the future of finance and technology. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Bitcoin and US Crypto Policy? Donald Trump’s announcement at the White House Crypto Summit – “I will never sell Bitcoin ” – is more than just a headline; it’s a powerful signal of a potential sea change in U.S. cryptocurrency policy. By committing to holding seized Bitcoin and exploring ways to accumulate more, the U.S. government could be on the verge of becoming a significant player in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

This has spurred a debate about cypherpunk values. When it became clear that the Lazarus Group hackers were swapping their stolen ETH for bitcoins on THORChain, an immediate vote to halt ETH to BTC swaps was passed, and then almost immediately reverted by other voters. THORChain made $5.5 million from its role as the main conduit for North Korean hackers laundering their ill-gotten gains, according to THORChain Explorer. The protocol saw $5.9 billion in swap volume in the 10 days from Feb. 22 through March 3. After 10 days, the hackers managed to launder all of the nearly 500,000 ether they stole into bitcoin.

The political winds are shifting, and the crypto landscape might be on the verge of a seismic change. Former U.S. President Donald Trump has thrown down the gauntlet, declaring an end to what he terms President Biden’s ‘war on crypto.’ This isn’t just political rhetoric; it’s a direct challenge to the current regulatory environment that many in the digital asset space view as stifling innovation and growth. Let’s dive into what Trump’s bold statements mean for the future of crypto regulation and, more importantly, for your investments. Decoding Trump’s Crypto Promise: What Does ‘Ending the War’ Really Mean? During his Crypto Summit speech, Trump didn’t mince words. He directly addressed the concerns of many in the crypto industry regarding regulatory pressure. He specifically called out ‘Chokepoint 2.0,’ a term that has become synonymous with the alleged strategy of regulators to indirectly target the crypto industry by pressuring banks to cut off services to crypto businesses. According to CoinDesk reports, this pressure has manifested in banks closing accounts of crypto firms and entrepreneurs, effectively creating roadblocks for fund transfers to and from cryptocurrency exchanges. Trump’s promise to ‘end the war’ and roll back ‘Chokepoint 2.0’ suggests a significant shift in approach. But what exactly could this entail? Here’s a breakdown of potential implications: Easing Regulatory Pressure: Trump’s administration could instruct regulatory bodies like the SEC and FinCEN to adopt a less aggressive stance towards the crypto industry. This could mean fewer enforcement actions and a more collaborative approach to rule-making. Unblocking Banking Access for Crypto Businesses: Rolling back ‘Chokepoint 2.0’ implies actively working to ensure crypto businesses have fair access to banking services. This could involve clarifying regulations for banks or even enacting policies that prevent discriminatory practices against crypto firms. Fostering Innovation: By reducing regulatory hurdles and improving banking access, Trump’s policies could aim to create a more favorable environment for crypto innovation and growth within the U.S. Crypto Regulation Under Biden: Understanding the ‘War’ To fully grasp the significance of Trump’s promise, it’s crucial to understand the context of the current regulatory landscape under President Biden. While the Biden administration hasn’t explicitly declared a ‘war on crypto,’ many in the industry feel that recent regulatory actions and pronouncements have been overly restrictive and even hostile. Here are some key aspects of the current crypto regulation environment often cited as evidence of this ‘war’: SEC Enforcement Actions: The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), under Chair Gary Gensler, has taken a firm stance, asserting jurisdiction over a wide range of crypto assets, deeming many as securities. This has led to numerous enforcement actions against crypto companies for alleged securities violations. Operation Chokepoint 2.0 Accusations: As Trump mentioned, the ‘Chokepoint 2.0’ accusation centers around the idea that regulators are using banks to indirectly control the crypto industry. Critics argue that this tactic stifles legitimate crypto businesses and pushes innovation offshore. Lack of Regulatory Clarity: A persistent complaint from the crypto industry is the lack of clear and consistent regulatory guidelines. This uncertainty makes it difficult for businesses to operate compliantly and discourages investment. Treasury Department Scrutiny: The Treasury Department, particularly through FinCEN and OFAC, has also increased its focus on crypto, emphasizing anti-money laundering (AML) and sanctions compliance, sometimes leading to stringent requirements and enforcement. The Potential Benefits of a Crypto-Friendly Trump Administration for Crypto Businesses If Trump’s promise translates into concrete policy changes, the benefits for crypto businesses could be substantial. Imagine a scenario where regulatory burdens are eased, and banking access is normalized. What could this unlock? Reduced Compliance Costs: Less aggressive regulation and clearer guidelines could significantly reduce the compliance costs for crypto companies, freeing up resources for innovation and growth. Increased Investment and Capital Flow: A more welcoming regulatory environment could attract greater investment into the crypto space, both from institutional investors and venture capital. Easier banking access would also facilitate smoother capital flow within the industry. Job Creation and Economic Growth: A thriving crypto sector, fueled by reduced regulatory friction, could lead to significant job creation in areas like software development, cybersecurity, and financial services. This, in turn, could contribute to broader economic growth. Innovation and Technological Advancement: With less fear of regulatory crackdowns, crypto businesses would be more incentivized to innovate and develop new blockchain-based technologies and applications, potentially benefiting various sectors beyond finance. Navigating the Challenges: Will Trump’s Promise Be Fully Realized? While Trump’s promise offers a beacon of hope for the crypto community, it’s crucial to approach it with a balanced perspective. Political promises are often easier made than kept, and the regulatory landscape is complex and influenced by numerous factors. Here are some potential challenges and considerations: Regulatory Inertia: Changing the course of regulatory bodies is not an overnight process. Even with a change in administration, regulatory agencies have established processes and priorities that can be slow to shift. Political and Public Sentiment: Public and political sentiment towards crypto can be volatile. Negative events or scandals in the crypto space could easily derail efforts to ease regulation, regardless of political promises. Global Regulatory Landscape: Crypto regulation is increasingly becoming a global issue. Even if the U.S. adopts a more crypto-friendly approach, international regulations and compliance requirements will still play a significant role for global crypto businesses. The Role of Congress: While presidential actions can influence regulatory agencies, significant and lasting changes in crypto regulation often require legislative action from Congress. The political makeup of Congress and bipartisan support for crypto-friendly legislation will be crucial. Actionable Insights: What Should Crypto Investors and Businesses Do Now? Trump’s statements have injected a dose of optimism into the crypto market. But what practical steps should crypto investors and businesses take in response? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on political developments and regulatory announcements related to crypto. Follow reputable news sources and industry publications to stay ahead of the curve. Engage with Policymakers: Support industry advocacy groups and initiatives that are working to educate policymakers about the benefits of crypto and advocate for sensible regulation. Prepare for Potential Regulatory Shifts: Businesses should review their compliance strategies and be prepared to adapt to potential changes in regulations, whether they become more lenient or stringent. Diversify and Manage Risk: While Trump’s promise is encouraging, the crypto market remains volatile. Diversification and prudent risk management are always essential investment strategies. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Crypto Regulation? Donald Trump’s pledge to end the ‘war on crypto’ marks a potentially pivotal moment for the digital asset industry. His focus on rolling back ‘Chokepoint 2.0’ and easing regulatory pressure resonates deeply with crypto businesses and investors who have long felt stifled by the current environment. While the path forward is uncertain and challenges remain, Trump’s bold promise injects a renewed sense of hope and anticipation into the crypto space. Whether this translates into a true ‘new dawn’ for crypto regulation remains to be seen, but the conversation has undoubtedly shifted, and the potential for significant change is now firmly on the table.

41303674,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=138285,1741392353,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Fierce AI Race: Microsoft Intensifies Efforts to Rival OpenAI’s Dominance,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/microsoft-ai-openai-competition-heats/,"The tech world is witnessing a fascinating power struggle as Microsoft, a long-time partner of OpenAI, is reportedly escalating its artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives. This strategic pivot signals a bold move by Microsoft to not just collaborate, but to directly compete with OpenAI, especially in powering its innovative products like the Copilot bot. For those in the cryptocurrency space, this intense competition mirrors the rapid innovation and rivalry we see in blockchain technologies, where companies constantly push boundaries to lead the next wave of technological advancement. Let’s dive into the details of Microsoft’s ambitious AI strategy and what it means for the future of technology. Why is Microsoft Stepping Up its AI Development Game? Microsoft’s increased focus on in-house AI development stems from a combination of strategic necessity and perhaps, a bit of competitive friction. Recent reports suggest that OpenAI has been less forthcoming with technical specifics about its advanced models, creating some tension in the relationship with Microsoft, despite the latter’s significant $14 billion investment. This has seemingly spurred Microsoft to become more self-reliant and explore diverse avenues for its AI ambitions. Here’s a breakdown of Microsoft’s multi-pronged approach: Building Proprietary AI Models: Microsoft has reportedly developed its own ‘reasoning’ AI models, internally benchmarked against OpenAI’s o1 and o3-mini models. This indicates a serious commitment to creating AI capabilities that are on par with, or even surpass, those of OpenAI. MAI Family of Models: Beyond individual models, Microsoft has also created a family of AI models known as MAI, directly competitive with OpenAI’s offerings. The potential plan to offer these models through an API later this year could position Microsoft as a significant player in the AI model marketplace, offering alternatives to businesses and developers. Exploring Alternative AI Partnerships: To diversify its AI resources, Microsoft is reportedly testing models from various leading AI companies like xAI (Elon Musk’s AI venture), Meta, Anthropic, and DeepSeek. This strategic move suggests Microsoft is hedging its bets, ensuring it isn’t solely reliant on OpenAI’s technology for critical products like Copilot. Strategic Talent Acquisition: The hiring of Mustafa Suleyman, co-founder of DeepMind and Inflection, to spearhead Microsoft’s AI efforts is a clear indication of the company’s seriousness. Suleyman’s expertise and leadership are expected to be pivotal in driving Microsoft’s ambitious AI agenda. OpenAI Competition : A Sign of a Maturing AI Landscape? The evolving relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI, from close collaboration to apparent OpenAI competition , highlights a significant trend in the AI industry. As AI technology matures and becomes more central to business strategies, companies are increasingly seeking control and diversification in their AI capabilities. This competition is not necessarily a negative development; in fact, it can be a catalyst for innovation, pushing both Microsoft and OpenAI to develop even more advanced and beneficial AI technologies. Just as competition in the cryptocurrency space drives innovation in blockchain and decentralized technologies, this rivalry in AI is likely to accelerate progress and broaden the applications of AI across various sectors. What Does This Mean for Microsoft AI and the Tech Industry? Microsoft’s intensified Microsoft AI efforts have several potential implications: Enhanced Copilot and Future Products: By exploring diverse AI models, Microsoft aims to enhance the capabilities of Copilot and future AI-powered products. This could lead to more sophisticated features, improved performance, and greater adaptability to user needs. A More Competitive AI Market: Microsoft’s entry as a direct competitor in AI models could disrupt the current market dynamics, potentially leading to more choices and competitive pricing for businesses seeking AI solutions. Accelerated Innovation: The race between Microsoft and OpenAI, along with other major tech players, is likely to fuel rapid innovation in AI. We can expect faster advancements in model performance, efficiency, and application across industries. Potential Shifts in AI Partnerships: Microsoft’s diversification strategy could signal a broader trend of tech giants seeking multiple AI partnerships and building in-house capabilities to reduce reliance on single providers. Navigating the Future of AI Models : Challenges and Opportunities While Microsoft’s ambitious move presents exciting opportunities, it also comes with challenges: Challenges Opportunities Ensuring seamless integration of diverse AI models into existing products and services. Creating more robust and versatile AI-powered solutions by leveraging the strengths of different models. Managing potential complexities of working with multiple AI providers and in-house development teams. Building a more resilient and adaptable AI infrastructure, less vulnerable to disruptions from a single provider. Maintaining ethical standards and responsible AI development across a broader range of models and partnerships. Fostering a more diverse and inclusive AI ecosystem by engaging with a wider range of AI developers and technologies. Conclusion: The AI Competition is Just Getting Started Microsoft’s ramped-up AI efforts signify a pivotal moment in the tech industry. The AI competition is intensifying, with major players vying for dominance in this transformative technology. For observers in the cryptocurrency world and beyond, this escalating rivalry promises accelerated innovation, diverse AI solutions, and a future where AI is even more deeply integrated into our daily lives and technologies. As Microsoft and OpenAI push the boundaries of AI, the entire tech landscape is set to benefit from this dynamic and evolving competition.

This Thursday, President Trump directed for the establishment of a Bitcoin reserve and digital asset stockpile for the other currencies with crypto seized during legal proceedings. David Sacks believes the government has about 200000 BTC from its seizures White House Czar David Sacks insisted that a crypto audit is necessary given how they’ve never done one. According to Sacks, the government has captured over 400,000 Bitcoins in criminal and civil proceedings over the last ten years. He believes the government is still in control of about half of that. However, he says they cannot be certain of the total crypto holdings since they’ve never done a proper audit. According to Arkham Intelligence, the United States owns roughly $17.5 billion in Bitcoin and about $400 million worth of other digital assets in known digital wallets. Meanwhile, Trump’s executive order mandates that the Treasury and Commerce Departments find “budget-neutral strategies” to acquire Bitcoin for the reserve, limiting them to forfeited assets for now. The US government will also have seized crypto build its separate digital asset stockpile to avoid incurring extra costs in acquisitions. Sacks added, “With the reserve, the goal is long-term preservation. With the stockpile, the goal is responsible stewardship.” Nevertheless, he has compared the BTC reserve and the separate digital asset stockpile to “a digital Fort Knox for cryptocurrency,” likening it to the Kentucky military base that holds part of the country’s gold reserves. However, some crypto analysts and enthusiasts expected Trump to take bolder steps in asset acquisition and are slightly disappointed that the reserve holdings are limited to only seized assets. For instance, Charles Edwards of the Capriole Fund, a Bitcoin and digital asset hedge fund, stated that no active Bitcoin purchases mean that the reserve is just a “fancy title” for already existing assets within the government’s control. Trump will meet some key crypto leaders soon President Donald Trump insisted that he wanted to make the US the global crypto capital, and signing this executive order to create a BTC reserve was a step forward for the crypto industry. So far, the crypto industry has also seen impressive changes in regulations and across regulatory agencies where Trump appointed key crypto supporters. For instance, the Securities and Exchanges Commission has dropped or paused over 10 cases, including its case against crypto exchange Coinbase. Before Trump authorised the formation of a working group that would recommend and develop policies for cryptocurrencies, the group was also supposed to propose strategies for the government to establish crypto strategic reserves. Coinbase Global Inc. CEO Brian Armstrong, Strategy CEO Michael Saylor and Vlad Tenev of Robinhood Markets Inc. are scheduled to meet with Trump, Sacks and Bo Hines to discuss more pro-crypto policies.

While Cardano continues to focus on scalability and sustainability, offering a strong foundation for decentralized applications, Lightchain AI is quickly emerging as a major competitor. Priced at just $0.006 during its presale and already raising $16.9 million, Lightchain AI combines blockchain technology with artificial intelligence, offering decentralized, scalable solutions with real-world applications. As Lightchain AI’s presale gains momentum, it could potentially surpass both ADA and DOGE in growth, making it a top contender for 2025. Cardano Price Prediction for 2025- Can ADA Reach $13? As of February 27, 2025, Cardano (ADA) is trading at approximately $0.65. Analysts predict that by the end of 2025, ADA's price could range between $0.698 and $0.812, with an average around $0.753. Reaching $13 would require a substantial increase of over 1,900% from its current price. While some analysts, like Dan Gambardello, have speculated about such a possibility, these views are considered highly optimistic and not widely supported. Given the current market trends and projections, a $13 price point for ADA by the end of 2025 appears highly unlikely. Investors should approach such predictions with caution and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions. How Dogecoin (DOGE) and Lightchain AI Are Competing for the Top Spot Dogecoin (DOGE) and Lightchain AI are competing for the top spot in the crypto space, but each takes a very different approach. DOGE’s popularity stems from its meme status and community-driven growth, while Lightchain AI is focused on innovation through the integration of artificial intelligence with blockchain. Lightchain AI stands out by mitigating bias in AI models through decentralized contributions, ensuring fairness and inclusivity in decision-making. The platform also emphasizes distributing control through decentralized governance, allowing token holders to vote on key decisions and shape the future of the project. Additionally, interoperability with other blockchain networks allows Lightchain AI to seamlessly integrate with various ecosystems, expanding its reach. These unique features, combined with strong tokenomics, position Lightchain AI to potentially surpass DOGE in both utility and growth in the near future. Why Lightchain AI Could Be Major Player in 2025 As blockchain technology evolves and artificial intelligence takes center stage, their integration is shaping the future of innovation. Enter Lightchain AI —a platform redefining scalability and sustainability in the blockchain space. With industries increasingly adopting blockchain and AI, the opportunities for Lightchain AI are skyrocketing. This growing momentum could drive widespread adoption, boosting demand for its platform and its native token. While some cryptocurrencies, like ADA, may face challenges reaching ambitious targets like $13 by 2025, Lightchain AI is carving out its own path. Its cutting-edge solutions and rising popularity position it as a potential game-changer in the crypto market. Don’t miss your chance to get in early.

The agency emphasized that it permits a range of activities with crypto, and it confirms and reaffirms those activities. It also rescinds guidance from 2021 that banks found burdensome and discriminatory. The OCC’s Interpretive Letter 1183 of March 7 is the first to be issued under Acting Comptroller of the Currency Rodney Hood, who was appointed to his post on Feb. 11. Hood is quoted in a press release as saying that the letter ensures “Bank activities are treated consistently by the OCC, regardless of the underlying technology.” Hood further said he would “continue to work diligently to ensure regulations are effective and not excessive.” The OCC’s letter is about letters Interpretive Letter 1183 begins by saying Letter 1179 has been rescinded. That letter required national banks to notify their supervisory office if they intend to engage in any of the activities permitted in other letters. The supervisory office would then evaluate the banks’ adequacy and reply in writing to object to the proposed activities or confirm its nonobjection. That letter was issued in November 2021 under Hood’s predecessor acting comptroller Michael Hsu. The OCC has gained supervisory experience and realized those measures are no longer necessary, the new letter said. The rescission should reduce banks’ burden, encourage responsible innovation and enhance transparency. It also ensures that bank activities are treated consistently, regardless of the underlying technology. In 2020 and 2021, the OCC issued letters concerning banks providing crypto asset custody ( 1170 ), the use of dollar deposits to back stablecoins ( 1172 ) and the use of public blockchains to verify payments ( 1174 ). All of those letters were issued while Brian Brooks was comptroller. Brooks was a former Coinbase chief legal officer. Now the OCC will examine the activities described in those letters, Letter 1183 said. The letter backpedals on joint policy The press release for the new letter stated that the OCC has also withdrawn its participation in the joint statement on crypto asset risks. That document was issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the OCC in January 2023. The joint statement came on the heels of the collapse of FTX and the rest of the events of the crypto winter. “It is important that risks related to the crypto-asset sector that cannot be mitigated or controlled do not migrate to the banking system,” it said. It went on to list eight specific risks. Banks can provide services to customers of any type, the statement read, but “based on the agencies’ current understanding and experience to date, the agencies believe that issuing or holding as principal crypto-assets … is highly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices.” It’s still early for jubilation Caitlin Long, founder and CEO of crypto-native Custodia Bank and a long-time critic of banking regulation as it applies to crypto, was reticent in her praise of the new OCC letter. “Amid all the jubilation about the OCC news, #OperationChokePoint2.0 isn’t over until: 1. Fed & FDIC also rescind their anti-#crypto guidance, which is still in effect (Fed & FDIC were far more detrimental to crypto banking than OCC) & 2. @custodiabank has its Fed master account,” Long wrote on X. The OCC regulates national banks, while the Federal Reserve regulates state banks (which are otherwise overseen by state agencies and cannot open branches out of state). The FDIC regulates commercial banks, which are a subset of both state and national banks. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The United States is signaling a major policy U-turn. After a period of intense regulatory scrutiny, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has declared an end to the crypto crackdown , paving the way for a more innovation-friendly environment for digital assets. This groundbreaking announcement, delivered at the White House Crypto Summit, suggests a significant change in approach that could reshape the future of cryptocurrency in America and its global influence. Are you ready to explore what this means for you, for the market, and for the future of finance? Why the Sudden Shift Away From Crypto Crackdown? For months, the crypto industry has navigated a complex web of regulations, often feeling like authorities were putting the brakes on innovation. Secretary Bessent’s speech signals a clear departure from this stance. He openly criticized past policies, acknowledging that a heavy-handed crypto crackdown approach was actually hindering progress and pushing innovation overseas. This is a crucial admission and a welcome change for many in the digital asset space. But what exactly prompted this change of heart? Recognizing Stifled Innovation: The Treasury Secretary explicitly stated that previous regulatory measures were ‘stifling innovation.’ This suggests a growing understanding within the government that overly strict rules can push groundbreaking technologies and businesses away from the U.S. President Trump’s Pro-Tech Stance: The announcement is closely aligned with President Trump’s publicly declared pro-technology stance. This political backing gives weight to the policy shift and suggests a long-term commitment to fostering innovation in the digital realm. Global Competitiveness Concerns: It’s likely the U.S. is also considering its global standing. Other nations are actively embracing and regulating crypto, creating hubs for digital asset innovation. A continued crypto crackdown risked the U.S. falling behind in this crucial technological race. Stablecoins: The Unsung Heroes in Maintaining US Dollar Dominance A key highlight of Secretary Bessent’s announcement was the emphasis on stablecoins . He specifically identified them as crucial for maintaining the U.S. dollar’s global dominance in the evolving financial landscape. This is a powerful endorsement of stablecoins and their potential. But why are stablecoins so important in this context? Stablecoins , cryptocurrencies pegged to a stable reserve asset like the US dollar, bridge the gap between traditional finance and the volatile crypto world. They offer the speed and efficiency of blockchain technology while maintaining price stability. Secretary Bessent seems to recognize that: Global Transactions: Stablecoins facilitate faster and cheaper international transactions, potentially strengthening the dollar’s role in global commerce. Digital Dollar Infrastructure: They can be seen as a stepping stone towards a potential central bank digital currency (CBDC) or at least a key component of a future digital dollar ecosystem. Innovation Hub: By supporting stablecoins, the U.S. can become a hub for stablecoin innovation, attracting businesses and talent in this rapidly growing sector. What Does This Mean for Digital Assets? The shift away from a crypto crackdown and towards a more supportive regulatory framework has profound implications for the entire digital assets ecosystem. It’s not just about stablecoins; it’s about creating a fertile ground for all types of crypto innovation. Here’s what we can expect: Area Potential Impact Innovation Expect a surge in crypto startups and projects within the U.S. as regulatory uncertainty decreases. Investment Increased institutional and retail investment in digital assets as the market matures and gains legitimacy. Adoption Wider adoption of cryptocurrencies for payments, investments, and various applications as regulatory hurdles are eased. Job Creation Growth in the crypto industry will lead to new job opportunities in technology, finance, and related sectors. Navigating the New Crypto Regulation Landscape While the announcement signals an end to the crypto crackdown , it doesn’t mean a complete absence of crypto regulation . Instead, it suggests a move towards smarter, more innovation-friendly rules. What should businesses and individuals in the crypto space be prepared for? Clarity, Not Absence of Rules: Expect regulations to become clearer and more targeted, focusing on consumer protection and preventing illicit activities without stifling innovation. Collaboration: The government may seek more collaboration with the crypto industry to develop effective and balanced regulatory frameworks. Focus on Key Areas: Regulation might prioritize areas like stablecoins, exchanges, and DeFi to ensure market stability and investor confidence. Actionable Insights: Preparing for a Crypto-Friendly Future This policy shift presents significant opportunities. Here are some actionable insights to consider: For Businesses: If you’ve been hesitant to launch or expand your crypto business in the U.S. due to regulatory concerns, now might be the time to reconsider. Explore opportunities for innovation and growth within a more supportive environment. For Investors: Stay informed about evolving regulations and market developments. A clearer regulatory landscape could lead to increased market stability and new investment opportunities in digital assets . For Individuals: Educate yourself about cryptocurrencies and stablecoins . Understand their potential benefits and risks as they become more integrated into the financial system. A New Dawn for Crypto in the USA? Secretary Bessent’s announcement is a watershed moment. It signifies a potential turning point in the U.S. approach to cryptocurrency, moving from a period of intense scrutiny to one of cautious embrace. By ending the crypto crackdown and recognizing the strategic importance of digital assets and stablecoins , the U.S. is signaling its intent to remain a leader in technological innovation and global finance. This shift could unleash a wave of innovation, investment, and adoption, shaping the future of money and the internet as we know it. The journey ahead will still require careful navigation and collaboration, but the direction is undeniably more promising for the crypto industry in the United States.

His analysis builds on detailed wave counts, multiple Fibonacci extension targets, and critical moving averages, offering a granular look at the BTC’s near- and mid-term possibilities. What’s Next For Bitcoin? Big Mike’s chart displays a complex Elliott Wave structure consisting of five main impulse waves and interspersed corrective sub-waves. A key area labeled near $72,895 corresponds to wave (c)(iv), representing a major potential bottom if the market breaks below $78,000 and continues lower. Notable corrective waves around $85,000 to $95,000 appear to have formed a larger consolidation phase, which he regards as a precursor to the next directional move. The chart also pinpoints an upside pathway from roughly $95,000, projecting impulse waves (3), (4), and (5) that extend into the $100,000–$140,000 zone. Related Reading: Historic Bitcoin Buy Signal: DXY’s Collapse Signals A Bigger Bull Run Fibonacci extension targets appear at approximately $114,693 (1.618 extension) which could be the target for wave (3), followed by a corrective move to $102,000 before starting wave 5 which aims for $137,727 (2.618 extension), or even a final leg near $150,000 aligns with wave c(3). Moving averages in the $72,000–$90,000 range underscore the significance of support near $78,000–$72,895, while an upper band around $90,000–$95,000 represents a crucial resistance corridor. The analyst observes a descending wedge formation from mid-February to early March, spanning $95,000 down to $85,000, and notes that an upside breakout could herald a renewed push into six-figure territory. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Price Range Could Be The Bulls’ Final Defense Line, Report Says Volume profiles indicate subdued participation during recent corrective phases, alongside a neutral Stochastic RSI reading that suggests momentum could shift decisively depending on which price threshold gives way first. Big Mike emphasizes two critical lines in the sand: “BTC above $95k will trigger the move quickly towards my target of $130-$140k. Below $78k and we test $72k, then run to $140k.” From his perspective, both a direct break above $95,000 and a deeper dip to $72,895 ultimately converge on the same upside target near $130,000–$140,000. At press time, BTC traded at $90,053.

While XRP has had its ups and downs, new and exciting projects are emerging, offering unique value propositions that could drive substantial growth. For those who missed the boat on XRP or are looking to diversify their portfolios, there are several promising cryptocurrencies with strong growth potential. These tokens bring innovative technologies, real-world use cases, and vibrant communities to the table, making them top contenders in the ever-expanding crypto space. In this article, we’ll explore the top 5 best cryptocurrencies to buy now, each with its own unique features and the potential to generate significant returns in the coming years. How Ripple (XRP) Fared and Why You Should Consider Other Cryptocurrencies Ripple (XRP) has experienced significant ups and downs since its inception, with legal battles and regulatory challenges weighing heavily on its performance. Despite its initial success and widespread adoption by financial institutions, XRP has faced roadblocks, especially with the ongoing SEC lawsuit, which has hindered its growth and limited its market potential. While XRP was once considered a top contender in the crypto space, these challenges have led many investors to reconsider their positions. As a result, diversifying into other cryptocurrencies with more promising long-term prospects has become increasingly attractive. There are now numerous alternative projects that offer unique use cases, solid roadmaps, and innovative technologies, making them worthy contenders for investment. In this article, we explore five such cryptocurrencies that could help you recover missed opportunities and potentially deliver greater returns. 5 Currencies to Look out for Besides Ripple (XRP) As Ripple (XRP) faces regulatory challenges, investors are increasingly looking to diversify their portfolios with other promising cryptocurrencies that offer unique features and growth potential. One such option is Lightchain AI (LCAI) , which blends artificial intelligence with blockchain, creating a decentralized platform for AI-powered applications. Cardano (ADA) is another strong contender, offering a scalable and sustainable proof-of-stake network that continues to attract developers and investors. Solana (SOL) stands out for its high-speed, low-cost blockchain, ideal for decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi projects. Polkadot (DOT) provides interoperability between blockchains, positioning it as a key player in the multi-chain future of crypto. Lastly, Chainlink (LINK) remains a valuable asset due to its decentralized oracle network, which bridges the gap between smart contracts and real-world data. These cryptocurrencies offer diverse opportunities for growth beyond Ripple, making them worth considering in 2025. Which One Should You Buy If You Still Want Ripple (XRP)? If you're still interested in investing in a cryptocurrency with strong potential in the cross-border payments space like Ripple (XRP), Lightchain AI (LCAI) is a great alternative to consider.

Armstrong made the statement following the White House Crypto Summit, where he and other industry leaders met with government officials to discuss crypto regulation policies. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong Announces 1,000 New U.S. Jobs After attending the White House Crypto Summit, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong took to X (formerly Twitter) to reveal the company’s hiring plans. He stated that the regulatory landscape in the U.S. is improving, allowing the company to expand its workforce. Armstrong credited the shift to President Trump’s leadership and the administration’s efforts to establish clear guidelines for crypto regulation. He emphasized that this new clarity is enabling businesses like Coinbase to strengthen their presence in the U.S. market. Coinbase CEO added, “Historic day at the Whitehouse Digital Asset Summit. Thanks to Trump’s leadership, along with David Sacks, the U.S. now has a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and emerging regulatory clarity. This is directly translating to economic growth in the U.S. For instance, Coinbase plans to hire about 1,000 employees in the U.S. this year as a result of this renewed growth. During the White House crypto summit , Donald Trump announced plans to end Operation Chokepoint 2.0, signaling a shift toward a more supportive regulatory environment. Additionally, Trump emphasized the urgency of stablecoin legislation, aiming to establish clear regulatory guidelines before Congress adjourns for summer. Regulatory Clarity Boosts Crypto Industry Growth The White House Crypto Summit brought together government officials, industry leaders, and regulatory bodies to discuss the future of digital assets. The event marked a shift in the U.S. government’s stance toward the crypto industry, with an emphasis on fostering innovation. One of the major developments discussed was the U.S. government’s decision to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . Armstrong expressed his support for the initiative, stating that the U.S. government holding Bitcoin signals its recognition as a key financial asset. A major factor influencing Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong’s hiring announcement was the US SEC decision to drop its enforcement action against the company. With the case no longer proceeding, crypto businesses now look to Congress for regulatory clarity. Armstrong stated that this development allows Coinbase to focus on business expansion rather than ongoing legal battles. Donald Trump Administration’s Crypto Policy Donald Trump administration has positioned itself as an advocate for the crypto industry, with officials expressing their commitment to making the U.S. a leader in digital assets. Bo Hines, the executive director of the President’s Working Group on Digital Assets, reaffirmed the administration’s goal of establishing the U.S. as the global center for crypto innovation. Hines stated that government agencies, including the Treasury and Commerce departments, are exploring ways to invest in Bitcoin without increasing the financial burden on taxpayers. Industry leaders, including Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, welcomed these policy changes. Meanwhile, VanEck has shared budget-neutral strategies in which the U.S. government could expand its Bitcoin Reserve without taxpayer funding.

Regulatory Clarity- Recent developments suggest a more favorable regulatory environment for XRP, potentially enhancing its adoption and stability. Market Performance- Analysts predict that XRP could reach $5 to $7 in the first half of 2025, driven by Ripple's advancements and increased adoption.

41305139,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=689129,1741394971,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41305139.jpeg,"David Sacks says Trump’s mention of XRP, SOL, and ADA is being overanalyzed",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/sacks-says-xrp-mentions-being-overanalyzed/,"As speculation surrounding President Donald Trump’s recent statement about creating a U.S. cryptocurrency strategic reserve has reached a fever pitch, White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks spoke out. Sacks attempted to reduce expectation and overinterpretation by noting that mentioning these particular altcoins did not mean any government-endorsed option or preference. Many cryptocurrency executives criticized the specific digital assets included in the report as too far-flung from crypto standards of development, institutional adoption, and decentralization seen in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Some analysts suggested that their addition was a sign the government had changed its approach and was preparing to back other blockchain networks. However, Sacks shot down those theories in an interview on Friday. “The president just listed the top five cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, so I think this is one of those moments where people are reading too much into this,” Sacks said. “There’s no secret motive behind it — he just mentioned the biggest names.” The market’s response to Trump’s comment was nonetheless stark. The name drop of XRP, SOL, and ADA resulted in explosive price movements, with some of these assets ripping up close to 70% over the weekend before pulling back. Such price volatility highlighted the outsized impact political statements and policy signals can have on digital asset markets. Federal government can’t account for all its crypto holdings Sacks said a complete audit was still needed to establish the government’s crypto holdings. He had no doubts that the U.S. government owned Bitcoin and thought there was some Ethereum. However, he noted that there was no clear answer to whether it also held other altcoins such as XRP, Solana, or Cardano. Source: Bloomberg That uncertainty is part of what Thursday night’s executive order required: a full tally of all the digital assets the U.S. government currently holds. The United States federal government has over 198,000 BTC holdings, and Bitcoin Treasuries estimate this to be worth around $17 billion at today’s prices. The order also establishes a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile to manage non-Bitcoin digital assets acquired through criminal and civil seizures. However, it explicitly states that the government will not actively purchase additional cryptocurrencies for this stockpile beyond those obtained through legal recoveries. Federal government is not interested in selling its crypto holdings The executive order sets forth a new way of dealing with these digital assets rather than simply playing accountants. While the federal government may opt to sell some of its holdings, Sacks suggested other strategies, such as lending or staking the cryptocurrencies it owns and earning additional returns, could be used. Sacks said the executive order was meant to establish guidelines for responsible asset management. He said that the first step would be a complete audit and that digital assets would be transferred to a more secure account. The Treasury Secretary and their expertise would then administer a diversified portfolio to long-term custodial oversight to maximize the benefit for Americans. He also said the strategy may be as simple as staking certain assets for passive rewards, portfolio rebalancing to lower risk while gaining a larger return, or selling when appropriate. He said the Treasury Department could consider such options if they served the country’s long-term financial interests. With these policy developments playing out, the crypto industry’s eyes are now fixed on a highly publicized summit in Washington, D.C., where President Trump hosts several top Bitcoin and cryptocurrency executives. The discussions are likely to focus on regulatory approaches, market growth, and how blockchain technology is evolving in the U.S. economy. In the meantime, the market conditions are still turbulent. XRP and ADA have lost around 7% in the last 24 hours following their brief rally last weekend (according to The Block’s crypto price data). Solana (SOL), on the other hand, remained relatively more robust, recording a slight decline of 1.3%. The two leading cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, have also suffered; Bitcoin has fallen 2%, while Ethereum has lost 2.7% during the same time frame. As the government’s crypto blueprint continues, traders, investors, and policymakers will watch how these assets are handled in the new U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile and whether other regulatory changes could affect the broader market.

Priced at just $0.006 during its presale, Lightchain AI has already raised $16.9 million, offering a unique combination of blockchain and artificial intelligence that promises scalable, decentralized solutions for real-world applications. While Ethereum continues to lead with its smart contracts and Cardano focuses on scalability and sustainability, Lightchain AI’s innovative approach positions it for explosive growth. As the presale progresses, Lightchain AI may very well become the best altcoin for long-term investors in 2025 and beyond. Comparing Long-Term Potential- Lightchain AI, Ethereum (ETH), and Cardano (ADA) In 2025, Lightchain AI, Ethereum (ETH), and Cardano (ADA) each present distinct long-term investment opportunities. Ethereum (ETH)- As a leading platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, Ethereum continues to drive innovation in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Analysts project ETH could reach $3,500 by the end of 2025, reflecting its established position and ongoing development. Cardano (ADA)- Known for its proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, Cardano emphasizes scalability, security, and sustainability. Price predictions for ADA in 2025 vary, with some forecasts suggesting a range between $0.69 and $2.22, indicating potential for significant growth. Lightchain AI (LCAI)- An emerging cryptocurrency integrating artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, Lightchain AI has garnered attention for its innovative approach. During its presale, LCAI raised over millions, indicating strong investor confidence. Some projections suggest that a $300 investment could potentially grow to $12,300, highlighting its rapid growth and the confidence investors have in its future prospects. While all three projects offer promising prospects, Lightchain AI's innovative integration of AI and blockchain positions it as a potentially high-return investment. However, it's essential to approach such investments with caution, conducting thorough research and considering the inherent risks associated with the cryptocurrency market. Why Lightchain AI Could Be Best Long-Term Hold for Next 4 Years Lightchain AI could be the best long-term hold for the next 4 years due to its unique integration of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. The platform’s scalability is enhanced by Layer 2 solutions and DAG structures, allowing it to handle high transaction volumes without compromising performance. Lightchain AI also focuses on gas optimization, ensuring cost-efficiency and sustainability for users.

Buy LCAI Tokens Now for Long-Term Growth Potential Investing in LCAI tokens now can offer significant long-term growth potential as the platform continues to develop and establish itself in the cryptocurrency market. With a limited supply of 10 billion tokens, scarcity may contribute to price appreciation over time. As Lightchain AI expands its real-world use cases and partnerships, demand for its token could increase, driving up its value. Invest right now and hold onto your LCAI tokens for the next 4 years to potentially see significant returns on your investment. However, as with any investment, it's crucial to conduct due diligence and only invest what you can afford to lose.

The Solana ( SOL ) rival is witnessing price gains amid a new collaboration with World Liberty Financial (WLFI). Says World Liberty Financial co-founder Zak Folkman in a statement , “We chose Sui for its American-born innovation combined with impressive scale and adoption. It is a natural complement to our mission of bringing decentralized finance to more Americans. Given our plans to support foundational DeFi assets in the coming months, collaborating with Sui was an obvious decision.” World Liberty Financial’s website states that Trump is not an officer, director, founder or employee of the firm or any of its affiliates but lists the president as its chief crypto advocate. The website also notes that DT Marks DEFI LLC, a company affiliated with Trump and some of his family members, holds 22.5 billion WLFI tokens and is entitled to receive fees from the project. SUI is currently trading for $2.76, up by 5.18% over the past 24 hours. Leading altcoins hover in the red zone. The smart contract platform Ethereum ( ETH ) is down by 0.58%, while Solana and Cardano ( ADA ) plunged by 1% and 7.41%, respectively.

The suit claims the closures were driven by political bias, targeting the Trump family’s conservative affiliations back in 2021. “Plaintiffs have reason to believe that Capital One’s unilateral decision came about as a result of political and social motivations and Capital One’s unsubstantiated, “woke” beliefs that it needed to distance itself from President Trump and his conservative political views. In essence, Capital One “de-banked” Plaintiffs’ Accounts because Capital One believed that the political tide at the moment favored doing so. In addition to the considerable financial harm that Plaintiffs and their affiliated entities suffered, Capital One’s reckless decision is part of a growing trend by financial institutions in the United States of America to cut off a consumer’s access to banking services if their political views contradict with those of the financial institution. Capital One’s conduct is but one example of a systemic, subversive industry practice that aims to coerce the public to shift and re-align their political views.” The move comes after Trump openly slammed both Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase. At a World Economic Forum session in January, Trump publicly criticized Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. He accused them of denying services to conservatives, urging them to “open your banks” to those who have allegedly been unfairly kicked out of the banking system. Trump’s remarks touch on a broader debate over alleged discrimination in the financial sector. This month, after meeting with Republican lawmakers, Chase’s Dimon said US banks sometimes “push people out of the system” due to vague federal anti-money laundering rules. Dimon denied political or religious bias at Chase, instead blaming regulatory pressures that force compliance-driven account closures.

While Ethereum and Solana remain dominant players in DeFi, smart contracts, and blockchain adoption, a new contender is rapidly gaining traction— Lightchain AI (LCAI). With $17.1 million raised in presale, Lightchain AI has already demonstrated strong investor confidence, and traders believe it could 20x or more as the broader crypto market continues to rally. But how realistic is a 20x surge for Lightchain AI , and how does it compare to Ethereum and Solana’s growth potential? Let’s break it down. Ethereum (ETH) Eyes $7,000 – A Bull Market on the Horizon? Ethereum (ETH) is making waves, currently trading around $2,228.85, with analysts spotting exciting signs of a potential surge to $7,000. Crypto expert Ali Martinez highlights a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, suggesting that if ETH closes above $4,100, it could kickstart a rally toward $7,000. But that’s not all—Ethereum’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio adds to the momentum. Breaking past the 3.2 MVRV band, now hovering near $7,000, could confirm a major move upward. What does the future hold? Projections vary: some predict ETH will hit $6,000–$7,000 by late 2025, while others take a more cautious stance. One thing’s for sure—reaching $7,000 could mark the beginning of a broader bull market, signaling growing adoption and surging investor confidence in Ethereum’s ecosystem. Buckle up, ETH investors—big things may be on the horizon! Solana’s (SOL) Road to $650 - High-Speed Transactions Fuel Growth Solana (SOL) is currently trading at approximately $147.32, with analysts identifying bullish trends that suggest a potential rise to $650. According to Binance analysts, breaking key resistance levels around $500 could open the path toward this target. Known for its high-speed transaction capabilities—processing up to 65,000 transactions per second with low fees—Solana has become a leading choice for decentralized applications and financial services. This efficiency has spurred significant developer interest, further driving growth in its ecosystem. However, reaching the $650 milestone will depend on broader market conditions, technological progress, and continued adoption. While Solana’s transaction speed positions it as a strong contender in the blockchain space, prospective investors are encouraged to conduct thorough research and account for market volatility when making decisions. As Ethereum and Solana continue to gain traction, traders are exploring high-growth opportunities in this expanding market, with Lightchain AI emerging as a standout option. Why Traders Believe Lightchain AI (LCAI) Could 20x in 2025 Ethereum and Solana may have laid the groundwork for blockchain infrastructure, but Lightchain AI (LCAI) is taking things to the next level by seamlessly blending AI with blockchain technology. What really sets LCAI apart ? Its innovative dynamic gas fee system. Instead of one-size-fits-all pricing, fees adjust based on the complexity of AI tasks. The result? A cost-effective, user-friendly platform that's driving rapid adoption and shaking up the decentralized AI landscape. But that’s just the beginning. Lightchain AI has an ambitious roadmap, from prototype development to global expansion. Its cutting-edge parallelized architecture allows multiple AI tasks to run at once, slashing delays and supercharging performance. With these bold innovations, Lightchain AI isn’t just keeping up—it’s leading the charge in the future of decentralized AI. Buckle up, because the next generation of blockchain technology is here.

While Trump’s proposal to include XRP in a U.S. strategic crypto reserve initially ignited a price rally, macroeconomic headwinds and skepticism from key financial institutions have cut gains in half XRP Bulls Struggle to Hold Gains Amid Conflicting Catalysts XRP price grazed the $3 mark on Monday as rallying 40% after Trump included XRP in the Crypto strategic reserver assets last weekend. However, traders digested multiple market-moving developments this week, those gains have been halved. Trump’s push to establish a cryptocurrency strategic reserve, with XRP included alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano generated strong initial momentum at the start of the week. Further optimism came from the easing of tariffs imposed on Mexico and Canada, boosting broader market sentiment. XRP Price Action However, XRP bulls faced resistance as macroeconomic uncertainties dampened risk appetite. The latest U.S. Non-Farm Payroll ( NFP ) report revealed rising unemployment, fueling concerns about persistent inflation and a potentially more hawkish Federal Reserve. As a result, profit-taking emerged near the $3 mark, halting the upside breakout and forcing consolidation around $2.40. The rejection at $3 suggests traders remain wary of overextending bullish positions amid policy uncertainty. Liquidity remains a key factor, with leveraged long positions likely facing liquidations if XRP fails to hold critical support levels. JPMorgan Director Casts Doubt on Strategic Crypto Reserve Approval for Ripple At press time on March 8, Ripple price was trading at $2.40, with a market capitalization of approximately $140 billion. Bull traders anticipate that a break above $3 could push XRP’s market cap toward $200 billion, especially if U.S. Treasury actions align with Trump’s strategic reserve proposal. Ripple (XRP) Market Data, | Source: CoingeckoRipple (XRP) Market Data, | Source: Coingecko However, JPMorgan’s latest report has thrown cold water on Ripple’s ambitious valuation target, highlighting significant hurdles in gaining congressional approval for a U.S. strategic crypto reserve. According to Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, managing director of global market strategy at JPMorgan, the probability of such a reserve materializing remains below 50%. “We don’t believe an approval of a U.S. strategic crypto reserve is the most likely scenario (assuming congressional approval would be needed). So the chance is less than 50% in our mind. And if a U.S. strategic crypto reserve is eventually approved, it would be difficult to include smaller tokens outside Bitcoin and Ethereum, as the inclusion of such tokens would raise more concerns about risk and volatility” – Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, Maanaging director of global market strategy at JPMorgan The report further noted that similar state-level Bitcoin reserve proposals have recently failed in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming due to concerns over volatility and regulatory hurdles. Skepticsm around approval of Trump’s crypto strategic reserve plan added to the bearish sentiment keeping XRP price below the $2.50 mark on the daily candle. As traders await further clarity, XRP’s technical structure suggests a pivotal battle ahead. XRP Price Forecast: Bulls Eye $3, But Rejection Looms Amid Profit-Taking XRP price is showing early signs of bullish exhaustion after failing to hold above $2.60, suggesting a potential retest of lower support levels. The 12-hour chart highlights a clear rejection near $2.99, coinciding with the upper Donchian Channel boundary, signaling strong resistance. Despite the recent breakout, the inability to sustain momentum above this zone raises the likelihood of profit-taking, particularly with the latest 5.84% decline. XRP Price Forecast The MACD histogram, while still in positive territory, has begun fading, hinting at waning bullish momentum. The MACD line remains above the signal line, supporting a bullish case, but the narrowing gap suggests that if selling pressure persists, bears could regain control. Key support is forming near $2.47, aligned with the midline of the Donchian Channel. A decisive break below this level would expose $2.39, a critical pivot where bulls must step in to prevent a slide toward $1.95. Conversely, if XRP price holds above $2.47 and volume picks up, a renewed push toward $2.99 is likely, with $3.20 as the next bullish target. Leverage traders appear active, making sharp wicks and liquidity hunts a key risk in both directions.

Imagine snagging PEPE at a fraction of a cent and watching it skyrocket by over 1,900%, making millionaires overnight. The regret is real, but here’s the twist—you don’t have to miss out again. BTFD Coin (BTFD) is here, and its 3650% moonshot potential is already creating waves! While PEPE’s time has passed for insane early gains, BTFD Coin is the Best New Meme Coin to Join Today, offering what could be the last low-entry chance before it explodes. The Bulls Squad is rallying behind this project, and the presale is already 99% complete at just $0.00016 per coin. Once the presale ends, BTFD will list at $0.0006, meaning investors who get in now can lock in 275% gains instantly, with a projected moon price of $0.006. The question is, will you seize this golden opportunity—or regret it like PEPE all over again? BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Final Presale Dip Before a 3650% Surge BTFD Coin (BTFD) is more than just another meme coin—it’s a movement built on one of the most legendary investment strategies: Buy The Dip. And right now, the dip is here—but not for long. In just a few months, BTFD has sold over 71 billion tokens, raised over $6.27 million, and gained 11,200+ holders. The presale started at just $0.000004 per coin, and now, at $0.00016, it’s still dirt cheap compared to its expected launch price of $0.0006. But the real excitement? Analysts predict a moon price of $0.006, which means—yes, you read that right—a 3650% ROI potential. Let’s break it down. If you invest $2,500 at today’s price of $0.00016, you’ll get 15.6 million BTFD tokens. Once BTFD hits $0.0006 at launch, your investment would triple to $9,375. But if it reaches the $0.006 moon price, your $2,500 turns into $93,750. Now, imagine sitting on the sidelines, watching this play out, just like with PEPE. This is your shot. This is why so many investors believe BTFD Coin is the Best New Meme Coin to Join Today. Bulls Squad: The Core of BTFD’s Success At the heart of BTFD’s explosive growth is the Bulls Squad, a powerhouse community of diamond-handed investors who believe in the long game. These aren’t your average meme coin gamblers; they’re crypto warriors who turn dips into fortunes. And here’s where it gets even better—BTFD isn’t just hype; it’s utility-driven. Play-to-Earn (P2E) Game: Launched on January 1, 2025, it allows players to earn real BTFD tokens while gaming. 90% APY Staking: Holders can stake their tokens and earn massive passive income. Bulls Squad Rewards: The exclusive Bulls Squad initiative could generate a 3650% return, positioning BTFD as the best new meme coin to join today with real profit potential. If you’ve ever looked at Doge, Shiba, or PEPE and wished you got in early—this is your moment. How Investors Missed PEPE and Lost Their Chance at Millions When Pepe Coin (PEPE) first hit the market, almost nobody took it seriously. A silly frog meme? Sounds ridiculous, right? Well, tell that to the early believers who scooped up billions of PEPE tokens for pennies in its first few months. PEPE started at $0.00000005 in April 2023, and by December 2024, it surged past a market cap of $11 billion. Some early buyers turned a few hundred bucks into life-changing wealth. But most people? They hesitated. They ignored it. And they missed out. The same people who laughed at PEPE were now watching from the sidelines as whales raked in insane profits. Even in 2025, PEPE remains a major player, but the explosive early gains are gone. History is repeating itself with BTFD Coin, and this time, you have a second shot at massive returns—if you act fast. That’s why crypto analysts are calling BTFD the Best New Meme Coin to Join Today, as it mirrors PEPE’s early days but with even bigger potential. Why Presales Are the Smartest Crypto Play The crypto market is volatile, and if you’re sick of watching your portfolio take hits from bearish trends, presales are your best bet. They let you buy at the lowest possible price, avoid market fluctuations, and maximize your gains before public trading begins. BTFD Coin has already proven its strength by raising millions, building a thriving community, and securing major crypto partnerships. Once it hits exchanges, expect a FOMO-fueled buying spree—and prices will never be this low again. That’s why seasoned investors agree that BTFD is the Best New Meme Coin to Join Today. Final Call: Will You Seize the Opportunity or Watch from the Sidelines? PEPE was the missed chance of 2023-2024. BTFD is the Best New Meme Coin to Join Today and the biggest presale opportunity of 2025. With only 1% left in Stage 14, the window to buy at $0.00016 is closing fast. When the presale ends, the launch price of $0.0006 is locked in—and after that, the projected $0.006 moon price will separate the winners from the wish they had. The choice is simple. Either join now and secure your spot in the next crypto success story—or risk regretting it as you did with PEPE. Sign up before the BTFD Coin presale ends!

How much could I earn if BTFD hits $0.006? A $2,500 investment today could turn into $93,750 if BTFD reaches its projected moon price. Why is BTFD expected to moon?

The upcoming presale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is causing present-day enthusiasm while its ongoing funding campaign races towards reaching its projected $4 value within eight weeks. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has received $2.3 million from its 4,300 second presale investors at $0.015 which guarantees a 300% return when the cryptocurrency lists on exchanges at $0.06. Dogecoin Navigates Market Turbulence Amid Payment Integration Speculation The crypto market volatility causes Dogecoin to lose 14% of its value while its current trading price sits at $0.18. The speculation continues about Elon Musk potentially adding DOGE payments to X despite market fluctuations because of the recent offer from Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson to upgrade Dogecoin’s network. Through his technical proposal Hoskinson aimed to create payment features and AI applications which mirrored Musk’s initial support for using DOGE to buy Tesla products. Technical assessments of the market show a rounding bottom pattern which indicates a probable 266% price increase to $0.65 when support levels remain strong. The approximate rise in price value for this token remains uncertain because it depends on both market perception and partnership stability. Expert analysts agree recovery will be stable when sell-off activities slow down and payment plans advance physically as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) maintains substantial progress with its pre-sale launches. Ripple Faces Macroeconomic Headwinds Despite Bullish Forecasts Ripple (XRP) has experienced a 12% decline which brought prices down to $2.35 as political engagements with U.S. crypto reserves lost their market impact. The cryptocurrency analyst EGRAG CRYPTO predicts a steady price increase of XRP to reach $30 by May 2025 according to past performance indicators. For this forecast to materialize XRP needs to break through the channel pattern established in 2017 which will demand a 2,500% price increase. XRP faces negative short-term investment signals because of macroeconomic factors and new trade restrictions that show its ability to manage market volatility remains unclear. While regulatory clarity and institutional adoption remain tailwinds, Ripple’s path to triple-digit growth appears fraught with hurdles. Contrastingly, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) avoids such dependencies, leveraging its decentralized lending model to drive demand irrespective of macroeconomic shifts. Mutuum Finance Capitalizes on Presale Momentum and Tokenomics The DeFi platform MUTM stands out among DeFi solutions because it delivers practical use cases for users. Mutuum Finance gains investor interest by offering lending protocols and mtTokens that produce interest on deposits. MUTM tokens are currently available during their second presale stage at $0.015 while they will move to $0.02 in a subsequent pricing step following a predicted price boost of 33%. The project benefits from its buy-and-distribute features since revenue produced buybacks sustain market demand alongside staking rewards that encourage hodlers to maintain their assets. The future listing price of $0.06 for MUTM tokens can lead to a 4000% profits for early investors according to analysts who foresee that MUTM prices could potentially rise to $4. More than 4300 investors have participated in MUTM’s presale because they appreciate its open tokenomics and planned P2P lending capabilities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) achieves its growth through planned tokenomics structures and instant token presale gains rather than pursuing speculative achievement targets like XRP and DOGE. The sell-out pace of phase two accelerates while the project establishes increased investor confidence through its $2.3 million fundraise. The eight-week plan leading to $4 provides MUTM investors with an attractive window when they value actual returns instead of future speculations. The timeout for $0.015 token acquisition during presale is shrinking which produces faster FOMO through increased desire for lucrative returns. Secure MUTM tokens at $0.015 right now as the Mutuum Finance presale phase two will reach its conclusion soon. Take part in the presale on the official website to secure potential 300% profit when the platform launches.

After languishing below $85k for days, Bitcoin climbed past $90k last Monday and briefly flirted with the $95k level. However, crypto’s hot streak was brief, making Trump’s latest statement a “sell on news” event. From $94,770 on March 3, Bitcoin dipped to as low as $82,681 on March 4. Leading altcoins also slumped with BTC, creating a ripple effect across the broader crypto industry. Today, Bitcoin is trading wildly between $84k and $91k, more than 10k below its all-time high. Related Reading: Billionaire Warns Of Financial Turmoil—Will Bitcoin Save Investors? What’s Up With The Bitcoin Drop? Bitcoin gradually recovered from a low of $83,000 last week and bounced back to $92k days before the planned White House Crypto Summit this Friday, March 7th. Trump’s latest pronouncement did not specify how the reserve shall be funded beyond what was already included in the US’ crypto holdings. Instead of clarity, the statement was just a commitment to retain crypto holdings, with no specifics on funding. The president’s disclosure on a possible stockpile spurred conversations and debates among analysts and critics. Many crypto holders and supporters backed the possible inclusion of SOL, XRP, and ADA. Stock broker and financial commentator Peter Schiff shared his thoughts on the plan, saying the US government should limit the assets included in the pile. He specifically identified “seized assets”, so the government should not buy additional SOL, ADA, XRP, and ETH. Other Crypto Experts Remain Supportive Of Bitcoin As Bitcoin and other leading altcoins struggle, other crypto personalities publicly announce their support for the project. For example, Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich argued that even though BTC is retreating, there’s no denying the importance of Trump’s latest executive order. Gerovich stated that this new order authorizes the Secretaries of Commerce and Treasury to draft a strategy for buying Bitcoin without burdening American taxpayers. He stated that the order is more aggressive and provides a plan for acquiring more crypto without affecting the national budget. Possible Paths To Acquire BTC Discussed Gerovich further explains that there are two ways the US government can acquire Bitcoins and set up a strategic stockpile: One, Trump can exercise his presidential power by using the Exchange Stabilization Fund, which has $39 billion in assets. Two, the president can rely on Congressional approval. The second option is in line with Senator Lummis’ Bitcoin Bill, where the US government will acquire 200k Bitcoins annually for five years. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Won’t Stop At $150K’ This Year, Research Firm Chief Says Lummis was one of the first personalities to comment on the latest EO. The senator mentioned that the latest order was just the beginning, and encouraged Congress to pass the Bitcoin bill.
