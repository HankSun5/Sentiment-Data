Here’s Why and When,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-lend-your-xrp-to-institutions-heres-why-and-when/,"Brett (@Brett_Crypto_X), a prominent voice in the digital asset space, recently issued a direct message to XRP holders, emphasizing the importance of long-term vision over short-term gains. His post encouraged investors to rethink their approach by taking advantage of market dips to accumulate XRP rather than looking for exit points. He believes those who understand what they hold with XRP will never sell the asset and urges the community to prioritize strategic accumulation and future utility. $XRP holders, it's time to rethink your approach—accumulate during the dips. Once regulations hit, lend your $XRP to institutions and enjoy passive income. I’m fed up with folks asking when to sell. If you truly understand what you’ve got, the answer is simple: never. — Brett (@Brett_Crypto_X) April 10, 2025 Shifting the Narrative from Selling to Lending According to Brett, XRP’s real value will be realized once regulatory clarity enters the market, and the recent conclusion of the Ripple lawsuit has sped up this process. He pointed to the growing possibility of lending digital assets to institutions as a future avenue for generating passive income. By doing so, holders can earn a yield on their assets without liquidating them. This approach reframes XRP as a long-term financial tool instead of a speculative asset, especially once institutions gain regulatory approval to operate more freely in crypto markets. Institutional Interest and Strategic Accumulation Many XRP proponents believe that major financial institutions, including firms like BlackRock, are positioning themselves to acquire XRP at relatively low prices . This aligns with the idea that these institutions see XRP as a critical piece in the evolving global financial infrastructure. Supporters argue that XRP’s underlying technology and its intended use case in facilitating cross-border payments and improving liquidity between financial entities make it an ideal asset for integration into traditional finance. The attention from major firms also validates its long-term relevance, even if the current market price does not yet reflect that value. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Regulation as a Catalyst for Adoption Many XRP holders believe that the path will be clear for institutional adoption once regulatory frameworks are finalized. Ripple is now free to sell XRP to institutions , and with demand rising, lending tokens to banks, financial platforms, or other entities may become viable and potentially lucrative. This scenario depends on establishing proper custody, compliance, and lending mechanisms, but the interest shown by institutions suggests that such infrastructure is already being developed. Instead of looking for exit strategies, Brett and other experts encourage committed holders to accumulate and hold to participate in a future financial system where XRP plays a foundational role. For those who recognize XRP’s intended function and the interest it has garnered from institutional players, the current period may represent an opportunity to build and prepare rather than exit.

In 2023, James sued James sued DCG and its CEO Barry Silbert, DCG’s now-bankrupt lending arm Genesis Global Capital and its former CEO Michael Moro and crypto exchange Gemini, alleging that they worked together to cover up a gaping $1 billion hole in Genesis’ balance sheet caused by the wipe-out of Singapore-based crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) in 2022. James said DCG and Genesis made “false assurances” on social media that DCG had absorbed Genesis’ losses from 3AC’s implosion when, in fact, they had just papered over the hole with a promissory note, pleading to pay Genesis $1.1 billion over 10 years at a 1% interest rate. While DCG has adamantly maintained that the promissory note was legitimate, James’ suit claimed that DCG has “never made a single payment under the Note.” While Gemini and Genesis both settled with the OAG, DCG, Silbert and Moro have fought them tooth and nail. Last spring, DCG and both executives filed motions to dismiss the suit, alleging that the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) had failed to state a claim — essentially arguing that they were not selling securities and thus should not be sued under New York State securities laws. But the judge presiding over the case disagreed in her Friday ruling, writing that the OAG had, at least at the current stage of the case, adequately alleged that the Gemini Earn program — the now-defunct Gemini lending product that went belly-up in November 2022 and which sits at the center of James’ case — was a security. Crane did, however, agree to toss out two of James’ claims against DCG, Moro and Silbert — one claim under New York’s Executive Law that they engaged in a scheme to defraud in the first degree, and another that they engaged in a conspiracy in the fifth degree — ruling that those claims were duplicative. Though Crane ruled the case can proceed, DCG said it isn’t done fighting. “As we have stated from the beginning, the allegations against DCG are a thin web of innuendo, mischaracterizations, and unsupported conclusions,” a spokesperson for DCG told CoinDesk. “We’re encouraged by the judge’s dismissal of the New York Attorney General’s most outrageous claims based on alleged violations of criminal fraud and conspiracy statutes. We will continue to fight this baseless lawsuit as we remain focused on our mission in support of the digital assets industry.”",Policy|Letitia James|DCG|Barry Silbert,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-11 22:14:48

With the market buzzing with possibilities, it’s not just the usual suspects like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu capturing attention. Newer meme coins are making waves, some even promising unique features that could make them the next big thing. Among these, some coins stand out in particular—like Troller Cat ($TCAT), which is set to launch soon, and others like Floki Inu, Turbo, Bonk, Popcat, and Notcoin, all gaining traction in the meme coin market. In this article, we’ll look at how these meme coins are heating up and why Troller Cat, in particular, might be the one to watch, especially with its upcoming presale and whitelist phase. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or new to the meme coin game, this list will give you the inside scoop on the rising stars in the crypto universe. 1. Troller Cat ($TCAT)- The New Meme Coin You Shouldn’t Miss Troller Cat is quickly gaining momentum as one of the most promising meme coins in 2025. Early investors are gearing up for something special as the presale rapidly approaches. With its focus on a unique play-to-earn (P2E) game center, Troller Cat is rumored to have deflationary mechanics that will reduce its supply and, ultimately, increase demand. This is exactly the kind of buzz that crypto enthusiasts love. The $TCAT whitelist is currently open, giving early adopters a chance to secure their positions before the presale goes live. If you’re looking to get in early on a meme coin with tremendous potential, the TrollerCat whitelist is your ticket. By signing up, you’ll not only be among the first to access the presale but could potentially enjoy high staking rewards. Analysts are already speculating that Troller Cat could follow the success of other big meme coins, rewarding those who act quickly. 2. Floki Inu ($FLOKI) – A Viking Meme Coin with Strong Community Support Floki Inu is a meme coin that’s built a loyal following, inspired by Elon Musk’s dog, Floki. It’s been making significant strides with its growing ecosystem and passionate community. The coin’s popularity surged after Musk tweeted about it, but it’s the community that’s really propelled Floki Inu forward. As a meme coin with real utility, it’s now working on its own NFT marketplace and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. Floki Inu made it to this list because it has the right balance of meme culture and growing ecosystem potential. The coin’s value has been steadily climbing, and its dedicated community makes it a formidable player in the meme coin space. 3. Turbo ($TURBO)- Speeding Ahead in the Meme Coin Race Known for its fast-moving nature, Turbo has been catching the attention of meme coin enthusiasts for its unique approach to engaging the community. The coin has made waves with its promise of high-speed transactions and decentralized governance. Unlike some meme coins, Turbo focuses on scalability, aiming to provide a faster, more efficient alternative in the meme coin market. Turbo’s ability to scale as the market grows makes it stand out. Investors are noticing this underdog coin, with many seeing it as a promising long-term investment. Turbo has earned its place on this list due to its rapid growth and unique features. 4. Bonk ($BONK) – A Meme Coin with Meme Potential Bonk made a splash on the meme coin scene by positioning itself as a fun, community-driven coin. Originating from the Solana blockchain, Bonk quickly gained traction for its meme value, even though it wasn’t initially intended to be anything more than a community experiment. However, it has since built a solid reputation, primarily due to its active community and growing user base. Despite its playful nature, Bonk is showing real promise. Its success is largely due to its community-first approach and strong backing from the Solana ecosystem. Bonk has made it to this list because of its fun vibes, viral success, and ongoing community engagement. 5. Popcat ($POPCAT) – The Meme Coin with Real Buzz Popcat is based on the popular meme of the cat that gained viral fame due to its wide appeal. The creators behind Popcat have capitalized on this meme, turning it into a fun, engaging cryptocurrency. Despite the playful concept, Popcat is drawing serious attention for its rapidly growing community and meme-driven marketing approach. Why has Popcat made it to this list? It’s simple: the meme factor. Popcat has tapped into the meme culture like few other coins have. It’s fun and easy to understand, and everyone loves a viral meme, making it one of the more promising meme coins today. 6. Notcoin ($NOT) – A Meme Coin with a Twist Notcoin is one of the newest meme coins on the scene, and it’s already making waves due to its unique branding and twist on the classic meme coin format. Unlike traditional meme coins, Notcoin seeks to bring value to its community by introducing features that are typically associated with serious projects, like a deflationary model and utility in DeFi platforms. Notcoin made it to this list because it combines the fun of meme coins with the seriousness of a utility coin. It’s capturing the attention of investors who are looking for the next big meme coin with real utility potential. 7. Would ($WOULD): The Underdog Meme Coin That’s Gaining Momentum Would has quietly become one of the most intriguing players in the meme coin space, drawing attention with its unique charm and growing community. While it doesn’t yet boast the recognition of giants like Dogecoin, its combination of playful branding and a solid development plan has piqued the interest of crypto enthusiasts. The token’s lighthearted approach has attracted a following of younger investors eager to be part of something fun yet potentially lucrative. Analysts believe that Would Coin is one to watch, as it’s creating waves despite being in its infancy. What truly sets Would apart is its focus on sustainability and its active community. Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype, Would has a roadmap in place with real goals, collaborations, and influencer partnerships. The buzz surrounding its potential is palpable, and as the meme coin market continues to evolve, Would could be the unexpected dark horse that surprises investors. Keep an eye on this one—it might just be the next big thing. Conclusion Based on the latest research, the best meme coins to keep an eye on are Troller Cat, Floki Inu, Turbo, Bonk, Popcat, and Notcoin. However, Troller Cat stands out as the next big meme coin with its potential for huge returns and unique features like its rumored deflationary P2E model and staking rewards.

Buffett’s net worth is now $153.5 billion after surging $11.5 billion this year alone, reports Bloomberg. Buffett’s gains stand out amid the tariff-induced selloff triggered by President Trump, which wiped trillions of dollars from global equities. And his gains come despite this month’s sell off, which reduced Buffett’s 2025 winnings by $14.5 billion. Buffett, who is now ranked fourth among global billionaires, is one of only two in the top 20 that grew richer this year. He’s alongside L’Oreal heiress Francoise Bettencourt Meyers, who has added $1.8 billion. After the tariff news hit, the top 500 billionaires shed over $500 billion in just two days. Elon Musk alone suffered a $134 billion loss, with net worth now standing at about $297 billion. Meanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett’s conglomerate, saw an 8.8% share decline since April 2, outperforming the S&P 500’s 10.7% fall. The company’s relative resilience stems from its focus on the property and casualty sector, which remains less affected by global trade disruptions. Buffett has avoided major deals, while trimming stakes in Apple and Bank of America, which have both been hit hard by the tariffs.

This marks its first move under its newly introduced digital asset treasury strategy, which involves staking. Janover Stakes its SOL Holdings As part of its new strategy, Janover plans to commence staking of its SOL holdings, which will generate more revenue for the tech firm. The company takes this laudable step only a week after its Board of Directors formally approves a new treasury policy. This lays the foundation for accumulating crypto assets over the long term. Moreover, the board preferred Solana as the first asset for this initiative. The company’s management highlighted how this step represents the first capital deployment from the $42 million financing round that it previously closed. Noteworthy, Janover’s decision comes when market conditions are favorable to investors. Most of these stakers are getting significant returns from their investments. According to Joseph Onorati, Janover’s CEO, the recent SOL purchase aligns with the company’s objective to become the most efficient and transparent platform for cryptocurrency accumulation in the public markets. Janover Plans to Operate Solana Validators Apart from staking the popular coin, Janover wants to operate a few Solana validators to improve its participation. Specifically, taking this step will allow the company to further participate in securing the Solana network while earning rewards that can be reinvested into the Janover treasury. In the company’s leadership opinion, this is a crucial move toward scaling its operations. More importantly, they are excited about the prospect that this will have no impact on Janover’s efficient capital deployment strategy. Solana Use Cases is on the Rise Again, this Janover move reflects Solana’s growing appeal, even among traditional financial institutions. Two weeks ago, top asset management firm BlackRock added its USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) to the Solana network. This expansion connected Traditional Finance (TradFi) with blockchain and included Solana in its ecosystem. Before then, Swiss-based digital asset company Taurus expanded its digital asset custody and token services to the Solana blockchain . This enabled banks to issue, manage, and securely store digital assets on Solana. Similarly, PayPal and Venmo users can now buy, sell, and hold LINK and SOL in their accounts.

Market trends indicate wallets between 1,000 and 10,000 Bitcoin are expanding at a rate higher than the 30-day average, reports CryptoQuant. Related Reading: From Joke To Juggernaut: Dogecoin Value Revolution Gets Nod From Global Asset Giant Large Investors Display High Confidence In Bitcoin The rise in the number of large crypto holders indicates rising confidence in the future of the cryptocurrency. These investors, usually not exchanges or mining pools, are important in maintaining the value of Bitcoin. Their increasing interest comes as Bitcoin’s market capitalization hits $1.58 trillion, with dominance over other cryptocurrencies at more than 60%. Bitcoin recently hit $83,400 before correcting slightly to settle above $80,000. The increase in these high wallet balances is consistent with Bitcoin’s recent price gains, indicating market strength despite external pressures. Large investor demand for Bitcoin is accelerating.

Typically bullish, signals strong investor confidence. pic.twitter.com/hR5Rumj6A6 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) April 10, 2025 Analysts Look To Price Gap Patterns For Future Projections Some market observers have offered their predictions on what direction the top digital asset may take next. An X (formerly Twitter) analyst by the name of Enzy Bitcoin says that Bitcoin usually goes up after the filling up of price gaps. The analyst mentioned the latest gap between $70,000 and $75,000, that Bitcoin may reach $130,000 in the near future based on historical trends. Source: CryptoQuant Another analyst, BitBull, equated Bitcoin’s stability to recent volatility in US stock markets. As the traditional markets have grappled with volatility, Bitcoin has remained firm above $80,000. Prices below $100,000 may still be acceptable entry points for investors, some experts say. BTC Long-Term Target Extremely Positive Looking further down the road, other market observers posted a very favorable prognosis for Bitcoin’s future only recently, emphasizing the significance of being cognizant of market cycles, particularly during pricing fluctuations like when in a bear trap. The analysts’ projection reads as unusually bullish, that perhaps Bitcoin may get to a whopping $250,000 price tag. This vision also predicts meaningful growth for major alternative cryptocurrencies. Market Cap Hits $1.58 Trillion While Recovery Keeps Momentum The latest price bounceback of the flagship crypto has taken its aggregate market value to $1.58 trillion when this report was made. This follows its appreciation by over $8,000 from recent lows, demonstrating the capability of the cryptocurrency to bounce back quickly from temporary declines. Related Reading: XRP ETF Launch Impresses Even In Bear Market, Says Analyst The market dominance of the cryptocurrency has also grown, currently standing at over 60% of the total crypto market capitalization. The dominance indicates that Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency and continues to attract investors who desire growth as well as a store of value. Although Bitcoin failed to sustain its short surge to $83,500, sustaining above $81,000 demonstrates resilience in the prevailing market environment.

Dogecoin’s path to $1 seems like a distant dream, while Shiba Inu’s 13% price jump lacks the fundamentals to back it up. Meanwhile, Ruvi AI (RUVI) is emerging as a game changer in the blockchain space, offering investors a much more profitable and stable opportunity. Set within a decentralized AI powered ecosystem, Ruvi is not just another crypto token; it’s a blueprint for scalable returns backed by innovation, real world utility and exceptional presale benefits. If you thought the 1160% ROI days in crypto were over, Ruvi AI is here to prove otherwise. The Problems with Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Dogecoin has its cultural appeal but the hard reality is it’s trading at cents and far from its all time highs. Even the most optimistic analysts are saying Doge won’t hit $1 for years and will need a speculative market and sustained celebrity endorsements to keep any momentum. Shiba Inu fares no better, with a 56% surge in trading volume only to reveal lackluster on-chain fundamentals. With a burn rate that has stalled and no deflationary measures, the SHIB token is more spark than fire for long term investors. Both tokens are symbols of meme culture and are held back by a lack of true innovation. Their legacy is in viral hype and speculative trading, neither of which deliver the consistent growth that today’s investors demand. What Makes Ruvi AI a Better Opportunity Ruvi AI turns the speculative crypto market on its head by providing an ecosystem for growth and utility. As the ultimate SuperApp for AI driven content, Ruvi allows users to generate text, image, audio and video content and get rewarded with $RUVI tokens. This isn’t a system built on fleeting market hype; it’s a self sustaining platform using blockchain to empower creators, businesses and developers. The Ruvi AI presale takes it to another level by offering incredible opportunities for early adopters to benefit from its tiered system. Unlike Dogecoin and Shiba Inu where ROI is dependent on market forces, Ruvi AI’s structure ensures its value grows with user engagement and ecosystem growth. VIP Tier Example: The Path to Extraordinary ROI The presale got investors attention fast and hit its first milestone just a few days after launch, raising over 100,000$ with more than 10M tokens sold. The benefits of Ruvi AI’s token system become clear when you look at its VIP bonus presale tiers. By buying 200,000 $RUVI tokens you get an 80% bonus, effectively doubling your holdings. With the presale price at $0.01, that means you can get into VIP 4 by investing $2,000. What does that mean for ROI when Ruvi AI’s utility driven token lists at $0.07? Your 200,000 tokens become 360,000 and their value is $25,200. That’s a 1160% ROI, showing the sheer potential of Ruvi compared to the uncertainty of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. For investors who won’t settle for mediocrity, the VIP 4 tier is the ultimate opportunity to maximize returns. Ruvi AI vs Meme Tokens There’s a reason Ruvi AI feels like a breath of fresh air in today’s crypto market. Where tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu collapse under the weight of speculative trading, Ruvi thrives on innovation and real world utility. Its decentralized model allows a community driven approach where token holders have governance rights and help shape its roadmap. Open to developers, contributors and content creators, Ruvi becomes more valuable the more it’s used. Meme tokens have little to offer beyond market sentiment and are especially vulnerable to price reversals, whale dumps and fading public interest. While Dogecoin waits for a bull market and Shiba Inu hopes for volume spikes, Ruvi AI is delivering immediate tangible value to its active users. A Smarter Future with Ruvi AI The crypto market is changing and so should your investment strategy. Ruvi AI is the intersection of community, utility and innovation, outperforming meme tokens in every way. Its presale mechanics offer unparalleled entry points, now is the time for forward thinking investors to get in. With a proven roadmap and built-in incentives like the VIP 4 tier, Ruvi AI isn’t just competing, it’s redefining what smart crypto investing looks like. Stop chasing speculative assets and start using an ecosystem that delivers gain potential while empowering its community to shape the future of blockchain and AI. Ruvi AI is the future of the digital economy.

The image shows the top five XRP wallets, with Uphold leading at 1.83% of the total XRP supply, followed by another large wallet holding 1.56%, identified by the community as one of the Bithumb wallets. Binance and Ripple also have several top positions, reinforcing the perception of strong institutional backing behind XRP. Top XRP Holders Revealed: Uphold, Binance, and Ripple Dominate with Billions in Reserves! Someone with unnamed hold approx 3 billion $XRP pic.twitter.com/jceBi8ryxz — Brett (@Brett_Crypto_X) April 10, 2025 Brett’s post pointed to the growing momentum surrounding XRP and emphasized how entities accumulating billions in tokens signal long-term confidence in the asset. Additionally, experts are increasingly encouraging retail investors to accumulate XRP, anticipating a pivotal role for the token in the future of finance. The concentration of such large amounts of tokens in institutional hands suggests that individual holders may have to move quickly to secure a meaningful position before broader adoption drives further demand. Institutional Dominance and the Road Ahead The image in Brett’s post revealed Uphold at the top with over 1.83 billion XRP, valued at around $3.7 billion. The second-highest wallet, now believed by the community to belong to Bithumb, holds over 1.56 billion XRP, worth approximately $3.1 billion. Binance, the largest global exchange, appears third with around $2.7 billion in holdings. Ripple controls two of the top five wallets, accounting for over 2.5 billion XRP combined. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Such heavy accumulation by institutions underscores a broader trend: increasing confidence in XRP’s future utility. Many analysts argue that XRP’s speed and low-cost transactions make it well-suited for cross-border payments and financial infrastructure, and this view appears to be supported by these major holdings. Now that Ripple is free to sell tokens to institutional investors , this adoption could rise rapidly in the coming months as regulatory clarity improves. Retail Investors May Face Pressure to Accumulate Several community responses to Brett’s post echoed a sense of urgency. One commenter remarked , “When giants are stacking billions in XRP, you don’t second guess, you accumulate.” This reflects a belief that the growing concentration of XRP in institutional wallets may limit availability for retail investors as adoption increases. Climbing the ranks of token holders has become significantly difficult . With over 3 billion XRP held collectively by the top three wallets alone, the data suggests that retail investors face an increasingly competitive landscape. One prominent XRP proponent recently stated that not holding at least 1,000 XRP is insanity . Brett and the broader XRP community message is clear: institutional interest is growing, and those who act early could benefit most.

Qubetics, Cosmos & Sonic Might Be the Smartest Picks of 2025",https://thecoinrise.com/looking-for-the-top-crypto-to-buy-qubetics-cosmos-sonic-might-be-the-smartest-picks-of-2025/,"Cosmos just gave the interoperability game a major glow-up. With the launch of Eureka on April 10, Cosmos transformed its IBC protocol from an in-house connector into a universal standard. This isn’t some copy-paste bridge job. Eureka lets Cosmos-based chains connect directly with Ethereum—natively. No clunky workarounds, no user drop-off, and no liquidity bleed. For developers building multichain apps with serious scale in mind, this is the roadmap. Cosmos isn’t just expanding; it’s redefining multichain architecture. That’s the kind of tech move that puts a token on any serious list of the top crypto to buy this year. Over on Sonic’s side, Fantom’s rebrand brought more than just a new name. Since January 2025, Sonic (S) has rolled out a full-scale upgrade focused on high-speed performance, streamlined interoperability, and revamped tokenomics with aggressive burning mechanisms. While S is still down nearly 40% for the year, large-scale trendlines show price movement hugging a key ascending support for 540+ days. That’s not noise; that’s a long-term base. Even with short-term pain, Sonic is bouncing off solid structural support—a classic recipe for those scouting the top crypto to buy on a technical reset. Now throw Qubetics into the mix—a project that isn’t patching holes but rebuilding the plumbing of digital finance from the ground up. The $TICS token powers a platform that’s solving what its predecessors fumbled: asset utility, legal compliance, and seamless interoperability. This isn’t a whitepaper dream—it’s a live infrastructure shift. And that’s exactly why Qubetics is drawing heavy attention from the smart money crowd sizing up the top crypto to buy with real-world upside. Qubetics ($TICS): Interoperability with Actual Utility Qubetics isn’t just building bridges—it’s laying down digital superhighways. The platform’s interoperability layer lets users, businesses, and entire institutions connect to multiple blockchains without friction. Whether it’s cross-border finance, data transfer, or tokenized identity flows, Qubetics runs on an architecture designed to unify ecosystems instead of fragmenting them. That matters when real-world value exchange is on the line. Qubetics’ decentralized framework makes it easy for a logistics company in Dallas to sync assets with a payment processor in Seoul, or for a freelance developer in Miami to tap into multi-chain liquidity without trusting a third-party bridge. For professionals, enterprises, and Web3-native users alike, Qubetics delivers cross-chain composability with security and compliance at the core. That’s why it’s front and center in every credible breakdown of the top crypto to buy for 2025. Qubetics Presale Snapshot & ROI Potential The Qubetics presale is currently in Stage 29. So far, more than 507 million $TICS tokens have been sold to over 24,600 holders, raising upwards of $16 million. The token price at this stage is $0.1573. Early buyers who entered at Stage 1 for $0.01 are already sitting on a 1473% gain. But it’s not too late. At $0.1573, $TICS still offers serious upside. If it hits $1, that’s a 535% return. At $5, it’s 3078%. At $6, it’s 3713%. At $10, that’s a 6256% ROI. And if $TICS reaches $15 after mainnet launch? That’s a 9434% return for current-stage buyers. It’s no stretch to say this is one of the best crypto presale opportunities going right now—and clearly a top crypto to buy before it hits major exchanges. Cosmos (ATOM): The Interoperability Blueprint The launch of Eureka marks a seismic shift for Cosmos. Until now, most multichain development relied on bridges—messy, slow, and usually centralized. With Eureka, Cosmos flipped the script by enabling true native interoperability between Ethereum and IBC-connected chains. This puts Cosmos in a whole new league. Developers can now create seamless dApps across ecosystems without liquidity fragmentation or user exit points. It turns Cosmos from an ecosystem play into a multichain nucleus. For any serious builder or backer looking for the top crypto to buy with structural potential, ATOM just got promoted. The timing couldn’t be better either. As more DeFi and NFT projects look for alternatives to slow, congested networks, Cosmos is stepping in with clean, secure, and scalable solutions. Sonic (S): Rebranded and Ready to Run Sonic (formerly Fantom) might be down 40% YTD, but don’t mistake the chart for the tech. Since its rebrand, Sonic has doubled down on infrastructure upgrades that include enhanced scalability, faster settlement, and deeply restructured tokenomics that lean on burning mechanisms to reduce supply. Sonic’s current trend suggests a wave-based correction, now entering a long-term accumulation phase. Price projections based on historical growth suggest S could climb significantly by 2026 and beyond. But the real setup? It’s technical. The asset has bounced off its ascending support line five times in 540+ days. That’s textbook base-building. For technical traders and early adopters chasing the top crypto to buy during cycle resets, Sonic is a prime candidate. The story here isn’t just a rebound. It’s a repositioning—and it could easily catch markets sleeping. Final Thoughts This isn’t about hype cycles or meme-fueled spikes. The top crypto to buy today comes down to one thing: infrastructure with purpose. Qubetics is addressing cross-chain finance with real utility and a presale that’s still hot. Cosmos is breaking multichain boundaries with native Ethereum interoperability. Sonic is laying low while building a bullish technical base. If timing is the key to crypto profits, these three names offer radically different but equally promising entries. For buyers eyeing the best 100x setups or short-term breakout cycles, this isn’t a list to scroll past. This is a lineup to act on. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs 1. Why is Qubetics considered a top crypto to buy in 2025? Qubetics offers unmatched utility through its interoperability infrastructure and is currently in a high-ROI presale stage. 2. How is Cosmos different after the Eureka upgrade? Cosmos now supports native IBC-to-Ethereum connections, eliminating bridges and boosting developer adoption. 3. What makes Sonic (S) a strong pick despite the 40% drop? Sonic’s ascending trendline and infrastructure reboot suggest long-term accumulation and bullish potential. 4. What is the current stage and price of the Qubetics presale? Stage 29 at $0.1573 per token, with 24,600+ holders and over $16 million raised. 5. Is Qubetics just for long-term holders? No. Its ongoing presale stage offers significant short-term ROI potential as well. The post Looking for the Top Crypto to Buy?

43229373,https://cryptonews.com/?p=350670,1744413543,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/43229373.jpeg,US Bitcoin Miners Prepare for Business Disruptions Due to China Tariffs,https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-miners-us-tariffs-escalate-disruption/,"Bitcoin (BTC) miners in the United States are preparing for business disruptions as the trade war between the US and China continues. On Thursday, April 9 the White House announced that the 125% import tax on China was in addition to a 20% tariff that President Trump imposed for China’s role in supplying fentanyl to the US. President Trump clarified that he has raised tariffs on Chinese goods by a total of 145% since taking office. Bitcoin Miners Face Increasing Buildout Costs While Trump’s newly enforced tariffs with China are having a major impact on the S&P 500, Bitcoin miners are also being hit hard . The US is heavily reliant on Bitcoin mining hardware produced in Southeast Asia, especially by companies like Bitmain , MicroBT, and Canaan. On April 2, Trump’s hiked tariffs also placed levies on Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia. These regions are home to some of the largest mining rig manufacturers. U.S. tariffs on Bitcoin mining machines just spiked across key manufacturing countries. China jumped from 25% to 54%. Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand went from 2% to over 20–30%. If U.S. demand drops, we could start seeing cheaper rigs show up abroad. pic.twitter.com/XQ2VlNTIij — Esprezzo (@Esprezzoapp) April 9, 2025 As a result, US-based miners that source equipment from these regions are facing business disruptions. ​​ Jaime McAvity, CEO of Cormint Data Systems – a US-based mining company – told Cryptonews that Cormint sources components from China including miners, transformers, pdus, power supplies and containers. “The tariffs will contribute to higher buildout costs,” McAvity said. “Miners that were manufactured in China are now completely uneconomical to import to the USA.” McAvity further stated that US firms that ordered equipment from China but have yet to take delivery will likely sell them in the Chinese market. “This will contribute to weaker demand and lower prices — creating an attractive investment opportunity for non-US based miners,” he said. Jill Ford, founder of Bitford Digital – a Texas-based company specializing in Bitcoin mining solutions and hosting services – told Cryptonews that the newly imposed China tariffs will hit American Bitcoin miners the hardest. According to Ford, US miners are now looking at a 22–36% increase in the cost of mining machines. “That kind of margin shift is significant – especially in an industry where efficiency is everything,” Ford said. “When US miners are forced to pay that much more per machine, it becomes incredibly difficult to remain competitive with international miners who aren’t facing the same cost pressures.” US miners face rising costs due to Trump's tariffs on China, potentially shifting $BTC mining offshore. Tariffs could increase equipment costs by 22-36%, impacting expansion plans. pic.twitter.com/NXaYkBvyNR — Alerts Via Web3 (@AlertsViaWeb3) April 9, 2025 Short-Term Disruption or Major Setback? Given this, Ford believes that the newly imposed US tariffs on China will create a major setback for the growth and global competitiveness of the American Bitcoin mining sector. For context, the American Bitcoin mining industry is an important player in the global market. The United States accounted for over 40% of the Bitcoin network’s global hashrate — the total computing power securing the Bitcoin protocol — at the end of 2024. Two US-based mining pools, Foundry USA and MARA Pool, accounted for over 38.5% of all blocks mined. According to TheMinerMag, Foundry USA grew its hashrate from 157 exahashes per second (EH/s) at the start of 2024 to roughly 280 EH/s by December. Yet with the majority of mining hardware being manufactured in China, Ford noted that US miners are looking at an added 36% cost per machine. “That kind of price hike will clearly force tough decisions. For many miners, it will no longer make economic sense to mine in the US – we can expect to see more mining operations shift overseas where equipment is more affordable and the market is healthier,” she stated. On the other hand, McAvity pointed out that as a result of the tariffs mining suppliers are in the process of onshoring production to the US – including Cormint. With this in mind, he views the tariffs with China as “a temporary business disruption.” “Since US production costs are higher than China, it will contribute to a long-term increase in costs, but it shouldn’t be too bad,” McAvity said. Echoing this, Ford remarked that it will be a smart move for US Bitcoin miners to start exploring alternatives from US-based manufacturers like Auradine, for example. “These alternatives are becoming more viable, and we’re already seeing global leaders like Whatsminer producing machines domestically. Bitmain is also planning to open a US warehouse this summer,” she said. Tariff’s Impact on Bitcoin Hashrate Higher operational costs in the US will make it less attractive for miners to expand their operations. However, miners in countries unaffected by the tariffs could gain a competitive edge. “The tariffs will likely slow hashrate growth in the US, but I don’t see them slowing global hashrate overall,” Ford said. “In fact, we’ll probably see hashrate continue to rise outside the US as mining operations shift to more cost-effective regions.” While this may be, McAvity pointed out that most miners with already installed Hashrate will likely welcome the slow growth in new Hashrate. Echoing this, Scott Offord, owner and founder of Bitcoin Mining World, told Cryptonews that the short-term effect might actually help existing miners with slightly better profitability. “Longer-term concerns about decentralization remain valid,” Offord said. “Miners should closely monitor how hashrate distribution shifts globally as a result.” US Bitcoin Miners Must Adapt or Die In addition to monitoring hashrate distribution, Ford stated that adaptability will be the key to success for US based miners. “Miners who diversify their supply chains and stay nimble will be in the best position to weather this,” she said. Shedding light on this, Offord advises Bitcoin miners dealing with tariffs to be proactive. “Secure existing in-stock inventory quickly, explore sourcing from lower-tariff countries, and prioritize partnerships with manufacturers assembling rigs in the USA. Optimize your current equipment’s lifespan and efficiency through careful maintenance and better tuning,” he said. Indeed, well-prepared Bitcoin miners will likely be impacted much less. Zach Bradford, CEO of US-based Bitcoin miner CleanSpark, told Cryptonews that CleanSpark is prepared for the tariffs, noting that the majority of the company’s miners and infrastructure required to meet near-term goals are already stateside. “While these tariffs may slow down competitors who lack our scale and resilience, we’re confident in our ability to maintain our momentum and lead the industry forward,” Bradford said.

Adding fuel to the fire, whispers of looming Trump tariffs are sending shivers down the spines of tech innovators, especially those dreaming of moonshot projects . Let’s dive into the week’s biggest tech letdowns and potential economic earthquakes, unpacked from Bitcoin World’s Equity podcast. Meta’s Llama Launch: A Damp Squib in the AI Race? Meta’s grand unveiling of its latest AI models was met with a collective ‘meh’ from the tech community. Despite being touted as the next leap in “open-ish” AI, Scout, Maverick, and Behemoth failed to ignite the expected excitement. Critics were quick to point out a distinct lack of innovation, a crucial element in today’s fiercely competitive AI race . Was this a genuine misstep, or something more calculated? The plot thickened as accusations of benchmark tampering began to surface on social media platforms like X and Reddit. Whispers of a mysterious ex-employee and discrepancies between public and private performance metrics added layers of intrigue to the Meta Llama saga. The attempt to regain the spotlight quickly devolved into a PR headache for the tech giant. Here’s a quick rundown of the key concerns surrounding Meta’s Llama release: Underwhelming Performance: Critics argue the models don’t represent a significant leap forward, especially compared to competitors. Benchmark Tampering Allegations: Rumors suggest Meta might have manipulated benchmarks to inflate the perceived performance of their models. Performance Discrepancies: Questions arise about the gap between how the models perform in controlled, private settings versus real-world, public applications. PR Backlash: The messy rollout and accusations have damaged Meta’s reputation in the AI space. Is Meta prioritizing impressive test scores over genuine, business-driving innovation? As Kirsten from Equity podcast aptly put it, “creating something to do well on a test doesn’t always translate to good business.” Trump Tariffs: A Looming Threat to Tech Innovation? Beyond the Meta Llama drama, another significant concern is the potential impact of Trump tariffs . The podcast episode delves into Trump’s renewed push for tariffs and how companies are bracing for potential economic fallout. While the specifics are still unfolding, the implications for moonshot projects and the broader tech industry are substantial. Why are tariffs a worry for innovative ventures? Increased Costs: Tariffs raise the price of imported components and materials, essential for many tech products, including AI hardware and infrastructure. Supply Chain Disruptions: Trade wars and tariffs can create uncertainty and instability in global supply chains, hindering production and innovation. Reduced Investment: Economic uncertainty due to tariffs can deter investment in long-term, high-risk projects like moonshot projects . Global Competitiveness: Tariffs can make domestic companies less competitive in the global market, especially in fast-evolving sectors like AI. For startups and companies pursuing ambitious, long-term goals, Trump tariffs represent a significant headwind. These projects often rely on global collaboration, international talent, and access to worldwide markets. Tariffs could stifle the very innovation they aim to foster. Beyond Llama and Tariffs: Other Highlights from Equity Podcast The Equity podcast episode wasn’t just about Meta Llama and Trump Tariffs . Here’s a quick peek at other fascinating topics discussed: Secretive EV Startup Backed by Bezos: Uncover the mystery surrounding Slate Auto, a Bezos-backed EV startup, and whether it’s his ‘Plan B’ in the electric vehicle space. Colossal Biosciences’ Dire Wolf Discovery: Explore the groundbreaking Dire Wolf discovery by Colossal Biosciences and question whether this breakthrough truly justifies the startup’s massive $10B+ valuation. Stay Tuned for More Insights This week’s Equity podcast episode provides a crucial snapshot of the tech world’s current anxieties and excitements. From the Meta Llama launch failing to impress to the looming threat of Trump tariffs on moonshot projects , and the intriguing developments in the EV and biotech sectors, there’s a lot to unpack.

43229650,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148832,1744414221,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Data Privacy Scrutiny: Ireland Investigates X’s Alarming Grok AI Training Tactics,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ireland-investigates-x-grok-data/,"Hold onto your data! In a move that’s sending ripples through the tech world, Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC) has launched a formal investigation into Elon Musk’s social media giant, X. The probe centers around concerns that X might be leveraging the European user data to fuel the training of its generative AI model, Grok. This development raises critical questions about data privacy and the boundaries of AI development, especially under the stringent regulations of GDPR. Why is Ireland’s DPC Investigating X Over Grok AI Training? The heart of the matter lies in how X is processing publicly accessible posts from European users. The DPC, known for its robust enforcement of GDPR , wants to determine if X has a legitimate legal basis for using this data to train its Grok AI chatbot. This investigation is not just a slap on the wrist; it’s a serious inquiry into whether X is playing by the rules when it comes to handling the personal information of its European users in the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence. Here’s a breakdown of what we know: The Trigger: The DPC initiated the investigation following concerns about X potentially using European users’ public posts for AI training purposes. GDPR at the Forefront: The investigation hinges on the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which mandates companies to have a valid legal basis for processing personal data. Powerful Regulator: Ireland’s DPC isn’t a newcomer to holding tech giants accountable. They have a track record of issuing substantial fines to major players like Microsoft, TikTok, and Meta. Past Actions: Interestingly, the DPC had already sought a court order last year to restrict X from using European user data for AI training models , indicating a pre-existing concern. What Does This Mean for Your Data Privacy? This investigation shines a spotlight on the often-murky waters of data privacy in the age of AI. Many users are unaware of how their publicly posted data might be used to train these powerful AI models. The DPC’s probe aims to clarify these practices and ensure that companies like X are transparent and compliant with regulations like GDPR when it comes to user data. Key Takeaways for Users: Awareness is Key: Be mindful that your public posts on platforms like X could potentially be used to train AI. GDPR Protection: If you are a European user, GDPR is in place to protect your data privacy rights. Regulatory Scrutiny: Regulators are actively examining how tech companies use data for AI training , signaling increased oversight in this area. The Shadow of GDPR: What Fines Could X Face? The stakes are incredibly high for X. Under GDPR , Ireland’s DPC has the authority to impose fines of up to 4% of a company’s global revenue. For a company the size of X, this could translate into billions of dollars. The precedent set by previous DPC fines against Meta, totaling nearly 3 billion euros, underscores the potential financial repercussions. This investigation serves as a stark reminder that non-compliance with GDPR can lead to significant financial penalties. Potential Implications of GDPR Fines: Aspect Details GDPR Fines Up to 4% of global revenue DPC’s Track Record History of substantial fines against tech companies Financial Impact on X Potentially billions of dollars in fines Industry-Wide Impact Sets a precedent for data privacy in AI training across the tech industry Grok AI and the Data Dilemma: How Much Data is Too Much? X’s AI venture, xAI, and its chatbot Grok are at the center of this controversy. The question arises: how much European user data is being used, and is it being done ethically and legally? While AI models require vast amounts of data for effective AI training , the source and usage of this data are under increasing scrutiny. The investigation highlights the ongoing debate about balancing innovation in AI with the fundamental rights of data privacy . The Data Question for Grok AI: Data Sources: Where exactly is Grok AI getting its training data from, specifically from European users? Opt-in vs. Opt-out: Was there clear and informed consent from users regarding the use of their data for AI training ? Transparency: Is X being transparent about its data usage practices for Grok AI? Ethical Considerations: Beyond legal compliance, are there ethical implications to using public user data for AI training models without explicit consent? Looking Ahead: The Future of Data Privacy and AI Training The Ireland DPC’s investigation into X is more than just a company-specific issue; it’s a bellwether for the future of data privacy in the age of AI. As AI models become increasingly sophisticated and data-hungry, regulatory bodies worldwide are likely to intensify their scrutiny of data handling practices. This investigation could set crucial precedents for how companies can ethically and legally utilize user data for AI training while respecting GDPR and similar data protection frameworks. The outcome will be closely watched by tech companies, regulators, and users alike, as it will shape the evolving landscape of AI development and European user data rights.

The change of gears could be attributed to the commission of the newly formed SEC Crypto Task Force, whose mandate is to harmonize securities laws for digital assets. 🚨NEW: The @SECGov and @binance have jointly asked the court to pause the case against the exchange for another 60 days. According to a recent filing, they’ve had “productive” talks, partly tied to the Crypto Task Force’s work, and say a continued pause is in everyone’s best… pic.twitter.com/0vH5MiE8wr — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) April 11, 2025 In the court documents filed to the US District Court, the lawyers of the SEC and Binance agreed to reveal “constructive communications” about the case. The parties agreed that the pause would be enough to negotiate and obtain the necessary approvals. In 2023, the SEC sued Binance for operating an unregistered clearing agency, broker, and exchange via its U.S. affiliate. The regulator also accused Binance of misusing customer assets and altering trading volumes on its U.S. platform. The recent filing reveals that more consideration has been given to how the SEC’s Crypto Task Force might bear on its case against Binance. This task force was created earlier this year to improve the regulation of the crypto industry, which has defined contemporary cases. As a response, the SEC and Binance have also contended that the continuance of the stay is in the best interest of the judicial economy. The current pause was intended to end on Monday but can be actually extended for the next 60 days if provided by the court. Binance’s legal troubles continue Binance has faced numerous legal issues since its formation in 2023. The SEC’s lawsuit accused Binance and CZ of bypassing US laws to get richer while subjecting investors to risks. In November 2023, CZ resigned from the CEO position and entered a plea before the DOJ on money laundering and money-transmitting business without a license. In the DOJ case, Binance consented to settle for more than $4 billion in fines. CZ was convicted in April 2024 and was given a four-month imprisonment but was later released in September of the same year. Binance continues to operate despite regulations and is also involved in the SEC-formed working group. Formed in February 2025, the task force aims to establish clear guidelines for digital assets. Such a broad policy can be considered an important move in shifting regulation clarification. Ripple and SEC near final settlement approval In another related development, Ripple Labs and the SEC draw closer to an end to a legal battle. Since both parties have filed cross-motions to stay their appeals pending settlement of the case, both appeals were withdrawn. This filing submitted to the U.S Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit affirms the existence of an agreement in principle. Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, publicly stated that the SEC would withdraw some components of the appeal related to the July 2023 ruling, which was beneficial for Ripple. However, the SEC must review and ratify the proposed plan. According to the legal representatives, more time would also be required for the SEC Commission to approve the resolution. After approval, the District Court would deliver an indicative ruling to complete the settlement. Market analysts have predicted approval to happen in sync with the appointment of Paul Atkins as SEC Chairman. Atkins, a nominee under the current Trump administration, received Senate approval recently and is expected to assume office shortly. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

They’ve integrated USD1, a U.S. dollar stablecoin linked to World Liberty Financial – a project connected to the family of former U.S. President Donald Trump – as a new collateral asset . This move is generating buzz and sparking conversations across the crypto community. Let’s dive into what this means for users, the market, and the future of stablecoins. What’s the Buzz About Falcon Finance and USD1 Stablecoin? For those unfamiliar, Falcon Finance is a stablecoin issuer that has been making waves in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Backed by DWF Labs, a well-known entity in the crypto investment and web3 space, Falcon Finance aims to provide robust and reliable stablecoin solutions. Now, they’re taking a bold step by adding USD1 to their list of supported collateral assets. USD1 stablecoin itself is quite interesting. It’s a U.S. dollar pegged stablecoin issued by World Liberty Financial. What makes it particularly noteworthy is its association with World Liberty Financial, a project driven by the family of Donald Trump. This connection instantly adds a layer of intrigue and, for some, perhaps even controversy, given the polarizing nature of the Trump name in global politics and finance. Why is Adding USD1 as Collateral Asset a Big Deal? So, why is Falcon Finance’s decision to include USD1 as a collateral asset significant? Let’s break down the key benefits and implications: Expanded Options for Users: Adding USD1 broadens the spectrum of assets users can leverage within the Falcon Finance ecosystem. This increased choice is always a welcome development, giving users more flexibility in managing their crypto portfolios. Potential for Increased Liquidity: Introducing a new, potentially popular stablecoin like USD1 as collateral can boost liquidity within Falcon Finance’s platform. Higher liquidity generally translates to smoother transactions and potentially better yields for users engaging in DeFi activities like lending and borrowing. Market Diversification: By supporting USD1, Falcon Finance is diversifying its collateral base. This reduces reliance on a single or limited number of assets and can contribute to a more robust and resilient platform overall. Attracting a New User Base?: The Trump family association with USD1 might attract a specific segment of users who are politically aligned or simply curious about projects linked to prominent figures. This could potentially expand Falcon Finance’s user base and market reach. Navigating the Landscape: Benefits and Challenges of USD1 Collateral While the addition of USD1 as a collateral asset presents several advantages, it’s crucial to consider both the potential benefits and challenges. Here’s a balanced perspective: Benefits: Novelty Factor: USD1’s unique background can generate media attention and user interest simply due to its connection to the Trump family. This novelty could be a powerful marketing tool and draw in curious investors. Potential for Growth: If World Liberty Financial and the USD1 stablecoin project gain traction, early integration as a collateral asset could position Falcon Finance favorably in a growing market. Ideological Alignment (for some): For individuals who are supporters of Donald Trump or his political ideologies, USD1 might represent a stablecoin that resonates with their values, potentially leading to increased adoption within this demographic. Challenges: Political Polarization: The Trump name is highly divisive. Associating with USD1 could alienate users who are politically opposed to Trump, potentially limiting the broader appeal of Falcon Finance. Regulatory Scrutiny: Projects with high-profile or politically connected figures often face increased regulatory attention. USD1 and Falcon Finance might be subject to closer examination by regulatory bodies. Reputational Risks: Any controversies or negative press associated with Donald Trump or his family could indirectly impact the reputation of USD1 and, by extension, platforms like Falcon Finance that support it. Market Volatility and Trust: Like all stablecoins, USD1 will need to maintain its peg to the U.S. dollar. Market volatility and any doubts about its reserves or operational transparency could erode trust and negatively affect its viability as collateral. USD1 Stablecoin and Falcon Finance: A Deeper Dive To better understand the implications, let’s consider some key aspects in more detail: Feature Falcon Finance USD1 Stablecoin Type Stablecoin Issuer & DeFi Platform U.S. Dollar Pegged Stablecoin Backing DWF Labs World Liberty Financial (Trump Family Linked) Function Provides stablecoin solutions, now accepts USD1 as collateral Aims to be a reliable digital representation of the U.S. dollar Significance of Collaboration Expands collateral options, potentially increases liquidity and user base Gains wider platform adoption, enhances visibility Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? So, what should crypto users and investors make of this development? Here are some actionable insights: For Falcon Finance Users: If you are already using Falcon Finance, the addition of USD1 gives you more options for collateralizing your positions. Explore how this new asset can fit into your DeFi strategies. For USD1 Holders: If you hold USD1, its inclusion as collateral on Falcon Finance increases its utility and potential use cases within the DeFi ecosystem. For DeFi Enthusiasts: Keep an eye on how USD1 performs as collateral on Falcon Finance. Monitor its liquidity, stability, and user adoption. This could be an interesting case study of how politically connected or novelty stablecoins fare in the market. Due Diligence is Key: As with any crypto investment or platform, always conduct thorough research. Understand the risks associated with both Falcon Finance and USD1 before engaging with them. Pay attention to audits, transparency reports, and community sentiment. Conclusion: A Bold Move with Potential and Questions Falcon Finance’s decision to add USD1 stablecoin as a collateral asset is undoubtedly a bold and attention-grabbing move. It introduces a unique element into the DeFi landscape – a stablecoin with direct ties to a prominent political family. While this could bring benefits like increased user interest and market diversification, it also comes with potential challenges related to political polarization, regulatory scrutiny, and reputational risks. The success of this integration will depend on various factors, including the performance and stability of USD1, the broader market response, and how effectively Falcon Finance navigates the potential challenges. It’s a development worth watching closely as it unfolds in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency and stablecoins.

43229928,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148865,1744414814,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Landmark Crypto Regulation: Pakistan Proposes Essential Compliance Framework,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/pakistan-crypto-regulation-framework/,"In a significant move for the digital asset landscape, Pakistan is stepping up its game in the cryptocurrency arena. The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has unveiled a proposed regulatory framework specifically designed for cryptocurrencies. This isn’t just another set of rules; it’s a compliance-focused approach meticulously crafted to align with the stringent guidelines set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). For anyone involved in or observing the crypto space in Pakistan, this development is essential to understand. Understanding Cryptocurrency Regulation in Pakistan The core of this initiative is the proposed cryptocurrency regulation in Pakistan . Spearheaded by the FIA, this framework is not about stifling innovation but about fostering a secure and compliant environment for digital currencies to thrive. According to reports from Cointelegraph, the primary objective is to ensure adherence to international standards, particularly those concerning terrorism financing, anti-money laundering (AML), and know-your-customer (KYC) procedures. This move signals a maturing perspective on digital assets within Pakistan, acknowledging their potential while prioritizing national security and financial integrity. Key aspects of the proposed cryptocurrency regulation in Pakistan include: Focus on FATF Compliance: The framework is built around the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force, an intergovernmental body setting global standards on money laundering and terrorist financing. Balancing Innovation and Security: FIA Director Sumera Azam emphasized that the regulations aim to strike a delicate balance. The goal is to encourage technological advancement in the digital currency sector without compromising national security. Addressing Financial Crimes: A major driver behind this regulatory push is to combat the potential misuse of cryptocurrencies for illicit activities, including money laundering and terrorism financing. Protecting Investors: By implementing KYC processes and AML measures, the framework seeks to create a safer environment for individuals and institutions engaging with cryptocurrencies in Pakistan. Why FATF Crypto Compliance is Crucial The emphasis on FATF crypto compliance is not arbitrary. FATF’s recommendations are globally recognized benchmarks for combating financial crimes. For Pakistan, adhering to these standards is particularly important for several reasons: International Recognition and Trust: Compliance with FATF guidelines enhances Pakistan’s credibility within the international financial community. It signals that the nation is serious about tackling financial crime and operating within global norms. Avoiding the Grey List: Pakistan has been under increased scrutiny from FATF in the past. Robust FATF crypto compliance measures can help prevent being placed on or remaining on the FATF grey list, which can have negative economic repercussions. Facilitating International Collaboration: A compliant framework makes it easier for Pakistan to collaborate with other nations in combating cross-border financial crimes involving cryptocurrencies. Promoting Responsible Crypto Adoption: By aligning with FATF standards, Pakistan can encourage the responsible adoption of cryptocurrencies, attracting legitimate businesses and investments while deterring illicit activities. AML and KYC: Cornerstones of Pakistan’s Crypto Framework At the heart of the proposed regulations are Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) processes. These are not new concepts in traditional finance, but their application to the crypto world in Pakistan is a critical development. Effective AML KYC Pakistan measures are designed to: AML (Anti-Money Laundering) KYC (Know Your Customer) Purpose: To prevent the use of the financial system for money laundering, which is the process of making illegally-gained proceeds appear legitimate. Purpose: To verify the identity of customers to prevent identity theft, financial fraud, money laundering, and terrorist financing. Measures: Transaction monitoring, reporting suspicious activities, record-keeping, and compliance programs. Measures: Customer identification procedures (CIP), customer due diligence (CDD), and ongoing monitoring of customer activity. Benefits in Crypto Context: Reduces the risk of cryptocurrencies being used for illicit activities, protects the integrity of the financial system. Benefits in Crypto Context: Enhances security, prevents fraud, and builds trust in the crypto ecosystem, making it safer for users. For cryptocurrency exchanges and service providers operating in Pakistan, robust AML KYC Pakistan compliance will be non-negotiable under the new framework. This will likely involve implementing systems and procedures to verify user identities, monitor transactions for suspicious patterns, and report any illicit activities to the relevant authorities. The Broader Pakistan Crypto Framework: Balancing Act Beyond AML and KYC, the overall Pakistan crypto framework aims to create a structured and balanced ecosystem. It’s not just about restrictions; it’s about providing a clear pathway for the development and adoption of digital currencies within a regulated environment. This framework is expected to address several key areas: Licensing and Registration: Establishments dealing with cryptocurrencies may need to obtain licenses and register with regulatory bodies to operate legally in Pakistan. Taxation: The framework may clarify the tax implications of cryptocurrency transactions and holdings, providing clarity for both businesses and individuals. Consumer Protection: Regulations could include measures to protect consumers from fraud, scams, and market manipulation within the crypto space. Innovation and Growth: While compliance is paramount, the framework is also expected to foster innovation by providing a clear and predictable regulatory landscape for crypto businesses to operate and grow. Navigating the Pakistan Digital Currency Policy Landscape The proposed regulatory framework is a significant step in shaping Pakistan digital currency policy . It reflects a pragmatic approach, acknowledging the global trend towards digital assets while prioritizing risk management and compliance. For stakeholders in the crypto space, including investors, businesses, and technology enthusiasts, understanding this evolving policy landscape is crucial. Actionable Insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of the latest developments in Pakistan’s cryptocurrency regulations. Follow updates from the FIA and other relevant government bodies. Prepare for Compliance: If you are operating a crypto-related business in Pakistan, start preparing for stricter AML and KYC requirements. Invest in compliance infrastructure and training. Engage with Regulators: Participate in industry consultations and dialogues with regulators to contribute to the development of effective and balanced regulations. Educate Users: Promote user education on the importance of compliance, security, and responsible crypto practices. Conclusion: A Promising Step Towards a Regulated Crypto Future Pakistan’s proposed compliance-focused regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies is a promising development. It signals a move towards a more structured and secure digital asset ecosystem. By prioritizing FATF compliance, AML, and KYC, Pakistan is taking proactive steps to mitigate risks while potentially unlocking the benefits of cryptocurrency innovation. While challenges may lie ahead in implementation and adaptation, this framework represents a significant leap forward in the evolution of Pakistan digital currency policy .

43230068,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148867,1744415111,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Unstoppable ChatGPT Dominates Global App Download Charts, Surpassing TikTok and Instagram",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/chatgpt-dominates-app-downloads/,"In a remarkable turn of events in the ever-evolving digital landscape, ChatGPT has achieved a feat that underscores its growing influence and user adoption. Forget doomscrolling on social media for a moment, because the AI chatbot that’s been on everyone’s lips (and screens) has just hit a major milestone. ChatGPT became the most downloaded app worldwide in March, dethroning the usual suspects like Instagram and TikTok from their top spots in the global app arena. Let’s dive into the details of this impressive surge and what it means for the future of AI and mobile applications. ChatGPT’s Astonishing Ascent to the Top of App Downloads March marked an unprecedented month for ChatGPT, as it soared to become the world’s most downloaded app, excluding games. This isn’t just a minor victory; it’s a seismic shift in the download charts . For the first time, ChatGPT has claimed the monthly download crown, surpassing established giants like Instagram and TikTok. This milestone is not just a testament to ChatGPT’s popularity but also highlights the increasing mainstream adoption of AI technology. Here’s a breakdown of ChatGPT’s phenomenal March performance: Record-Breaking Downloads: ChatGPT amassed a staggering 46 million new downloads in March alone. Month-over-Month Growth: Installs jumped by an impressive 28% compared to February. Chart-Topping Position: This surge propelled ChatGPT to the No. 1 position, outperforming Instagram (No. 2) and TikTok (No. 3). This data, recently reported by app intelligence provider Appfigures, paints a clear picture: ChatGPT is not just a trending topic; it’s a dominant force in the global app market. What Fueled ChatGPT’s Download Surge? While the raw numbers are impressive, it’s crucial to understand what factors contributed to this massive spike in app downloads . Several upgrades and market dynamics appear to have played a significant role: Image Generation Upgrade: March saw the first major enhancement to ChatGPT’s image generation capabilities in over a year. This update sparked viral trends, particularly the Studio Ghibli style image generation, captivating users and driving engagement. Content Moderation Adjustments: OpenAI’s decision to remove some content moderation safeguards for images likely broadened the creative possibilities and appeal of ChatGPT. AI Voice Feature Upgrade: Improvements to ChatGPT’s AI voice feature further enhanced user experience and utility. However, Appfigures suggests that these feature upgrades might not be the sole drivers of this download frenzy. The firm’s founder and CEO, Ariel Michaeli, offers a compelling perspective: “It’s starting to feel like ChatGPT is becoming a verb, a lot like how Google did in the 2000s, to the point where many don’t think ‘AI’ but rather ‘ChatGPT.” This “ChatGPT as a verb” phenomenon suggests that the chatbot’s brand recognition is becoming synonymous with AI itself. When people think of AI, or hear about exciting developments in the field, ChatGPT is often the first application that comes to mind. This brand power could be a significant factor in its download charts success. The ChatGPT Effect: Brand Recognition and AI Dominance ChatGPT’s brand recognition isn’t just a marketing buzzword; it’s a tangible advantage in the competitive landscape of AI chatbots . Michaeli’s observation highlights a crucial point: ChatGPT’s name is now so deeply ingrained in the public consciousness that it benefits from the overall excitement surrounding AI, even from the buzz generated by its competitors. Consider these points regarding ChatGPT’s brand power: First-Mover Advantage: ChatGPT gained significant traction early on, establishing itself as the go-to AI chatbot for many users. Name Recognition: The name “ChatGPT” is now widely recognized and understood, even by those less familiar with AI technology. Halo Effect: Excitement around AI in general, including competitors like Grok or Claude, often inadvertently drives users to download ChatGPT due to its dominant brand presence. This brand dominance poses a challenge for other AI chatbots . Anthropic’s Claude, for instance, reportedly faces an uphill battle in achieving comparable download numbers, not necessarily due to technological inferiority, but partly due to weaker brand recognition. Grok, backed by Elon Musk, might fare better due to Musk’s personal brand and the X platform for distribution, showcasing the power of brand association in the AI space. TikTok and Instagram: Still Major Players in the App Arena While ChatGPT stole the spotlight in March, it’s essential to acknowledge the continued dominance of Instagram and TikTok in the global app ecosystem. These platforms have consistently held top positions in download charts and remain incredibly popular worldwide. Here’s a quick look at their recent performance and influence: App Previous Ranking (Jan-Feb 2025) March 2025 Ranking Key Factors TikTok No. 1 No. 3 Earlier download surge due to potential US ban concerns; still a social media giant. Instagram No. 2 No. 2 Held No. 1 position throughout 2024; strong popularity, especially among US teens. Instagram’s consistent popularity, particularly among younger demographics in the US, is highlighted by a Piper Sandler survey, which found it to be the most-used social app among U.S. teens (87% monthly usage), surpassing TikTok (79%) and Snapchat (72%). The Broader App Download Landscape Beyond the top three, March’s download charts reflect the continued strength of social media and communication apps. Meta’s Facebook and WhatsApp rounded out the top 5, while other notable apps in the top 10 included CapCut, Telegram, Snapchat, Meta’s Threads, and Temu. Collectively, the top 10 apps garnered an impressive 339 million downloads in March, exceeding February’s 299 million, indicating a robust and growing app market. Conclusion: The Dawn of the AI App Era? ChatGPT’s ascent to the top of the global app download charts is more than just a statistical anomaly; it’s a powerful indicator of shifting user behavior and the increasing centrality of AI in our digital lives. While social media giants like Instagram and TikTok remain formidable, ChatGPT’s triumph signals a potential new era – one where AI-powered applications are not just niche tools but mainstream utilities, shaping how we interact with technology daily. The brand recognition ChatGPT has cultivated, combined with ongoing advancements in AI capabilities, positions it as a frontrunner in this evolving landscape. As AI continues to permeate various aspects of our lives, ChatGPT’s download charts success may well be a harbinger of things to come – a future where AI chatbots and similar applications play an even more prominent role in the mobile app ecosystem.

In a surprising turn, Binance Research’s latest report suggests otherwise. While traditional markets, particularly the U.S. Treasury market, grapple with heightened volatility and the looming threat of carry trade liquidations, Bitcoin appears to be showing unexpected resilience. Let’s dive into the key findings of this intriguing report and explore what it means for the future of crypto investments. Is Bitcoin Volatility Really Tamer Than We Think? For years, Bitcoin volatility has been a double-edged sword. It’s attracted adventurous investors seeking high returns, but simultaneously deterred more risk-averse institutional players. However, the narrative might be shifting. Binance Research’s report highlights that despite increased correlation with broader market trends, Bitcoin’s price swings haven’t been as dramatic as one might expect, especially when juxtaposed against the turbulence in the U.S. Treasury market. Key Takeaways from Binance Research on Bitcoin Volatility: Unexpected Stability: Bitcoin’s realized volatility is currently lower than many anticipated, considering the macroeconomic uncertainties. Treasury Market Turmoil: The U.S. Treasury market is exhibiting significant volatility, creating potential risks for carry trades. Correlation, Not Chaos: While Bitcoin’s correlation with traditional markets has increased, it hasn’t necessarily translated into amplified volatility for the cryptocurrency itself. Central Bank Lifeline?: The report suggests that potential liquidity support from global central banks could act as a buffer, providing a safety net for the crypto market. Factor Impact on Bitcoin Volatility U.S. Treasury Market Volatility Potential to increase market-wide risk sentiment, but Bitcoin’s volatility remains comparatively contained. Increased Market Correlation Leads to some influence from traditional market movements, but not necessarily heightened Bitcoin-specific volatility. Central Bank Liquidity Support Could act as a stabilizing force, potentially further reducing perceived and actual crypto volatility . Crypto Volatility vs. Traditional Market Turmoil: A Stark Contrast? The report underscores a crucial point: while the cryptocurrency market is often perceived as a hotbed of volatility, traditional financial instruments, particularly government bonds, are currently facing their own set of challenges. The U.S. Treasury market, a cornerstone of global finance, is experiencing fluctuations that are raising eyebrows and triggering concerns about broader financial stability. This situation puts the spotlight on crypto volatility in a new light. Is it possible that in certain macroeconomic climates, Bitcoin could actually represent a relatively less volatile asset compared to segments of the traditional financial system? Treasury Market Jitters: Why Should Crypto Investors Care? Why should cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors pay attention to the rumblings in the treasury market ? The answer lies in interconnectedness. Financial markets, despite their diverse asset classes, are not isolated islands. Volatility in the U.S. Treasury market, often considered a benchmark for global risk-free rates, can have ripple effects across the entire financial landscape. Here’s why it matters for crypto: Risk Sentiment: Treasury market instability can heighten overall risk aversion in the market. This can lead investors to reduce exposure to perceived ‘riskier’ assets, including cryptocurrencies. Carry Trade Liquidations: The report mentions the risk of carry trade liquidations. In simple terms, carry trades involve borrowing in a low-interest-rate currency to invest in a higher-yielding asset. Volatility in the treasury market can disrupt these strategies, potentially leading to forced selling and market downturns, impacting all asset classes, including crypto. Liquidity Concerns: Treasury market stress can sometimes signal broader liquidity issues in the financial system. Liquidity is the lifeblood of any market, and its contraction can negatively affect asset prices. Central Banks to the Rescue? Potential Liquidity Support The Binance Research report offers a glimmer of hope amidst the market uncertainty. It suggests that potential liquidity support from global central banks could provide a cushion for the cryptocurrency market. Central banks play a crucial role in maintaining financial stability. In times of market stress, they can inject liquidity into the system to prevent credit crunches and market meltdowns. How could this benefit crypto? Market Stabilization: Central bank intervention can calm market nerves and reduce overall volatility, benefiting all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Improved Liquidity: Increased liquidity in the broader financial system can trickle down to the crypto market, making trading smoother and potentially supporting price levels. Investor Confidence: Central bank support can signal a commitment to financial stability, boosting investor confidence and potentially attracting more capital to the crypto space. Navigating the Current Market Landscape: Actionable Insights So, what are the actionable takeaways for crypto investors from this Binance Research report? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on macroeconomic developments, particularly in the U.S. Treasury market and any signals from global central banks. Manage Risk: While Bitcoin volatility might be lower than expected currently, the crypto market is still inherently volatile. Ensure your portfolio risk is aligned with your risk tolerance. Diversification: Diversification remains a prudent strategy. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, even if that basket is Bitcoin. Consider diversifying across different cryptocurrencies and asset classes. Long-Term Perspective: Focus on the long-term fundamentals of the crypto market and individual projects. Short-term volatility, even if surprisingly contained, is still a factor. Conclusion: A Silver Lining in Market Uncertainty? Binance Research’s report offers a fascinating perspective on the current market dynamics. The finding that Bitcoin volatility is lower than expected, especially amidst the turbulence in the U.S. Treasury market, is noteworthy. While caution remains paramount in navigating the crypto landscape, the potential for central bank support and the relative stability of Bitcoin compared to some traditional market segments could present a powerful silver lining for crypto enthusiasts. The situation is fluid, and continuous monitoring is key, but this report certainly provides food for thought and a potentially more optimistic outlook than some might have anticipated.

This decision follows what both parties described as “productive discussions” and will provide more time for further deliberations. US SEC and Binance Agree To Pause Legal Proceedings The SEC initially sued Binance in 2023, accusing the exchange and its executives, including former CEO Changpeng Zhao, of violating federal securities laws, who is now the Strategic Advisor to Pakistan’s Crypto Council. The charges centred on Binance’s operation as an unlicensed clearing agency, broker, and exchange. Additional allegations included the commingling of funds and manipulation of trading volume on Binance.US, its U.S. affiliate. These serious claims led to the ongoing litigation, which was paused multiple times to allow the parties to negotiate and clarify their positions. Earlier this year, the SEC requested a 60-day pause in the case to allow for discussions around a new crypto task force to clarify how securities law might apply to digital assets. That pause was set to expire on April 14, 2025, but the SEC and Binance have now mutually agreed to extend it for an additional two months. Reasons for the Continued Binance SEC Pause The SEC, in its filing, explained that the discussions between both parties had focused on how the work of the newly formed crypto task force could impact the case. The task force, created to address regulatory issues in the cryptocurrency sector, may provide clearer guidance on how U.S. securities law applies to digital assets. The SEC also pointed out that additional time was needed for authorization from the Commission before making any decisions or revisions in the scope of the case. Binance, for its part, agreed that an extension of the pause was in everyone’s best interest and would help to facilitate the ongoing discussions between the two sides. “The continued pause is appropriate and in the interest of judicial economy,” the filing stated. Both the SEC and Binance have indicated that they aim to resolve the matter efficiently, without unnecessary delays or complications. Crypto Task Force’s Role in the Case The SEC’s newly established crypto task force may shape how digital asset transactions are treated under U.S. law. In a recent statement, Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda emphasized the importance of clear regulations for the cryptocurrency market and noted that the task force’s role is to create long-term solutions for regulating crypto trading. Uyeda also suggested that a “time-limited, conditional exemptive relief framework” might be appropriate to allow innovation in blockchain technology while maintaining regulatory oversight. He encouraged market participants to contribute their views on where such exemptions might be necessary to foster industry growth. The crypto task force’s efforts may influence how the SEC handles its case against Binance and its broader approach to regulating the digital asset space. The task force aims to ensure that U.S. law can adapt to the rapidly evolving technology behind cryptocurrencies while also protecting investors and ensuring market integrity. Next Steps in the Legal Proceedings With the case now paused for another 60 days, the SEC and Binance will continue their discussions and await further guidance from the crypto task force. The next update on the case’s status will come after the 60-day period. As the pause continues, like the Ripple vs SEC case , stakeholders in the cryptocurrency industry will closely monitor the outcome of the discussions, as the case could set important precedents for future regulatory actions. The SEC, as a result, has clarified that it is focused on ensuring compliance with securities laws, while Binance has stated its commitment to working within the framework of U.S. regulations.

43230341,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148882,1744415759,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking OpenAI Lawsuit: Ex-Staffers Unite Against For-Profit AI Transition,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/openai-lawsuit-non-profit-transition/,"In a dramatic turn of events shaking the foundations of the artificial intelligence world, a group of former OpenAI employees has thrown their weight behind Elon Musk’s lawsuit against the AI giant. This isn’t just another legal squabble; it’s a battle for the soul of AI, questioning whether altruistic missions can survive in the cutthroat world of tech profits. For crypto enthusiasts and investors closely watching the tech landscape, this lawsuit could signal significant shifts in how AI development and governance are perceived and regulated, potentially impacting blockchain applications and the future of decentralized AI. Why are Ex-OpenAI Staffers Taking a Stand? Twelve former OpenAI employees have formally submitted an amicus brief, essentially a ‘friend of the court’ filing, supporting Elon Musk’s claims. Their core argument? That OpenAI’s proposed shift from a non-profit ethos to a fully for-profit transition fundamentally betrays its original mission. These aren’t just disgruntled ex-employees; they are individuals who were deeply invested in OpenAI’s initial vision. Let’s break down their key concerns: Mission Betrayal: The brief argues that converting the non-profit arm’s controlling stake in OpenAI would directly violate the organization’s founding principles. Breach of Trust: They claim this restructuring would break the trust with employees, donors, and stakeholders who believed in OpenAI’s non-profit commitments. Safety Concerns: The ex-staffers worry that a for-profit OpenAI might prioritize financial gains over AI safety and responsible development. These concerns echo sentiments voiced by some of these individuals previously. Gretchen Krueger has publicly advocated for greater accountability, while Daniel Kokotajlo and William Saunders have warned against a “reckless” race for AI dominance. Carrol Wainwright has even cautioned against trusting OpenAI’s promises of future ethical conduct. Their collective action underscores the gravity of their worries. The Contentious History of OpenAI’s Structure OpenAI’s organizational structure is a bit of a maze, and understanding it is crucial to grasping the current non-profit vs. for-profit transition debate. Here’s a timeline: Year Event Significance 2015 Founded as a non-profit organization. Mission: Ensure AI benefits all humanity. 2019 Converted to a “capped-profit” model. Retained a non-profit wing with controlling stake. Present Pushing for full Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) status. Aiming for further restructuring towards a fully for-profit model. Musk’s lawsuit centers on the argument that OpenAI is abandoning its original non-profit mission. While a judge denied a preliminary injunction to halt the conversion, the case is set for a jury trial in spring 2026, indicating the legal battle is far from over. Why Does the Non-Profit Structure Matter? According to the ex-employees’ brief, the current structure, with a non-profit controlling the corporate arm, isn’t just an organizational quirk; it’s “crucial” and “critical” to OpenAI’s mission. They argue that this structure was deliberately designed to safeguard against purely financial motivations overshadowing the goal of beneficial AI. Here’s why they believe it’s so important: Mission Alignment: The non-profit governance ensures decisions are made with humanity’s benefit in mind, not just shareholder returns. Charter Commitments: OpenAI’s charter document outlines key principles for its mission, which were treated as binding commitments internally. Recruitment Tool: OpenAI used its unique governance structure to attract talent, contrasting itself with competitors like Google and Anthropic. The brief even recounts a 2020 all-hands meeting where CEO Sam Altman allegedly emphasized the “paramount” importance of non-profit governance in prioritizing safety and societal benefits over short-term profits. This highlights the perceived internal understanding that the non-profit element was fundamental to OpenAI’s identity and purpose. The Fear of a Fully For-Profit OpenAI The ex-staffers warn of a dystopian scenario if OpenAI becomes fully for-profit . They suggest this could incentivize the company to cut corners on safety and concentrate powerful AI in the hands of shareholders. A key concern is the “merge and assist” clause in OpenAI’s charter. This clause pledges OpenAI to stop competing and assist any “value-aligned, safety-conscious” project that achieves Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) first. In a purely for-profit model, the brief argues, OpenAI might have little incentive to honor this commitment. Growing Opposition to OpenAI’s Transition The ex-OpenAI employees are not alone in their opposition. Earlier this week, a coalition of organizations, including non-profits and labor groups, petitioned the California Attorney General to block OpenAI’s for-profit transition . They accuse the company of failing to protect its charitable assets and subverting its mission of safe AI. Encode, another non-profit, echoed similar concerns in a previous amicus brief. OpenAI, however, maintains that the for-profit transition will strengthen its non-profit arm, providing resources for “charitable initiatives” in healthcare, education, and science. They claim the non-profit will benefit from billions of dollars through its controlling stake. In a series of posts on X, OpenAI stated they are “getting ready to build the best-equipped nonprofit the world has ever seen.” High Stakes for OpenAI The pressure is on OpenAI to finalize its for-profit conversion by the end of this year or next. Failure to do so could jeopardize significant capital raised recently. This timeline adds urgency to the ongoing legal battles and public scrutiny. The coming months will be critical in determining the future trajectory of OpenAI and the broader landscape of AI ethics and governance.

After bouncing from recent lows, XRP is now pushing against the $1.96 resistance level — a breakout above could signal a new bull phase for the asset. As the broader market stirs back to life in Q2 , some analysts believe XRP may finally have the momentum to regain its former highs, especially if global remittance use cases begin to accelerate. The token remains a favorite for long-term holders aiming for a 2x–5x move by year’s end. ETHEREUM: ALL EYES ON SCALABILITY AND STAKING IN 2025 Ethereum remains the backbone of the decentralized ecosystem, and in April 2025 , it’s once again at the center of the conversation. With increased Layer-2 adoption and a surge in staking participation, ETH is showing renewed strength just above the critical $2,000 mark. Devs are optimistic that upcoming EIP upgrades and cross-chain integrations will push ETH back toward its all-time high. Institutional interest is also picking up, with ETH-based ETFs and DeFi staking products capturing attention. As a result, many expect Ethereum to serve as a stabilizing force in portfolios while also offering mid-term upside — potentially delivering a solid 3x–4x by Q4 2025 if conditions align. SOLANA: SURGING DEVELOPER ACTIVITY AND DAPP EXPLOSION Solana has been making serious noise in Q2 2025 , buoyed by an explosion in developer activity and new dApps launching on-chain. With transaction speeds outpacing competitors and fees staying ultra-low, SOL has re-established itself as the go-to network for high-performance applications. Traders are watching for a sustained move above $200 , which could open the doors to a parabolic run similar to 2021 . If the network maintains uptime and community growth, Solana could easily climb into the top three by market cap — and offer a potential 5x–10x window for early 2025 entrants. MAGACOIN FINANCE: THE DARK HORSE GATHERING STEAM JOIN OVER 12,500+ INVESTORS – SECURE YOUR SPOT NOW While XRP, ETH, and SOL dominate headlines, one rising star is making its way into high-level watchlists: MAGACOIN FINANCE . The project has quietly amassed a major following, with influencers, YouTubers, and Telegram communities buzzing over what some are calling the “ SHIBA of 2025 — but with structure.” Despite the wider market’s hesitancy, MAGACOIN FINANCE has already surpassed record levels in presale traction, a rare feat for a newcomer. Its multi-stage launch model, strong political meme branding, and early viral traction have analysts whispering about a possible 70x surge before the year ends. With its price at $0.0002908 some projections go even further, claiming that a $100 investment could return $10,000 — a whopping 2,900% gain — if market conditions and community hype align post-listing. The real story? MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t just a memecoin. It’s shaping up to be a movement, and savvy investors are already positioning before listings go live.

The top US crypto exchange rolled out support for Wayfinder (PROMPT) on Thursday, the same day the token launched. Wayfinder bills itself as an omni-chain tool “providing groundbreaking ways for AI to interact with blockchain environments.” The project’s whitepaper notes that it will also be used for blockchain-based games. “Wayfinder is an AI agent framework able to power blockchain-based games, with Parallel Studios’ Colony as an initial game incorporating Wayfinder’s technology, as well as provide generalized on-chain AI capabilities to both developers and non-technical users. Wayfinder’s innovations in enabling AI agents to operate within blockchain environments are achieved via the development of what is being termed ‘wayfinding paths,’ which serve as an instruction set and roadmap for AI agents. This enables them to navigate blockchain environments with the goal of attaining a unique endpoint, such as a particular DEX on XYZ chain, a decentralized marketplace, or a Web3 enabled tool.” PROMPT is down more than 27% on its first day of trading. Coinbase listed the asset with an “ experimental label ,” which the platform uses for tokens that pose certain risks, such as price swings and canceled orders because of lower trading volume and availability.

After a stretch of sideways movement and bearish pressure that left the altcoin range-bound, ADA is now displaying signs of revival. The current price action might not be explosive, but it carries the hallmarks of a market quietly building strength one step at a time. This growing momentum suggests that bulls are gradually returning to the scene with renewed confidence. While caution remains across the broader crypto landscape, ADA’s calculated pace might actually be a sign of strength rather than weakness. Instead of rushing into overbought conditions, the altcoin is laying a solid foundation that could support a more durable rally. The Calm Setup For A Calculated Climb In a recent post on X, crypto analyst Gemxbt pointed out that Cardano exhibited a bullish structure, as the price trends steadily above 5, 10, and 20-hour moving averages. This alignment of short-term moving averages typically signals sustained buying pressure and growing bullish momentum in the market. It also suggests that the bulls are maintaining control in the short term, keeping Cardano on a steady upward path. Related Reading: Cardano Price Prediction: ADA Set To Crash To $0.4 After Correction To Liquidity Zone Gemxbt’s observation reinforces that ADA’s recent price action isn’t just a temporary spike but rather a sign of strengthening technical foundations. When prices remain consistently above multiple key moving averages, it often reflects increased trader confidence and a favorable environment for further upward movement. He further noted that a key resistance level lies around the $0.62 mark, which could act as a near-term hurdle for ADA’s price advance. On the downside, solid support has formed near the $0.56 level, providing a cushion against potential pullbacks. These levels are crucial in determining the next directional move, as a break above resistance could trigger further gains, while a fall below support might signal short-term weakness. Gemxbt also highlighted that the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is currently crossing above the signal line, which suggests growing buying interest. This crossover typically marks the beginning of a momentum shift in favor of the bulls, increasing the likelihood of continued price appreciation. Potential Breakout Possibilities: What To Watch For If Cardano continues its upward trajectory and successfully breaks above the $0.68 resistance level, it could open the door to more gains. The next key levels to watch are at $0.81 and $0.90, where the price may encounter additional selling pressure. A break above these levels would push ADA toward even higher targets, such as $1.17 and $1.58. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Rockets Over 60%, Crushing Bears in a Stunning Rally! However, if ADA fails to break through the $0.68 level and retreats, the first support to monitor would be around $0.56 to $0.52, which has historically acted as a strong floor. A drop below these levels could signal a shift in market sentiment and lead to a deeper pullback.

For those deeply invested in the crypto world, especially Solana (SOL), the latest update from Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart is crucial. Are we on the verge of seeing a Solana ETF finally hit the market? Let’s dive into the details and understand what this could mean for you and the broader crypto landscape. Why is the Solana ETF Deadline of October 10th Generating Buzz? According to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, the earliest final deadline for a Solana ETF application is now set for October 10th. This date isn’t just plucked out of thin air; it represents a critical point in the regulatory process. Seyffart highlighted in a recent podcast that it’s improbable for the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) or its dedicated Crypto Task Force to reach a decision on approving a Crypto ETF of this nature before this date. This essentially sets the stage for a nail-biting wait until at least October for any definitive news. But why is this deadline so important, and what makes a Solana ETF such a hot topic? Regulatory Timelines: The SEC has specific timelines for reviewing and approving or rejecting ETF applications. October 10th represents a key milestone in this process for any potential SOL ETF . Market Anticipation: The crypto market, particularly Solana enthusiasts, are eagerly anticipating a positive decision. An approved Solana ETF could unlock significant institutional investment in SOL. Analyst Insights: James Seyffart’s statements carry weight in the ETF world, and his setting of this deadline provides a concrete timeframe for market expectations. What are the Potential Benefits of a Solana ETF? The introduction of a Solana ETF could be a monumental step for the Solana ecosystem and the broader cryptocurrency market. Let’s explore some of the key benefits: Increased Accessibility for Investors: An ETF makes investing in Solana significantly easier for retail and institutional investors. They wouldn’t need to navigate crypto exchanges, wallets, or private key management. Buying and selling SOL would be as straightforward as trading stocks through traditional brokerage accounts. Boost to Solana’s Market Capitalization: ETFs can channel substantial capital into the underlying asset. Approval of a SOL ETF could lead to a significant influx of funds into Solana, potentially driving up its price and market capitalization. Legitimization of Solana as an Asset Class: An ETF approval by the SEC would lend further legitimacy to Solana as a recognized and investable asset class. This could attract more institutional investors who are currently hesitant to invest directly in cryptocurrencies. Enhanced Liquidity: ETFs are traded on exchanges, providing high liquidity. A Solana ETF would enhance the overall liquidity of SOL, making it easier for investors to buy and sell without significantly impacting the price. Diversification Opportunities: For investors looking to diversify their portfolios, a Solana ETF offers a convenient way to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency market without directly holding SOL tokens. Challenges and Hurdles in SEC Approval for a Crypto ETF While the prospect of a Crypto ETF , especially a Solana ETF, is exciting, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges and regulatory hurdles that must be overcome. The SEC has been cautious in approving cryptocurrency-based ETFs, and for good reason. Here are some of the key challenges: Challenge Description Market Manipulation Concerns The SEC has expressed concerns about the potential for market manipulation in the cryptocurrency space, which could affect the price and stability of a Crypto ETF . Custody and Security Ensuring the secure custody of the underlying Solana assets for an ETF is a critical concern. The SEC needs to be convinced that robust and reliable custody solutions are in place. Regulatory Uncertainty The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. The SEC is navigating uncharted territory, and its approach to crypto ETFs is still being developed. Volatility of Crypto Assets Cryptocurrencies, including Solana, are known for their volatility. The SEC needs to assess how this volatility might impact the risk profile of a SOL ETF and investor protection. Defining ‘Crypto Task Force’ Role James Seyffart specifically mentioned the SEC’s Crypto Task Force. Understanding the exact role and influence of this task force in the ETF approval process is crucial but remains somewhat opaque. What Does the October 10th Deadline Mean for Your Crypto Investments? The October 10th deadline for a potential ETF Deadline is more than just a date on the calendar; it’s a potential inflection point for Solana and the crypto market. Here’s what investors should consider: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on news and updates related to Solana ETF applications and SEC announcements. Reliable sources like Bloomberg and reputable crypto news outlets are essential. Manage Expectations: While the deadline is set, SEC approval is not guaranteed. Be prepared for both positive and negative outcomes. Market volatility around this date is highly probable. Diversify Your Portfolio: Regardless of the ETF outcome, diversification remains a sound investment strategy. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, even if you are bullish on Solana. Understand Risk Tolerance: Crypto investments are inherently risky. Assess your risk tolerance and invest accordingly. ETFs can mitigate some risks associated with direct crypto ownership, but risks remain. Beyond October 10th: The Future of Solana and Crypto ETFs Whether the SEC approves a Solana ETF by October 10th or not, the trajectory of crypto ETFs is clear: they are becoming an increasingly important part of the financial landscape. The demand for regulated and accessible crypto investment products is growing, and ETFs are a natural evolution in this space. Even if this particular deadline passes without approval, the push for a Crypto ETF , including those based on Solana, will likely continue. The industry is maturing, and regulatory frameworks are slowly catching up. The October 10th deadline is a significant marker in the journey toward a Solana ETF. It represents the earliest possible date for a final decision and underscores the ongoing dialogue between the crypto industry and regulatory bodies like the SEC. While uncertainty remains, the potential benefits of a Solana ETF are undeniable, promising to broaden access, enhance legitimacy, and inject significant capital into the Solana ecosystem. Keep watching this space – the next few months could be pivotal for Solana and the future of crypto investment.

The class action lawsuit alleged BofA violated New York’s Exempt Income Protection Act (EIPA) by mishandling and charging improper fees to customers who had been slapped with court-order restraints. Specifically, the lawsuit says that BofA grouped multiple accounts together before calculating how much of the customers’ funds were legally protected, leading to more funds being frozen than allowed by law. The lawsuit also alleged BofA issued checks to debtors for the exempt amount by regular mail, meaning that the class members faced delays in accessing the money needed for daily expenses. BofA has agreed to the terms of the settlement without admitting to any wrongdoing. On top of the multi-million-dollar payout, BofA says it is permanently changing its practices, including: Stopping aggregating accounts when computing how much money is protected by law. Notifying account holders of their rights if their accounts had been restrained. Halting the practice of issuing checks for exempt funds so customers can access their money as needed via debit cards, online bank transfers and others. The settlement is subject to court approval.

Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda has voiced the need for an interim crypto rules framework. This isn’t about long-term, rigid structures, but rather a nimble, short-term approach designed to nurture blockchain innovation while the complexities of permanent crypto regulation are ironed out. Is this the breath of fresh air the crypto industry has been waiting for? Let’s dive into the details. Why an Interim Crypto Regulatory Framework? Uyeda’s suggestion, made during a roundtable discussion of the SEC’s Cryptocurrency Task Force (TFT), highlights a critical challenge: how to regulate a rapidly evolving space without stifling its growth. He pointed out the necessity to explore more efficient ways to regulate within a comprehensive federal framework. The core idea is to create a supportive environment for blockchain innovation to flourish in the short term, paving the way for more robust and well-considered crypto regulation in the future. Think of it like building a house. You need scaffolding to support the structure while the permanent walls are being constructed. This interim framework is the scaffolding for the crypto industry. Key Benefits of a Short-Term Crypto Regulatory Approach Fosters Innovation: By providing clear, albeit temporary, guidelines, businesses gain the confidence to innovate without fear of immediate, potentially restrictive, long-term regulations. This is crucial for unleashing the full potential of blockchain innovation . Flexibility and Adaptability: Interim frameworks can be more easily adjusted and updated as the crypto landscape evolves. This agility is vital in a sector known for its rapid pace of change. Reduced Uncertainty: The current regulatory uncertainty is a major hurdle for crypto businesses. A short-term framework can provide much-needed clarity and reduce anxiety, encouraging investment and growth. Inclusivity: Uyeda emphasized the need for an “inclusive federal regulatory framework.” This suggests a desire to create rules that are accessible and fair for all participants in the crypto space, not just large institutions. What Could an Interim Framework Look Like? Conditional Exemptions Uyeda specifically mentioned a “conditional exemption system” as a possible component of this interim SEC regulatory framework . What could this mean in practice? Imagine a system where certain crypto activities or projects are granted exemptions from existing securities laws, provided they meet specific conditions. These conditions could include: Transparency Requirements: Projects might need to provide clear and accessible information about their operations, tokenomics, and risks. Investor Protection Measures: Implementing safeguards to protect investors from fraud and manipulation, perhaps through disclosure requirements or limitations on investment amounts for certain types of investors. Operational Standards: Establishing basic operational standards for crypto exchanges and platforms to ensure security and reliability. Time Limits: Exemptions could be granted for a limited period, aligning with the “interim” nature of the framework, and reviewed periodically. Challenges and Considerations While the idea of an interim SEC regulatory framework is promising, there are challenges to consider: Defining “Interim”: How long is “short-term”? Clarity on the duration of the interim framework is crucial to avoid prolonged uncertainty. Balancing Innovation and Protection: Striking the right balance between fostering blockchain innovation and protecting investors will be delicate. Regulations must be robust enough to prevent harm but not so restrictive as to stifle progress. Coordination: Effective crypto regulation requires coordination among various regulatory bodies, not just the SEC. Ensuring a unified approach will be essential. Industry Input: For the framework to be truly effective and inclusive, active engagement with the crypto industry is paramount. Roundtable discussions like the one Uyeda participated in are a good starting point. The Cryptocurrency Task Force and Future Discussions The roundtable discussion where Uyeda made these remarks was the first of four scheduled meetings of the SEC’s Cryptocurrency Task Force (TFT). The focus of this initial meeting was on adjusting cryptocurrency trading regulations. This indicates that the SEC is actively engaging with the complexities of crypto regulation and seeking input from various stakeholders. The fact that the SEC is holding these discussions and considering innovative approaches like interim frameworks is a positive sign. It suggests a willingness to adapt and find pragmatic solutions to regulate the crypto space effectively without hindering its transformative potential. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on developments from the SEC and the Cryptocurrency Task Force. These discussions will directly shape the future of crypto regulation . Engage in Dialogue: If you are involved in the crypto industry, consider participating in industry forums and discussions to contribute your perspective to the regulatory conversation. Prepare for Change: Whether you are a crypto investor, developer, or business owner, be prepared for regulatory changes. An interim framework could bring both opportunities and adjustments to the way you operate. Conclusion: A Sensational Step Towards Balanced Crypto Regulation? Mark Uyeda’s suggestion of an interim crypto regulation framework is a potentially sensational development. It signals a nuanced approach from the SEC, acknowledging the need to support blockchain innovation while working towards long-term regulatory clarity. This could be a crucial step in fostering a healthy and thriving crypto ecosystem in the United States. The coming months will be critical as the SEC continues its discussions and potentially moves towards implementing this innovative regulatory strategy.

For years, Bitcoin has been touted as ‘digital gold,’ a safe haven in times of economic uncertainty. But what if this narrative is fundamentally flawed? Recent findings suggest a surprising twist: Bitcoin correlation is increasingly mirroring the movements of tech stocks , rather than acting as a true alternative to gold . Let’s dive deep into this fascinating shift and explore what it means for your crypto investments. Is Bitcoin Really Digital Gold? Unpacking the Correlation Conundrum The idea of Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ has been a cornerstone of its appeal, especially for investors seeking diversification away from traditional markets. The narrative painted a picture of Bitcoin as an uncorrelated asset, a hedge against inflation and economic downturns, much like its precious metal counterpart, gold. However, a recent report from Franklin Templeton Digital Assets throws a wrench into this long-held belief. The report highlights a critical divergence in price action, suggesting that Bitcoin’s price movements are becoming increasingly intertwined with the tech stocks , specifically the Nasdaq, rather than with gold price fluctuations. Here’s a breakdown of the key findings: Correlation with Tech Stocks Surges: The report reveals that Bitcoin’s correlation with tech-heavy indices like the Nasdaq can reach as high as 0.7. This indicates a strong positive relationship – when tech stocks rise, Bitcoin tends to follow suit, and vice versa. Weak Correlation with Gold: In stark contrast, Bitcoin’s correlation with gold rarely climbs above 0.3. This weak correlation suggests that Bitcoin and gold largely move independently of each other, challenging the ‘digital gold’ thesis. Challenging the Narrative: Franklin Templeton argues that Bitcoin’s inherent volatility, exposure to regulatory changes, and speculative nature make it fundamentally different from gold, which is traditionally seen as a store of value and a safe-haven asset. Why is Bitcoin Mimicking Tech Stocks? Delving into the Drivers So, why are we witnessing this shift in Bitcoin correlation ? Several factors are likely at play, contributing to Bitcoin’s increasing alignment with tech stocks : Risk-On Asset Perception: Despite its aspirations of being ‘digital gold,’ Bitcoin is often perceived by many investors as a risk-on asset, similar to growth stocks in the technology sector. When investor sentiment is bullish and risk appetite is high, both tech stocks and Bitcoin tend to benefit. Conversely, during periods of uncertainty or economic downturn, both may face selling pressure. Institutional Investment Flows: The growing institutional adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could be a significant factor. Many institutional investors allocate capital across various asset classes, including technology stocks and now, digital assets. Investment strategies that allocate to both tech and crypto might inadvertently contribute to correlated price movements. Technological Innovation Narrative: Bitcoin, at its core, is a technological innovation. It’s intertwined with the broader narrative of disruptive technologies and digital transformation, themes that heavily influence the tech stock market. This shared narrative can drive investor interest and potentially lead to correlated price action. Macroeconomic Factors: While the report suggests independent price movements are largely the norm, both Bitcoin and tech stocks can react to broader macroeconomic events. For instance, interest rate hikes or changes in monetary policy can impact both sectors, albeit perhaps for different reasons. Gold vs. Bitcoin: A Tale of Two Assets in Times of Global Uncertainty While the long-term correlation might be weak, it’s crucial to examine how both assets react to specific global events. The recent market activity provides a compelling example. As reported by Crypto Briefing , we observed contrasting reactions: Bitcoin’s Rebound on PPI Data: Bitcoin recently experienced a notable rebound, surging above $83,000. This surge was triggered by lower-than-expected Producer Price Index (PPI) data, which suggested easing inflationary pressures. This positive economic data boosted risk assets, including tech stocks and Bitcoin. Gold’s Record High Amid Trade Tensions: Simultaneously, gold reached a record high of $3,236. This surge was fueled by escalating U.S.-China trade tensions, highlighting gold’s traditional role as a safe-haven asset during geopolitical uncertainty. This divergence underscores a crucial point: while both assets can react to global events, their underlying drivers and investor perception remain distinct. Gold’s price surge was driven by fear and uncertainty, while Bitcoin’s rebound was linked to positive economic data and risk-on sentiment. Navigating the Crypto Investment Landscape: Actionable Insights So, what does this mean for you, the crypto investor? Understanding the Bitcoin correlation with tech stocks versus gold provides valuable insights for your crypto investment strategy: Re-evaluate Diversification Strategies: If you’re seeking true portfolio diversification and aiming to reduce correlation with traditional equity markets, relying solely on Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ might be insufficient. Consider incorporating other assets with lower correlation to both tech stocks and Bitcoin. Monitor Tech Sector Performance: Keep a close eye on the performance of the tech sector, particularly indices like the Nasdaq. Tech stock trends could offer valuable clues about potential Bitcoin price movements. Understand Risk Profiles: Acknowledge that Bitcoin, at least currently, behaves more like a risk-on tech asset than a safe-haven like gold. Adjust your risk tolerance and investment strategy accordingly. Stay Informed on Macroeconomic Factors: While correlation is important, macroeconomic events and overall market sentiment will continue to play a significant role in both Bitcoin and gold price movements. Stay informed about economic data releases, geopolitical developments, and central bank policies. The Future of Bitcoin: Beyond the ‘Digital Gold’ Narrative? The findings presented by Franklin Templeton challenge the simplistic ‘digital gold’ narrative surrounding Bitcoin. While Bitcoin may eventually evolve into a more uncorrelated asset, its current behavior suggests a stronger affinity with the technology sector. This isn’t necessarily a negative development. The tech sector is known for innovation and growth potential, and Bitcoin’s association with it could attract further investment and adoption. However, for investors seeking a true safe-haven asset and portfolio diversification, it’s crucial to understand Bitcoin’s evolving correlation dynamics. The ‘digital gold’ narrative might need to be revisited, and investment strategies should be adapted to reflect the reality of Bitcoin’s price movements in relation to both tech stocks and gold price . The world of crypto investment is constantly evolving, and staying informed and adaptable is key to navigating its complexities successfully.

Imagine the aroma of fries mixed with the electrifying buzz of crypto – a combination that might have been, but for now, remains just a thought. The National Center for Public Policy Research, a McDonald’s shareholder, put forward the idea, suggesting that embracing Bitcoin could solidify McDonald’s market leadership. But the golden arches seem to be staying grounded in tradition for now. Let’s dive into what exactly happened and what it means for corporate crypto adoption. Why a Bitcoin Proposal for McDonald’s? The core argument from the National Center for Public Policy Research was simple yet compelling: as more and more major corporations are dipping their toes (or diving headfirst) into the cryptocurrency waters, shouldn’t McDonald’s also consider adding Bitcoin investment to its financial strategy? Their proposal highlighted the growing trend of companies diversifying their balance sheets with digital assets, positioning it as a move to stay ahead of the curve and maintain a competitive edge. Think of companies like MicroStrategy or Tesla, who have made significant Bitcoin allocations. The proposal suggested McDonald’s could benefit from similar strategic diversification. Here’s a breakdown of the rationale: Following the Trend: The proposal pointed out that numerous companies are already incorporating Bitcoin into their financial reserves. Maintaining Leadership: By adopting Bitcoin, McDonald’s could be seen as innovative and forward-thinking, reinforcing its position as a market leader. Potential Financial Benefits: Bitcoin’s potential for appreciation could offer McDonald’s a new avenue for returns on their assets. Essentially, the shareholder group believed that a Bitcoin proposal was a strategic move for McDonald’s to future-proof its finances and brand image in an increasingly digital world. McDonald’s Response: No Bitcoin Discussion at Shareholder Meeting Despite the seemingly logical arguments presented in the Bitcoin proposal , McDonald’s didn’t bite. The company officially announced that this particular proposal would not be up for discussion at their upcoming May shareholder meeting. This wasn’t a simple oversight; McDonald’s actively filed documentation with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to ensure the proposal was kept off the agenda. The SEC, in turn, validated McDonald’s stance, confirming the company’s right to decide which proposals are discussed at its shareholder meetings. So, why the cold shoulder from the house of the Big Mac? Several factors might be at play: Risk Aversion: McDonald’s is a publicly traded company with a responsibility to stakeholders. Bitcoin, while having potential, is also known for its volatility. A large corporation like McDonald’s might be wary of the perceived risk associated with holding a significant amount of Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Focus on Core Business: McDonald’s primary business is fast food. Management might prefer to concentrate on core operations, expansion, and traditional financial instruments rather than venturing into the relatively new and complex world of cryptocurrency investments. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. McDonald’s, with its vast international operations, might be hesitant to engage with Bitcoin until there’s clearer and more consistent regulatory frameworks in place worldwide. The Shareholder Meeting and Corporate Governance This situation highlights interesting aspects of corporate governance and the role of the shareholder meeting . Shareholder meetings are platforms where company management and shareholders can interact, discuss company performance, and vote on important matters. Shareholders have the right to submit proposals, but not all proposals are guaranteed to be discussed or voted upon. Companies, like McDonald’s, have mechanisms and rights, often validated by regulatory bodies like the SEC, to manage the agenda of these meetings. This instance shows the balance of power between shareholders and corporate management. While shareholders can voice their opinions and suggest strategic directions, ultimately, the company’s leadership has significant control over what gets formally considered and acted upon. What Does This Mean for Corporate Bitcoin Adoption? While McDonald’s decision might seem like a setback for proponents of corporate Bitcoin adoption , it’s crucial to view it in perspective. Not every company will, or should, jump into Bitcoin immediately. McDonald’s specific business model, risk appetite, and strategic priorities differ from companies like tech firms or those in the financial sector that have been quicker to adopt Bitcoin. However, this episode does underscore several key points regarding corporate crypto strategies: Diversity in Corporate Approaches: Companies will have varied approaches to cryptocurrency. Some will be early adopters, some will be cautious observers, and others might completely avoid it. This diversity is natural and reflects different business needs and philosophies. Shareholder Influence: This case demonstrates the potential for shareholder activism in pushing for crypto adoption. While this particular proposal was rejected for discussion, it signals a growing interest among some investors in seeing corporations explore digital assets. Long-Term Trend: Despite McDonald’s current stance, the broader trend of corporate interest in cryptocurrencies is likely to continue. As the crypto market matures, regulations become clearer, and use cases expand, more companies may reconsider their position on digital assets like Bitcoin. Actionable Insights: Is Bitcoin Right for Your Business? Whether you’re a shareholder, a business owner, or simply curious about the intersection of crypto and corporations, McDonald’s situation offers some valuable insights. Thinking about corporate Bitcoin adoption for your own business or investments? Consider these points: Consideration Actionable Insight Risk Tolerance Assess your company’s risk appetite. Bitcoin is volatile. Is your business prepared for potential price swings? Strategic Alignment Does Bitcoin align with your long-term business strategy? How would it fit into your financial goals and brand image? Regulatory Landscape Stay informed about crypto regulations in your operating jurisdictions. Seek legal and financial advice to navigate compliance. Shareholder/Stakeholder Sentiment Gauge the interest and concerns of your shareholders and stakeholders regarding crypto adoption. Open communication is key. Ultimately, the decision to adopt Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency is a complex one, requiring careful consideration of various factors unique to each business. Conclusion: A Pause, Not a Full Stop on Corporate Crypto? McDonald’s decision to not discuss the Bitcoin proposal at its shareholder meeting isn’t necessarily a definitive ‘no’ to crypto forever. It’s more accurately a ‘not now.’ It reflects a cautious approach from a major corporation, prioritizing its current strategies and risk management. However, the conversation around corporate Bitcoin adoption is far from over. Shareholder interest is evident, and the broader trend towards digital assets is undeniable. While you might not be able to buy your Big Mac with Bitcoin just yet, the seeds of change are sown. Keep watching this space – the future of corporate finance and cryptocurrency is still being written, one proposal, one shareholder meeting, and one SEC filing at a time.

43231455,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148933,1744418406,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crucial AI Copyright Fight: Law Professors Support Authors Against Meta,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-copyright-meta-authors-lawsuit/,"In a significant development for the burgeoning field of AI and content creation, a group of distinguished law professors has stepped into the legal ring, siding with authors locked in a copyright dispute with tech giant Meta. This case, revolving around Meta’s Llama AI models and their training on copyrighted ebooks, could set a precedent for how intellectual property is treated in the age of artificial intelligence. For those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, where digital ownership and rights are paramount, this legal battle over AI Copyright is a crucial one to watch. Why is the Meta AI Lawsuit a Landmark Case for Copyright? The heart of the matter lies in the lawsuit, Kadrey v. Meta, where authors like Richard Kadrey, Sarah Silverman, and Ta-Nehisi Coates accuse Meta of using their ebooks to train its Llama AI models without proper authorization. The professors, in their amicus brief, argue against Meta’s defense of ‘fair use’, calling it an overreach. Let’s break down why this is so important: Challenging ‘Fair Use’ in the AI Era: Meta claims its use of copyrighted material for AI training falls under ‘fair use’. The professors argue this is a dangerous expansion of fair use, suggesting it grants AI developers unprecedented privileges compared to human creators. ‘Transformative’ Use Debate: A key aspect of fair use is whether the use is ‘transformative’. Meta argues its AI training is transformative. The professors counter that using copyrighted works to train AI is akin to educating human authors – a core purpose of the original works, thus not truly ‘transformative’. Commercial Intent and Competition: The brief highlights Meta’s for-profit nature and the potential for AI-generated content to directly compete with the original copyrighted works. This commercial aspect further weakens Meta’s fair use argument, according to the professors. Essentially, the professors are saying that if Meta’s argument succeeds, it could drastically erode copyright protections, paving the way for tech companies to freely utilize copyrighted works for commercial AI development without compensating creators. This has profound implications for all digital content creators, including those in the crypto art and NFT space. Llama AI and the Core of the Copyright Dispute Meta’s Llama AI models are at the center of this controversy. These large language models require vast amounts of data for training, and authors allege their copyrighted ebooks were part of this training data. The lawsuit claims Meta not only used these ebooks but also removed copyright management information (CMI) to conceal the alleged infringement. Judge Vince Chhabria’s decision to allow the case to proceed, despite dismissing part of it, is a victory for the authors. He acknowledged that copyright infringement is a ‘concrete injury’ and that the authors have sufficiently alleged Meta’s intentional removal of CMI. This ruling indicates that the court is taking the authors’ claims seriously and is willing to scrutinize Meta’s AI training practices under copyright law. Copyright Law in the Age of Artificial Intelligence: Navigating Uncharted Waters This case, alongside others like The New York Times v. OpenAI, underscores the urgent need to clarify Copyright Law in the age of AI. The existing legal frameworks, designed for a pre-AI world, are being tested by these new technologies. Key questions are emerging: What constitutes ‘fair use’ in AI training? Can tech companies freely use copyrighted material to train commercial AI models under the guise of fair use? Is AI-generated content a derivative work? If AI models are trained on copyrighted works, are the outputs they generate considered derivative works, thus infringing on the original copyrights? How should copyright be enforced in the AI era? Traditional copyright enforcement mechanisms may be inadequate to address the scale and nature of AI-driven copyright issues. The answers to these questions will have far-reaching consequences for innovation, creativity, and the balance of power between technology companies and content creators. The outcome of the Meta AI Lawsuit and similar cases will shape the future landscape of digital rights and responsibilities. The Concept of Fair Use : Is Meta Stretching its Boundaries? The legal doctrine of Fair Use allows for limited use of copyrighted material without permission for purposes like criticism, commentary, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. Meta argues its AI training falls under fair use, claiming it’s transformative and non-commercial in the context of model training itself. However, the professors and authors vehemently disagree. The professors’ brief argues persuasively that Meta’s use is not truly transformative because it serves a purpose similar to the original works – education and knowledge dissemination. Furthermore, they emphasize the commercial nature of Meta and the potential for AI-generated content to directly compete with the authors’ works in the marketplace. This commercial angle is a critical point of contention in the fair use debate. For the crypto community, understanding fair use in the AI context is vital. As blockchain technology increasingly intersects with AI, particularly in areas like decentralized AI and AI-driven content platforms, navigating copyright and fair use will become even more crucial. Actionable Insights and the Road Ahead The legal battles surrounding AI and copyright are just beginning. Here’s what you need to know and consider: Stay Informed: Follow cases like Kadrey v. Meta and The New York Times v. OpenAI. Their outcomes will set important precedents. Support Creators’ Rights: Advocate for fair compensation and recognition for content creators in the AI age. This is aligned with the ethos of digital ownership championed by the crypto community. Engage in the Debate: Participate in discussions about AI ethics, copyright, and the future of content creation. Your voice matters in shaping these evolving norms. Consider Legal Implications: If you are developing or using AI technologies, especially in a commercial context, be mindful of copyright laws and potential fair use limitations. Seek legal counsel to ensure compliance. The Meta AI Lawsuit is more than just a legal dispute; it’s a bellwether for the future of AI, copyright, and the rights of creators in the digital age. As AI continues to evolve and permeate various sectors, including the cryptocurrency world, understanding these legal and ethical dimensions is paramount.

Due to this reason, investors have shifted their focus towards projects that offer actual utility. Among these projects, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining a lot of attention. It is a decentralized finance protocol that is known for its growth potential and structure. Analysts predict that its price could go up to 1600% soon. Many, hence, say that it may be the most promising crypto in 2025. Currently, each token is priced at $0.025 during the 4th presale phase. This coin is still under the radar but it won’t stay there for a long time. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance provides a non-custodial and decentralized environment. Users in this ecocystem can lend and borror digital assets on-chain. The platform is supporting interest-earning deposits, and collateral based borrowing. It gives users access to liquidity while also making sure that they retain ownership of their coins. After depositing coins like USDT or Ethereum, users get mtTokens. These are a type of ERC-20 tokens that are equivalent to the deposit value. The tokens gradually provide yield to the users. And users can track these tokens in real time or use them with other DeFi platforms. As such, it gives users a lot of transparency and flexibility. Borrowers, in turn, can access funds by locking supported assets as collateral. Each asset comes with a Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio that helps manage the protocol’s stability while still offering borrowing power to users. The interest paid by borrowers flows back into the ecosystem, sustaining returns for liquidity providers. There are many reasons why Mutuum Finance is gaining attention. It is not just due to the early traction. But its token MUTM is also linked to the platform directly. It does not rely on speculation by the market. Instead, its value is actually dependent on usage and utility. Users borrow using the platform and allocate fees to purchasing MUTM from the market. The tokens get distributed to mtToken holders. This creates a cycle that allows consistent engagement and long-term holding. In other words, the system is directly linked to the value of the token. Hence, those who want to invest in projects offering utiltiy and growth may want to consider MUTM. As such, its not just another presale that makes empty promises. The project has actually laid a foundation for consistent long-term growth. Momentum around MUTM is building. The project has raised more than $6.45 million with 8000 current holders. Furthermore, the project is in the 4th presale phase and is expected to reach $0.03 after this stage. This means that the current window may be the last one before early investors will get priced out and broader market starts recognizing the coin. Looking ahead, analysts project the token could hit $0.40 or higher not long after it goes live. Based on today’s price of $0.025, that would mean a return of up to 16x. With a growing number of investors tracking the next crypto to hit $1, MUTM is increasingly being seen as a serious contender heading into 2025. A major reason for this confidence is Mutuum’s launch strategy. Unlike many presale tokens that offer no product for months post-listing, Mutuum is on track to debut its beta platform alongside the token release. This gives early supporters a clear advantage—they won’t just be holding a token, they’ll be using it in a live, functioning DeFi protocol from day one. In addition to its core lending and borrowing mechanics, Mutuum is building an overcollateralized stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. This stablecoin will be minted using assets locked in the protocol, helping expand Mutuum’s use cases and boost the total value locked (TVL) within the ecosystem. Combined with attractive APYs on deposits and flexible borrowing options, this makes MUTM appealing not just as a token, but as a platform for long-term crypto investment strategies. With a fixed token supply of 4 billion, a live product roadmap, and a clear incentive structure for users, MUTM is positioning itself as a strong choice for investors focused on real value. The project doesn’t promise overnight success — it focuses on functionality, sustainability, and organic growth. For those exploring new crypto coins before broader market rotation, Mutuum Finance is worth a closer look — especially at its current price.

The bill , spearheaded by Senate Democrats Sheldon Whitehouse and John Fetterman, is designed to tackle the environmental effects of increasing energy demand while shielding households from higher energy costs, according to Bloomberg. Key provisions of the Clean Cloud Act and industry reactions Named the Clean Cloud Act , the proposed legislation requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish an emissions performance standard for data centers and crypto mining facilities with more than 100 KW of installed IT nameplate power. The standard would be determined by regional grid emissions intensities, aiming for an 11% annual reduction in emissions. The bill also introduces penalties for surpassing the established limits, starting at $20 per ton of CO2e, with the fine increasing annually by inflation plus an additional $10. “Surging power demand from crypto miners and data centers is outpacing the growth of carbon-free electricity,” notes a minority blog post on the US Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works website. According to the post data centers, electricity usage will account for up to 12% of the US total power demand by 2028. The rapid growth of data centers is projected to generate approximately 2.5 billion metric tons of CO2 emissions globally by the end of the decade, according to research from Morgan Stanley. Matthew Sigel, VanEck’s head of research, argues that the proposed legislation targets Bitcoin miners and similar operations for their energy consumption in a “Losing ‘Blame the Server Racks’ Strategy,” as he stated in an April 11 post on X. Moreover, the law may conflict with US policy under President Donald Trump, who reversed a 2023 executive order from former President Joe Biden that set AI safety standards. Trump has also expressed his goal of making the US the “world capital” of both AI and cryptocurrency. Bitcoin miners pivot to AI data-center hosting The draft law comes as Bitcoin miners, including Galaxy, CoreScientific, and Terawulf, increasingly pivot toward supplying high-performance computing (HPC) power for AI models, VanEck said . Still, it has yet to be passed in the Senate. Bitcoin miners have struggled in 2025 as declining cryptocurrency prices weigh on business models already impacted by the Bitcoin network’s most recent halving. According to Coin Metrics, miners are “diversifying into AI data-center hosting as a way to expand revenue and repurpose existing infrastructure for high-performance computing.” According to Coin Metrics, miners’ incomes began to stabilize in the first quarter of 2025. However, the recovery could be cut short if ongoing trade wars disrupt miners’ business models. Nicholas Roberts-Huntley, CEO of Concrete & Glow Finance, noted that aggressive tariffs and retaliatory trade policies could create obstacles for node operators, validators, and other core participants in blockchain networks. He continued to say that the infrastructure supporting crypto, not just the assets, can become collateral damage in times of global uncertainty.

Coinbase made a notable case for the utility of XRP in global finance in its recent filing with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The document is part of Coinbase’s request to self-certify the listing of XRP futures contracts on its derivatives trading platform, with the launch scheduled for April 21. BREAKING: Coinbase Says #XRP Utility in ODL Makes It Attractive to Financial Institutions! pic.twitter.com/ZnX4jeAnUk — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) April 10, 2025 XRP’s Role in Financial Efficiency As part of its filing, Coinbase described XRP as a digital asset that serves a distinct purpose in streamlining international transactions. The exchange referenced the asset’s integration into Ripple’s enterprise-level payment systems. According to the filing, XRP’s use as a bridge currency within ODL enables real-time foreign exchange settlement, reducing transaction fees and processing times for cross-border remittances and corporate transfers. Experts believe XRP’s utility makes it a safe haven . Coinbase suggests that these advantages position the asset as a viable solution for financial institutions, payment processors, and remittance platforms looking to optimize settlement mechanisms. The company emphasized that these qualities have made XRP appealing to industry players seeking faster and more cost-effective alternatives to traditional banking rails. The statements suggest that Coinbase views XRP not just as a speculative instrument but as a utility-driven asset with meaningful applications in global finance. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Concerns Over Coinbase Terminology Prominent figures in the XRP community quickly responded to the details within Coinbase’s filing. WrathofKahneman (@WKahneman), a well-known community member, drew attention to the specifics of Coinbase’s language. Specifically, WrathofKahneman pointed out that Ripple had already moved away from branding its services under the “ODL” name as of 2023, having replaced it with what is now known as its Crypto Liquidity solution. While ODL is still commonly used, the filing’s continued reference to the term led some observers to speculate whether the exchange has direct insight into Ripple’s operations or if it relied on legacy information. The Future is Bright for XRP Despite the language, the filing itself is a step toward launching XRP futures trading on Coinbase’s derivatives arm, a development that many within the crypto sector see as a milestone. If approved, it would mark a significant return of XRP-related derivatives to U.S.-regulated platforms. Moreover, some within the community view this as a potential precursor to the eventual approval of XRP spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which would significantly expand investor access to the asset.

Bitcoin Dominance Rises To Major Rejection Zone,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/is-it-time-for-altcoin-season/,"Crypto analyst El Crypto has raised the possibility of an altcoin season happening soon. The analyst alluded to Bitcoin’s dominance rising to a major rejection zone, which could be bullish for altcoins. Altcoin Season May Be Imminent As Dominance Hits Major Rejection Zone In an X post, El Crypto suggested that the altcoin season may be imminent as Bitcoin’s dominance hits a major resistance zone. He revealed that BTC’s dominance again touched a zone that has led to rejection every time in the last one and a half years. He added that the Stochastic Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also in the overbought area, while a bearish cross has now happened again. Related Reading: Waiting For An Altcoin Season? Analyst Says A Weekly Close Above This Level Would Trigger A Rally Based on this, the analyst remarked that the market looks to be in for some fun, hinting at an altcoin season. Crypto analyst CryptoElites also affirmed that Bitcoin’s dominance has reached its peak. He further affirmed that next up is a massive altcoin rally, which will usher in the alt season. In another X post, the crypto analyst alluded to the USDT and USDC dominance ratio. He claimed that the market was at a critical trend reaction point right now. CryptoElites then mentioned that if the stablecoins’ dominance breaks down, then the altcoin season will officially begin. Crypto analyst Kevin Capital also looked to provide a bullish outlook towards the altcoin season. In an X post, he highlighted the global liquidity index overlaid with the Dogecoin price. In line with this, he remarked that it might be time for market participants to start paying attention to this. So far, altcoins have been mirroring Bitcoin’s price action, suffering a similar downtrend amid the trade war. However, if the altcoin season were to kick into full gear, these altcoins could easily decouple from the flagship crypto and outperform. Ethereum is known to lead this altcoin season, but that may not be the case this time, as ETH has underperformed throughout this cycle. Still Bitcoin Season For Now Blockchain Center data shows that it is still Bitcoin season for now, as the flagship crypto continues to outperform most altcoins. In the past 90 days, only seven out of the top 50 coins have outperformed the flagship crypto. These coins include Mantra, GateToken, Monero, LEO, Tron, and FastToken. Related Reading: Altcoin Season: Crypto Expert Reveals Why $425 Billion Is Important For it to be altcoin season, 75% of the top 50 coins would need to outperform Bitcoin over the last 90 days. Although almost all coins have witnessed declines within this timeframe, BTC has suffered a 22% drop, which is less than what these altcoins have seen during this period. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $80,900, down over 1% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

This initiative would allow crypto exchanges to experiment more freely in emerging sectors, including potentially offering tokenized securities. SEC mulls exemptions to let crypto exchanges tokenized securities Tokenized securities are blockchain-based versions of traditional financial instruments, such as stocks and bonds, issued as fungible digital assets. Ahead of the agency’s second-ever digital assets roundtable—this time centered on crypto trading—Republican commissioners proposed the idea of granting exemptions that could soon enable platforms like Coinbase to explore offering tokenized securities alongside their existing crypto offerings. “I encourage market participants that are developing new ways to trade securities using blockchain technology to provide input on where exemptive relief may be appropriate,” Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda said in a pre-recorded video statement. According to Uyeda, a “time-limited, conditional exemptive relief framework” could offer unregistered crypto exchanges the freedom to innovate in areas like tokenized securities before rules and laws are written on the subject. Commissioner Hester Peirce, who heads the SEC’s newly formed crypto task force, voiced support for the idea during live remarks at the agency’s Washington headquarters on Friday—advocating for the potential benefits of an exemptive relief framework tailored for crypto exchanges. She noted that participating firms could see what works and what doesn’t, technically and commercially. Peirce added such trials could inform the Commission’s rulemaking efforts. A couple of months ago, Peirce backed the idea of a “digital securities sandbox” that would have enabled U.S. crypto firms to collaborate with their British counterparts in testing new approaches to “the issuance, trading, and settlement of securities.” However, the proposal failed to gain traction with crypto-skeptical SEC Chair Gary Gensler at the helm. SEC faces pushback over sandbox proposal Other countries, including Colombia, have explored the concept of a crypto-focused regulatory sandbox. In the past, the United States has implemented similar frameworks to promote innovation in traditional finance sectors, such as loan underwriting. However, allowing crypto exchanges, which are not currently regulated by the SEC, to venture into trading tokenized stocks and bonds—if even temporarily—might not be without its risks. The SEC’s only remaining Democratic commissioner, Caroline Crenshaw, seemed to reference these concerns during her remarks on Friday. She noted that crypto exchanges pose unique risks because they already “perform multiple services under one roof,” whereas regulated securities exchanges spread those functions across separate entities to mitigate risk. Crenshaw warned that, beyond the impact on individual investors, these persistent risks could disrupt the orderly functioning of crypto markets and pose broader threats to the banking system and traditional financial infrastructure.

The decline began early on April 11 , with ETH losing momentum after testing resistance at around $1,637 . Despite brief midday stabilization, bearish pressure continued to dominate, dragging the price to a new short-term low. This move comes as the crypto market enters a period of uncertainty in Q2 , with major tokens facing headwinds from macroeconomic shifts and investor caution.

At its current presale price of $0.1573, early buyers are eyeing potential returns of up to 9,435% if $TICS hits $15. That’s why developers across South America—who’ve seen how legacy rails fail—are now aligning with Qubetics. It’s not hype. It’s momentum, with measurable progress. This isn’t just the best crypto for quick profit —it’s a movement. What Early Backers Could Gain From Qubetics: ROI Scenarios That Speak for Themselves The current presale price of Qubetics ($TICS) stands at $0.1573—and this stage won’t last forever. For those eyeing a position before the next stage increase, the math is both clear and compelling. With projected ROI percentages already mapped out up to a $15 valuation, even modest entries could lead to jaw-dropping returns. Here’s how different allocations would shape up if $TICS hits that future $15 milestone. A $100 entry today would secure approximately 635 $TICS, which could turn into $1,500 to $9,525, depending on the token’s future valuation. With $200, you’re looking at 1,270 $TICS, putting your future potential between $3,000 and $19,050. Polygon (MATIC) – Whale Moves and a $1B Ecosystem Revival Polygon might’ve flown under the radar in Q1, but the signals from Q4 2024 flipped the entire narrative. Within just 48 hours, whales stacked over 59 million MATIC tokens—a move that screamed long-term conviction. Why? Because Polygon isn’t just a sidechain anymore. With massive scaling solutions like zkEVM in play, the protocol’s becoming a serious contender for enterprise-grade dApps, especially in regions with high traffic but limited on-chain bandwidth. By the end of 2024, Polygon’s Total Value Locked (TVL) surged past $1 billion, indicating a real spike in utility and builder activity. Add the bullish breakout above the 200-day EMA, and Polygon is firmly back in conversation for high-impact use cases. While some coins are floating on sentiment, Polygon’s rise is backed by utility that appeals to devs and validators alike. That blend of tech depth and market traction makes MATIC a strong mention among the best crypto for quick profit this quarter. But here’s where it gets even better for the South American tech crowd: With gas fees optimized, cross-chain connectivity, and growing validator support, Polygon is now the smart builder’s pick for scalable deployment. It’s real, it’s live, and it’s earning traction in ways that can’t be ignored. Sonic (SONIC) – Layer-1 Just Got Lightning Fast In December 2024, Sonic Labs officially flipped the switch on its Layer-1 mainnet—and it hasn’t looked back since. Built from the ground up for high-speed, modular smart contracts, Sonic’s launch marked a new chapter for real-time Web3 applications. Just one month later, on January 7, 2025, the SONIC token officially debuted. But what turned heads wasn’t just the token—it was the tokenomics. 57% of SONIC’s total supply is now flowing straight to community-focused initiatives. That’s more than a statement—it’s a structural commitment to decentralization. In February 2025, BitMEX greenlit SONIC, making it tradable and accessible. And to scale secure distribution? Sonic Labs struck a strategic partnership with Sentio to deliver 190 million native tokens, streamlining staking and strengthening on-chain trust. With SONIC trading at $0.23 and rising by 14.09% today, it’s capturing attention fast. But what really makes Sonic one of the best crypto for quick profit candidates is the sheer agility of its ecosystem. It’s fast, open, and riding high on developer adoption. South American projects needing real-time settlements and low-latency deployments are finding Sonic’s new chain too good to pass up. Why These Three Are Dominating April’s Top Crypto Picks Polygon has scale and whale traction. Sonic has speed and fresh community energy. But Qubetics? It has the full picture. Real utility, developer tools, fiat integration, and a working asset tokenization platform—all wrapped inside a red-hot crypto presale. So, what’s the common thread here? Simplicity, speed, and sovereignty. That’s the trifecta modern blockchain adopters crave. These coins aren’t riding the hype train—they’re laying down real tech that supports real change. And with the market heating up across Latin America, from Salvadoran remittance corridors to Chilean DeFi hubs, these three cryptos are locked in as the best crypto for quick profit this April. Smart early buyers know timing matters. But so does tech. And right now, to join the best crypto presale before the next price stage kicks in? That’s not a gamble. That’s strategic entry.

Qubetics ($TICS), Polygon (MATIC), and Sonic (SONIC) are leading April 2025’s charts due to real-world use cases, presale momentum, and rapid blockchain innovation. Why is Qubetics considered a top pick for crypto gains? Because of its Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace, $16M+ raised, 24,600+ token holders, and ROI potential based on its current presale stage. What makes Sonic unique among new Layer-1 projects? Sonic’s modular Layer-1 mainnet, community-first tokenomics, and its 14% daily surge make it a serious contender for fast-deploying Web3 developers.

He flagged state-by-state regulation of crypto trading as a concern, warning it could lead to a “patchwork of state licensing regimes.” Uyeda said that a favorable federal regulatory framework would ease the burden for market participants wishing to offer tokenized securities and non-security crypto assets, allowing them to operate under a single SEC license instead of navigating “fifty different state licenses.” He urged crypto market participants to share feedback on areas where “exemptive relief” could be appropriate. Source: US Securities and Exchange Commission Uyeda also reiterated the benefits of blockchain technology in financial markets during the roundtable discussion. “Blockchain technology offers the potential to execute and clear securities transactions in ways that may be more efficient and reliable than current processes,” Uyeda said.

The report investigated whether former SEC official William Hinman had a conflict of interest when he said Ethereum was not a security. At the time, Hinman was still getting payments from his former law firm, which was linked to Ethereum. William Hinman in Ethereum-related decisions In May 2022, Empower Oversight asked the OIG to investigate Hinman’s financial relationship with his former law firm, Simpson Thacher, which represented Ethereum, a major cryptocurrency participant. In a speech in 2018, Hinman had stated that Ethereum was not a security. The answer was no. The key point was that he was still being paid by Simpson Thacher at the time. The report also noted that properly disclosed his monetary relationships, and did not personally enrich himself. However, Empower Oversight was not satisfied. They argued that the probe was too limited, as it sidestepped broader questions about how the SEC handles conflicts of interest in general and how it decides which crypto companies to target. “ By narrowly focusing on whether criminal charges should be brought against Hinman, the SEC OIG completely missed the bigger issue here—an erosion of public trust in the agency due to inadequate transparency and an undeniable lack of faith in the integrity of its cryptocurrency enforcement decisions, ” Foster said. The OIG’s December 9, 2024, report answered one very narrow question: had Hinman violated any criminal conflict-of-interest law? The response was no. He reported they had to struggle to publish fundamentals.

The data, which spans from late 2013 through 2025, highlights multiple instances in which XRP went through a protracted bear market before staging an explosive rally. Two particular examples stand out in Egrag’s assessment: the 2017 surge in which XRP rose over 2,700% from its pre-rally price levels, and the 2021 run-up that saw the asset climb by more than 1,000%. Egrag Predicts XRP Surge To $19–$45 The chart reveals a consistent framework that relies on the interplay between the 21-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the 33-week Simple Moving Average (MA). These moving averages are shown crossing during bearish cycles and then eventually curving upward, implying the formation of a bottom. Related Reading: 62.8% Of XRP Realized Cap Held By New Investors: Sign Of Fragility? Historically, XRP’s final bullish legs—often culminating in “blow-off tops”—began once the price retook the 21 EMA and the 33 MA, with the 777-day (and in one instance, 770-day) window before those bullish crosses recurring as a noteworthy time cycle. “Men lie, women lie, but charts don’t,” says Egrag. “I’m not improvising here; I’m relying on historical data to present future predictions. Will it rhyme exactly? No, because if it were that easy, everyone would be a multimillionaire!” According to the chart, XRP has already mirrored some of the patterns seen in 2017 and 2021, a parallel that leads Egrag to posit two potential price targets if the token completes another blow-off top scenario. While he acknowledges various complicating factors, the analyst believes XRP could rally as much as 2,700%—taking the asset to approximately $45—or, in a more moderate iteration, 1,050% to just below $20. “Now, here’s my measured move: if #XRP mimics either of these cycles, we could see price movements of 2,700% or 1,050%, putting XRP around $45 or $19!” he notes, referencing the previous explosive expansions. Egrag cites past cycles to support these targets, pointing to how XRP found support at the 21 EMA in 2017 just before launching into its last blow-off phase. In 2021, the coin rallied once it decisively broke above both the 21 EMA and 33 MA. Related Reading: XRP Primed for a Comeback as Key Technical Signal Hints at Explosive Move To underscore the method behind using both indicators, Egrag adds that “market makers use the same moving averages to see where support and resistance are and act against us. So I am using different moving averages—one is fast (exponential) and one is simple—to understand price action better.” He emphasizes these signals are lagging indicators but can still confirm whether market sentiment is shifting from bearish to bullish. Notably, Egrag’s personal long-standing target for XRP has been $27. He underlines that nothing is guaranteed, especially in a market characterized by what he calls “human reactions and behaviors.” Quoting a line from the film Margin Call, he explains, “You cannot control it, stop it, or slow it, or even slightly alter it…you have to just react. Make a lot of money if you get it right, or you’ll be left by the side of the road if you get it wrong.” Yet he notes that it is wise to strategize selling—or “DCA (Dollar-Sell-Average)—if circumstances call for it, to mitigate risk. At press time, XRP traded at $2.00.

On-chain data shows that Punk #3100 changed hands for 4,000 ETH, translating to approximately $6.07 million via a private transaction on the official CryptoPunks marketplace. The NFT is one of just nine Alien Punks in the original 10,000-piece CryptoPunks collection created by Larva Labs in 2017. Recognized for its distinctive blue skin and bandana, the Alien Punk is part of the most sought-after group in the NFT space. The $10M Loss Blockchain data from Arkham Intelligence shows that this particular NFT previously sold in March of last year for 4,500 ETH, then valued at more than $16 million. The sale ranks as the third most expensive single NFT transaction by dollar value. Just days after that transaction, Punk #7804 exchanged for 4,850 ETH worth roughly $16.42 million at the time, marking the second-largest deal in the collection’s history. However, due to Ethereum’s price drop over the past year, Thursday’s 4,000 ETH sale amounted to just over $6 million, resulting in the seller making a $10 million loss from the transaction. While the parties in the exchange remain unidentified, Etherscan records show that the purchasing wallet received 4,001 ETH from an account labeled “Coinbase Prime 2” shortly before the sale. Alien CryptoPunks continue to dominate the top end of the NFT market. They are the rarest type in the collection, even more than the 88 Zombie Punks or the 24 Ape Punks. The top seven of the highest-value on-chain CryptoPunk sales involve these variants. CryptoPunks Hit by Market Downturn Despite their status, CryptoPunks have not been immune to the broader downturn in the NFT market. Data from NFT Price Floor shows that their asking price has dropped nearly 43% in the last three months, currently sitting at $71,031. This figure marks a notable decline from the collection’s peak in November 2021, when the figure exceeded $400,000. Originally offered for free in 2017, the digital assets have evolved into cultural symbols of the early NFT era. In 2022, the intellectual property rights were acquired by Yuga Labs, creator of the Bored Ape Yacht Club. Earlier this year, speculation swirled about a possible sale of the product’s IP. However, Yuga Labs co-founder Greg Solano dismissed the rumors, stating that while many parties had approached the company, there were no plans to divest any time soon.

While XRP , Solana (SOL) , and Bitcoin (BTC) are strong contenders for consistent growth, those aiming for outsized results are looking toward MAGACOINFINANCE —the early-stage crypto that’s built for this kind of leap. Current Market Performance (BTC, SOL, XRP, MAGACOINFINANCE) Bitcoin (BTC) trades at $81,812 , Solana (SOL) at $182 , and XRP at $1.99 —all showing long-term strength.

XRP is rising on regulatory clarity and growing liquidity. Solana (SOL) dominates tokenized assets and is leading Web3 real-world use. All three are solid bets—but may not deliver 10,000% from current levels. Worth Watching Too: ADA, XLM, AVAX Cardano (ADA) at $0.68 is seeing quiet L1 activity pick up. Stellar (XLM) at $0.17 is regaining attention in global remittance use. Avalanche (AVAX) at $49.20 leads subnet expansion and gaming adoption. They’re solid—but MAGACOINFINANCE is built for the kind of return $100 investors dream about. Conclusion As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, both established and emerging digital assets present unique opportunities. While Bitcoin (BTC) , Ripple (XRP) , and Solana (SOL) pursue growth strategies, MAGACOINFINANCE distinguishes itself with its innovative approach and attractive pre-sale incentives.

Bitcoin Wallets With 10+ Tokens Have Seen Their Count Go Up Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has discussed about how the trend in the Supply Distribution has looked for the cryptocurrency’s key holders. The “Supply Distribution” here is an indicator that measures, among other things, the number of wallets that belong to a particular group. The investors or addresses are divided into these cohorts based on the number of tokens that they are holding in their balance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance: BTC’s MVRV Outpaces ETH’s For Record 812 Days The 1 to 10 coins group, for instance, includes all investors who own between 1 and 10 tokens. In the context of the current topic, the coin range of interest is the 10+ coins one (with the upper limit being infinity). At the current exchange rate, the cutoff for this range converts to around $821,000, so the only investors who would be able to qualify for it would be the large ones. Two key cohorts in particular fall in this range: the sharks and whales. The influence of any entity in the market goes up the more coins that they hold, so the sharks and whales with their sizeable holdings can occupy an important spot in the ecosystem. As such, the trends related to them can be worth keeping an eye on. The Supply Distribution allows for one such way to track these investors. Below is the chart for the indicator shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in its value over the last few months: As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin Supply Distribution for the 10+ coins range was following a slight overall downtrend during the last few weeks, but in the past day, the metric’s value has seen a turnaround. This suggests that the sharks and whales are now growing in number again. The reversal in the population of these large entities has come as US President Donald Trump has announced a 90-day pause on the tariffs for most countries. The tariffs had earlier unleashed FUD on the market, leading to a crash for BTC and other digital assets. With the news of the pause, however, the coins have shown a rebound. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breakout Above This Level Could Set Stage For $208,550 Top, Analyst Says During the jump, wallets with 10+ coins have gone up by 132, which is the largest jump since February 20th. The analytics firm notes that this indicates “a higher level of confidence from crypto’s key stakeholders.” It now remains to be seen whether the big-money investors would continue to buy into Bitcoin in the coming days or not. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $82,100, down around 1% in the last week.

Garlinghouse Eyes Long-Term Crypto Growth Claman pointed out that Bitcoin, which surged to a high of $107,000 after the election, has since dropped to around $86,000. She asked Garlinghouse about the market’s future and where he sees prices heading, especially amid wildly different predictions — from $250,000 per Bitcoin to much lower forecasts. Garlinghouse opened up about the importance of taking a long-term perspective. “I don’t think about it in short-term timeframes. I think about the macro trends in crypto and the XRP ecosystem,” he said. “XRP has been the best-performing major crypto over the last 90 days. We’re focused on where the industry will be in three years, not the next six months.” Ripple Makes Bold $1.25B Acquisition He also discussed Ripple’s recent $1.25 billion acquisition of Prime Broker Hidden Road — the largest in the company’s history and reportedly the biggest in the crypto industry to date. Garlinghouse said that such a move wouldn’t have been possible a year ago due to what he described as a “coordinated attack” on the industry by the U.S. government, including restrictive IRS rules and banking regulations that discouraged crypto adoption. Great interview by @LizClaman of @bgarlinghouse . Liz asks Brad, if he would’ve made the $1.25 billion acquisition of Prime Broker Hidden Road one year ago? Great question!

Mark Uyeda opens the event Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda presided over the session, joined by Commissioners Hester Peirce and Caroline Crenshaw. The conference was called “Between a Block and a Hard Place” and brought together the most important players from both the traditional and crypto finance world to achieve practical solutions for making blockchain technology a part of the current markets. Nicholas Losurdo serves as moderator The panel members were representative of a broad spectrum of institutions. Nicholas Losurdo, a partner at Goodwin Procter LLP, was the roundtable moderator. Gregory Tusar, Coinbase’s Vice President of Institutional Product, provided perspective from one of the largest US crypto exchanges. Tyler Gellasch emphasizes crypto broker registration Tyler Gellasch, President and CEO of Healthy Markets Association, made a strong point about crypto brokers registering with regulators so that there is transparency and improved oversight of the markets. He also made the point that brokers should know whom they are dealing with, instead of just encrypted information. Jon Herrick, New York Stock Exchange Chief Product Officer, discussed the effect of ETF approvals, indicating that they have simplified investor entry into digital assets through known and regulated pathways. He further noted that ETFs potentially enable traditional financial institutions to utilize digital assets in new ways, most notably as collateral. Dave Lauer supports transparency and fair markets Richard Johnson, founder and CEO of Texture Capital, and Dave Lauer, co-founder of Urvin Finance and We the Investors, both commented on how markets might evolve to facilitate tokenized assets. Katherine Minarik gives a DeFi legal view Chief Legal Officer of Uniswap Labs Katherine Minarik represented the DeFi industry and the ways decentralized platforms are structured differently than traditional exchanges. Christine Parlour, Finance and Accounting Chair at UC Berkeley, offered academic perspectives on structural changes required to enable regulation to be more effective. Chelsea Pizzola, Associate General Counsel at Cumberland DRW, and Austin Reid, FalconX Global Head of Revenue and Business, added their legal and institutional trading industry perspectives in the crypto sector. Hester Peirce reflects on learnings from the first roundtable Hester Peirce, a Commissioner of the SEC, said that she found the initial roundtable useful in informing her opinion on when crypto assets would be subject to securities laws. She hoped this roundtable would be as fruitful, pointing to the diversity of participants—from national securities exchanges and alternative trading systems to crypto-native companies. Richard Gabbert, the head of the Crypto Task Force, was supposed to emphasize the importance of investor-centric regulation. The conversation pointed out that existing federal regulations were not written with blockchain and decentralized finance in mind, resulting in mismatches between how crypto markets operate and how they are regulated. The roundtable also discussed the age-old problem of state-by-state licensing under which crypto exchanges such as Coinbase have to get licensed in all 50 states. Many in the industry are advocating for one SEC license with which they can operate nationwide, which would ease compliance and make operating less cumbersome. Panelists explained how current rules such as the order protection rule or prohibitions on listing unregistered securities cause issues when attempting to bring tokenized securities into traditional markets. They also recognized that crypto platforms tend to be different, having custody, clearing, and execution all on the same platform, as opposed to the distinct systems in traditional finance. In spite of these difficulties, there was a general optimism about the potential of blockchain to transform the way markets operate. From 24/7 trading through smart contracts to enhancing collateral management and settlement of transactions, the roundtable demonstrated that most industry leaders view blockchain as a means to make financial systems more efficient. The SEC is weighing whether to grant temporary exemptions to spur innovation while longer term rules are being formulated. In total, the roundtable emphasized that regulators and market participants must work together to develop a framework that benefits both innovation and investor protection.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-12 04:47:21

Lower Than You Think,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/bitcoin-maxi-takes-aim-ethereums-true-value-lower-than-you-think/,"Bitcoin maximalist Samson Mow has doubled up on his value criticism of Ethereum’s price, asserting ETH is still overvalued despite Bitcoin’s price almost quadrupling since 2022. The JAN3 CEO referred to the glaring disparity in performance between the two top cryptocurrencies over a near three-year span. Related Reading: XRP ETF Launch Impresses Even In Bear Market, Says Analyst Price Gap Grows As Bitcoin Rises According to data, Ethereum now sits at $1,558, essentially the same as its August 2022 price of $1,600. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has climbed from $21,500 to $82,302 – an eye-popping 270% rise. The widening gap has only served to bolster Mow’s contention that Ethereum’s price does not correlate with its fundamentals. Mow re-tweeted his August 23, 2022 post this week to emphasize his steadfast stance. His criticism focuses on supply variations between the cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has less than 21 million overall coins, while Ethereum boasts 122 million circulating tokens. #Ethereum is overvalued. 1 BTC = $21.5k 1 ETH = $1.6k 21M BTC supply (actually less) 122M ETH supply (72M premined) Adjusted for unit bias (ETH price at 21M units) one ETH would be $9.3k. So some people are paying $9.3k per unit of something that’s 60% printed from thin air. — Samson Mow (@Excellion) August 23, 2022 ‘60% Minted Out Of Thin Air’ Claim Targets Ethereum’s Origins Based on Mow’s quotations, about 72 million ETH tokens (approximately 60% of the supply) were premined at the time of Ethereum’s launch. Token creation before the start of public mining has been quite an issue for purists in cryptocurrency for some time. Possibly, the Bitcoin maximalist suggested that if 21 million coins were all there would be in supply for Ethereum like in Bitcoin, then each ETH would be valued today at around $9,300. Mow is again targeting investors in Ethereum, saying they are paying too much for an asset whose supply is exaggerated. Sensitive To Macroeconomic Forces Ethereum recently fell to a multi-year low of $1,380 on the back of global tariff trade war tensions. The cryptocurrency bounced back immediately to $1,680 on April 9 after US President Donald Trump declared a three-month tariff tariff hike pause on various countries, with China being the exception. These movements illustrate how both cryptocurrencies are still sensitive to macroeconomic forces even as they have different value propositions and market performances. Ether down in the last week. Source: Coingecko Related Reading: From Joke To Juggernaut: Dogecoin Value Revolution Gets Nod From Global Asset Giant Long-Standing Campaign Against Ethereum Continues This is not Mow’s first time criticizing Ethereum. He has been vocal against ETH for years. In November 2024, he cautioned investors that the fate of Ethereum could be the same as their favorite tokens. Mow, who forecasts Bitcoin to hit $1 million this year, has told investors to sell everything, including Ethereum, and invest in Bitcoin instead. The debate underscores deep-seated differences in cryptocurrency investment philosophies. While Bitcoin maximalists such as Mow focus on scarcity and Bitcoin’s “digital gold” status, Ethereum supporters highlight the platform’s smart contract abilities and wider applications ecosystem. As the price differential between the two leading cryptocurrencies continues to expand, these debates regarding relative value and suitable pricing models draw greater interest from investors and market analysts in common.

Sun’s X post came just hours after speculation grew over an April 11 Wall Street Journal report , which alleged that Zhao agreed to provide evidence on Sun as part of his plea deal, citing sources familiar with the matter.

The report added, “that arrangement hasn’t previously been reported.” Zhao hasn’t publicly addressed the reports at the time of publication, but the day before, he warned his 10 million X followers that he had been told a “baseless hit piece” about him was being written. Sun commended Zhao’s integrity and said that the DoJ is one of T3 Financial Crime Unit’s (T3 FCU) — which Tron co-founded along with Tether and TRM Labs — “closest and most trusted partners.” “To this day, his conduct and principles remain the highest standard I strive to follow as a founder,” Sun said of Zhao. Sun added: “Whether it’s CZ or our partners at the DOJ, we maintain direct, honest communication at all times.

CZ is both my mentor and a close friend—he has played a crucial role in supporting me during my entrepreneurial journey. To this day, his conduct and principles remain the highest standard I strive to follow as a founder. At the same… — H.E. Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) April 12, 2025 However, Justin Sun, in response, called the allegations “baseless” and publicly defended CZ, calling him both a mentor and a close friend. He stressed that Tron maintains honest and direct communication with the DOJ and praised President Trump’s crypto leadership , expressing confidence in the U.S. market. Binance Eyes U.S. Comeback The backdrop to this controversy is Binance’s renewed effort to rebuild its U.S. standing. The company’s leadership, including CEO Richard Teng, recently met with Treasury officials to push to reduce or eliminate the independent monitor currently overseeing its anti-money-laundering controls. That monitor was part of a $4.3 billion settlement following Binance’s 2023 guilty plea for allowing illicit financial activity on its platform. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Binance Lawsuit Paused 60 Days as SEC Focuses on New Crypto Task Force , Reports also suggest that Binance is aligning itself with Trump-linked ventures, specifically World Liberty Financial’s USD1 stablecoin , heavily backed by Justin Sun and the Trump family. A listing of the token on Binance could generate major profits while potentially opening the door for CZ’s pardon under a new administration. The Bigger Picture As U.S. crypto enforcement shifts under Trump-era changes, including the pause of DOJ monitorships, Binance appears to be positioning itself for a strategic return. CZ, despite serving a brief prison term, remains a central figure in the company’s vision for revival. While he denies ties to World Liberty Financial, insiders say CZ’s long-standing connections may play a key role in Binance’s next chapter. With power players like Justin Sun, the Trump family, and the DOJ interests all converging, CZ’s future and Binance’s U.S. comeback hangs in the balance. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In one such move, the ongoing legal battle between the U.S. SEC and Binance has been officially paused for another 60 days. This move comes after what both sides have described as “productive discussions,” with the focus now shifting to how the SEC’s newly established crypto task force could impact the outcome of the case and the broader digital asset industry. NEW: The @SECGov and @binance have jointly asked the court to pause the case against the exchange for another 60 days. According to a recent filing, they’ve had “productive” talks, partly tied to the Crypto Task Force’s work, and say a continued pause is in everyone’s best… pic.twitter.com/0vH5MiE8wr — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) April 11, 2025 A Long-Running Legal Dispute In an X post, Fox Journalist Eleanor Terrett shared that the SEC and Binance have jointly requested another 60-day pause. Both parties believe the pause serves everyone’s best interest, with the next update expected after the 60 days. The SEC filed a lawsuit against Binance in 2023 , accusing the crypto exchange and its then-CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), of operating as an unregistered clearing agency, broker, and exchange. Additional allegations included fund commingling and manipulation of trading volumes on Binance US. Since then, the case has seen several pauses to allow time for negotiation and regulatory discussions. Earlier this year, the SEC requested a 60-day pause to give room for conversations related to the crypto task force’s impact on how digital assets should be regulated under securities law. That pause was supposed to end on April 14, 2025, but both parties have now asked the court to extend it through mid-June. Focus Shifts to Crypto Task Force The SEC’s crypto task force is expected to play a key role in shaping future regulations for the industry. According to the SEC’s latest filing, discussions with Binance have revolved around how the task force’s findings may affect the case. There’s a growing hope that the task force could provide clearer guidelines on applying existing securities laws to crypto transactions. Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda has emphasized that the task force aims to strike a balance between fostering blockchain innovation and maintaining investor protection. He also hinted at the possibility of introducing conditional exemptions to support industry growth while still enforcing compliance. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Binance Founder Changpeng Zhao Denies DOJ Deal to Testify Against Justin Sun , What the Pause Means for Binance and the Industry However, this extended pause will be beneficial for Binance to look for possible settlement options and be in line with regulations.

Binance has acknowledged that the continued pause is in everyone’s best interest. While the pause may not be the end, it certainly sets the stage for major regulatory developments in the months ahead. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Recent statistics from the token’s official burn tracker revealed that almost 17 million coins were removed from the circulating supply in just a day. As a result, crypto traders and investors anticipate a highly bullish price trajectory for the token ahead, abiding by economic principles. Simultaneously, SHIB Knight, a renowned community member, has further asserted that a $0.000015 price target for the token looms right over the horizon. Shiba Inu Burn Rate Bursts 1000%, What’s Fueling The Surge? According to the latest data from Shibburn on X , the Shiba Inu burn rate has surged 984.58% in the past 24 hours. As per the data, 16.94 million coins have been removed from the total supply over the past day. Source: Shibburn site Following the abovementioned burn chronicle, the total number of coins burnt to date was evaluated as 410.74 trillion tokens. Further, the total circulating supply shredded down to 584.37 trillion SHIB tokens at the time of reporting. Notably, two separate wallet addresses were collectivelyggested that the responsible for boosting the Shiba Inu burn rate today. Shibburn’s data suwallet addresses “0xa9d1e08c7” and “0xa20833” burnt 10 million and 4.3 million SHIB tokens, respectively. Traders and investors view this saga as bullish news, given that supply reduction could prompt a price upswing even if the demand for the asset remains the same. SHIB Price Eyes $0.000015? At the time of reporting, SHIB coin’s price jumped over 3% and exchanged hands at $0.00001220. The meme coin pumped from a low of $0.00001183 over the past day. This price upswing mirrors a bullish impact fueled via the recent SHIB burn rate surge. Besides, the price upswing also falls in line with today’s broader market trend, signaling that a recovery-like trend is cooking. Bitcoin price regained a hold above $83K after slipping as low as $74K this week. Altcoins and meme coins have mainly mimicked this uptrend, with Shiba Inu recovering from a weekly low at the $0.000010 level. In response, broader market sentiments orbiting the meme coin are already optimistic. Moreover, community member SHIB Knight has posted on X amid this upswing, revealing that $0.00001570 is the short-term price target.

That wave turned retail traders into millionaires — but let’s face it, those days are gone. XRP’s current market cap, regulatory entanglements, and long-standing consolidation around the $0.20–$0.60 range make another 50x moonshot nearly impossible. So, where’s the next opportunity? WHY XRP’S BEST DAYS ARE BEHIND IT To 50x from today, XRP would need to hit a market cap larger than $1.9 trillion , eclipsing even Bitcoin’s all-time highs. With Ripple still fighting an uphill battle with the SEC and its ecosystem seeing more stagnation than innovation, the upside for XRP is limited. Institutional support may help it survive — but not send it soaring. Investors holding out for a $20 XRP are clinging to hope, not data. WHERE THE HYPE IS SHIFTING: MAGACOIN FINANCE PRESALE SELLING OUT – CLICK HERE TO SECURE A SPOT NOW While blue chips plateau, meme-fueled, community-driven coins like MAGACOIN FINANCE are proving there’s still 100x potential in this market — especially during presale phases. Though the exact figures remain under wraps, insiders confirm MAGACOIN FINANCE is approaching a huge mark in early funding. What’s more telling than capital raised is the ferocious buzz : growing Telegram communities, watchlists on CoinGecko, and whispers across crypto Twitter calling it “the next SHIBA with structure.” The most exciting part? Listings haven’t even begun. Presale phases are rapidly selling out, and when a token generates this level of heat pre-launch, it’s usually a sign of explosive demand to come. THE DIFFERENCE IS STRUCTURE + MOMENTUM JOIN OVER 12,500+ INVESTORS – SECURE YOUR SPOT NOW Coins like PEPE and FLOKI went viral without fundamentals — MAGACOIN FINANCE is following the same trajectory, but with a roadmap, stage-based tokenomics , and a polished community launch strategy. If it mirrors what SHIBA did — or even 30% of that — the upside is still wild with the current price of $0.0002908 . Especially when you’re entering before centralized exchange listings and mainstream media mentions. Crypto doesn’t hand out 2,900% ROI anymore on post-listing tokens. That kind of multiplication is reserved for ultra-early entries — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the few still offering that shot. With Q2 2025 expected to bring broader market bullishness and major meme coins already saturating retail attention, newer tokens with viral DNA are perfectly positioned to breakout. MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t trying to be the next XRP. It’s trying to be what XRP once was — the breakout no one saw coming until it was already too late. FINAL THOUGHTS: A MARKET LOOKING FOR THE “NEXT” GET 50% EXTRA TOKENS INSTANTLY — USE PROMO CODE: MAGA50X BEFORE IT EXPIRES XRP’s time has passed for exponential growth. It’s not that it’s dead — it’s just matured. The altcoin crowd is hunting for newer stories, cheaper entries with current price of $0.0002908 , and tokens with community-first narratives. That’s exactly what MAGACOIN FINANCE is delivering — and why it’s quickly climbing watchlists. If you missed SHIBA, PEPE, and FLOKI, this might be the cycle’s one last whisper of early alpha.

At the start of the week, stocks and crypto saw a sharp drop as new tariffs were looming. But as soon as Trump announced a 90-day pause on the tariffs on all countries except China, the markets swiftly rebounded. Bitcoin is now back to its $82,000 levels. While there were debates over whether Bitcoin acted like a safe-haven or was it just another risky asset, nevertheless, Bitcoin was more resilient than most assets. Heading into the weekend, according to market intelligence platform Santiment , these trending tokens are leading the charge as crypto discussions heat up. Starting with Ethereum, there are discussions going on comparing Ether’s performance to Bitcoin and other crypto currencies. However, users have also expressed criticism over its long-term viability due to its declining market dominance and competition from other tokens. Ethereum is currently trading at $1,568 down over 13% in the past week. ONDO: Ondo has recently been listed on Binance, one of the top crypto exchanges globally by volume, which has triggered excitement in the community after ONDO was chosen for trading though a community vote. Many investors are optimistic over ONDO’s potential as its trading is all set to begin on April 11, 2025. Next up is Solana which is trending as traders focus on its price moves and strategies. SOL is one of the top altcoins which is gaining momentum which is also increasing its visibility and relevance. Analyst suggests that SOL is testing a key breakout level and could reach $200 if it holds. Besides, there is growing speculations around SOL ETF approval. Bloomberg’s James Seyffart confirmed that the final deadline is October 10 but said there’s some chance that the SEC may act sooner. However, approval by that date is strongly expected. Next up is the flagship crypto Bitcoin which is seen as a resilient asset when compared to others. When China revealed a tariff rate of 125% on US goods in response to Trump’s 145% levy, then Gold, which is often perceived as a safe haven shooted up while Bitcoin held its ground and did not panic like stocks. There are trending discussions going on about investments, trading strategies and market predictions. Several investment strategies are circulation like dollar-cost averaging and how crucial it is to hold onto Bitcoin as a safety net against market volatility. Users are also confident of Bitcoin’s potential growth contrasting it with other crypto currencies like Ether. Analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted that Bitcoin is breaking above a key resistance level at $82,360. If it could continue rising, then the next target could be $91,500. ORCA : This altcoin is trending as it has showed a notable price increase. It also features in the list of daily gainers which gets a lot of attention from crypto traders. XCN: Onyxcoin is trending as it is frequently mentioned in crypto investment decisions and predictions. Experts are bullish over the token expecting significant price increases.

Recall that the token dumped to $0.407 (on CoinGecko) on April 5, which became an all-time low . However, it bounced off almost immediately and soared past $0.75 just a day later. It has failed to maintain its run and was taken south once again during the massive volatility induced by Trump’s Trade War during the trading week. Nevertheless, it has emerged as one of the two top performers on a daily scale now, trailing only BONK. PI is up by over 15% and now trades close to $0.7 once again. Consequently, its market cap has risen to $4.7 billion on CoinGecko, which places it in 31st place in terms of largest assets. Still, PI was once close to breaking within the top $10 alts, when its price stood close to $3. While today’s performance is quite bullish, there are certain warning signs about its short-term moves. The number of tokens to be unlocked in the next few days is quite high, reaching up to 10 million on April 18. Such large number of coins getting unlocked at the same time could lead to increased selling pressure and further downside.

On the other hand, the DOGE whale accumulation could provide an additional boost for the rally ahead. Dogecoin Price Analysis: Bullish Breakout Potential Emerges After facing a steep correction of over 70%, Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing signs of a potential breakout. The cryptocurrency is currently forming a tight falling wedge pattern, a classic technical setup often considered bullish. Adding to the optimism, the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates a bullish divergence, suggesting the downward momentum could be waning. Source: TradingView Traders are closely watching for a breakout above the wedge’s trendline, which could signal a shift in market sentiment. If confirmed, such a breakout might pave the way for renewed upside momentum with next immediate targets of $0.35 and $0.50. After facing strong selloff earlier this week, Dogecoin price has reclaimed the crucial $0.16 support level hinting that the bottom is already in for the meme coin. Analysts are hoping for a massive rally to $5 as the whale accumulation surges. Prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez reported that the DOGE whales have purchased approximately 1.83 billion DOGE, valued at around $640.5 million, over a two-day period. This surge in whale activity suggests a potential bullish outlook for the meme-based cryptocurrency. Source: Santiment Martinez highlighted that while retail investors have been focusing on newer meme tokens, whales have been quietly increasing their DOGE holdings. Such a massive accumulation could set the stage for notable price movements going ahead. Key Catalysts for DOGE Ahead Dogecoin price has been subject to global macro developments and the escalating Trump tariff war over the past few months. However, the markets have started to look beyond it as Bitcoin price is showing strength while consolidating around $82,000 levels. Furthermore, as per the Coinglass data, the DOGE futures open interest is up 5.62% at $1.50 billion. This shows that traders are turning bullish for the asset class moving ahead. On April 9, 2025, 21Shares unveiled a strategic partnership with the House of Doge to introduce the Dogecoin Exchange-Traded Product (ETP), trading under the ticker DOGE. Duncan Moir, President of 21Shares, emphasized the significance of the collaboration, stating, “The Dogecoin ETP offers investors the most direct and accessible way to engage with the Dogecoin ecosystem.” The post Dogecoin Price Gearing for A 3X Rally Amid DOGE Whale Accumulation appeared first on CoinGape .",24/7 Cryptocurrency News|Altcoin News|Dogecoin (DOGE)|dogecoin etf|dogecoin price,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-04-12 06:04:49

This Underrated DeFi Project Just Crossed 8K Holders,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/this-underrated-defi-project-just-crossed-8k-holders/,"The post Next Crypto to Explode in 2025? This Underrated DeFi Project Just Crossed 8K Holders appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In a market often dominated by overhyped tokens and recycled narratives, it’s rare to see a DeFi project steadily grow its community before launch—without media noise or influencer-driven price spikes. Yet, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is doing exactly that. The protocol just surpassed 8,100 on-chain holders, a milestone that signals quiet but strong interest from long-term participants. With its presale moving rapidly and price locked at $0.025, many investors are starting to look at MUTM as a serious contender for 2025’s next crypto to explode. What makes this especially interesting isn’t just the holder count—it’s the timing. Mutuum is preparing for several major steps, including the launch of its beta platform and a full smart contract audit by CertiK, one of the most recognized names in blockchain security. This combination of adoption and accountability is turning heads. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol built to address one of the most practical needs in crypto: efficient, non-custodial access to capital. Rather than using a closed or overly complex system, Mutuum allows users to deposit assets into smart contracts and earn passive income through interest-bearing mtTokens. These mtTokens are more than just placeholders—they reflect real-time yield. As others borrow from the protocol, interest is automatically accrued to the mtTokens without users needing to stake, lock, or manage anything manually. It’s passive income designed for simplicity and scale, giving users full control of their funds at all times. Borrowers, meanwhile, use overcollateralized positions to access liquidity without having to sell their assets. It’s a model that fits well into the habits of both retail and whale investors, especially in bullish markets where holding core assets like ETH or stablecoins can lead to stronger long-term gains. The early interest in Mutuum is backed by real numbers. The project has raised over $6.5 million so far during its presale, with participation from a mix of DeFi veterans and newer investors who recognize value early. While other tokens chase listing announcements before building anything, Mutuum has focused on fundamentals. Crossing the 8K holder mark during presale alone is a major signal. It shows that investors aren’t just buying in—they’re holding on. This kind of retention is often seen in tokens with long-term appeal, not quick-flip narratives. The price is expected to move up to $0.03 in the next phase, and the public launch is confirmed at $0.06, which already gives today’s buyers a 2.4x upside. But for many, it’s not just about the price—it’s about what comes next. One of the most critical elements for any DeFi protocol is smart contract security, and Mutuum is taking it seriously. The team has officially announced an upcoming audit by CertiK, a trusted name that has reviewed some of the largest projects in the crypto space. This audit will ensure that the protocol’s smart contracts meet strict safety standards, further reinforcing investor trust before the token launches on exchanges. Security is a growing concern in DeFi, and the inclusion of CertiK at this stage adds credibility—not just to the codebase but to the project’s long-term commitment to doing things right. MUTM isn’t just a governance token or a speculative asset—it’s a part of the protocol’s economic engine. A portion of Mutuum’s platform revenue is set aside to buy MUTM tokens on the open market, which are then redistributed to users who hold mtTokens. This means that long-term contributors aren’t just earning interest—they’re also receiving added value through recurring token distributions tied to real platform activity. This model connects demand for the token with the actual use of the protocol. It’s not driven by hype, but by engagement—and that’s exactly the kind of structure long-term investors tend to look for. Mutuum Finance is still early, and it’s priced like it. But unlike many presale tokens that struggle to justify their valuations, MUTM has already proven it has a real foundation: utility, a working model, community growth, and third-party validation through its upcoming CertiK audit. For those asking what’s next in DeFi—and which project might quietly lead the next wave—Mutuum is worth serious attention. It’s an underrated protocol with momentum, a clear vision, and now, over 8,000 holders who seem to agree. Whether you’re looking for smart passive yield, exposure to early-stage DeFi, or just the best crypto coin to buy before 2025 heats up, MUTM may be one of the best options on the table right now.

ChatGPT Breaks Down Ripple’s Road to a New Bull Run,https://cryptopotato.com/can-xrp-explode-again-chatgpt-breaks-down-ripples-road-to-a-new-bull-run/,"TL;DR Despite its substantial price surge in the past several months, XRP failed to break its 2018 all-time high but came agonizingly close. It has retraced substantially since then, alongside the rest of the market, but ChatGPT believes there are certain factors that could restart its bull run. What Happened With XRP? CryptoPotato reported recently that everything seemed to be going in Ripple’s way ever since the US elections in November last year. Trump’s victory meant an upcoming regulatory change, which was particularly important for the company due to its long-standing legal fight against the local securities watchdog. That lawsuit has effectively ended now, just a few months after Trump’s promised changes came into effect. XRP was name-dropped by the same POTUS to be potentially included in the country’s strategic crypto reserve. There are multiple companies that had filed to launch their own exchange-traded funds tracking XRP’s performance. More recently, another massive development was announced as the company bought a large prime broker for $1.25 billion, which is set to be a game-changer for Ripple and its cross-border token. Yet, XRP’s biggest gains came in the months leading to the actual changes, lawsuit closure, and big purchases, which brought speculations on whether that run was just another classic ‘sell-the-news’ event. The asset peaked in January this year at $3.4, thus matching its record from seven years ago. Since then, it has been mostly downhill, and XRP even slipped below the coveted $2 support on several occasions. Can the Bull Run Start Over? While analysts have their own view on what can restart XRP’s bull run, we decided to ask ChatGPT for its own take. The AI chatbot outlined the aforementioned Ripple ETFs that have to be approved to impact the asset’s price because they can ‘open the gates to institutional flow, like we saw with Bitcoin.’ Second, ChatGPT listed the dire market conditions as of late. An improvement on that front could propel another price surge for XRP, which outperformed most crypto assets during the November-January run. The AI machine sees utility growth and adoption for Ripple’s cross-border payment systems, as well as major partnerships, as the next potential reasons that could lead to an XRP price pump. Whale activity is also important for the price movements of a crypto asset, and ChatGPT noted that many such market participants have disappeared from the XRP landscape as of late. If they return with massive purchases as they did after the elections, the asset could go parabolic once again. Lastly, the chatbot mentioned that XRP needs to break out of the crucial resistance levels at $2.5 and $3 to aim for a new all-time high. “A clean breakout from these resistance zones, with volume, could trigger momentum traders and algorithms,” ChatGPT concluded.

The crypto platform will likely reset revenue targets after a period of inflated crypto valuations while now focusing on a more stable subscription revenue. Coinbase remains highly profitable with a $9.3 billion cash balance. Investors should consider building a position during this weakness while anticipating some downside potential due to lowered expectations. Along with the market slump, Coinbase Global, Inc. ( COIN ) has fallen back to yearly lows. Unfortunately, cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, weren't similarly wiped out providing a far clearer path upwards. My investment thesis is more Bullish on the stock after the froth is gone with a potential double bottom around $160, but the company likely comes out with weak Q2'25 targets. Source: Finviz Resetting Revenue Targets At the recent highs, Coinbase was a tough buy due to the stretched valuation combined with elevated crypto valuations. In essence, the stock was priced for perfection and the company faced the recent scenario where the underlying crypto assets slipped, leading to a reduction in expected revenues. Though, so far, Bitcoin hasn't fallen dramatically, only slipping to $80K. The cryptocurrency is still above the $60K levels from last year, while falling from recent highs around $100K. Source: Coinbase With the hype burned out of the crypto market, Coinbase can build on a more normal transaction base starting in Q2. After all, the big revenue ramp in 2024 only got the business back to the 2022 peak levels of $2.3+ billion in quarterly revenues when Bitcoin originally reached $50K. Data by YCharts The main cryptocurrency doubled and Coinbase didn't even reach the prior peak revenue levels. The company has even made progress to diversify away from Bitcoin trading revenues, with Subscription and Services revenues slowly growing to $641 million in Q4. With Bitcoin surging from $60K at the start of October in Q4 to $100K by mid-December, the business was in an ideal transaction environment during Q4'24. Coinbase saw transaction revenues soar 88% QoQ to $1.35 billion in a jump that likely isn't repeatable for the rest of 2025. Source: Coinbase Q4'24 shareholder letter Coinbase would appear to face some lower transaction revenues during Q1'25, leading to a possible collapse in transactions during Q2. The company only saw Q2/Q3 transaction revenues around $650 million last year, some $900 million lower than the spike in Q4. As back in 2022 and 2023, Coinbase saw both the assets under management and transaction volume slump when crypto prices fell. As an example, transaction values slipped from $1,650 billion in 2021 to only $468 billion by 2023. Coinbase produced $2.2 billion in Q4 revenues and the current estimates are for quarterly revenue only dipping to ~$1.95 billion over the next few quarters. Back in 2022, the business plunged more than 50% to a low of only $0.6 billion. Data by YCharts When reporting Q4 results, Coinbase discussed Q1'25 transaction revenue of $750 million through February 11. The company was on pace for another quarter of $1.5 billion in transaction revenues, but Bitcoin fell from $95K to below $80K to start April. The analyst estimates appear far too high for the reality of the crypto market, where transaction revenues are volatile. Revenues tend to spike like in Q1'24 and Q4'24 followed by much weaker quarters where both transaction volumes and values plunge. Investors have to expect a weak outlook for Q2 after this volatile tariff policy likely leads to people pulling back on trading. More Stock Appeal The stock is far more appealing here, with the market cap back down to $42 billion. Coinbase ran to the prior peak of nearly $350 and the stock is suddenly down over 50% on the anticipation of weaker revenues. Coinbase remains highly profitable with the consensus estimates predicting a $7+ EPS for the next few years, leading to a P/E multiple of ~23x. The risk is that these numbers need to be cut, but ultimately the stock is at an attractive valuation based on the crypto market growing over time to justify a premium valuation. The crypto platform only has transaction expenses at 14% of net revenue, making the business highly profitable. Coinbase is spending about $550 million in adjusted operating expenses on a quarterly basis, to the point where Subscription and Services revenues targeted at $725 million for Q1'25 nearly cover most operating expenses. The company has a massive cash balance of $9.3 billion due to generating net income of $2.6 billion last year. The crypto business is printing money regardless of the volatility. Coinbase just needs to adjust revenue expectations for the reset to be complete. The company will report Q1 results and reset expectations for Q2 in a few weeks, providing an opportunity to use the double bottom here around $160 as an initial entry point with some capital held back for even lower prices and a cut in revenue expectations. A standard method is to invest up to 50% of a full position now, with 50% held back for potentially lower prices. Takeaway The key investor takeaway is that Coinbase Global is far more interesting here, with the stock trading at the yearly lows and some of the excess in cryptocurrencies ringed from the market. Investors should use the weakness to start building a position, knowing some potential downside exists on a lowering of revenue expectations for the next quarter.",COIN,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-04-12 06:52:10

The recent roundtable conference hosted by the SEC’s Crypto Task Force has shed light on the agency’s potential regulatory shift, with a vision for the US to lead in innovation and technology. Providing more insights into the US SEC’s potential crypto regulations, Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett shared an X post. Let’s unveil the key details shared by Terrett and the SEC’s possible moves ahead. US SEC Shifts Gears: Latest Updates on Crypto Regulations In a significant development, the US SEC’s Crypto Task Force conducted a roundtable conference focusing on crypto-friendly regulations. The regulator envisions building a comprehensive framework that could bolster the growth of blockchain technology. Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett, in her recent X post, commented on Acting SEC Chair Mark Udeya’s hint at the Commission’s potential decisions. According to Udeya, the SEC is gearing up to introduce a “sandbox” crypto regulation for tokenized securities. Terrett noted that the sandbox approach could be implemented for both registered and unregistered firms that offer tokenized securities. Significantly, this development comes on the heels of the SEC and Binance’s joint decision to pause the ongoing legal case. What is Sandbox Regulation? In a separate thread, Eleanor Terrett demystified sandbox crypto regulation, clarifying the community’s doubts. “A regulatory sandbox is when regulators allow market participants to operate outside existing laws in order to be able to experiment with new technology without the threat of being sued,” stated Terrett. Notably, this temporary arrangement gives regulators time to develop tailored guidelines or regulations for the emerging technology. Unlike the previous administration’s approach of suing companies for non-compliance, a sandbox fosters innovation while providing a framework for future oversight. US SEC’s New Crypto Regulations Foster Blockchain Growth As highlighted by Mark Udeya, the US SEC is putting effort into introducing new crypto regulations, focusing on innovation. He cited, “A time-limited, conditional exemptive relief framework for registrants and non-registrants could allow for greater innovation with blockchain technology within the United States in the near term.” Furthermore, Udeya posited that the SEC is working towards a long-term solution to ease the community’s burden. He added that the new crypto regulations could provide a relief, especially to the market participants offering tokenized securities and non-security crypto assets. Recently, the US SEC released disclosure guidance for crypto assets that are deemed securities. The Division of Corporation Finance has issued guidance for issuers. They emphasized the importance of clear and transparent disclosures in key areas. This includes business descriptions, risk factors, and financial statements.

The Cardano founder has predicted that the price of the alpha crypto could hit $250,000 by the end of this year due to Big Tech entering the crypto arena and regulatory progress. Bitcoin to Explode to $250,000 by Year-End In a recent interview with CNBC , Charles Hoskinson stated that Bitcoin, currently priced at $82,705, could be primed for a dramatic surge as early as this year, with technology behemoths like Microsoft and Apple moving into crypto. The world’s largest crypto has endured increased volatility in recent weeks, spurred by President Donald Trump’s aggressive trade policies, which have heightened inflation concerns and limited appetite for risk assets among investors. After slumping below $75,000 earlier this week, Bitcoin rebounded on Wednesday after Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs of at least 10% on all U.S. imports. BTC, which has gained 1.3% in the past day, has fared better than the broader crypto market, which saw its market capitalization plunge 0.8% since yesterday, according to CoinGecko data. Hoskinson doesn’t expect these tariffs to escalate into a prolonged global trade war with widespread negative consequences. “What will happen is that the tariff stuff will be a dud, and that people will realize that the world is willing to negotiate, and it’s really just US versus China,” he said. The Ethereum co-founder believes Bitcoin could rise to $250,000 “by the end of this year or next year” as tariff concerns ease off. Hoskinson forecasts that the global economy will adjust to a ‘new normal,’ after which the U.S. Federal Reserve will likely slash interest rates, thus making capital cheaper. That implies that more “fast, cheap money” could pour into crypto. Macroeconomic Factors Underpinning Bitcoin Price Hoskinson also predicted that upcoming U.S. legislation, including a stablecoin bill and the Digital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act, would be a boon for the crypto industry. These bills, currently progressing through Congress, seek to establish a clear regulatory framework for digital assets. Stablecoins could enjoy widespread adoption by the “Magnificent 7” tech giants, such as Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon (AMZN), Hoskinson added. The ADA creator further pointed to steady adoption of crypto assets and geopolitical shifts as other factors that could propel Bitcoin prices. As a result, Hoskinson expects a temporary lull in the market “for probably the next three to five months,” followed by a significant surge of speculative interest around August or September. “That’ll carry through probably another six to 12 months,” he postulated.",Bitcoin|News|ADA|Bitcoin News|Cardano,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-12 06:56:23

Not Likely, But This $0.007 Token Could Go to $5",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/04/can-shiba-inu-shib-reach-1-if-bitcoin-btc-hits-500000-not-likely-but-this-0007-token-could-go-to-5,"Speculation abounds regarding Shiba Inu's (SHIB) potential to hit $1 if Bitcoin skyrockets to $500,000—yet most analysts deem this improbable due to SHIB’s astronomical token supply. Instead, investor focus is shifting toward nascent, more scalable tokens like Lightchain AI . Priced at a mere $0.007, Lightchain AI has already amassed $18.7 million in its presale, luring capital from those prioritizing tangible utility and sustainable growth. By integrating blockchain with artificial intelligence, the project endeavors to construct a transparent, decentralized ecosystem underpinned by robust tokenomics and governance. While SHIB's $1 aspiration remains a distant improbability, Lightchain AI’s trajectory toward $5 appears considerably more plausible. SHIB Hitting $1 Remains Unrealistic Despite BTC Growth ​As Bitcoin is rapidly picking up the pace, the chance that Shiba Inu (SHIB) should appear at a $1 price is utterly unlikely due to the fact that today this virtual currency has a huge outsized supply of about 589 trillion coins. To get to the point of $1, the market capitalization would need to be around $589 trillion which is an amount that is greater than the total financial assets in the world combined. Thus even if they use a burn-strategy to dramatically reduce the currency in circulation, the sheer scope of the task makes it nearly impossible; at the current rate of burn, we need to wait for more than 40000 years to disappear enough tokens that the $1 target comes close to reality. Therefore, SHIB can be expected to undergo price variations and could possibly advance but it would be farfetched to think that it will reach $1.​ Lightchain AI at $0.007 Could Be Your $5 Crypto Jackpot Lightchain AI , currently priced at $0.007, presents a unique opportunity for early investors aiming for long-term gains. What sets it apart is its strong governance model—on-chain voting empowers token holders to shape the platform’s evolution directly. All proposals are transparently recorded on the blockchain, ensuring accountability and community trust. Developer accessibility is also a core strength: with APIs, SDKs, and a dedicated sandbox environment, developers can easily build, test, and deploy decentralized AI applications. This combination of governance integration, open development tools, and a fair token price makes Lightchain AI a hidden gem with serious upside potential. As utility becomes the new driver in crypto, LCAI stands ready to turn early bets into major wins. Grab Lightchain AI Tokens for Your Next AI Project! Decentralized and democratized artificial intelligence is on the rise, and Lightchain AI is at the forefront of this movement. With its unique combination of governance integration, open development tools, and fair token pricing, LCAI offers a promising platform for companies and developers looking to incorporate AI into their projects. If you're interested in leveraging LCAI's technologies and benefits, now is the time to grab some tokens. As utility becomes a key factor in the crypto market, early investments in LCAI could lead to major returns in the future.

Swissblock says on the social media platform X that Bitcoin’s momentum to the upside is not yet a sign of a convincing breakout. “Don’t let your guard down yet! The 90-day trade war extension eases tensions, but we’re not out of the woods. Bitcoin breaks $78,000-$79,000, now holding above $80,000. Are we in the clear?” Swissblock says the Bitcoin Risk Signal – which uses several indicators, including price data, on-chain data and a selection of other trading metrics to gauge whether BTC is at risk of a major drawdown – is not yet indicating a market bottom has been reached. “Market risk must ease for a true bottom. It’s under control but still elevated, not in a low-risk regime yet. We need to see a clear decline in risk.” Source: Swissblock/X According to Swissblock, Bitcoin remains in a downtrend. “For the bottom to progress, market trend must signal formation. We’re in a downtrend phase, normal in bottoming cycles: bottom-downtrend-uncharted. The bottom is close, but not confirmed.” Source: Swissblock/X Swissblock says that for Bitcoin to confirm a bullish reversal, the flagship crypto asset needs to hold $80,000 as support. “Bitcoin must hold $80,000 and consolidate to break the downward compression.

This can be showcased by the fact that , according to CoinGecko data, the price of DOGE has dropped by 14 % in the past week to hit $0.157 at the time of writing. As a result, renowned market analyst, Ali Martinez, believes that Dogecoin is in a dilemma, with $0.16 being a critical zone. Martinez pointed out , “Dogecoin is at a make-or-break level. If $0.16 holds, a rally to $0.57 could follow. If it fails, a drop to $0.06 becomes likely.” Source: Ali Martinez Since Dogecoin finds itself on a tightrope, the apex meme coin will need to dust itself off and reclaim $0.16 to rekindle the bullish fire. Is all Hope Lost? As Dogecoin traverses bearish territory, all hope is not lost for the meme coin OG. This is founded on the formation of an inverse head and shoulder pattern, which could signal DOGE’s bottom.

43241588,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148932,1744441575,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Update: SEC & Binance File Joint Motion to Extend Litigation Pause – Hopeful Sign for Crypto?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-binance-litigation-pause-extended/,"In a potentially hopeful turn of events for the cryptocurrency industry, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Binance have once again jointly requested a 60-day suspension of their ongoing litigation. This marks the second such request, hinting at potentially positive developments behind the scenes. Are we witnessing a breakthrough in the complex landscape of crypto regulation ? Let’s dive into the details of this crucial development. Why Another Litigation Pause? Exploring the SEC & Binance Joint Motion According to Eleanor Terrett, host of ‘Crypto In America’ on X (formerly Twitter), both the SEC and Binance have indicated that they are engaged in ‘productive discussions’. These discussions reportedly revolve around the activities of the SEC’s Cryptocurrency Task Force . The core argument for this second pause mirrors the first – allowing space for these discussions to progress without the immediate pressure of active litigation. This joint motion for a litigation pause signals a potential shift from adversarial courtroom battles to a more conciliatory approach. But what does this mean for Binance, the SEC, and the broader crypto market? Key Highlights of the Joint Motion: Productive Discussions: Both parties cite ongoing ‘productive discussions’ related to the SEC’s Cryptocurrency Task Force. Mutual Benefit: The motion emphasizes that a delay is in ‘everyone’s best interests’, suggesting a shared goal in finding a resolution. Second 60-Day Pause: This is the second time both parties have jointly requested a 60-day suspension, indicating sustained dialogue. Precedent Set: The court previously approved a similar 60-day suspension in February, suggesting a willingness to accommodate these pauses. Binance Litigation : A Step Back from the Battlefield? The initial Binance litigation , initiated by the SEC, has been a significant point of concern within the crypto community. The SEC’s lawsuit against Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) in June 2023 included a range of serious allegations, including operating unregistered exchanges, broker-dealers, and clearing agencies. A prolonged and contentious legal battle is typically costly, time-consuming, and can create significant uncertainty. This joint motion to pause litigation could be interpreted as both parties acknowledging the potential drawbacks of protracted legal proceedings and exploring avenues for a more negotiated settlement. Potential Benefits of a Litigation Pause: Reduced Legal Costs: Pausing litigation can help curb the escalating legal expenses for both the SEC and Binance. Focused Discussions: It allows both parties to dedicate resources and attention to productive dialogue rather than courtroom preparations. Market Stability: A move towards resolution, even if incremental, can inject a degree of stability into the cryptocurrency market, which often reacts negatively to regulatory uncertainty. Potential for Settlement: These discussions could pave the way for a potential settlement, avoiding a lengthy and unpredictable court battle. The SEC’s Cryptocurrency Task Force : What’s on the Table? The mention of the SEC’s Cryptocurrency Task Force is particularly noteworthy. This task force is responsible for coordinating efforts to identify and address securities law violations within the cryptocurrency and digital asset space. The ‘productive discussions’ likely involve Binance addressing concerns raised by the task force, potentially related to compliance, operational practices, and investor protection. What specific activities are under discussion? While details remain scarce, we can speculate on potential areas: Regulatory Clarity: Discussions might be aimed at clarifying regulatory expectations and establishing a clearer framework for crypto exchanges operating in the U.S. Compliance Frameworks: Binance may be working with the SEC to enhance its compliance frameworks to align with U.S. regulations. Investor Protection Measures: The SEC is likely interested in ensuring robust investor protection measures are in place on platforms like Binance. Operational Transparency: Discussions could involve improving transparency in Binance’s operational practices and reporting. Crypto Regulation in the US: Navigating a Complex Landscape The broader context of crypto regulation in the United States remains complex and evolving. The SEC has taken a firm stance on regulating cryptocurrencies as securities, leading to enforcement actions against various crypto entities. The Binance case is a prime example of this assertive regulatory approach. However, there’s also growing recognition within the industry and among policymakers that a more balanced and pragmatic approach to crypto regulation is needed. The current ‘regulation by enforcement’ approach has been criticized for creating uncertainty and stifling innovation. Could this joint motion signal a potential shift towards a more collaborative regulatory environment? Challenges and Considerations: SEC’s Stance: The SEC has historically maintained a strict regulatory posture towards crypto. A significant shift in approach may face internal resistance. Binance’s Global Operations: Binance operates globally, and any agreement with the SEC will need to consider its international operations. Broader Regulatory Framework: A lasting solution requires a more comprehensive and clearer regulatory framework for the crypto industry in the U.S., which goes beyond individual enforcement actions. Timeframe: Even with productive discussions, reaching a comprehensive resolution could still be a lengthy process. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? For crypto investors, this news of a second litigation pause offers a glimmer of hope amidst regulatory uncertainty. While it’s crucial to avoid premature optimism, here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on further developments related to the SEC-Binance discussions and any official statements from both parties. Market Volatility: Be prepared for potential market volatility. Positive news could lead to upward price movement, while setbacks could trigger dips. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that regulatory clarity, while desirable, is a long-term process. Focus on projects with strong fundamentals and robust compliance measures. Diversification: As always, diversification remains a key strategy to mitigate risk in the volatile crypto market. Conclusion: A Potential Turning Point in SEC & Binance Saga? The joint motion by the SEC and Binance to extend the litigation pause is a significant development. It suggests that both parties are actively seeking a path towards resolution through dialogue rather than solely through adversarial legal battles. While the outcome of these ‘productive discussions’ remains uncertain, this move offers a potential breakthrough in the ongoing saga and could signal a more constructive phase in the evolution of crypto regulation in the United States. The crypto community will be watching closely to see if this pause leads to a more amicable and positive future for Binance and the broader industry.

It is specifically developed for decentralised finance, high-frequency trading, and real-time digital exchanges. It is known for its unmatched transaction speed. How the SEI Community Is Reacting? As Donald Trump is now one of the most influential figures in the United States, it is natural for WLF’s investment decisions to gain extraordinary market attention . The SEI community has responded positively to WLF’s decision to purchase SEI tokens. The move could be seen as a signal of strategic positioning in the crypto space by World Liberty Fi. SEI Price Outlook: What Analysis Say Until recently, the SEI market had been in a bearish zone. In the last one year, the market has plummeted by over 75.9%. In the last 30 days, the market has dropped by 12%. In the last 14 days alone, the market has declined by 14.4%. At the start of this month, the price of SEI was $0.1720. Since then, the market has slipped by 4.36%. On April 7, the price touched as low as $0.1293. However, on April 6, strong buying pressure emerged in the SEI market. On that day alone, the market grew by over 10.52%. Even though sellers regained control of the market on April 10, they were only able to cause a small correction of 4.11 – far lower compared to April 6’s massive growth. In the last 24 hours, the SEI price has witnessed a rise of 7.8%. In the last one hour alone, the market has climbed by 3.4%. In conclusion, Trump-affiliated investments in SEI could trigger increased confidence in the project, especially from institutional investors. If World Liberty FI continues its crypto activity, SEI might experience stronger demand and visibility in the coming weeks. However, broader market conditions and global sentiment will still play a key role in determining the long-term performance of the token. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

43241679,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148940,1744441808,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Ethereum Relief: SEC Clears Hinman in Landmark Speech, No Ethics Breach Found",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-clears-hinman-ethereum-speech/,"In a significant development for the crypto world, particularly for Ethereum enthusiasts, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially cleared former SEC Corporation Finance Director William Hinman of any ethical misconduct concerning his controversial 2018 speech. This speech, where Hinman declared that Ethereum (ETH) was not a security, has been a subject of intense debate and scrutiny. Now, the SEC’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) report brings a decisive conclusion, finding no criminal or ethical violations. Let’s dive into the details of this groundbreaking report and what it means for the future of crypto regulation and Ethereum. Decoding the SEC’s Hinman Speech Clearance: What Happened? For those deeply invested in the crypto space, especially in Ethereum , William Hinman’s 2018 speech was a landmark moment. Speaking at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit, Hinman stated that Ether transactions were not securities transactions. This statement was widely interpreted as a tacit approval of Ethereum’s decentralized nature and its divergence from traditional securities. However, this speech also sparked controversy, particularly concerning Hinman’s past and future associations with the law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett (STB), which had ties to crypto projects, including Ethereum-related entities. Allegations of conflict of interest and ethical breaches surfaced, prompting an investigation by the SEC’s Office of Inspector General. The central question was whether Hinman’s speech was influenced by his personal or professional interests, especially considering his previous and subsequent employment at STB. The OIG report aimed to determine if Hinman violated any ethics rules or criminal statutes in relation to his Ethereum speech. Key Findings: No Ethics Breach in Hinman’s Ethereum Stance The OIG report’s conclusion is clear and definitive: no criminal or ethics violations were found. The report states several key points: No Direct Financial Impact: The OIG found no evidence that Hinman’s speech had a direct or predictable effect on his financial interests. This was crucial in dismissing allegations of personal gain or insider influence. No SEC Involvement with Former Firm Matters: The investigation revealed no indication that Hinman was involved in SEC matters related to his former firm, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, further dispelling concerns about conflicts of interest. Collaborative Speech Drafting: Importantly, the report highlighted that Hinman’s speech was not a solo endeavor. It was a collaboratively drafted document, reviewed and contributed to by multiple divisions within the SEC. This suggests the speech represented a broader SEC perspective rather than solely Hinman’s personal views. These findings are pivotal in understanding the context and intent behind Hinman’s crypto regulation remarks. It indicates a degree of internal consensus within the SEC at the time regarding Ethereum’s classification. Empower Oversight’s Criticism: A Narrow Scope? While the OIG report exonerates Hinman of criminal and ethical breaches, it has not been without criticism. Empower Oversight, the organization that obtained the report, has voiced concerns about its scope. They argue that the OIG’s investigation was too narrowly focused, primarily looking for potential criminal conflicts of interest. According to U.Today’s report, Empower Oversight believes the investigation should have delved deeper into other potential ethical lapses beyond just criminal violations. This criticism raises questions about the thoroughness of ethics oversight in regulatory bodies. While the OIG addressed the most serious allegations, the debate about the broader ethical implications of regulatory officials’ pronouncements and their connections to private firms might continue. It highlights the ongoing tension between public service and private sector opportunities for individuals with regulatory expertise. Implications for Ethereum and the Crypto Market: What Does This Mean? The SEC clearing Hinman in the Hinman speech case has several significant implications for Ethereum and the broader cryptocurrency market: Reinforces Ethereum’s Non-Security Status (Indirectly): While the OIG report is not a legal ruling on Ethereum’s security status , it validates the context surrounding Hinman’s speech. By clearing Hinman, the SEC implicitly acknowledges that his speech, which stated Ethereum was not a security, did not stem from unethical or conflicted motives. This can be interpreted as a subtle endorsement of the views expressed in the speech. Reduced Regulatory Uncertainty: The cloud of ethical doubt over a significant SEC statement regarding Ethereum has been lifted. This can contribute to reduced regulatory uncertainty surrounding Ethereum, potentially fostering greater investment and development in the Ethereum ecosystem. Precedent for Future SEC Guidance: The collaborative nature of Hinman’s speech drafting, as highlighted in the report, suggests that SEC guidance on crypto assets is often a product of internal consensus. This could provide a framework for understanding future SEC pronouncements and how they are developed. Continued Scrutiny on Regulatory Ethics: Despite Hinman’s clearance, the criticism from Empower Oversight underscores the ongoing need for vigilance regarding ethics in regulatory bodies. The crypto community and the public will likely continue to scrutinize the interactions between regulators and the industries they oversee. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Evolving Regulatory Landscape For participants in the cryptocurrency market, especially those focused on crypto regulation , the Hinman report offers several actionable insights: Insight Actionable Step Regulatory statements, even informal ones, can have significant market impact. Stay informed about speeches, statements, and guidance from regulatory bodies like the SEC. Monitor official channels and news sources. SEC’s internal processes for crypto regulation are collaborative. Understand that SEC positions are often the result of internal discussions and consensus-building. Look for patterns and consistency in SEC communications. Ethics scrutiny of regulators is a crucial aspect of market integrity. Support organizations and initiatives that promote transparency and accountability in regulatory bodies. Engage in public discourse on regulatory ethics. Ethereum’s regulatory path is becoming clearer, but vigilance is still needed. Continue to monitor regulatory developments specifically concerning Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. Engage with legal and regulatory experts to understand evolving compliance requirements. Conclusion: A Chapter Closed, But the Story Continues The SEC’s OIG report clearing William Hinman of ethical violations in his Ethereum speech marks the closing of a significant chapter in the ongoing narrative of crypto regulation. It provides relief and clarity regarding a statement that has shaped perceptions of Ethereum’s regulatory standing for years. While Empower Oversight’s concerns about the scope of the investigation remind us of the complexities of regulatory ethics, the report’s findings are nonetheless impactful. For the crypto community, this development reinforces the importance of understanding regulatory signals, engaging in informed discussions, and staying vigilant as the regulatory landscape continues to evolve. The journey of defining clear and fair rules for the crypto world is far from over, but the Hinman report offers a valuable point of reflection and a step forward in that journey.

This also means that the Helium WiFi Hotspots are not considered securities. Helium can now continue developing WiFi infrastructure and providing crypto incentives without worrying about the SEC subjecting it to never-ending legal suits. The Helium team remains positive with their vision of creating a fully connected world with the help of blockchain technology. Gary Gensler, the former SEC chair, made one final lashing out, targeting Helium with an enforcement action. Helium announced on its blog that the case was unfairly dismissed, meaning the SEC cannot raise similar cases against Helium in the future. Helium also announced that its tokens, including its WiFi tokens, can now be declared saints. Helium operates a blockchain network responsible for around 375,000 WiFi Hotspots, aiming to decentralize the WiFi business. Its market capitalization was around $5 billion in 2021 and has since dropped to $480 million. Since Trump’s inauguration, the SEC has dropped several high-profile cases, including Ripple, Coinbase, and Uniswap. “Today marks a major win for Helium and The People’s Network”, wrote Helium on their blog. “Nova Labs, the founding team behind Helium, confirms the SEC has agreed to dismiss with prejudice its claims that Nova Labs sold unregistered securities. With this dismissal, we can now definitively say that all compatible Helium Hotspots and the distribution of HNT, IOT, and MOBILE tokens through the Helium Network are not securities”. The SEC, however, will still fine Nova Labs with a $200,000 fine related to their civil case involving major firms, including Nestle, Lime, and Salesforce. The SEC claimed that they engaged in fundraising misconduct by making inflated claims about their relation to major firms, during a 2021-2022 token sale. The SEC argues that they inflated their valuation to $1 billion by luring investors under false pretenses. Despite Helium only having limited contact with companies like Nestle, they presented these companies as partners and users of their technology. However, The $200k settlement allows Helium to move on without admitting guilt. Crypto projects, moreover, should learn a lesson from the incident, remembering the dangers of marketing a fundraising campaign. “With the dismissal of the SEC’s unregistered securities claims with prejudice” , Helium wrote on their blog, “the outcome establishes that selling hardware and distributing tokens for network growth does not automatically make them securities in the eyes of the SEC”.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News|SEC,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|REGULATION|HNT|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-12 07:13:30

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/bitcoin-dedicated-platform-says-ripple-has-changed-the-game-for-xrp-forever-heres-why/,"A recent tweet from Bitcoin.com News has drawn attention to what it calls a “defining moment” for XRP and the XRP Ledger. Referring to Ripple’s $1.25 billion acquisition of Hidden Road, the tweet highlights the potential for this development to reshape the cryptocurrency’s role in traditional finance. The post notes that Hidden Road, a prime brokerage firm handling over $10 billion in daily volume and processing over 50 million transactions, is now “plugged into XRP,” suggesting that this move could fundamentally shift how the asset is used in global markets. According to Bitcoin.com News, Ripple hasn’t just acquired a company—it has positioned XRP to serve as the infrastructure for a new era of financial settlement. Ripple didn’t just buy a company—it changed the game for XRP forever The $1.25B Hidden Road deal is more than a headline.

The report emphasizes that Ripple’s move could unlock access to trillions of dollars in traditional finance and dramatically scale the use of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) across institutional platforms. The deal also aligns with Ripple’s longstanding goal of bridging the gap between blockchain technology and legacy finance systems. Institutional Reach and Technology Integration The $1.25 billion acquisition brings with it access to Hidden Road’s significant client base, which includes over 300 institutional investors. These firms represent a wide range of financial activities, including trading, asset management, and liquidity provisioning. By embedding XRP into the clearing and settlement processes used by Hidden Road, Ripple seeks to demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the XRPL. David Schwartz, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, underscored this point by suggesting that billions in trades could be settled instantly on the XRPL, turning the ledger into a functional component of the financial system’s infrastructure. Stablecoin Integration and Future Utility Hidden Road’s infrastructure will also support Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD. According to the Times Tabloid article, this integration will provide a mechanism for efficient cross-margining and settlement, further embedding Ripple’s products within the global financial system. By linking RLUSD and XRP with the core functions of a major prime broker, Ripple aims to offer a full-stack solution that meets the needs of institutional finance.

This consistent demand signals rising institutional interest in XRP-related products, especially after recent legal clarity surrounding Ripple. Teucrium’s CEO Sal Gilbertie called the new 2x XRP ETF their “most successful launch ever.” In an interview with ETF analyst Neta Geraci, he said the product’s debut saw an overwhelming response, even though it flew under the radar at first. The ETF launched right after the old SEC leadership stepped down , which Gilbertie noted was a smart timing move. Trading under the ticker XXRP, the fund gives investors double the daily movement of XRP, making it ideal for those who want to bet short-term on XRP’s price swings. It kicked off with around $5 million in volume, which, while much smaller than big Bitcoin ETFs , was still considered strong for today’s market by expert Eric Balchunas. The volume on $XXRP is impressive, these are big numbers for Day Two-Four, esp for a 2x indie in a whack market. Child's play vs bitcoin ETFs of course, but really strong, this thing is finding an audience quickly pic.twitter.com/IOUtQFW8bd — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) April 11, 2025 Strong Debut Reflects Soaring Demand After its launch on NYSE Arca , the leveraged XRP ETF had an impressive first week. It opened with $5.5 million in trading volume and closed at $23.37. Activity picked up fast, with volume hitting over $13 million on April 9 and the price climbing to $28.92. The ETF reached its weekly high at $29.21 on April 11, with $8.57 million traded. Legal Clarity and New XRP Futures Fuel Optimism The ETF’s rising popularity aligns with broader trends in the XRP ecosystem. On March 20, Bitnomial launched XRP futures , expanding institutional access to the asset. Even more importantly, the U.S. SEC has officially ended its lawsuit against Ripple Labs, a case that cast doubt over XRP’s regulatory status for years. This legal closure has opened the door for new XRP-focused products. Many asset managers are now hopeful about XRP ETF approvals, especially after the SEC’s recent green light for Ethereum ETF options , hinting at a more crypto-friendly stance. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple CEO Talks XRP Price Surge and Bitcoin Price Forecasts , XRP Price Riding the Momentum With the legal cloud lifted, XRP’s outlook appears stronger than ever.

The banking giant believes that Ripple will soar by over 200% in the coming years. In this article, we explore several factors that support the bank’s bullish thesis. Top 3 Reasons Why XRP Price Can Hit $5.50 This Year Standard Chartered’s Geoff Kendrick’s forecast says that XRP price will soar by 200% to $5.50 before the end of 2025. If Ripple attains this price, the altcoin will attain a $319 billion market cap and become the largest altcoin. Let’s explore why this rally is likely to happen. Inflows to the First XRP ETF in the US Earlier this week, Teucrium Investment launched the first leveraged XRP ETF in the US. As a recent Coingape article reported, this ETF has secured five straight days of inflows. This shows high market interest in the product despite macroeconomic concerns from the ongoing US-China trade war. According to data from Teucrium, the 2x Long Daily XRP ETF has amassed $17.2 million in net assets after trading for only five days. During the same period, spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs recorded steady outflows. This makes it likely that the XRP price will attain the Standard Chartered target of $5.50. US Government May Hold $50M XRP The US government may hold $50M XRP tokens according to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. While speaking to Fox Business, Garlinghouse noted that the settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might go to the US government. “The SEC is going to end up with $50 million, the US government is getting $50M. We have even talked about making that available in XRP.” Ripple’s settlement in the SEC case may see the token being the first altcoin to be added to a digital assets stockpile. This is bullish for XRP price and could aid a rally to $5.50 as Standard Chartered predicted. Regulatory Clarity Lastly, the newly found regulatory clarity for Ripple after the SEC case ended makes the $5.50 target attainable. The end of this case will see Ripple secure adoption from retail and institutional investors, triggering a massive price rally. The SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit has been weighing on XRP price for years since it was opened in late 2020. With the weight being lifted, XRP will likely unlock a massive 200% rally. XRP Price Technical Analysis XRP price today trades at $2,03 with a slight 2.3% gain in 24 hours. The altcoin is now eyeing resistance at the 78.6% Fibonacci level of $2.10. If Ripple overcomes this resistance, it may recover past $2.23. The RSI is also flashing bullish signs after rising to 57. Meanwhile, the MACD has also flipped positive, which is a sign that the current uptrend is growing strong and may extend. XRP/USDT: 4-Hour Chart To sum up, several bullish catalysts make the $5.50 target price for XRP by Standard Chartered attainable. Factors like the end of the SEC case, endorsement by the US government, and interest in the recently launched XRP ETF will support the parabolic 200% gains for Ripple before year-end.

Now in Phase 4 of its 11-phase presale, the token is priced at $0.025, with Phase 5 set to increase the price by 20% to $0.03. 400 million tokens have been claimed by early joiners, who are benefiting from a system built to maximize returns through multifaceted tokenomics. Investors buying now will make a 140% profit once launched, with MUTM listing at $0.06. Post-launch, analysts expect another spike to $4.50, as Mutuum Finance’s unique mechanisms and rapid adoption kick in. Here are three key factors driving estimates of $6 by mid-2025. Presale and Well-Defined Tokenomics Strategic planning of the MUTM presale structure has successfully attracted investor interest in Mutuum finance. The presale introduces token pricing at $0.025 during this phase but the price will rise across multiple periods until it reaches a $0.06 listing price at the conclusion. The progressive pricing model stimulates supporter rewards and establishes momentum by emptying available token quantities at each stage. The transition to Phase 5 delivers a 20% profit opportunity known as paper gain to all current buyers. Strong tokenomics together with this strategy create additional confidence in investors. Phase 4 users can expect a minimum 140% profit at $0.06 when the platform launches utilities while analysts project the price will reach $4.50. The projected returns from Mutuum Finance depend on its revenue-sharing system that uses platform fees to repurchase tokens through redemption to lower supply levels permanently. The presale has raised more than $6.5 million while showing constant acceleration which indicates further demand growth is unlikely. Demand Generation through Buy-and-Distribute Mechanism Mutuum Finance implements its growth strategy through the core buy-and-distribute protocol. The revenue stream automatically acquires MUTM tokens from public exchanges to route into purchases. The tokens that Mutuum Finance purchases go to stakers and liquidity providers in order to strengthen long-term holding and support persistent buying pressure. The continuous self-feeding system controls token supply while driving prices upward because market fluctuations fail to affect it. Mutuum Finance enhanced their platform capabilities by launching a new dashboard display of the token holder rankings for the top 50 individuals. Additional bonus tokens can be accumulated by high earners through their individual score performance. These promotional plays generate increased visibility and fan engagement during the presale period through a $100,000 prize giveaway which reflows into the ecosystem development. A Practical Solution To Decentralized Borrowing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) instead ties its value to real DeFi applications rather than being a speculation token. It uses overcollateralized loans to allow users to lend and borrow from each other, making it impossible for users to default while providing lenders with liquidity. Users deposit assets like ETH or stablecoins to mint interest-bearing mtTokens, which accumulate over time, and can be traded across DeFi platforms. When the market is on the up, a lender will be able to charge a high rate for the ability to borrow funds, which means the rates that people are given will reflect the current economic climate, whereas they could also take the lower during the down times. Additionally, a peer-to-peer lending feature enables the direct negotiation of loan terms, which increases its utility for niche assets such as meme coins. This capability makes Mutuum Finance an all-in-one platform for anyone looking for DeFi services, whether institutional or retail, allowing users to do everything on the platform. Moving Forward The development team of Mutuum Finance is currently in the final stages of issuing a smart contract audit with CertiK, which is expected to greatly boost investor confidence. As each is completed, results will be shared through official channels. At the same time, phase four of the presale is gathering momentum, as it provides one of the last chances to buy MUTM below the $0.03 mark ahead of exchange listings.

A new bill introduced by U.S. Senators Sheldon Whitehouse and John Fetterman is sending ripples through the crypto world. The Clean Cloud Act proposes to levy fees on data centers and cryptocurrency mining facilities that exceed carbon emission benchmarks. This move signals a significant shift towards environmental accountability within the digital asset space, but what does it really mean for Bitcoin and the future of crypto mining? Let’s dive into the details of this groundbreaking legislation. Understanding the Clean Cloud Act: Targeting Bitcoin Mining Carbon Emissions The heart of the matter lies in the Clean Cloud Act , a draft bill designed to address the growing environmental concerns associated with energy-intensive industries like cryptocurrency mining and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Recognizing the substantial energy demands of data centers and, particularly, Bitcoin mining operations, the bill aims to mitigate the risk of surging energy prices and reduce the overall carbon footprint. But how exactly does it plan to achieve this? Emission Performance Standards: The bill mandates the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish emission performance standards specifically for data centers and crypto mining facilities with a significant IT load (100 kilowatts or more). Annual Emission Reduction Targets: These standards are designed to drive down emissions by 11% annually. The reduction target is based on the emissions intensity of the local power grid, acknowledging regional variations in energy sources. Carbon Emission-Based Fees: Here’s where it gets interesting. Facilities exceeding these emission standards will face fees, initially set at $20 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂e). This financial penalty is designed to incentivize cleaner practices and make polluting energy sources less economically viable. In essence, the Clean Cloud Act is a direct attempt to regulate the environmental impact of Bitcoin and other energy-intensive digital technologies by making carbon emissions a tangible cost for these operations. Why Focus on Bitcoin Mining Carbon Emissions? The spotlight on Bitcoin mining carbon emissions isn’t arbitrary. Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, while lauded for its security, is notoriously energy-hungry. Globally, Bitcoin mining consumes a vast amount of electricity, a significant portion of which still comes from fossil fuels, contributing substantially to carbon emissions. Critics argue that this energy consumption undermines global climate goals and exacerbates environmental problems. This bill underscores a growing global awareness and concern about the ecological footprint of cryptocurrencies. As governments worldwide grapple with climate change, industries perceived as major contributors to carbon emissions are increasingly facing regulatory scrutiny. Cryptocurrency regulation , particularly concerning environmental impact, is becoming a hot topic on the legislative agenda. Potential Impacts and Challenges of the Clean Cloud Act The Clean Cloud Act , while aiming for a greener future, is not without its potential challenges and implications for the cryptocurrency industry. Potential Benefits: Environmental Responsibility: The most obvious benefit is the push towards more environmentally responsible practices in Bitcoin mining . By making carbon emissions costly, the bill incentivizes miners to seek out cleaner energy sources. Grid Stability: By reducing overall energy demand from large data centers and mining facilities, the bill could contribute to grid stability, particularly in regions with strained energy infrastructure. Innovation in Green Mining: The financial pressure from emission fees could spur innovation in green mining technologies and renewable energy adoption within the crypto mining sector. Potential Challenges: Increased Operating Costs: For mining facilities that rely on carbon-intensive energy sources, the Bitcoin mining fees imposed by the bill could significantly increase operating costs, potentially impacting profitability. Competitive Disadvantage: U.S.-based miners might face a competitive disadvantage compared to miners in regions with less stringent environmental regulations, potentially leading to a shift in mining operations to other countries. Implementation Complexity: Defining and enforcing emission performance standards for a decentralized and rapidly evolving industry like cryptocurrency mining can be complex and require robust monitoring and verification mechanisms. Defining ‘Excessive’ Emissions: The 11% annual reduction target based on local grid intensity might be perceived as aggressive by some and insufficient by others, sparking debate about the fairness and effectiveness of the benchmarks. Is This the Future of Cryptocurrency Regulation? The introduction of the Clean Cloud Act is a strong signal that environmental considerations are no longer on the periphery of cryptocurrency regulation. Governments are increasingly recognizing the need to balance innovation in the digital asset space with broader societal goals, including climate action. Whether this specific bill becomes law in its current form remains to be seen. It will likely face scrutiny and debate from various stakeholders, including the cryptocurrency industry, environmental groups, and energy providers. However, the underlying trend is clear: the era of ignoring the environmental impact of Bitcoin and other energy-intensive cryptocurrencies is rapidly closing. This legislative effort could pave the way for more comprehensive and globally coordinated approaches to cryptocurrency regulation , particularly concerning energy consumption and environmental sustainability. The crypto industry will need to adapt and innovate to thrive in a future where environmental responsibility is not just a choice, but a regulatory requirement. Conclusion: A Critical Moment for Crypto and the Environment The Clean Cloud Act represents a pivotal moment in the ongoing conversation about cryptocurrency and its environmental footprint. It’s a clear indication that lawmakers are taking the Bitcoin mining carbon emissions issue seriously and are prepared to implement measures that could significantly reshape the industry. While the bill presents challenges, it also offers an opportunity to drive innovation towards greener and more sustainable cryptocurrency practices. The coming months will be crucial in determining the fate of this legislation and its lasting impact on the crypto landscape.

Token unlocking will take place on April 18th at 03:00 Turkish time (UTC+3). Memecoin is currently unlocking 493,150 TRUMP tokens daily, worth around $3.94 million per day. According to blockchain data, TRUMP’s current market cap is $1.6 billion, with a fully diluted valuation of around $8 billion. Of the maximum supply of 1 billion, 200 million tokens (20%) are currently available for use, while the remaining 800 million (80%) are locked. TRUMP is currently trading at $8, an 84% drop from its peak price just before Trump’s presidential inauguration on January 20. The sharp drop in price coincided with a significant drop in user engagement. All-time chart showing the huge decline in the TRUMP token.

This week, the AI community witnessed a dramatic turn as Meta, a tech titan, faced scrutiny over the real capabilities of its much-anticipated Maverick AI model. Initially touted for a high score on the LM Arena benchmark using an experimental version, the vanilla, unmodified Maverick model has now been tested, and the results are in: it’s lagging behind the competition. Let’s dive into what this means for the AI model benchmark landscape and for Meta. Why is the AI Community Buzzing About Meta’s Maverick Model and its Benchmark Results? Earlier this week, controversy erupted when it was revealed that Meta had used an experimental, unreleased iteration of its Llama 4 Maverick model to achieve a seemingly impressive score on LM Arena, a popular crowdsourced AI model benchmark . This move led to accusations of misrepresentation, prompting LM Arena’s maintainers to issue an apology and revise their evaluation policies. The focus then shifted to the unmodified, or ‘vanilla,’ Maverick model to assess its true standing against industry rivals. The results are now in, and they paint a less flattering picture. The vanilla Maverick, identified as “Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct,” has been benchmarked against leading models, including: OpenAI’s GPT-4o Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro As of Friday, the rankings placed the unmodified Meta Maverick AI model below these competitors, many of which have been available for months. This raises critical questions about Meta’s AI development trajectory and its competitive positioning in the rapidly evolving AI market. The release version of Llama 4 has been added to LMArena after it was found out they cheated, but you probably didn’t see it because you have to scroll down to 32nd place which is where is ranks pic.twitter.com/A0Bxkdx4LX — ρ:ɡeσn (@pigeon__s) April 11, 2025 What Factors Contribute to the Maverick Model’s Performance Gap? Meta’s own explanation sheds some light on the performance discrepancy. The experimental Maverick model, “Llama-4-Maverick-03-26-Experimental,” was specifically “optimized for conversationality.” This optimization strategy appeared to resonate well with LM Arena’s evaluation method, which relies on human raters comparing model outputs and expressing preferences. However, this tailored approach also underscores a critical point about LM Arena and similar benchmarks. While LM Arena offers a platform for crowdsourced AI model evaluation, it’s not without its limitations. As previously discussed, its reliability as a definitive measure of an AI model’s overall capabilities has been questioned. Optimizing a model specifically for a particular benchmark, while potentially yielding high scores in that context, can be misleading. It can also obscure a model’s true performance across diverse applications and real-world scenarios. Developers might find it challenging to accurately predict how such a benchmark-optimized model will perform in varied contexts beyond the specific parameters of the AI performance evaluation. Meta’s Response and the Future of Llama 4 In response to the unfolding situation, a Meta spokesperson provided a statement to Bitcoin World, clarifying their approach to AI model development. They emphasized that Meta routinely experiments with “all types of custom variants” in their AI research. The experimental “Llama-4-Maverick-03-26-Experimental” was described as a “chat optimized version we experimented with that also performs well on LMArena.” Looking ahead, Meta has now released the open-source version of Llama 4 . The spokesperson expressed anticipation for how developers will customize and adapt Llama 4 for their unique use cases, inviting ongoing feedback from the developer community. This open-source approach may foster broader innovation and uncover novel applications for Llama 4, even as the vanilla version faces AI performance challenges in benchmarks like LM Arena. Key Takeaways on Meta’s Maverick Model and AI Benchmarks: Benchmark Context Matters: The incident highlights the importance of understanding the context and methodology of AI model benchmarks . Scores on platforms like LM Arena should be interpreted cautiously and not be seen as the sole determinant of a model’s overall utility. Optimization Trade-offs: Optimizing AI models for specific benchmarks can lead to inflated scores that may not reflect real-world performance across diverse tasks. Transparency and Openness: Meta’s release of the open-source Llama 4 is a positive step towards transparency and community-driven development in the AI space. Developer Customization is Key: The true potential of models like Llama 4 may lie in the hands of developers who can tailor and fine-tune them for specific applications, going beyond generic benchmark performance. The recent events surrounding Meta’s Maverick model serve as a crucial reminder of the complexities in evaluating AI performance and the need for nuanced perspectives beyond benchmark rankings. As the AI landscape continues to evolve, critical analysis of evaluation methodologies and a focus on real-world applicability will be paramount.

43242686,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148971,1744444216,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent: NY Judge Greenlights Critical Securities Fraud Case Against DCG in Crypto Legal Battle,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ny-judge-dcg-securities-fraud/,"Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! The legal drama in the crypto world just took another critical turn. A New York judge has given the green light for Attorney General Letitia James’ civil securities fraud case against Digital Currency Group (DCG), its CEO Barry Silbert, and former Genesis Global Capital CEO Michael Moro to proceed. This isn’t just another day in crypto town; this decision could have significant ripple effects across the industry. Let’s dive into what this all means. Why is the DCG Securities Fraud Case Moving Forward? In a nutshell, the judge in New York found enough merit in the Attorney General’s allegations to allow the securities fraud case to move to trial. Filed back in 2023, the lawsuit accuses DCG and its affiliates, along with crypto exchange Gemini, of attempting to hide a staggering $1 billion hole in Genesis’ balance sheet. This alleged cover-up followed the dramatic collapse of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital in 2022 – a period many of us remember for its market turmoil. While Gemini and Genesis have already settled with the state, DCG, Silbert, and Moro fought back, seeking to dismiss the case. Their core argument? The Gemini Earn program, a key element in the allegations, didn’t involve securities and therefore shouldn’t fall under the state’s securities laws. However, the judge wasn’t convinced. Let’s break down the key players and what’s at stake: Digital Currency Group (DCG): A major crypto venture firm facing serious allegations. Barry Silbert: CEO of DCG, now personally in the legal crosshairs. Genesis Global Capital: A DCG affiliate at the heart of the alleged financial shortfall. Gemini: Crypto exchange involved through its Earn program, which has already settled with the state. New York Attorney General Letitia James: Leading the charge, claiming investor fraud and seeking accountability. The Heart of the Matter: The Gemini Earn Program and Securities The crux of DCG’s defense was that the Gemini Earn program wasn’t a security. Why is this important? Because securities are subject to stricter regulations and legal frameworks designed to protect investors. If the Gemini Earn program is deemed a security, it opens up a whole new level of legal scrutiny. The Attorney General argued that the Gemini Earn program indeed functioned as a security offering. The judge agreed, stating that the Attorney General had “adequately alleged” this point. This is a significant win for the prosecution and a major setback for DCG’s defense. To understand why this program is so contentious, let’s look at its features: Feature Description Gemini Earn Program Offered by Gemini in partnership with Genesis, allowing users to lend their crypto in exchange for interest. Yield Generation Users expected to earn interest, implying a return on investment, a key characteristic of securities. Centralized Management The program was managed by Gemini and Genesis, with users relying on their expertise and actions. Risk of Loss As events unfolded, users faced significant risk of losing their deposited crypto, highlighting the investment nature. What Does This Crypto Legal Battle Mean for the Industry? This crypto legal battle is far more than just a dispute between DCG and the New York Attorney General. It’s a bellwether for how regulators and courts are viewing crypto products and services. The decision to allow the case to proceed signals a tougher stance on crypto firms, especially those offering yield-generating products. Here’s why this case is so important for the broader crypto ecosystem: Regulatory Scrutiny: It reinforces the idea that crypto firms are not operating in a regulatory vacuum. Expect increased oversight. Precedent Setting: The outcome could set precedents for future cases involving crypto lending and yield programs. Investor Protection: It underscores the importance of investor protection in the crypto space, a growing concern for regulators worldwide. Market Confidence: How this case unfolds will likely impact market confidence, particularly in centralized crypto platforms. Barry Silbert and DCG Under Pressure: What’s Next? With the dismissal motion denied, Barry Silbert and DCG are now facing a full-blown trial. This means they will have to present a robust defense against the Attorney General’s claims. The stakes are incredibly high, not just for DCG and Silbert personally, but for their reputation and future in the crypto industry. The road ahead for DCG involves: Preparing for Trial: Building a legal strategy to counter the Attorney General’s evidence. Potential Settlement: While they initially resisted, a settlement might become a more attractive option to avoid a potentially damaging trial. Reputational Damage Control: Managing public perception and investor confidence during this challenging period. Industry Impact: Navigating the broader industry repercussions and regulatory shifts that may arise from this case. Final Thoughts: A Decisive Moment for Crypto Regulation? The New York judge’s decision is a decisive moment in the ongoing saga of crypto regulation. It highlights the increasing pressure on crypto firms to comply with traditional financial regulations, particularly when it comes to products that resemble securities. As this case progresses, it will be crucial to watch how it shapes the future landscape of crypto finance and investor protection. One thing is clear: the era of unchecked crypto operations is rapidly coming to an end.

In return, Changpeng Zhao (CZ) would provide the US DoJ executives with evidence related to Tron founder Justin Sun. Responding to it, Sun said that he sees CZ as his mentor and that he has nothing to hide from the authorities. Justin Sun Addresses Rumors, Affirms Trust in Binance CEO Responding to the circulating rumors, Tron founder Justin Sun emphasized his strong ties with Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). In a message on the X platform, the Tron founder wrote: “CZ is both my mentor and a close friend—he has played a crucial role in supporting me during my entrepreneurial journey”. Sun praised Zhao’s leadership and ethics, calling them “the highest standard I strive to follow as a founder. He also highlighted TRON’s collaborative relationship with the DOJ, describing the department as “one of T3FCU’s closest and most trusted partners”. The Tron founder assed that the joint efforts between the two parties have focused on protecting global users through various cases. “Whether it’s CZ or our partners at the DOJ, we maintain direct, honest communication at all times. I have full trust in each and every one of them,” Sun affirmed. Additionally, Justin Sun said that he’s very optimistic about favourable crypto policy initiatives under U.S. President Donald Trump. Also, sharing optimism about TRON’s prospects, stating, “As the President’s earliest crypto choice, TRX is set to be one of the beneficiaries of this success. ALL IN USA!” Is WSJ On A Hit Job Against CZ? Just ahead of the WSJ report , Binance chief Changpeng Zhao shared on X platform, exposing the media platform. He wrote: “Multiple people have told me again WSJ is writing another baseless hit piece about me”. Last month, a WSJ report also stated that the Trump family was eyeing a stake deal in Binance.US , in return for pardoning CZ from his prison term. CZ later denied the allegations, calling them baseless. In another development on Friday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Binance jointly requested a federal judge to extend the pause in their ongoing legal case by an additional 60 days. The motion comes after both parties described recent talks as “productive discussions,” with the extension intended to allow more time for continued deliberations and potential resolution.

Simultaneously, the company has been in discussions to partner with a Trump family-backed cryptocurrency initiative, marking a notable alignment between the embattled crypto exchange and the former president’s inner circle. The discussions, confirmed by individuals familiar with the matter, signal Binance’s effort to regain traction in the U.S. market following its $4.3 billion settlement with federal regulators in 2023 for facilitating illicit financial activity. Binance pushes to end U.S. oversight as Trump family eyes strategic crypto alliance According to people familiar with the meeting, Binance CEO Richard Teng and Chief Legal Officer Eleanor Hughes requested that Treasury officials remove the monitorship or reduce its duration and scope. The current oversight requires extensive oversight from the Treasury and the Justice Department. At the same time, Binance is exploring a potential listing of a new dollar-pegged stablecoin, USD1, launched by World Liberty Financial, a venture backed by former President Donald Trump’s family. The Trump-affiliated crypto firm aims to capitalize on Binance’s global reach of over 250 million users and its daily trading volume of $65 billion to propel USD1 into a major player in the digital currency ecosystem. The talks illustrate an emerging alliance between Binance and Trump-world figures. Binance, facing regulatory pressure and operational restrictions in the U.S., could benefit from political goodwill. Trump, who has already pardoned several crypto industry figures, may be poised to ease regulatory scrutiny on digital assets. In return, the Trump family gains financially from increased circulation of USD1. Stablecoin issuers like Tether made over $13 billion in profits last year, largely from interest income on reserves. Binance’s support could drive massive adoption of USD1 and potentially bring in similar windfalls. Sources told the Wall Street Journal that Trump family representatives have also talked with Binance about acquiring a stake in Binance US, the exchange’s faltering U.S. subsidiary. Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, who pleaded guilty to federal charges and served a four-month prison term, is reportedly seeking a presidential pardon. This move could be facilitated by strengthening ties with the Trump camp. Crypto diplomacy in Abu Dhabi sparks Binance–Trump alliance The Binance and Trump Family relationship was catalyzed at a high-level crypto conference in Abu Dhabi last December, shortly before Trump’s second inauguration. In a private VIP room dubbed the “Whale Only” lounge, Zhao mingled with Eric Trump and other Trump associates, including Steve Witkoff, who is a special Middle East envoy. Eric Trump used the opportunity to promote World Liberty and the “digital-currency golden age” under his father’s renewed leadership. Since then, business discussions between Binance and World Liberty Financial have accelerated. The exchange is also reportedly fine-tuning its internal anti-money-laundering controls, though some insiders claim these efforts may weaken checks on high-risk users — a claim Binance denies. Binance’s interest in political alliances extends beyond potential partnerships. The company reportedly established internal task forces to prepare for a U.S. reentry under a second Trump administration and to pursue a pardon for Zhao. Binance’s past dealings with figures like Justin Sun — founder of the Tron blockchain and a major investor in World Liberty — have also raised eyebrows. Over half of last year’s illicit crypto activity reportedly occurred on Tron. Sun, who is facing SEC scrutiny, invested $75 million into World Liberty’s token earlier this year. Following the investment, the regulatory watchdog asked a federal court to pause its fraud lawsuit against him. As part of his plea deal, Zhao agreed to provide information to prosecutors about Sun’s activities, sources revealed. Justice Department ends crypto oversight The Justice Department recently announced the dissolution of its cryptocurrency unit and the suspension of corporate monitorships — the very mechanism currently overseeing Binance. This reflects a shift in the regulatory winds. The “Ending Regulation by Prosecution” announcement suggests a broader rollback in crypto enforcement under the Trump administration. A Treasury spokesperson confirmed the meeting with Binance was one of many held with industry stakeholders. A Binance spokesperson described the monitorships as “inefficient and costly burdens” and reaffirmed the exchange’s commitment to “supporting any government seeking to balance innovation with user protections.” The spokesperson for World Liberty noted that USD1 aims to be “accessible for millions around the globe,” asserting that Binance is still an integral player in crypto’s global market. The White House declined to comment on whether Zhao or any other individuals are under consideration for presidential pardons.

When a figure as influential as former President Donald Trump speaks about the U.S. dollar, the global financial markets – including the ever-exciting cryptocurrency sphere – perk up and listen. Recently, Trump made a confident statement suggesting a significant strengthening of the US Dollar , coupled with optimistic expectations for improved relations with China. But what does this mean for the global economy , international trade , and your crypto portfolio? Let’s dive into the details. Trump’s Bold Prediction: A Stronger US Dollar on the Horizon? According to a post by Watcher.Guru on X (formerly Twitter), Donald Trump declared that the US Dollar is poised to “rise significantly and become stronger than ever.” This statement, coming from a former president known for his direct and often market-moving pronouncements, has certainly grabbed attention. But what’s behind this bullish outlook? And more importantly, what are the potential ripple effects across different sectors, especially in the context of international trade and digital currencies? Decoding the Dynamics: Why a Stronger US Dollar Matters A strengthening US Dollar isn’t just a number on a currency exchange chart; it’s a key indicator with far-reaching implications. Let’s break down why this matters: Impact on Imports and Exports: A strong dollar makes U.S. imports cheaper for American consumers, potentially helping to keep inflation in check. Conversely, it makes U.S. exports more expensive for foreign buyers, which could impact the competitiveness of American goods and services in the global market. Influence on Global Debt: Many countries, especially emerging economies, hold debt denominated in US Dollars . A stronger dollar means these debts become more expensive to repay in their local currencies, potentially straining their economies. Commodity Prices: Many commodities, like oil and gold, are priced in US Dollars . A stronger dollar can sometimes lead to a decrease in commodity prices, as it takes fewer dollars to purchase the same amount of commodities. Investor Sentiment: A strong dollar is often seen as a sign of a robust U.S. economy , which can attract foreign investment into dollar-denominated assets. To understand the potential benefits and challenges, let’s consider a quick comparison: Aspect Benefits of a Strong US Dollar Challenges of a Strong US Dollar Consumers Cheaper imports, potentially lower inflation. – U.S. Exporters – Exports become more expensive, potentially reducing competitiveness. Global Debtors – Dollar-denominated debts become more expensive to repay. Investors Sign of a strong U.S. economy, attracting investment. – China and the US Dollar: Navigating the Complex Relationship Trump’s statement also included optimism about achieving a “positive outcome” in relations with China . The economic relationship between the U.S. and China is one of the most crucial in the world, and the US Dollar plays a significant role in this dynamic. Here’s how a stronger US Dollar and improved relations could intertwine: Trade Balance: A stronger dollar could potentially exacerbate the trade imbalance between the U.S. and China by making Chinese goods cheaper for American consumers and American goods more expensive for Chinese buyers. However, improved relations might lead to new trade agreements or adjustments that could mitigate this effect. Currency Manipulation: The U.S. has often accused China of manipulating its currency to gain a trade advantage. A stronger US Dollar could put pressure on other currencies, including the Chinese Yuan, and how China manages its currency will be closely watched. Geopolitical Implications: Positive outcomes in U.S.- China relations could lead to greater stability in global markets and reduced geopolitical risks, which can be beneficial for overall economic growth. Crypto’s Reaction: Will Bitcoin and Altcoins Respond to a Surging US Dollar? For cryptocurrency enthusiasts, the strength of the US Dollar is always a point of interest. Historically, there’s often been an inverse relationship between the US Dollar and assets like Bitcoin. When the dollar strengthens, assets like Bitcoin, sometimes viewed as alternative stores of value, can see fluctuations. Here’s what to consider in the crypto context: Investment Flows: A stronger US Dollar might make dollar-denominated investments more attractive, potentially diverting some investment away from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies in the short term. Global Crypto Markets: For investors outside the U.S., a stronger dollar can make cryptocurrencies priced in dollars more expensive in their local currencies, potentially affecting demand. Inflation Hedge Narrative: If a stronger dollar helps to curb inflation, it could potentially reduce the appeal of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as inflation hedges, although this narrative is complex and debated. Navigating the Economic Tides: Actionable Insights for Investors So, what should investors, particularly those in the crypto space, take away from Trump ‘s statements and the potential for a stronger US Dollar ? Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on macroeconomic indicators, including currency movements, inflation data, and developments in U.S.- China relations. News from figures like Trump can be market-moving, but it’s crucial to look at broader economic trends. Diversify Your Portfolio: Diversification is key in any investment strategy. Consider having a mix of assets, including traditional investments and cryptocurrencies, to mitigate risks associated with currency fluctuations and market volatility. Understand Global Interconnections: The global economy is interconnected. Events in one part of the world, or statements from influential figures, can have ripple effects everywhere, including the crypto market. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term market reactions can be volatile, maintain a long-term perspective on your investments. The cryptocurrency market, in particular, is known for its long-term growth potential despite short-term fluctuations. Conclusion: A Stronger Dollar, Global Dynamics, and the Crypto World Donald Trump ‘s prediction of a stronger US Dollar and optimism regarding China injects a fresh layer of complexity into the global economic narrative. For those in the cryptocurrency world, understanding these macroeconomic shifts is paramount. A stronger dollar can have multifaceted impacts, influencing everything from trade balances to investment flows and potentially shaping the trajectory of the crypto market. As always, staying informed, being adaptable, and maintaining a balanced perspective are your best tools for navigating these dynamic times. The interplay between the US Dollar , global economy , and the burgeoning crypto space is set to remain a captivating story to watch unfold.

33767162,[object Object],1744444825,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Bitcoin Realized Loss Suggests Early Signs Of Seller Exhaustion, Glassnode Says",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-realized-loss-seller-exhaustion-glassnode/,"The analytics firm Glassnode has revealed how the trend in the Bitcoin Realized Loss could imply sellers may be starting to reach exhaustion. Bitcoin Realized Loss Is Showing Signs Of Saturation In a new post on X, Glassnode has talked about how the Bitcoin capitulation has looked during the latest price drawdown. The on-chain indicator of relevance here is the “ Realized Loss ,” which measures, as its name suggests, the total amount of loss that the investors on the Bitcoin network as a whole are ‘realizing.’ The metric works by going through the transaction history of each coin being moved or sold on the blockchain to see what price it was transacted at prior to this. If the previous selling price is more than the current spot price for any coin, then its sale is said to be contributing to loss realization. The amount of loss being realized in the sale is, of course, equal to the difference between the two prices. The Realized Loss calculates this value for all transactions occurring on the network and sums them up to find the total situation. Like the Realized Loss, there is also an indicator known as the Realized Profit . This metric naturally keeps track of the sales of the opposite type (that is, where last transfer value is lower than the latest spot price). Now, here is the chart for the Bitcoin Realized Loss shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in its 6-hour rolling value over the past year: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin Realized Loss observed several large spikes during the bearish price action in February and March, suggesting the investors panic sold their underwater coins. The recent FUD around tariffs has triggered a continuation of the drawdown for the asset and predictably, the holders have shown sizeable capitulation now as well. But interestingly, the scale of the 6-hour Realized Loss has been notably lower than the spikes from before. This could imply capitulation is reaching a point of saturation, which, according to Glassnode, may be an early sign that the sellers are becoming exhausted. If so, then it’s possible that BTC may be close to some sort of bottom. In the same thread, the on-chain analytics firm has also discussed about the recent trajectory in the market cap of the altcoins (that is, the cryptocurrencies excluding Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the stablecoins). From the chart, it’s apparent that the altcoin market cap was sitting at an all-time high of $1 trillion in December 2024, but today the metric has shrunken to $583 billion. “Assets further out on the risk curve have shown heightened sensitivity to liquidity shocks, leading to severe sector-wide devaluation,” notes Glassnode. BTC Price Bitcoin has been making an attempt at recovery during the last couple of days as its price has returned to $81,900.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Realized Loss|Bitcoin Seller Exhaustion|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|RUNE|FET|SEI|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CAKE|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-04-12 08:00:25

The cryptocurrency was trading at $1,892 exactly two years ago, on April 11, 2023, and is now priced around $1,560 – over 17% lower. Related Reading: Is Ethereum Repeating Its 2020 Trend Reversal? Analyst Predicts ETH To ‘Explode’ In Q2 2025 In contrast, BTC has surged from approximately $41,000 two years ago to $82,127 at the time of writing – an increase of nearly 100%. While SOL currently trades below its April 2023 price, unlike ETH, it did manage to reach a new all-time high (ATH) of $293 earlier this year in January. Understandably, sentiment toward ETH – among both retail and institutional investors – is hovering near all-time lows. However, Martinez believes that “smart money” may be accumulating at current levels, anticipating a near-term reversal. The analyst pointed out that Ethereum’s Entity-Adjusted Dormancy Flow has recently dropped below one million. Martinez added: This historically indicates a macro bottom zone, meaning $ETH might be undervalued and long-term holders are less inclined to sell. It also suggests: sentiment is low, capitulation may have occurred, smart money might be accumulating. For the uninitiated, Ethereum’s Entity-Adjusted Dormancy Flow is an on-chain metric that compares the market cap to the dormancy – the average age of ETH being moved – adjusted for unique entities instead of raw addresses. The metric helps identify whether the market is overheated or undervalued by tracking the behavior of long-term holders. If ETH follows historical trends, it may be approaching a momentum reversal. In a separate X post, crypto trader Merlijn The Trader suggested that Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) is nearing a peak, which could shift capital into altcoins and trigger a short-term rally. At the time of writing, BTC.D stands around 63.5%. A potential pivot by the US Federal Reserve toward quantitative easing (QE) could inject fresh liquidity into the market, possibly sparking a mini altcoin rally. ETH Demands Cautious Optimism While there are multiple signs that ETH may be close to bottoming out, some indicators suggest that there could be continued weakness for the digital asset before any meaningful momentum shift.

Further, ongoing capital outflows from US-based spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETF) remain a concern for the asset’s short-term outlook. That said, crypto analyst NotWojak recently noted that ETH may be on the verge of a breakout, with a potential upside target of $1,835. At press time, ETH is trading at $1,557, down 2.3% in the past 24 hours.

You’re not alone. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a key indicator of market sentiment, has just signaled a significant shift. Let’s dive into what this means for you and your crypto investments. Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: What Is It? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a powerful tool designed to gauge the overall sentiment of the cryptocurrency market. Think of it as a mood ring for the crypto world. It analyzes various factors to determine whether the market is experiencing fear or greed, two dominant emotions that heavily influence investment decisions. Ranging from 0 to 100, the index breaks down as follows: 0-25: Extreme Fear – Suggests investors are extremely worried, often indicating a potential buying opportunity. 26-49: Fear – Indicates fear is prevalent in the market, suggesting caution among investors. 50-75: Greed – Signals that greed is taking over, potentially pointing towards market exuberance and a possible bubble. 76-100: Extreme Greed – Represents excessive optimism, often a warning sign of an impending market correction. The index isn’t based on gut feelings; it’s calculated using a weighted average of six key market indicators, giving a comprehensive view of market sentiment: Factor Weight Description Volatility 25% Measures the current and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing it with the 30-day and 90-day averages. Unusually high volatility can indicate fear. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Compares current market momentum and volume with the 30-day and 90-day averages. High buying volumes signal greed, while low volumes can indicate fear. Social Media 15% Analyzes social media sentiment, particularly on platforms like Twitter and Reddit, to understand public opinion on Bitcoin and crypto. Surveys 15% Conducts weekly crypto polls to gauge investor sentiment directly. Bitcoin Dominance 10% Measures Bitcoin’s dominance compared to other cryptocurrencies. A rise in Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate a fear-driven market as investors flock to the perceived safety of Bitcoin. Google Trends 10% Analyzes Google Trends data for Bitcoin-related search queries to understand general public interest and sentiment. Shift to the ‘Fear’ Zone: What Does This Mean for Crypto Market Sentiment? Recently, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index experienced a notable shift. As of April 12, it registered at 43, a decrease of 18 points from the previous day. This move propelled the index out of the ‘Extreme Fear’ zone (below 25) and into the ‘Fear’ zone (26-49). While this might seem like a positive progression from ‘Extreme Fear’, it still signifies that fear remains a dominant emotion in the crypto market . This transition suggests a slight improvement in overall market sentiment, but it’s crucial to remember that ‘Fear’ still implies caution. Investors are still wary, likely due to ongoing market uncertainties, regulatory concerns, or broader economic factors. The drop of 18 points highlights the volatile nature of the crypto market and how quickly sentiment can change. Navigating Market Volatility: How to Use the Fear & Greed Index to Your Advantage? So, how can you, as a crypto investor, use this information to your advantage in this period of market volatility ? Identify Potential Buying Opportunities: Historically, periods of ‘Extreme Fear’ on the index have often presented lucrative buying opportunities. When fear is rampant, asset prices can be suppressed, creating chances to buy quality cryptocurrencies at lower prices. However, ‘Fear’ zone, while less extreme, still suggests potential caution. It might be a good time for selective buying, focusing on fundamentally strong projects. Manage Risk: Conversely, high ‘Greed’ or ‘Extreme Greed’ readings can be seen as warning signs. When the market is overly greedy, it might be a good time to take profits or reduce your exposure to the market, preparing for potential corrections. The current ‘Fear’ zone suggests that excessive risk-taking should be avoided, and a more balanced approach to portfolio management is advisable. Confirm Market Trends: Use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index in conjunction with other technical and fundamental analysis tools. It shouldn’t be the sole basis for your investment decisions but rather a valuable supplementary indicator to confirm or question your market assessments. For instance, if the index shows ‘Fear’ but technical indicators suggest an upward trend, it might indicate a potential accumulation phase before a significant rally. Understand Market Psychology: The index is invaluable for understanding the overall psychology of the market. It helps you detach from emotional decision-making. When fear is high, it’s easy to get caught up in panic selling. The index reminds you to consider the broader market sentiment and make more rational decisions. Bitcoin Dominance and Fear: Is Bitcoin Still the Safe Haven? Bitcoin dominance is another critical factor within the index. During times of market uncertainty and fear , investors often flock to Bitcoin, perceived as the oldest and most established cryptocurrency. An increase in Bitcoin dominance can sometimes correlate with higher fear levels in the broader crypto market. Monitoring Bitcoin dominance alongside the Fear & Greed Index can provide deeper insights into market dynamics. If Bitcoin dominance is rising while the index is in ‘Fear’, it could indicate a flight to safety within the crypto space itself. Conclusion: Staying Informed and Making Wise Decisions in a Fearful Market The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s shift to the ‘Fear’ zone is a noteworthy development. It serves as a reminder of the inherent volatility and emotional nature of the cryptocurrency market. By understanding and utilizing this index, you can gain valuable insights into market sentiment, make more informed investment decisions, and navigate the often turbulent waters of crypto trading with greater confidence. Remember, knowledge is power, especially in the fast-paced world of crypto. Staying informed and adaptable is key to long-term success.

However, weak market participation and low momentum suggest a high probability of continued consolidation and short-term retracements. XRP Price Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart Ripple’s recent impulsive decline has been paused at a significant confluence of support levels, including the 200-day moving average at $1.8, the 0.5–0.618 Fibonacci retracement zone, and the lower boundary of a descending wedge pattern. This zone has acted as a key demand region, temporarily halting the downtrend. Moreover, the emergence of a bullish divergence between the RSI and price action further supports the possibility of a short-term rebound, potentially targeting the wedge’s upper boundary near the 100-day MA at $2.5. However, the broader market environment remains characterised by low activity and weak momentum, suggesting that XRP is likely to continue oscillating within the wedge pattern until a decisive breakout occurs. A valid breakout, either above or below the wedge, could result in significant volatility and liquidation cascades, driving an impulsive move in the breakout’s direction. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, XRP initially broke below both the descending wedge and expanding wedge patterns, triggering a wave of fear and suggesting a bearish continuation. However, this breakdown quickly turned into a false breakout, forming a bear trap as the price bounced back above the broken support levels. Since then, XRP has been gradually retracing toward its prior swing high of $2.2. A successful breach and close above this level would mark a bullish market structure shift, potentially opening the path toward the $2.5 resistance zone. Conversely, failure to break above $2.2 would reaffirm the existing bearish structure, making further downside in the medium term more probable.
