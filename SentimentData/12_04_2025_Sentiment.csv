Here’s Why and When,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-lend-your-xrp-to-institutions-heres-why-and-when/,"Brett (@Brett_Crypto_X), a prominent voice in the digital asset space, recently issued a direct message to XRP holders, emphasizing the importance of long-term vision over short-term gains. His post encouraged investors to rethink their approach by taking advantage of market dips to accumulate XRP rather than looking for exit points. He believes those who understand what they hold with XRP will never sell the asset and urges the community to prioritize strategic accumulation and future utility. $XRP holders, it's time to rethink your approach—accumulate during the dips. Once regulations hit, lend your $XRP to institutions and enjoy passive income. I’m fed up with folks asking when to sell. If you truly understand what you’ve got, the answer is simple: never. — Brett (@Brett_Crypto_X) April 10, 2025 Shifting the Narrative from Selling to Lending According to Brett, XRP’s real value will be realized once regulatory clarity enters the market, and the recent conclusion of the Ripple lawsuit has sped up this process. He pointed to the growing possibility of lending digital assets to institutions as a future avenue for generating passive income. By doing so, holders can earn a yield on their assets without liquidating them. This approach reframes XRP as a long-term financial tool instead of a speculative asset, especially once institutions gain regulatory approval to operate more freely in crypto markets. Institutional Interest and Strategic Accumulation Many XRP proponents believe that major financial institutions, including firms like BlackRock, are positioning themselves to acquire XRP at relatively low prices . This aligns with the idea that these institutions see XRP as a critical piece in the evolving global financial infrastructure. Supporters argue that XRP’s underlying technology and its intended use case in facilitating cross-border payments and improving liquidity between financial entities make it an ideal asset for integration into traditional finance. The attention from major firms also validates its long-term relevance, even if the current market price does not yet reflect that value. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Regulation as a Catalyst for Adoption Many XRP holders believe that the path will be clear for institutional adoption once regulatory frameworks are finalized. Ripple is now free to sell XRP to institutions , and with demand rising, lending tokens to banks, financial platforms, or other entities may become viable and potentially lucrative. This scenario depends on establishing proper custody, compliance, and lending mechanisms, but the interest shown by institutions suggests that such infrastructure is already being developed. Instead of looking for exit strategies, Brett and other experts encourage committed holders to accumulate and hold to participate in a future financial system where XRP plays a foundational role. For those who recognize XRP’s intended function and the interest it has garnered from institutional players, the current period may represent an opportunity to build and prepare rather than exit.

In 2023, James sued James sued DCG and its CEO Barry Silbert, DCG’s now-bankrupt lending arm Genesis Global Capital and its former CEO Michael Moro and crypto exchange Gemini, alleging that they worked together to cover up a gaping $1 billion hole in Genesis’ balance sheet caused by the wipe-out of Singapore-based crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) in 2022. James said DCG and Genesis made “false assurances” on social media that DCG had absorbed Genesis’ losses from 3AC’s implosion when, in fact, they had just papered over the hole with a promissory note, pleading to pay Genesis $1.1 billion over 10 years at a 1% interest rate. While DCG has adamantly maintained that the promissory note was legitimate, James’ suit claimed that DCG has “never made a single payment under the Note.” While Gemini and Genesis both settled with the OAG, DCG, Silbert and Moro have fought them tooth and nail. Last spring, DCG and both executives filed motions to dismiss the suit, alleging that the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) had failed to state a claim — essentially arguing that they were not selling securities and thus should not be sued under New York State securities laws. But the judge presiding over the case disagreed in her Friday ruling, writing that the OAG had, at least at the current stage of the case, adequately alleged that the Gemini Earn program — the now-defunct Gemini lending product that went belly-up in November 2022 and which sits at the center of James’ case — was a security. Crane did, however, agree to toss out two of James’ claims against DCG, Moro and Silbert — one claim under New York’s Executive Law that they engaged in a scheme to defraud in the first degree, and another that they engaged in a conspiracy in the fifth degree — ruling that those claims were duplicative. Though Crane ruled the case can proceed, DCG said it isn’t done fighting. “As we have stated from the beginning, the allegations against DCG are a thin web of innuendo, mischaracterizations, and unsupported conclusions,” a spokesperson for DCG told CoinDesk. “We’re encouraged by the judge’s dismissal of the New York Attorney General’s most outrageous claims based on alleged violations of criminal fraud and conspiracy statutes. We will continue to fight this baseless lawsuit as we remain focused on our mission in support of the digital assets industry.”",Policy|Letitia James|DCG|Barry Silbert,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-11 22:14:48

With the market buzzing with possibilities, it’s not just the usual suspects like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu capturing attention. Newer meme coins are making waves, some even promising unique features that could make them the next big thing. Among these, some coins stand out in particular—like Troller Cat ($TCAT), which is set to launch soon, and others like Floki Inu, Turbo, Bonk, Popcat, and Notcoin, all gaining traction in the meme coin market. In this article, we’ll look at how these meme coins are heating up and why Troller Cat, in particular, might be the one to watch, especially with its upcoming presale and whitelist phase. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or new to the meme coin game, this list will give you the inside scoop on the rising stars in the crypto universe. 1. Troller Cat ($TCAT)- The New Meme Coin You Shouldn’t Miss Troller Cat is quickly gaining momentum as one of the most promising meme coins in 2025. Early investors are gearing up for something special as the presale rapidly approaches. With its focus on a unique play-to-earn (P2E) game center, Troller Cat is rumored to have deflationary mechanics that will reduce its supply and, ultimately, increase demand. This is exactly the kind of buzz that crypto enthusiasts love. The $TCAT whitelist is currently open, giving early adopters a chance to secure their positions before the presale goes live. If you’re looking to get in early on a meme coin with tremendous potential, the TrollerCat whitelist is your ticket. By signing up, you’ll not only be among the first to access the presale but could potentially enjoy high staking rewards. Analysts are already speculating that Troller Cat could follow the success of other big meme coins, rewarding those who act quickly. 2. Floki Inu ($FLOKI) – A Viking Meme Coin with Strong Community Support Floki Inu is a meme coin that’s built a loyal following, inspired by Elon Musk’s dog, Floki. It’s been making significant strides with its growing ecosystem and passionate community. The coin’s popularity surged after Musk tweeted about it, but it’s the community that’s really propelled Floki Inu forward. As a meme coin with real utility, it’s now working on its own NFT marketplace and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. Floki Inu made it to this list because it has the right balance of meme culture and growing ecosystem potential. The coin’s value has been steadily climbing, and its dedicated community makes it a formidable player in the meme coin space. 3. Turbo ($TURBO)- Speeding Ahead in the Meme Coin Race Known for its fast-moving nature, Turbo has been catching the attention of meme coin enthusiasts for its unique approach to engaging the community. The coin has made waves with its promise of high-speed transactions and decentralized governance. Unlike some meme coins, Turbo focuses on scalability, aiming to provide a faster, more efficient alternative in the meme coin market. Turbo’s ability to scale as the market grows makes it stand out. Investors are noticing this underdog coin, with many seeing it as a promising long-term investment. Turbo has earned its place on this list due to its rapid growth and unique features. 4. Bonk ($BONK) – A Meme Coin with Meme Potential Bonk made a splash on the meme coin scene by positioning itself as a fun, community-driven coin. Originating from the Solana blockchain, Bonk quickly gained traction for its meme value, even though it wasn’t initially intended to be anything more than a community experiment. However, it has since built a solid reputation, primarily due to its active community and growing user base. Despite its playful nature, Bonk is showing real promise. Its success is largely due to its community-first approach and strong backing from the Solana ecosystem. Bonk has made it to this list because of its fun vibes, viral success, and ongoing community engagement. 5. Popcat ($POPCAT) – The Meme Coin with Real Buzz Popcat is based on the popular meme of the cat that gained viral fame due to its wide appeal. The creators behind Popcat have capitalized on this meme, turning it into a fun, engaging cryptocurrency. Despite the playful concept, Popcat is drawing serious attention for its rapidly growing community and meme-driven marketing approach. Why has Popcat made it to this list? It’s simple: the meme factor. Popcat has tapped into the meme culture like few other coins have. It’s fun and easy to understand, and everyone loves a viral meme, making it one of the more promising meme coins today. 6. Notcoin ($NOT) – A Meme Coin with a Twist Notcoin is one of the newest meme coins on the scene, and it’s already making waves due to its unique branding and twist on the classic meme coin format. Unlike traditional meme coins, Notcoin seeks to bring value to its community by introducing features that are typically associated with serious projects, like a deflationary model and utility in DeFi platforms. Notcoin made it to this list because it combines the fun of meme coins with the seriousness of a utility coin. It’s capturing the attention of investors who are looking for the next big meme coin with real utility potential. 7. Would ($WOULD): The Underdog Meme Coin That’s Gaining Momentum Would has quietly become one of the most intriguing players in the meme coin space, drawing attention with its unique charm and growing community. While it doesn’t yet boast the recognition of giants like Dogecoin, its combination of playful branding and a solid development plan has piqued the interest of crypto enthusiasts. The token’s lighthearted approach has attracted a following of younger investors eager to be part of something fun yet potentially lucrative. Analysts believe that Would Coin is one to watch, as it’s creating waves despite being in its infancy. What truly sets Would apart is its focus on sustainability and its active community. Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype, Would has a roadmap in place with real goals, collaborations, and influencer partnerships. The buzz surrounding its potential is palpable, and as the meme coin market continues to evolve, Would could be the unexpected dark horse that surprises investors. Keep an eye on this one—it might just be the next big thing. Conclusion Based on the latest research, the best meme coins to keep an eye on are Troller Cat, Floki Inu, Turbo, Bonk, Popcat, and Notcoin. However, Troller Cat stands out as the next big meme coin with its potential for huge returns and unique features like its rumored deflationary P2E model and staking rewards.

Buffett’s net worth is now $153.5 billion after surging $11.5 billion this year alone, reports Bloomberg. Buffett’s gains stand out amid the tariff-induced selloff triggered by President Trump, which wiped trillions of dollars from global equities. And his gains come despite this month’s sell off, which reduced Buffett’s 2025 winnings by $14.5 billion. Buffett, who is now ranked fourth among global billionaires, is one of only two in the top 20 that grew richer this year. He’s alongside L’Oreal heiress Francoise Bettencourt Meyers, who has added $1.8 billion. After the tariff news hit, the top 500 billionaires shed over $500 billion in just two days. Elon Musk alone suffered a $134 billion loss, with net worth now standing at about $297 billion. Meanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett’s conglomerate, saw an 8.8% share decline since April 2, outperforming the S&P 500’s 10.7% fall. The company’s relative resilience stems from its focus on the property and casualty sector, which remains less affected by global trade disruptions. Buffett has avoided major deals, while trimming stakes in Apple and Bank of America, which have both been hit hard by the tariffs.

This marks its first move under its newly introduced digital asset treasury strategy, which involves staking. Janover Stakes its SOL Holdings As part of its new strategy, Janover plans to commence staking of its SOL holdings, which will generate more revenue for the tech firm. The company takes this laudable step only a week after its Board of Directors formally approves a new treasury policy. This lays the foundation for accumulating crypto assets over the long term. Moreover, the board preferred Solana as the first asset for this initiative. The company’s management highlighted how this step represents the first capital deployment from the $42 million financing round that it previously closed. Noteworthy, Janover’s decision comes when market conditions are favorable to investors. Most of these stakers are getting significant returns from their investments. According to Joseph Onorati, Janover’s CEO, the recent SOL purchase aligns with the company’s objective to become the most efficient and transparent platform for cryptocurrency accumulation in the public markets. Janover Plans to Operate Solana Validators Apart from staking the popular coin, Janover wants to operate a few Solana validators to improve its participation. Specifically, taking this step will allow the company to further participate in securing the Solana network while earning rewards that can be reinvested into the Janover treasury. In the company’s leadership opinion, this is a crucial move toward scaling its operations. More importantly, they are excited about the prospect that this will have no impact on Janover’s efficient capital deployment strategy. Solana Use Cases is on the Rise Again, this Janover move reflects Solana’s growing appeal, even among traditional financial institutions. Two weeks ago, top asset management firm BlackRock added its USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) to the Solana network. This expansion connected Traditional Finance (TradFi) with blockchain and included Solana in its ecosystem. Before then, Swiss-based digital asset company Taurus expanded its digital asset custody and token services to the Solana blockchain . This enabled banks to issue, manage, and securely store digital assets on Solana. Similarly, PayPal and Venmo users can now buy, sell, and hold LINK and SOL in their accounts.

Market trends indicate wallets between 1,000 and 10,000 Bitcoin are expanding at a rate higher than the 30-day average, reports CryptoQuant. Related Reading: From Joke To Juggernaut: Dogecoin Value Revolution Gets Nod From Global Asset Giant Large Investors Display High Confidence In Bitcoin The rise in the number of large crypto holders indicates rising confidence in the future of the cryptocurrency. These investors, usually not exchanges or mining pools, are important in maintaining the value of Bitcoin. Their increasing interest comes as Bitcoin’s market capitalization hits $1.58 trillion, with dominance over other cryptocurrencies at more than 60%. Bitcoin recently hit $83,400 before correcting slightly to settle above $80,000. The increase in these high wallet balances is consistent with Bitcoin’s recent price gains, indicating market strength despite external pressures. Large investor demand for Bitcoin is accelerating.

Typically bullish, signals strong investor confidence. pic.twitter.com/hR5Rumj6A6 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) April 10, 2025 Analysts Look To Price Gap Patterns For Future Projections Some market observers have offered their predictions on what direction the top digital asset may take next. An X (formerly Twitter) analyst by the name of Enzy Bitcoin says that Bitcoin usually goes up after the filling up of price gaps. The analyst mentioned the latest gap between $70,000 and $75,000, that Bitcoin may reach $130,000 in the near future based on historical trends. Source: CryptoQuant Another analyst, BitBull, equated Bitcoin’s stability to recent volatility in US stock markets. As the traditional markets have grappled with volatility, Bitcoin has remained firm above $80,000. Prices below $100,000 may still be acceptable entry points for investors, some experts say. BTC Long-Term Target Extremely Positive Looking further down the road, other market observers posted a very favorable prognosis for Bitcoin’s future only recently, emphasizing the significance of being cognizant of market cycles, particularly during pricing fluctuations like when in a bear trap. The analysts’ projection reads as unusually bullish, that perhaps Bitcoin may get to a whopping $250,000 price tag. This vision also predicts meaningful growth for major alternative cryptocurrencies. Market Cap Hits $1.58 Trillion While Recovery Keeps Momentum The latest price bounceback of the flagship crypto has taken its aggregate market value to $1.58 trillion when this report was made. This follows its appreciation by over $8,000 from recent lows, demonstrating the capability of the cryptocurrency to bounce back quickly from temporary declines. Related Reading: XRP ETF Launch Impresses Even In Bear Market, Says Analyst The market dominance of the cryptocurrency has also grown, currently standing at over 60% of the total crypto market capitalization. The dominance indicates that Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency and continues to attract investors who desire growth as well as a store of value. Although Bitcoin failed to sustain its short surge to $83,500, sustaining above $81,000 demonstrates resilience in the prevailing market environment.

Dogecoin’s path to $1 seems like a distant dream, while Shiba Inu’s 13% price jump lacks the fundamentals to back it up. Meanwhile, Ruvi AI (RUVI) is emerging as a game changer in the blockchain space, offering investors a much more profitable and stable opportunity. Set within a decentralized AI powered ecosystem, Ruvi is not just another crypto token; it’s a blueprint for scalable returns backed by innovation, real world utility and exceptional presale benefits. If you thought the 1160% ROI days in crypto were over, Ruvi AI is here to prove otherwise. The Problems with Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Dogecoin has its cultural appeal but the hard reality is it’s trading at cents and far from its all time highs. Even the most optimistic analysts are saying Doge won’t hit $1 for years and will need a speculative market and sustained celebrity endorsements to keep any momentum. Shiba Inu fares no better, with a 56% surge in trading volume only to reveal lackluster on-chain fundamentals. With a burn rate that has stalled and no deflationary measures, the SHIB token is more spark than fire for long term investors. Both tokens are symbols of meme culture and are held back by a lack of true innovation. Their legacy is in viral hype and speculative trading, neither of which deliver the consistent growth that today’s investors demand. What Makes Ruvi AI a Better Opportunity Ruvi AI turns the speculative crypto market on its head by providing an ecosystem for growth and utility. As the ultimate SuperApp for AI driven content, Ruvi allows users to generate text, image, audio and video content and get rewarded with $RUVI tokens. This isn’t a system built on fleeting market hype; it’s a self sustaining platform using blockchain to empower creators, businesses and developers. The Ruvi AI presale takes it to another level by offering incredible opportunities for early adopters to benefit from its tiered system. Unlike Dogecoin and Shiba Inu where ROI is dependent on market forces, Ruvi AI’s structure ensures its value grows with user engagement and ecosystem growth. VIP Tier Example: The Path to Extraordinary ROI The presale got investors attention fast and hit its first milestone just a few days after launch, raising over 100,000$ with more than 10M tokens sold. The benefits of Ruvi AI’s token system become clear when you look at its VIP bonus presale tiers. By buying 200,000 $RUVI tokens you get an 80% bonus, effectively doubling your holdings. With the presale price at $0.01, that means you can get into VIP 4 by investing $2,000. What does that mean for ROI when Ruvi AI’s utility driven token lists at $0.07? Your 200,000 tokens become 360,000 and their value is $25,200. That’s a 1160% ROI, showing the sheer potential of Ruvi compared to the uncertainty of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. For investors who won’t settle for mediocrity, the VIP 4 tier is the ultimate opportunity to maximize returns. Ruvi AI vs Meme Tokens There’s a reason Ruvi AI feels like a breath of fresh air in today’s crypto market. Where tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu collapse under the weight of speculative trading, Ruvi thrives on innovation and real world utility. Its decentralized model allows a community driven approach where token holders have governance rights and help shape its roadmap. Open to developers, contributors and content creators, Ruvi becomes more valuable the more it’s used. Meme tokens have little to offer beyond market sentiment and are especially vulnerable to price reversals, whale dumps and fading public interest. While Dogecoin waits for a bull market and Shiba Inu hopes for volume spikes, Ruvi AI is delivering immediate tangible value to its active users. A Smarter Future with Ruvi AI The crypto market is changing and so should your investment strategy. Ruvi AI is the intersection of community, utility and innovation, outperforming meme tokens in every way. Its presale mechanics offer unparalleled entry points, now is the time for forward thinking investors to get in. With a proven roadmap and built-in incentives like the VIP 4 tier, Ruvi AI isn’t just competing, it’s redefining what smart crypto investing looks like. Stop chasing speculative assets and start using an ecosystem that delivers gain potential while empowering its community to shape the future of blockchain and AI. Ruvi AI is the future of the digital economy.

The image shows the top five XRP wallets, with Uphold leading at 1.83% of the total XRP supply, followed by another large wallet holding 1.56%, identified by the community as one of the Bithumb wallets. Binance and Ripple also have several top positions, reinforcing the perception of strong institutional backing behind XRP. Top XRP Holders Revealed: Uphold, Binance, and Ripple Dominate with Billions in Reserves! Someone with unnamed hold approx 3 billion $XRP pic.twitter.com/jceBi8ryxz — Brett (@Brett_Crypto_X) April 10, 2025 Brett’s post pointed to the growing momentum surrounding XRP and emphasized how entities accumulating billions in tokens signal long-term confidence in the asset. Additionally, experts are increasingly encouraging retail investors to accumulate XRP, anticipating a pivotal role for the token in the future of finance. The concentration of such large amounts of tokens in institutional hands suggests that individual holders may have to move quickly to secure a meaningful position before broader adoption drives further demand. Institutional Dominance and the Road Ahead The image in Brett’s post revealed Uphold at the top with over 1.83 billion XRP, valued at around $3.7 billion. The second-highest wallet, now believed by the community to belong to Bithumb, holds over 1.56 billion XRP, worth approximately $3.1 billion. Binance, the largest global exchange, appears third with around $2.7 billion in holdings. Ripple controls two of the top five wallets, accounting for over 2.5 billion XRP combined. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Such heavy accumulation by institutions underscores a broader trend: increasing confidence in XRP’s future utility. Many analysts argue that XRP’s speed and low-cost transactions make it well-suited for cross-border payments and financial infrastructure, and this view appears to be supported by these major holdings. Now that Ripple is free to sell tokens to institutional investors , this adoption could rise rapidly in the coming months as regulatory clarity improves. Retail Investors May Face Pressure to Accumulate Several community responses to Brett’s post echoed a sense of urgency. One commenter remarked , “When giants are stacking billions in XRP, you don’t second guess, you accumulate.” This reflects a belief that the growing concentration of XRP in institutional wallets may limit availability for retail investors as adoption increases. Climbing the ranks of token holders has become significantly difficult . With over 3 billion XRP held collectively by the top three wallets alone, the data suggests that retail investors face an increasingly competitive landscape. One prominent XRP proponent recently stated that not holding at least 1,000 XRP is insanity . Brett and the broader XRP community message is clear: institutional interest is growing, and those who act early could benefit most.

Qubetics, Cosmos & Sonic Might Be the Smartest Picks of 2025",https://thecoinrise.com/looking-for-the-top-crypto-to-buy-qubetics-cosmos-sonic-might-be-the-smartest-picks-of-2025/,"Cosmos just gave the interoperability game a major glow-up. With the launch of Eureka on April 10, Cosmos transformed its IBC protocol from an in-house connector into a universal standard. This isn’t some copy-paste bridge job. Eureka lets Cosmos-based chains connect directly with Ethereum—natively. No clunky workarounds, no user drop-off, and no liquidity bleed. For developers building multichain apps with serious scale in mind, this is the roadmap. Cosmos isn’t just expanding; it’s redefining multichain architecture. That’s the kind of tech move that puts a token on any serious list of the top crypto to buy this year. Over on Sonic’s side, Fantom’s rebrand brought more than just a new name. Since January 2025, Sonic (S) has rolled out a full-scale upgrade focused on high-speed performance, streamlined interoperability, and revamped tokenomics with aggressive burning mechanisms. While S is still down nearly 40% for the year, large-scale trendlines show price movement hugging a key ascending support for 540+ days. That’s not noise; that’s a long-term base. Even with short-term pain, Sonic is bouncing off solid structural support—a classic recipe for those scouting the top crypto to buy on a technical reset. Now throw Qubetics into the mix—a project that isn’t patching holes but rebuilding the plumbing of digital finance from the ground up. The $TICS token powers a platform that’s solving what its predecessors fumbled: asset utility, legal compliance, and seamless interoperability. This isn’t a whitepaper dream—it’s a live infrastructure shift. And that’s exactly why Qubetics is drawing heavy attention from the smart money crowd sizing up the top crypto to buy with real-world upside. Qubetics ($TICS): Interoperability with Actual Utility Qubetics isn’t just building bridges—it’s laying down digital superhighways. The platform’s interoperability layer lets users, businesses, and entire institutions connect to multiple blockchains without friction. Whether it’s cross-border finance, data transfer, or tokenized identity flows, Qubetics runs on an architecture designed to unify ecosystems instead of fragmenting them. That matters when real-world value exchange is on the line. Qubetics’ decentralized framework makes it easy for a logistics company in Dallas to sync assets with a payment processor in Seoul, or for a freelance developer in Miami to tap into multi-chain liquidity without trusting a third-party bridge. For professionals, enterprises, and Web3-native users alike, Qubetics delivers cross-chain composability with security and compliance at the core. That’s why it’s front and center in every credible breakdown of the top crypto to buy for 2025. Qubetics Presale Snapshot & ROI Potential The Qubetics presale is currently in Stage 29. So far, more than 507 million $TICS tokens have been sold to over 24,600 holders, raising upwards of $16 million. The token price at this stage is $0.1573. Early buyers who entered at Stage 1 for $0.01 are already sitting on a 1473% gain. But it’s not too late. At $0.1573, $TICS still offers serious upside. If it hits $1, that’s a 535% return. At $5, it’s 3078%. At $6, it’s 3713%. At $10, that’s a 6256% ROI. And if $TICS reaches $15 after mainnet launch? That’s a 9434% return for current-stage buyers. It’s no stretch to say this is one of the best crypto presale opportunities going right now—and clearly a top crypto to buy before it hits major exchanges. Cosmos (ATOM): The Interoperability Blueprint The launch of Eureka marks a seismic shift for Cosmos. Until now, most multichain development relied on bridges—messy, slow, and usually centralized. With Eureka, Cosmos flipped the script by enabling true native interoperability between Ethereum and IBC-connected chains. This puts Cosmos in a whole new league. Developers can now create seamless dApps across ecosystems without liquidity fragmentation or user exit points. It turns Cosmos from an ecosystem play into a multichain nucleus. For any serious builder or backer looking for the top crypto to buy with structural potential, ATOM just got promoted. The timing couldn’t be better either. As more DeFi and NFT projects look for alternatives to slow, congested networks, Cosmos is stepping in with clean, secure, and scalable solutions. Sonic (S): Rebranded and Ready to Run Sonic (formerly Fantom) might be down 40% YTD, but don’t mistake the chart for the tech. Since its rebrand, Sonic has doubled down on infrastructure upgrades that include enhanced scalability, faster settlement, and deeply restructured tokenomics that lean on burning mechanisms to reduce supply. Sonic’s current trend suggests a wave-based correction, now entering a long-term accumulation phase. Price projections based on historical growth suggest S could climb significantly by 2026 and beyond. But the real setup? It’s technical. The asset has bounced off its ascending support line five times in 540+ days. That’s textbook base-building. For technical traders and early adopters chasing the top crypto to buy during cycle resets, Sonic is a prime candidate. The story here isn’t just a rebound. It’s a repositioning—and it could easily catch markets sleeping. Final Thoughts This isn’t about hype cycles or meme-fueled spikes. The top crypto to buy today comes down to one thing: infrastructure with purpose. Qubetics is addressing cross-chain finance with real utility and a presale that’s still hot. Cosmos is breaking multichain boundaries with native Ethereum interoperability. Sonic is laying low while building a bullish technical base. If timing is the key to crypto profits, these three names offer radically different but equally promising entries. For buyers eyeing the best 100x setups or short-term breakout cycles, this isn’t a list to scroll past. This is a lineup to act on. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs 1. Why is Qubetics considered a top crypto to buy in 2025? Qubetics offers unmatched utility through its interoperability infrastructure and is currently in a high-ROI presale stage. 2. How is Cosmos different after the Eureka upgrade? Cosmos now supports native IBC-to-Ethereum connections, eliminating bridges and boosting developer adoption. 3. What makes Sonic (S) a strong pick despite the 40% drop? Sonic’s ascending trendline and infrastructure reboot suggest long-term accumulation and bullish potential. 4. What is the current stage and price of the Qubetics presale? Stage 29 at $0.1573 per token, with 24,600+ holders and over $16 million raised. 5. Is Qubetics just for long-term holders? No. Its ongoing presale stage offers significant short-term ROI potential as well. The post Looking for the Top Crypto to Buy?

43229373,https://cryptonews.com/?p=350670,1744413543,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/43229373.jpeg,US Bitcoin Miners Prepare for Business Disruptions Due to China Tariffs,https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-miners-us-tariffs-escalate-disruption/,"Bitcoin (BTC) miners in the United States are preparing for business disruptions as the trade war between the US and China continues. On Thursday, April 9 the White House announced that the 125% import tax on China was in addition to a 20% tariff that President Trump imposed for China’s role in supplying fentanyl to the US. President Trump clarified that he has raised tariffs on Chinese goods by a total of 145% since taking office. Bitcoin Miners Face Increasing Buildout Costs While Trump’s newly enforced tariffs with China are having a major impact on the S&P 500, Bitcoin miners are also being hit hard . The US is heavily reliant on Bitcoin mining hardware produced in Southeast Asia, especially by companies like Bitmain , MicroBT, and Canaan. On April 2, Trump’s hiked tariffs also placed levies on Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia. These regions are home to some of the largest mining rig manufacturers. U.S. tariffs on Bitcoin mining machines just spiked across key manufacturing countries. China jumped from 25% to 54%. Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand went from 2% to over 20–30%. If U.S. demand drops, we could start seeing cheaper rigs show up abroad. pic.twitter.com/XQ2VlNTIij — Esprezzo (@Esprezzoapp) April 9, 2025 As a result, US-based miners that source equipment from these regions are facing business disruptions. ​​ Jaime McAvity, CEO of Cormint Data Systems – a US-based mining company – told Cryptonews that Cormint sources components from China including miners, transformers, pdus, power supplies and containers. “The tariffs will contribute to higher buildout costs,” McAvity said. “Miners that were manufactured in China are now completely uneconomical to import to the USA.” McAvity further stated that US firms that ordered equipment from China but have yet to take delivery will likely sell them in the Chinese market. “This will contribute to weaker demand and lower prices — creating an attractive investment opportunity for non-US based miners,” he said. Jill Ford, founder of Bitford Digital – a Texas-based company specializing in Bitcoin mining solutions and hosting services – told Cryptonews that the newly imposed China tariffs will hit American Bitcoin miners the hardest. According to Ford, US miners are now looking at a 22–36% increase in the cost of mining machines. “That kind of margin shift is significant – especially in an industry where efficiency is everything,” Ford said. “When US miners are forced to pay that much more per machine, it becomes incredibly difficult to remain competitive with international miners who aren’t facing the same cost pressures.” US miners face rising costs due to Trump's tariffs on China, potentially shifting $BTC mining offshore. Tariffs could increase equipment costs by 22-36%, impacting expansion plans. pic.twitter.com/NXaYkBvyNR — Alerts Via Web3 (@AlertsViaWeb3) April 9, 2025 Short-Term Disruption or Major Setback? Given this, Ford believes that the newly imposed US tariffs on China will create a major setback for the growth and global competitiveness of the American Bitcoin mining sector. For context, the American Bitcoin mining industry is an important player in the global market. The United States accounted for over 40% of the Bitcoin network’s global hashrate — the total computing power securing the Bitcoin protocol — at the end of 2024. Two US-based mining pools, Foundry USA and MARA Pool, accounted for over 38.5% of all blocks mined. According to TheMinerMag, Foundry USA grew its hashrate from 157 exahashes per second (EH/s) at the start of 2024 to roughly 280 EH/s by December. Yet with the majority of mining hardware being manufactured in China, Ford noted that US miners are looking at an added 36% cost per machine. “That kind of price hike will clearly force tough decisions. For many miners, it will no longer make economic sense to mine in the US – we can expect to see more mining operations shift overseas where equipment is more affordable and the market is healthier,” she stated. On the other hand, McAvity pointed out that as a result of the tariffs mining suppliers are in the process of onshoring production to the US – including Cormint. With this in mind, he views the tariffs with China as “a temporary business disruption.” “Since US production costs are higher than China, it will contribute to a long-term increase in costs, but it shouldn’t be too bad,” McAvity said. Echoing this, Ford remarked that it will be a smart move for US Bitcoin miners to start exploring alternatives from US-based manufacturers like Auradine, for example. “These alternatives are becoming more viable, and we’re already seeing global leaders like Whatsminer producing machines domestically. Bitmain is also planning to open a US warehouse this summer,” she said. Tariff’s Impact on Bitcoin Hashrate Higher operational costs in the US will make it less attractive for miners to expand their operations. However, miners in countries unaffected by the tariffs could gain a competitive edge. “The tariffs will likely slow hashrate growth in the US, but I don’t see them slowing global hashrate overall,” Ford said. “In fact, we’ll probably see hashrate continue to rise outside the US as mining operations shift to more cost-effective regions.” While this may be, McAvity pointed out that most miners with already installed Hashrate will likely welcome the slow growth in new Hashrate. Echoing this, Scott Offord, owner and founder of Bitcoin Mining World, told Cryptonews that the short-term effect might actually help existing miners with slightly better profitability. “Longer-term concerns about decentralization remain valid,” Offord said. “Miners should closely monitor how hashrate distribution shifts globally as a result.” US Bitcoin Miners Must Adapt or Die In addition to monitoring hashrate distribution, Ford stated that adaptability will be the key to success for US based miners. “Miners who diversify their supply chains and stay nimble will be in the best position to weather this,” she said. Shedding light on this, Offord advises Bitcoin miners dealing with tariffs to be proactive. “Secure existing in-stock inventory quickly, explore sourcing from lower-tariff countries, and prioritize partnerships with manufacturers assembling rigs in the USA. Optimize your current equipment’s lifespan and efficiency through careful maintenance and better tuning,” he said. Indeed, well-prepared Bitcoin miners will likely be impacted much less. Zach Bradford, CEO of US-based Bitcoin miner CleanSpark, told Cryptonews that CleanSpark is prepared for the tariffs, noting that the majority of the company’s miners and infrastructure required to meet near-term goals are already stateside. “While these tariffs may slow down competitors who lack our scale and resilience, we’re confident in our ability to maintain our momentum and lead the industry forward,” Bradford said.

Adding fuel to the fire, whispers of looming Trump tariffs are sending shivers down the spines of tech innovators, especially those dreaming of moonshot projects . Let’s dive into the week’s biggest tech letdowns and potential economic earthquakes, unpacked from Bitcoin World’s Equity podcast. Meta’s Llama Launch: A Damp Squib in the AI Race? Meta’s grand unveiling of its latest AI models was met with a collective ‘meh’ from the tech community. Despite being touted as the next leap in “open-ish” AI, Scout, Maverick, and Behemoth failed to ignite the expected excitement. Critics were quick to point out a distinct lack of innovation, a crucial element in today’s fiercely competitive AI race . Was this a genuine misstep, or something more calculated? The plot thickened as accusations of benchmark tampering began to surface on social media platforms like X and Reddit. Whispers of a mysterious ex-employee and discrepancies between public and private performance metrics added layers of intrigue to the Meta Llama saga. The attempt to regain the spotlight quickly devolved into a PR headache for the tech giant. Here’s a quick rundown of the key concerns surrounding Meta’s Llama release: Underwhelming Performance: Critics argue the models don’t represent a significant leap forward, especially compared to competitors. Benchmark Tampering Allegations: Rumors suggest Meta might have manipulated benchmarks to inflate the perceived performance of their models. Performance Discrepancies: Questions arise about the gap between how the models perform in controlled, private settings versus real-world, public applications. PR Backlash: The messy rollout and accusations have damaged Meta’s reputation in the AI space. Is Meta prioritizing impressive test scores over genuine, business-driving innovation? As Kirsten from Equity podcast aptly put it, “creating something to do well on a test doesn’t always translate to good business.” Trump Tariffs: A Looming Threat to Tech Innovation? Beyond the Meta Llama drama, another significant concern is the potential impact of Trump tariffs . The podcast episode delves into Trump’s renewed push for tariffs and how companies are bracing for potential economic fallout. While the specifics are still unfolding, the implications for moonshot projects and the broader tech industry are substantial. Why are tariffs a worry for innovative ventures? Increased Costs: Tariffs raise the price of imported components and materials, essential for many tech products, including AI hardware and infrastructure. Supply Chain Disruptions: Trade wars and tariffs can create uncertainty and instability in global supply chains, hindering production and innovation. Reduced Investment: Economic uncertainty due to tariffs can deter investment in long-term, high-risk projects like moonshot projects . Global Competitiveness: Tariffs can make domestic companies less competitive in the global market, especially in fast-evolving sectors like AI. For startups and companies pursuing ambitious, long-term goals, Trump tariffs represent a significant headwind. These projects often rely on global collaboration, international talent, and access to worldwide markets. Tariffs could stifle the very innovation they aim to foster. Beyond Llama and Tariffs: Other Highlights from Equity Podcast The Equity podcast episode wasn’t just about Meta Llama and Trump Tariffs . Here’s a quick peek at other fascinating topics discussed: Secretive EV Startup Backed by Bezos: Uncover the mystery surrounding Slate Auto, a Bezos-backed EV startup, and whether it’s his ‘Plan B’ in the electric vehicle space. Colossal Biosciences’ Dire Wolf Discovery: Explore the groundbreaking Dire Wolf discovery by Colossal Biosciences and question whether this breakthrough truly justifies the startup’s massive $10B+ valuation. Stay Tuned for More Insights This week’s Equity podcast episode provides a crucial snapshot of the tech world’s current anxieties and excitements. From the Meta Llama launch failing to impress to the looming threat of Trump tariffs on moonshot projects , and the intriguing developments in the EV and biotech sectors, there’s a lot to unpack.

43229650,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148832,1744414221,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Data Privacy Scrutiny: Ireland Investigates X’s Alarming Grok AI Training Tactics,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ireland-investigates-x-grok-data/,"Hold onto your data! In a move that’s sending ripples through the tech world, Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC) has launched a formal investigation into Elon Musk’s social media giant, X. The probe centers around concerns that X might be leveraging the European user data to fuel the training of its generative AI model, Grok. This development raises critical questions about data privacy and the boundaries of AI development, especially under the stringent regulations of GDPR. Why is Ireland’s DPC Investigating X Over Grok AI Training? The heart of the matter lies in how X is processing publicly accessible posts from European users. The DPC, known for its robust enforcement of GDPR , wants to determine if X has a legitimate legal basis for using this data to train its Grok AI chatbot. This investigation is not just a slap on the wrist; it’s a serious inquiry into whether X is playing by the rules when it comes to handling the personal information of its European users in the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence. Here’s a breakdown of what we know: The Trigger: The DPC initiated the investigation following concerns about X potentially using European users’ public posts for AI training purposes. GDPR at the Forefront: The investigation hinges on the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which mandates companies to have a valid legal basis for processing personal data. Powerful Regulator: Ireland’s DPC isn’t a newcomer to holding tech giants accountable. They have a track record of issuing substantial fines to major players like Microsoft, TikTok, and Meta. Past Actions: Interestingly, the DPC had already sought a court order last year to restrict X from using European user data for AI training models , indicating a pre-existing concern. What Does This Mean for Your Data Privacy? This investigation shines a spotlight on the often-murky waters of data privacy in the age of AI. Many users are unaware of how their publicly posted data might be used to train these powerful AI models. The DPC’s probe aims to clarify these practices and ensure that companies like X are transparent and compliant with regulations like GDPR when it comes to user data. Key Takeaways for Users: Awareness is Key: Be mindful that your public posts on platforms like X could potentially be used to train AI. GDPR Protection: If you are a European user, GDPR is in place to protect your data privacy rights. Regulatory Scrutiny: Regulators are actively examining how tech companies use data for AI training , signaling increased oversight in this area. The Shadow of GDPR: What Fines Could X Face? The stakes are incredibly high for X. Under GDPR , Ireland’s DPC has the authority to impose fines of up to 4% of a company’s global revenue. For a company the size of X, this could translate into billions of dollars. The precedent set by previous DPC fines against Meta, totaling nearly 3 billion euros, underscores the potential financial repercussions. This investigation serves as a stark reminder that non-compliance with GDPR can lead to significant financial penalties. Potential Implications of GDPR Fines: Aspect Details GDPR Fines Up to 4% of global revenue DPC’s Track Record History of substantial fines against tech companies Financial Impact on X Potentially billions of dollars in fines Industry-Wide Impact Sets a precedent for data privacy in AI training across the tech industry Grok AI and the Data Dilemma: How Much Data is Too Much? X’s AI venture, xAI, and its chatbot Grok are at the center of this controversy. The question arises: how much European user data is being used, and is it being done ethically and legally? While AI models require vast amounts of data for effective AI training , the source and usage of this data are under increasing scrutiny. The investigation highlights the ongoing debate about balancing innovation in AI with the fundamental rights of data privacy . The Data Question for Grok AI: Data Sources: Where exactly is Grok AI getting its training data from, specifically from European users? Opt-in vs. Opt-out: Was there clear and informed consent from users regarding the use of their data for AI training ? Transparency: Is X being transparent about its data usage practices for Grok AI? Ethical Considerations: Beyond legal compliance, are there ethical implications to using public user data for AI training models without explicit consent? Looking Ahead: The Future of Data Privacy and AI Training The Ireland DPC’s investigation into X is more than just a company-specific issue; it’s a bellwether for the future of data privacy in the age of AI. As AI models become increasingly sophisticated and data-hungry, regulatory bodies worldwide are likely to intensify their scrutiny of data handling practices. This investigation could set crucial precedents for how companies can ethically and legally utilize user data for AI training while respecting GDPR and similar data protection frameworks. The outcome will be closely watched by tech companies, regulators, and users alike, as it will shape the evolving landscape of AI development and European user data rights.

The change of gears could be attributed to the commission of the newly formed SEC Crypto Task Force, whose mandate is to harmonize securities laws for digital assets. 🚨NEW: The @SECGov and @binance have jointly asked the court to pause the case against the exchange for another 60 days. According to a recent filing, they’ve had “productive” talks, partly tied to the Crypto Task Force’s work, and say a continued pause is in everyone’s best… pic.twitter.com/0vH5MiE8wr — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) April 11, 2025 In the court documents filed to the US District Court, the lawyers of the SEC and Binance agreed to reveal “constructive communications” about the case. The parties agreed that the pause would be enough to negotiate and obtain the necessary approvals. In 2023, the SEC sued Binance for operating an unregistered clearing agency, broker, and exchange via its U.S. affiliate. The regulator also accused Binance of misusing customer assets and altering trading volumes on its U.S. platform. The recent filing reveals that more consideration has been given to how the SEC’s Crypto Task Force might bear on its case against Binance. This task force was created earlier this year to improve the regulation of the crypto industry, which has defined contemporary cases. As a response, the SEC and Binance have also contended that the continuance of the stay is in the best interest of the judicial economy. The current pause was intended to end on Monday but can be actually extended for the next 60 days if provided by the court. Binance’s legal troubles continue Binance has faced numerous legal issues since its formation in 2023. The SEC’s lawsuit accused Binance and CZ of bypassing US laws to get richer while subjecting investors to risks. In November 2023, CZ resigned from the CEO position and entered a plea before the DOJ on money laundering and money-transmitting business without a license. In the DOJ case, Binance consented to settle for more than $4 billion in fines. CZ was convicted in April 2024 and was given a four-month imprisonment but was later released in September of the same year. Binance continues to operate despite regulations and is also involved in the SEC-formed working group. Formed in February 2025, the task force aims to establish clear guidelines for digital assets. Such a broad policy can be considered an important move in shifting regulation clarification. Ripple and SEC near final settlement approval In another related development, Ripple Labs and the SEC draw closer to an end to a legal battle. Since both parties have filed cross-motions to stay their appeals pending settlement of the case, both appeals were withdrawn. This filing submitted to the U.S Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit affirms the existence of an agreement in principle. Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, publicly stated that the SEC would withdraw some components of the appeal related to the July 2023 ruling, which was beneficial for Ripple. However, the SEC must review and ratify the proposed plan. According to the legal representatives, more time would also be required for the SEC Commission to approve the resolution. After approval, the District Court would deliver an indicative ruling to complete the settlement. Market analysts have predicted approval to happen in sync with the appointment of Paul Atkins as SEC Chairman. Atkins, a nominee under the current Trump administration, received Senate approval recently and is expected to assume office shortly. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

They’ve integrated USD1, a U.S. dollar stablecoin linked to World Liberty Financial – a project connected to the family of former U.S. President Donald Trump – as a new collateral asset . This move is generating buzz and sparking conversations across the crypto community. Let’s dive into what this means for users, the market, and the future of stablecoins. What’s the Buzz About Falcon Finance and USD1 Stablecoin? For those unfamiliar, Falcon Finance is a stablecoin issuer that has been making waves in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Backed by DWF Labs, a well-known entity in the crypto investment and web3 space, Falcon Finance aims to provide robust and reliable stablecoin solutions. Now, they’re taking a bold step by adding USD1 to their list of supported collateral assets. USD1 stablecoin itself is quite interesting. It’s a U.S. dollar pegged stablecoin issued by World Liberty Financial. What makes it particularly noteworthy is its association with World Liberty Financial, a project driven by the family of Donald Trump. This connection instantly adds a layer of intrigue and, for some, perhaps even controversy, given the polarizing nature of the Trump name in global politics and finance. Why is Adding USD1 as Collateral Asset a Big Deal? So, why is Falcon Finance’s decision to include USD1 as a collateral asset significant? Let’s break down the key benefits and implications: Expanded Options for Users: Adding USD1 broadens the spectrum of assets users can leverage within the Falcon Finance ecosystem. This increased choice is always a welcome development, giving users more flexibility in managing their crypto portfolios. Potential for Increased Liquidity: Introducing a new, potentially popular stablecoin like USD1 as collateral can boost liquidity within Falcon Finance’s platform. Higher liquidity generally translates to smoother transactions and potentially better yields for users engaging in DeFi activities like lending and borrowing. Market Diversification: By supporting USD1, Falcon Finance is diversifying its collateral base. This reduces reliance on a single or limited number of assets and can contribute to a more robust and resilient platform overall. Attracting a New User Base?: The Trump family association with USD1 might attract a specific segment of users who are politically aligned or simply curious about projects linked to prominent figures. This could potentially expand Falcon Finance’s user base and market reach. Navigating the Landscape: Benefits and Challenges of USD1 Collateral While the addition of USD1 as a collateral asset presents several advantages, it’s crucial to consider both the potential benefits and challenges. Here’s a balanced perspective: Benefits: Novelty Factor: USD1’s unique background can generate media attention and user interest simply due to its connection to the Trump family. This novelty could be a powerful marketing tool and draw in curious investors. Potential for Growth: If World Liberty Financial and the USD1 stablecoin project gain traction, early integration as a collateral asset could position Falcon Finance favorably in a growing market. Ideological Alignment (for some): For individuals who are supporters of Donald Trump or his political ideologies, USD1 might represent a stablecoin that resonates with their values, potentially leading to increased adoption within this demographic. Challenges: Political Polarization: The Trump name is highly divisive. Associating with USD1 could alienate users who are politically opposed to Trump, potentially limiting the broader appeal of Falcon Finance. Regulatory Scrutiny: Projects with high-profile or politically connected figures often face increased regulatory attention. USD1 and Falcon Finance might be subject to closer examination by regulatory bodies. Reputational Risks: Any controversies or negative press associated with Donald Trump or his family could indirectly impact the reputation of USD1 and, by extension, platforms like Falcon Finance that support it. Market Volatility and Trust: Like all stablecoins, USD1 will need to maintain its peg to the U.S. dollar. Market volatility and any doubts about its reserves or operational transparency could erode trust and negatively affect its viability as collateral. USD1 Stablecoin and Falcon Finance: A Deeper Dive To better understand the implications, let’s consider some key aspects in more detail: Feature Falcon Finance USD1 Stablecoin Type Stablecoin Issuer & DeFi Platform U.S. Dollar Pegged Stablecoin Backing DWF Labs World Liberty Financial (Trump Family Linked) Function Provides stablecoin solutions, now accepts USD1 as collateral Aims to be a reliable digital representation of the U.S. dollar Significance of Collaboration Expands collateral options, potentially increases liquidity and user base Gains wider platform adoption, enhances visibility Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? So, what should crypto users and investors make of this development? Here are some actionable insights: For Falcon Finance Users: If you are already using Falcon Finance, the addition of USD1 gives you more options for collateralizing your positions. Explore how this new asset can fit into your DeFi strategies. For USD1 Holders: If you hold USD1, its inclusion as collateral on Falcon Finance increases its utility and potential use cases within the DeFi ecosystem. For DeFi Enthusiasts: Keep an eye on how USD1 performs as collateral on Falcon Finance. Monitor its liquidity, stability, and user adoption. This could be an interesting case study of how politically connected or novelty stablecoins fare in the market. Due Diligence is Key: As with any crypto investment or platform, always conduct thorough research. Understand the risks associated with both Falcon Finance and USD1 before engaging with them. Pay attention to audits, transparency reports, and community sentiment. Conclusion: A Bold Move with Potential and Questions Falcon Finance’s decision to add USD1 stablecoin as a collateral asset is undoubtedly a bold and attention-grabbing move. It introduces a unique element into the DeFi landscape – a stablecoin with direct ties to a prominent political family. While this could bring benefits like increased user interest and market diversification, it also comes with potential challenges related to political polarization, regulatory scrutiny, and reputational risks. The success of this integration will depend on various factors, including the performance and stability of USD1, the broader market response, and how effectively Falcon Finance navigates the potential challenges. It’s a development worth watching closely as it unfolds in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency and stablecoins.

43229928,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148865,1744414814,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Landmark Crypto Regulation: Pakistan Proposes Essential Compliance Framework,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/pakistan-crypto-regulation-framework/,"In a significant move for the digital asset landscape, Pakistan is stepping up its game in the cryptocurrency arena. The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has unveiled a proposed regulatory framework specifically designed for cryptocurrencies. This isn’t just another set of rules; it’s a compliance-focused approach meticulously crafted to align with the stringent guidelines set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). For anyone involved in or observing the crypto space in Pakistan, this development is essential to understand. Understanding Cryptocurrency Regulation in Pakistan The core of this initiative is the proposed cryptocurrency regulation in Pakistan . Spearheaded by the FIA, this framework is not about stifling innovation but about fostering a secure and compliant environment for digital currencies to thrive. According to reports from Cointelegraph, the primary objective is to ensure adherence to international standards, particularly those concerning terrorism financing, anti-money laundering (AML), and know-your-customer (KYC) procedures. This move signals a maturing perspective on digital assets within Pakistan, acknowledging their potential while prioritizing national security and financial integrity. Key aspects of the proposed cryptocurrency regulation in Pakistan include: Focus on FATF Compliance: The framework is built around the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force, an intergovernmental body setting global standards on money laundering and terrorist financing. Balancing Innovation and Security: FIA Director Sumera Azam emphasized that the regulations aim to strike a delicate balance. The goal is to encourage technological advancement in the digital currency sector without compromising national security. Addressing Financial Crimes: A major driver behind this regulatory push is to combat the potential misuse of cryptocurrencies for illicit activities, including money laundering and terrorism financing. Protecting Investors: By implementing KYC processes and AML measures, the framework seeks to create a safer environment for individuals and institutions engaging with cryptocurrencies in Pakistan. Why FATF Crypto Compliance is Crucial The emphasis on FATF crypto compliance is not arbitrary. FATF’s recommendations are globally recognized benchmarks for combating financial crimes. For Pakistan, adhering to these standards is particularly important for several reasons: International Recognition and Trust: Compliance with FATF guidelines enhances Pakistan’s credibility within the international financial community. It signals that the nation is serious about tackling financial crime and operating within global norms. Avoiding the Grey List: Pakistan has been under increased scrutiny from FATF in the past. Robust FATF crypto compliance measures can help prevent being placed on or remaining on the FATF grey list, which can have negative economic repercussions. Facilitating International Collaboration: A compliant framework makes it easier for Pakistan to collaborate with other nations in combating cross-border financial crimes involving cryptocurrencies. Promoting Responsible Crypto Adoption: By aligning with FATF standards, Pakistan can encourage the responsible adoption of cryptocurrencies, attracting legitimate businesses and investments while deterring illicit activities. AML and KYC: Cornerstones of Pakistan’s Crypto Framework At the heart of the proposed regulations are Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) processes. These are not new concepts in traditional finance, but their application to the crypto world in Pakistan is a critical development. Effective AML KYC Pakistan measures are designed to: AML (Anti-Money Laundering) KYC (Know Your Customer) Purpose: To prevent the use of the financial system for money laundering, which is the process of making illegally-gained proceeds appear legitimate. Purpose: To verify the identity of customers to prevent identity theft, financial fraud, money laundering, and terrorist financing. Measures: Transaction monitoring, reporting suspicious activities, record-keeping, and compliance programs. Measures: Customer identification procedures (CIP), customer due diligence (CDD), and ongoing monitoring of customer activity. Benefits in Crypto Context: Reduces the risk of cryptocurrencies being used for illicit activities, protects the integrity of the financial system. Benefits in Crypto Context: Enhances security, prevents fraud, and builds trust in the crypto ecosystem, making it safer for users. For cryptocurrency exchanges and service providers operating in Pakistan, robust AML KYC Pakistan compliance will be non-negotiable under the new framework. This will likely involve implementing systems and procedures to verify user identities, monitor transactions for suspicious patterns, and report any illicit activities to the relevant authorities. The Broader Pakistan Crypto Framework: Balancing Act Beyond AML and KYC, the overall Pakistan crypto framework aims to create a structured and balanced ecosystem. It’s not just about restrictions; it’s about providing a clear pathway for the development and adoption of digital currencies within a regulated environment. This framework is expected to address several key areas: Licensing and Registration: Establishments dealing with cryptocurrencies may need to obtain licenses and register with regulatory bodies to operate legally in Pakistan. Taxation: The framework may clarify the tax implications of cryptocurrency transactions and holdings, providing clarity for both businesses and individuals. Consumer Protection: Regulations could include measures to protect consumers from fraud, scams, and market manipulation within the crypto space. Innovation and Growth: While compliance is paramount, the framework is also expected to foster innovation by providing a clear and predictable regulatory landscape for crypto businesses to operate and grow. Navigating the Pakistan Digital Currency Policy Landscape The proposed regulatory framework is a significant step in shaping Pakistan digital currency policy . It reflects a pragmatic approach, acknowledging the global trend towards digital assets while prioritizing risk management and compliance. For stakeholders in the crypto space, including investors, businesses, and technology enthusiasts, understanding this evolving policy landscape is crucial. Actionable Insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of the latest developments in Pakistan’s cryptocurrency regulations. Follow updates from the FIA and other relevant government bodies. Prepare for Compliance: If you are operating a crypto-related business in Pakistan, start preparing for stricter AML and KYC requirements. Invest in compliance infrastructure and training. Engage with Regulators: Participate in industry consultations and dialogues with regulators to contribute to the development of effective and balanced regulations. Educate Users: Promote user education on the importance of compliance, security, and responsible crypto practices. Conclusion: A Promising Step Towards a Regulated Crypto Future Pakistan’s proposed compliance-focused regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies is a promising development. It signals a move towards a more structured and secure digital asset ecosystem. By prioritizing FATF compliance, AML, and KYC, Pakistan is taking proactive steps to mitigate risks while potentially unlocking the benefits of cryptocurrency innovation. While challenges may lie ahead in implementation and adaptation, this framework represents a significant leap forward in the evolution of Pakistan digital currency policy .

43230068,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148867,1744415111,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Unstoppable ChatGPT Dominates Global App Download Charts, Surpassing TikTok and Instagram",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/chatgpt-dominates-app-downloads/,"In a remarkable turn of events in the ever-evolving digital landscape, ChatGPT has achieved a feat that underscores its growing influence and user adoption. Forget doomscrolling on social media for a moment, because the AI chatbot that’s been on everyone’s lips (and screens) has just hit a major milestone. ChatGPT became the most downloaded app worldwide in March, dethroning the usual suspects like Instagram and TikTok from their top spots in the global app arena. Let’s dive into the details of this impressive surge and what it means for the future of AI and mobile applications. ChatGPT’s Astonishing Ascent to the Top of App Downloads March marked an unprecedented month for ChatGPT, as it soared to become the world’s most downloaded app, excluding games. This isn’t just a minor victory; it’s a seismic shift in the download charts . For the first time, ChatGPT has claimed the monthly download crown, surpassing established giants like Instagram and TikTok. This milestone is not just a testament to ChatGPT’s popularity but also highlights the increasing mainstream adoption of AI technology. Here’s a breakdown of ChatGPT’s phenomenal March performance: Record-Breaking Downloads: ChatGPT amassed a staggering 46 million new downloads in March alone. Month-over-Month Growth: Installs jumped by an impressive 28% compared to February. Chart-Topping Position: This surge propelled ChatGPT to the No. 1 position, outperforming Instagram (No. 2) and TikTok (No. 3). This data, recently reported by app intelligence provider Appfigures, paints a clear picture: ChatGPT is not just a trending topic; it’s a dominant force in the global app market. What Fueled ChatGPT’s Download Surge? While the raw numbers are impressive, it’s crucial to understand what factors contributed to this massive spike in app downloads . Several upgrades and market dynamics appear to have played a significant role: Image Generation Upgrade: March saw the first major enhancement to ChatGPT’s image generation capabilities in over a year. This update sparked viral trends, particularly the Studio Ghibli style image generation, captivating users and driving engagement. Content Moderation Adjustments: OpenAI’s decision to remove some content moderation safeguards for images likely broadened the creative possibilities and appeal of ChatGPT. AI Voice Feature Upgrade: Improvements to ChatGPT’s AI voice feature further enhanced user experience and utility. However, Appfigures suggests that these feature upgrades might not be the sole drivers of this download frenzy. The firm’s founder and CEO, Ariel Michaeli, offers a compelling perspective: “It’s starting to feel like ChatGPT is becoming a verb, a lot like how Google did in the 2000s, to the point where many don’t think ‘AI’ but rather ‘ChatGPT.” This “ChatGPT as a verb” phenomenon suggests that the chatbot’s brand recognition is becoming synonymous with AI itself. When people think of AI, or hear about exciting developments in the field, ChatGPT is often the first application that comes to mind. This brand power could be a significant factor in its download charts success. The ChatGPT Effect: Brand Recognition and AI Dominance ChatGPT’s brand recognition isn’t just a marketing buzzword; it’s a tangible advantage in the competitive landscape of AI chatbots . Michaeli’s observation highlights a crucial point: ChatGPT’s name is now so deeply ingrained in the public consciousness that it benefits from the overall excitement surrounding AI, even from the buzz generated by its competitors. Consider these points regarding ChatGPT’s brand power: First-Mover Advantage: ChatGPT gained significant traction early on, establishing itself as the go-to AI chatbot for many users. Name Recognition: The name “ChatGPT” is now widely recognized and understood, even by those less familiar with AI technology. Halo Effect: Excitement around AI in general, including competitors like Grok or Claude, often inadvertently drives users to download ChatGPT due to its dominant brand presence. This brand dominance poses a challenge for other AI chatbots . Anthropic’s Claude, for instance, reportedly faces an uphill battle in achieving comparable download numbers, not necessarily due to technological inferiority, but partly due to weaker brand recognition. Grok, backed by Elon Musk, might fare better due to Musk’s personal brand and the X platform for distribution, showcasing the power of brand association in the AI space. TikTok and Instagram: Still Major Players in the App Arena While ChatGPT stole the spotlight in March, it’s essential to acknowledge the continued dominance of Instagram and TikTok in the global app ecosystem. These platforms have consistently held top positions in download charts and remain incredibly popular worldwide. Here’s a quick look at their recent performance and influence: App Previous Ranking (Jan-Feb 2025) March 2025 Ranking Key Factors TikTok No. 1 No. 3 Earlier download surge due to potential US ban concerns; still a social media giant. Instagram No. 2 No. 2 Held No. 1 position throughout 2024; strong popularity, especially among US teens. Instagram’s consistent popularity, particularly among younger demographics in the US, is highlighted by a Piper Sandler survey, which found it to be the most-used social app among U.S. teens (87% monthly usage), surpassing TikTok (79%) and Snapchat (72%). The Broader App Download Landscape Beyond the top three, March’s download charts reflect the continued strength of social media and communication apps. Meta’s Facebook and WhatsApp rounded out the top 5, while other notable apps in the top 10 included CapCut, Telegram, Snapchat, Meta’s Threads, and Temu. Collectively, the top 10 apps garnered an impressive 339 million downloads in March, exceeding February’s 299 million, indicating a robust and growing app market. Conclusion: The Dawn of the AI App Era? ChatGPT’s ascent to the top of the global app download charts is more than just a statistical anomaly; it’s a powerful indicator of shifting user behavior and the increasing centrality of AI in our digital lives. While social media giants like Instagram and TikTok remain formidable, ChatGPT’s triumph signals a potential new era – one where AI-powered applications are not just niche tools but mainstream utilities, shaping how we interact with technology daily. The brand recognition ChatGPT has cultivated, combined with ongoing advancements in AI capabilities, positions it as a frontrunner in this evolving landscape. As AI continues to permeate various aspects of our lives, ChatGPT’s download charts success may well be a harbinger of things to come – a future where AI chatbots and similar applications play an even more prominent role in the mobile app ecosystem.

In a surprising turn, Binance Research’s latest report suggests otherwise. While traditional markets, particularly the U.S. Treasury market, grapple with heightened volatility and the looming threat of carry trade liquidations, Bitcoin appears to be showing unexpected resilience. Let’s dive into the key findings of this intriguing report and explore what it means for the future of crypto investments. Is Bitcoin Volatility Really Tamer Than We Think? For years, Bitcoin volatility has been a double-edged sword. It’s attracted adventurous investors seeking high returns, but simultaneously deterred more risk-averse institutional players. However, the narrative might be shifting. Binance Research’s report highlights that despite increased correlation with broader market trends, Bitcoin’s price swings haven’t been as dramatic as one might expect, especially when juxtaposed against the turbulence in the U.S. Treasury market. Key Takeaways from Binance Research on Bitcoin Volatility: Unexpected Stability: Bitcoin’s realized volatility is currently lower than many anticipated, considering the macroeconomic uncertainties. Treasury Market Turmoil: The U.S. Treasury market is exhibiting significant volatility, creating potential risks for carry trades. Correlation, Not Chaos: While Bitcoin’s correlation with traditional markets has increased, it hasn’t necessarily translated into amplified volatility for the cryptocurrency itself. Central Bank Lifeline?: The report suggests that potential liquidity support from global central banks could act as a buffer, providing a safety net for the crypto market. Factor Impact on Bitcoin Volatility U.S. Treasury Market Volatility Potential to increase market-wide risk sentiment, but Bitcoin’s volatility remains comparatively contained. Increased Market Correlation Leads to some influence from traditional market movements, but not necessarily heightened Bitcoin-specific volatility. Central Bank Liquidity Support Could act as a stabilizing force, potentially further reducing perceived and actual crypto volatility . Crypto Volatility vs. Traditional Market Turmoil: A Stark Contrast? The report underscores a crucial point: while the cryptocurrency market is often perceived as a hotbed of volatility, traditional financial instruments, particularly government bonds, are currently facing their own set of challenges. The U.S. Treasury market, a cornerstone of global finance, is experiencing fluctuations that are raising eyebrows and triggering concerns about broader financial stability. This situation puts the spotlight on crypto volatility in a new light. Is it possible that in certain macroeconomic climates, Bitcoin could actually represent a relatively less volatile asset compared to segments of the traditional financial system? Treasury Market Jitters: Why Should Crypto Investors Care? Why should cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors pay attention to the rumblings in the treasury market ? The answer lies in interconnectedness. Financial markets, despite their diverse asset classes, are not isolated islands. Volatility in the U.S. Treasury market, often considered a benchmark for global risk-free rates, can have ripple effects across the entire financial landscape. Here’s why it matters for crypto: Risk Sentiment: Treasury market instability can heighten overall risk aversion in the market. This can lead investors to reduce exposure to perceived ‘riskier’ assets, including cryptocurrencies. Carry Trade Liquidations: The report mentions the risk of carry trade liquidations. In simple terms, carry trades involve borrowing in a low-interest-rate currency to invest in a higher-yielding asset. Volatility in the treasury market can disrupt these strategies, potentially leading to forced selling and market downturns, impacting all asset classes, including crypto. Liquidity Concerns: Treasury market stress can sometimes signal broader liquidity issues in the financial system. Liquidity is the lifeblood of any market, and its contraction can negatively affect asset prices. Central Banks to the Rescue? Potential Liquidity Support The Binance Research report offers a glimmer of hope amidst the market uncertainty. It suggests that potential liquidity support from global central banks could provide a cushion for the cryptocurrency market. Central banks play a crucial role in maintaining financial stability. In times of market stress, they can inject liquidity into the system to prevent credit crunches and market meltdowns. How could this benefit crypto? Market Stabilization: Central bank intervention can calm market nerves and reduce overall volatility, benefiting all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Improved Liquidity: Increased liquidity in the broader financial system can trickle down to the crypto market, making trading smoother and potentially supporting price levels. Investor Confidence: Central bank support can signal a commitment to financial stability, boosting investor confidence and potentially attracting more capital to the crypto space. Navigating the Current Market Landscape: Actionable Insights So, what are the actionable takeaways for crypto investors from this Binance Research report? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on macroeconomic developments, particularly in the U.S. Treasury market and any signals from global central banks. Manage Risk: While Bitcoin volatility might be lower than expected currently, the crypto market is still inherently volatile. Ensure your portfolio risk is aligned with your risk tolerance. Diversification: Diversification remains a prudent strategy. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, even if that basket is Bitcoin. Consider diversifying across different cryptocurrencies and asset classes. Long-Term Perspective: Focus on the long-term fundamentals of the crypto market and individual projects. Short-term volatility, even if surprisingly contained, is still a factor. Conclusion: A Silver Lining in Market Uncertainty? Binance Research’s report offers a fascinating perspective on the current market dynamics. The finding that Bitcoin volatility is lower than expected, especially amidst the turbulence in the U.S. Treasury market, is noteworthy. While caution remains paramount in navigating the crypto landscape, the potential for central bank support and the relative stability of Bitcoin compared to some traditional market segments could present a powerful silver lining for crypto enthusiasts. The situation is fluid, and continuous monitoring is key, but this report certainly provides food for thought and a potentially more optimistic outlook than some might have anticipated.

This decision follows what both parties described as “productive discussions” and will provide more time for further deliberations. US SEC and Binance Agree To Pause Legal Proceedings The SEC initially sued Binance in 2023, accusing the exchange and its executives, including former CEO Changpeng Zhao, of violating federal securities laws, who is now the Strategic Advisor to Pakistan’s Crypto Council. The charges centred on Binance’s operation as an unlicensed clearing agency, broker, and exchange. Additional allegations included the commingling of funds and manipulation of trading volume on Binance.US, its U.S. affiliate. These serious claims led to the ongoing litigation, which was paused multiple times to allow the parties to negotiate and clarify their positions. Earlier this year, the SEC requested a 60-day pause in the case to allow for discussions around a new crypto task force to clarify how securities law might apply to digital assets. That pause was set to expire on April 14, 2025, but the SEC and Binance have now mutually agreed to extend it for an additional two months. Reasons for the Continued Binance SEC Pause The SEC, in its filing, explained that the discussions between both parties had focused on how the work of the newly formed crypto task force could impact the case. The task force, created to address regulatory issues in the cryptocurrency sector, may provide clearer guidance on how U.S. securities law applies to digital assets. The SEC also pointed out that additional time was needed for authorization from the Commission before making any decisions or revisions in the scope of the case. Binance, for its part, agreed that an extension of the pause was in everyone’s best interest and would help to facilitate the ongoing discussions between the two sides. “The continued pause is appropriate and in the interest of judicial economy,” the filing stated. Both the SEC and Binance have indicated that they aim to resolve the matter efficiently, without unnecessary delays or complications. Crypto Task Force’s Role in the Case The SEC’s newly established crypto task force may shape how digital asset transactions are treated under U.S. law. In a recent statement, Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda emphasized the importance of clear regulations for the cryptocurrency market and noted that the task force’s role is to create long-term solutions for regulating crypto trading. Uyeda also suggested that a “time-limited, conditional exemptive relief framework” might be appropriate to allow innovation in blockchain technology while maintaining regulatory oversight. He encouraged market participants to contribute their views on where such exemptions might be necessary to foster industry growth. The crypto task force’s efforts may influence how the SEC handles its case against Binance and its broader approach to regulating the digital asset space. The task force aims to ensure that U.S. law can adapt to the rapidly evolving technology behind cryptocurrencies while also protecting investors and ensuring market integrity. Next Steps in the Legal Proceedings With the case now paused for another 60 days, the SEC and Binance will continue their discussions and await further guidance from the crypto task force. The next update on the case’s status will come after the 60-day period. As the pause continues, like the Ripple vs SEC case , stakeholders in the cryptocurrency industry will closely monitor the outcome of the discussions, as the case could set important precedents for future regulatory actions. The SEC, as a result, has clarified that it is focused on ensuring compliance with securities laws, while Binance has stated its commitment to working within the framework of U.S. regulations.

43230341,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148882,1744415759,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking OpenAI Lawsuit: Ex-Staffers Unite Against For-Profit AI Transition,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/openai-lawsuit-non-profit-transition/,"In a dramatic turn of events shaking the foundations of the artificial intelligence world, a group of former OpenAI employees has thrown their weight behind Elon Musk’s lawsuit against the AI giant. This isn’t just another legal squabble; it’s a battle for the soul of AI, questioning whether altruistic missions can survive in the cutthroat world of tech profits. For crypto enthusiasts and investors closely watching the tech landscape, this lawsuit could signal significant shifts in how AI development and governance are perceived and regulated, potentially impacting blockchain applications and the future of decentralized AI. Why are Ex-OpenAI Staffers Taking a Stand? Twelve former OpenAI employees have formally submitted an amicus brief, essentially a ‘friend of the court’ filing, supporting Elon Musk’s claims. Their core argument? That OpenAI’s proposed shift from a non-profit ethos to a fully for-profit transition fundamentally betrays its original mission. These aren’t just disgruntled ex-employees; they are individuals who were deeply invested in OpenAI’s initial vision. Let’s break down their key concerns: Mission Betrayal: The brief argues that converting the non-profit arm’s controlling stake in OpenAI would directly violate the organization’s founding principles. Breach of Trust: They claim this restructuring would break the trust with employees, donors, and stakeholders who believed in OpenAI’s non-profit commitments. Safety Concerns: The ex-staffers worry that a for-profit OpenAI might prioritize financial gains over AI safety and responsible development. These concerns echo sentiments voiced by some of these individuals previously. Gretchen Krueger has publicly advocated for greater accountability, while Daniel Kokotajlo and William Saunders have warned against a “reckless” race for AI dominance. Carrol Wainwright has even cautioned against trusting OpenAI’s promises of future ethical conduct. Their collective action underscores the gravity of their worries. The Contentious History of OpenAI’s Structure OpenAI’s organizational structure is a bit of a maze, and understanding it is crucial to grasping the current non-profit vs. for-profit transition debate. Here’s a timeline: Year Event Significance 2015 Founded as a non-profit organization. Mission: Ensure AI benefits all humanity. 2019 Converted to a “capped-profit” model. Retained a non-profit wing with controlling stake. Present Pushing for full Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) status. Aiming for further restructuring towards a fully for-profit model. Musk’s lawsuit centers on the argument that OpenAI is abandoning its original non-profit mission. While a judge denied a preliminary injunction to halt the conversion, the case is set for a jury trial in spring 2026, indicating the legal battle is far from over. Why Does the Non-Profit Structure Matter? According to the ex-employees’ brief, the current structure, with a non-profit controlling the corporate arm, isn’t just an organizational quirk; it’s “crucial” and “critical” to OpenAI’s mission. They argue that this structure was deliberately designed to safeguard against purely financial motivations overshadowing the goal of beneficial AI. Here’s why they believe it’s so important: Mission Alignment: The non-profit governance ensures decisions are made with humanity’s benefit in mind, not just shareholder returns. Charter Commitments: OpenAI’s charter document outlines key principles for its mission, which were treated as binding commitments internally. Recruitment Tool: OpenAI used its unique governance structure to attract talent, contrasting itself with competitors like Google and Anthropic. The brief even recounts a 2020 all-hands meeting where CEO Sam Altman allegedly emphasized the “paramount” importance of non-profit governance in prioritizing safety and societal benefits over short-term profits. This highlights the perceived internal understanding that the non-profit element was fundamental to OpenAI’s identity and purpose. The Fear of a Fully For-Profit OpenAI The ex-staffers warn of a dystopian scenario if OpenAI becomes fully for-profit . They suggest this could incentivize the company to cut corners on safety and concentrate powerful AI in the hands of shareholders. A key concern is the “merge and assist” clause in OpenAI’s charter. This clause pledges OpenAI to stop competing and assist any “value-aligned, safety-conscious” project that achieves Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) first. In a purely for-profit model, the brief argues, OpenAI might have little incentive to honor this commitment. Growing Opposition to OpenAI’s Transition The ex-OpenAI employees are not alone in their opposition. Earlier this week, a coalition of organizations, including non-profits and labor groups, petitioned the California Attorney General to block OpenAI’s for-profit transition . They accuse the company of failing to protect its charitable assets and subverting its mission of safe AI. Encode, another non-profit, echoed similar concerns in a previous amicus brief. OpenAI, however, maintains that the for-profit transition will strengthen its non-profit arm, providing resources for “charitable initiatives” in healthcare, education, and science. They claim the non-profit will benefit from billions of dollars through its controlling stake. In a series of posts on X, OpenAI stated they are “getting ready to build the best-equipped nonprofit the world has ever seen.” High Stakes for OpenAI The pressure is on OpenAI to finalize its for-profit conversion by the end of this year or next. Failure to do so could jeopardize significant capital raised recently. This timeline adds urgency to the ongoing legal battles and public scrutiny. The coming months will be critical in determining the future trajectory of OpenAI and the broader landscape of AI ethics and governance.

After bouncing from recent lows, XRP is now pushing against the $1.96 resistance level — a breakout above could signal a new bull phase for the asset. As the broader market stirs back to life in Q2 , some analysts believe XRP may finally have the momentum to regain its former highs, especially if global remittance use cases begin to accelerate. The token remains a favorite for long-term holders aiming for a 2x–5x move by year’s end. ETHEREUM: ALL EYES ON SCALABILITY AND STAKING IN 2025 Ethereum remains the backbone of the decentralized ecosystem, and in April 2025 , it’s once again at the center of the conversation. With increased Layer-2 adoption and a surge in staking participation, ETH is showing renewed strength just above the critical $2,000 mark. Devs are optimistic that upcoming EIP upgrades and cross-chain integrations will push ETH back toward its all-time high. Institutional interest is also picking up, with ETH-based ETFs and DeFi staking products capturing attention. As a result, many expect Ethereum to serve as a stabilizing force in portfolios while also offering mid-term upside — potentially delivering a solid 3x–4x by Q4 2025 if conditions align. SOLANA: SURGING DEVELOPER ACTIVITY AND DAPP EXPLOSION Solana has been making serious noise in Q2 2025 , buoyed by an explosion in developer activity and new dApps launching on-chain. With transaction speeds outpacing competitors and fees staying ultra-low, SOL has re-established itself as the go-to network for high-performance applications. Traders are watching for a sustained move above $200 , which could open the doors to a parabolic run similar to 2021 . If the network maintains uptime and community growth, Solana could easily climb into the top three by market cap — and offer a potential 5x–10x window for early 2025 entrants. MAGACOIN FINANCE: THE DARK HORSE GATHERING STEAM JOIN OVER 12,500+ INVESTORS – SECURE YOUR SPOT NOW While XRP, ETH, and SOL dominate headlines, one rising star is making its way into high-level watchlists: MAGACOIN FINANCE . The project has quietly amassed a major following, with influencers, YouTubers, and Telegram communities buzzing over what some are calling the “ SHIBA of 2025 — but with structure.” Despite the wider market’s hesitancy, MAGACOIN FINANCE has already surpassed record levels in presale traction, a rare feat for a newcomer. Its multi-stage launch model, strong political meme branding, and early viral traction have analysts whispering about a possible 70x surge before the year ends. With its price at $0.0002908 some projections go even further, claiming that a $100 investment could return $10,000 — a whopping 2,900% gain — if market conditions and community hype align post-listing. The real story? MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t just a memecoin. It’s shaping up to be a movement, and savvy investors are already positioning before listings go live.

The top US crypto exchange rolled out support for Wayfinder (PROMPT) on Thursday, the same day the token launched. Wayfinder bills itself as an omni-chain tool “providing groundbreaking ways for AI to interact with blockchain environments.” The project’s whitepaper notes that it will also be used for blockchain-based games. “Wayfinder is an AI agent framework able to power blockchain-based games, with Parallel Studios’ Colony as an initial game incorporating Wayfinder’s technology, as well as provide generalized on-chain AI capabilities to both developers and non-technical users. Wayfinder’s innovations in enabling AI agents to operate within blockchain environments are achieved via the development of what is being termed ‘wayfinding paths,’ which serve as an instruction set and roadmap for AI agents. This enables them to navigate blockchain environments with the goal of attaining a unique endpoint, such as a particular DEX on XYZ chain, a decentralized marketplace, or a Web3 enabled tool.” PROMPT is down more than 27% on its first day of trading. Coinbase listed the asset with an “ experimental label ,” which the platform uses for tokens that pose certain risks, such as price swings and canceled orders because of lower trading volume and availability.

After a stretch of sideways movement and bearish pressure that left the altcoin range-bound, ADA is now displaying signs of revival. The current price action might not be explosive, but it carries the hallmarks of a market quietly building strength one step at a time. This growing momentum suggests that bulls are gradually returning to the scene with renewed confidence. While caution remains across the broader crypto landscape, ADA’s calculated pace might actually be a sign of strength rather than weakness. Instead of rushing into overbought conditions, the altcoin is laying a solid foundation that could support a more durable rally. The Calm Setup For A Calculated Climb In a recent post on X, crypto analyst Gemxbt pointed out that Cardano exhibited a bullish structure, as the price trends steadily above 5, 10, and 20-hour moving averages. This alignment of short-term moving averages typically signals sustained buying pressure and growing bullish momentum in the market. It also suggests that the bulls are maintaining control in the short term, keeping Cardano on a steady upward path. Related Reading: Cardano Price Prediction: ADA Set To Crash To $0.4 After Correction To Liquidity Zone Gemxbt’s observation reinforces that ADA’s recent price action isn’t just a temporary spike but rather a sign of strengthening technical foundations. When prices remain consistently above multiple key moving averages, it often reflects increased trader confidence and a favorable environment for further upward movement. He further noted that a key resistance level lies around the $0.62 mark, which could act as a near-term hurdle for ADA’s price advance. On the downside, solid support has formed near the $0.56 level, providing a cushion against potential pullbacks. These levels are crucial in determining the next directional move, as a break above resistance could trigger further gains, while a fall below support might signal short-term weakness. Gemxbt also highlighted that the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is currently crossing above the signal line, which suggests growing buying interest. This crossover typically marks the beginning of a momentum shift in favor of the bulls, increasing the likelihood of continued price appreciation. Potential Breakout Possibilities: What To Watch For If Cardano continues its upward trajectory and successfully breaks above the $0.68 resistance level, it could open the door to more gains. The next key levels to watch are at $0.81 and $0.90, where the price may encounter additional selling pressure. A break above these levels would push ADA toward even higher targets, such as $1.17 and $1.58. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Rockets Over 60%, Crushing Bears in a Stunning Rally! However, if ADA fails to break through the $0.68 level and retreats, the first support to monitor would be around $0.56 to $0.52, which has historically acted as a strong floor. A drop below these levels could signal a shift in market sentiment and lead to a deeper pullback.

For those deeply invested in the crypto world, especially Solana (SOL), the latest update from Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart is crucial. Are we on the verge of seeing a Solana ETF finally hit the market? Let’s dive into the details and understand what this could mean for you and the broader crypto landscape. Why is the Solana ETF Deadline of October 10th Generating Buzz? According to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, the earliest final deadline for a Solana ETF application is now set for October 10th. This date isn’t just plucked out of thin air; it represents a critical point in the regulatory process. Seyffart highlighted in a recent podcast that it’s improbable for the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) or its dedicated Crypto Task Force to reach a decision on approving a Crypto ETF of this nature before this date. This essentially sets the stage for a nail-biting wait until at least October for any definitive news. But why is this deadline so important, and what makes a Solana ETF such a hot topic? Regulatory Timelines: The SEC has specific timelines for reviewing and approving or rejecting ETF applications. October 10th represents a key milestone in this process for any potential SOL ETF . Market Anticipation: The crypto market, particularly Solana enthusiasts, are eagerly anticipating a positive decision. An approved Solana ETF could unlock significant institutional investment in SOL. Analyst Insights: James Seyffart’s statements carry weight in the ETF world, and his setting of this deadline provides a concrete timeframe for market expectations. What are the Potential Benefits of a Solana ETF? The introduction of a Solana ETF could be a monumental step for the Solana ecosystem and the broader cryptocurrency market. Let’s explore some of the key benefits: Increased Accessibility for Investors: An ETF makes investing in Solana significantly easier for retail and institutional investors. They wouldn’t need to navigate crypto exchanges, wallets, or private key management. Buying and selling SOL would be as straightforward as trading stocks through traditional brokerage accounts. Boost to Solana’s Market Capitalization: ETFs can channel substantial capital into the underlying asset. Approval of a SOL ETF could lead to a significant influx of funds into Solana, potentially driving up its price and market capitalization. Legitimization of Solana as an Asset Class: An ETF approval by the SEC would lend further legitimacy to Solana as a recognized and investable asset class. This could attract more institutional investors who are currently hesitant to invest directly in cryptocurrencies. Enhanced Liquidity: ETFs are traded on exchanges, providing high liquidity. A Solana ETF would enhance the overall liquidity of SOL, making it easier for investors to buy and sell without significantly impacting the price. Diversification Opportunities: For investors looking to diversify their portfolios, a Solana ETF offers a convenient way to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency market without directly holding SOL tokens. Challenges and Hurdles in SEC Approval for a Crypto ETF While the prospect of a Crypto ETF , especially a Solana ETF, is exciting, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges and regulatory hurdles that must be overcome. The SEC has been cautious in approving cryptocurrency-based ETFs, and for good reason. Here are some of the key challenges: Challenge Description Market Manipulation Concerns The SEC has expressed concerns about the potential for market manipulation in the cryptocurrency space, which could affect the price and stability of a Crypto ETF . Custody and Security Ensuring the secure custody of the underlying Solana assets for an ETF is a critical concern. The SEC needs to be convinced that robust and reliable custody solutions are in place. Regulatory Uncertainty The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. The SEC is navigating uncharted territory, and its approach to crypto ETFs is still being developed. Volatility of Crypto Assets Cryptocurrencies, including Solana, are known for their volatility. The SEC needs to assess how this volatility might impact the risk profile of a SOL ETF and investor protection. Defining ‘Crypto Task Force’ Role James Seyffart specifically mentioned the SEC’s Crypto Task Force. Understanding the exact role and influence of this task force in the ETF approval process is crucial but remains somewhat opaque. What Does the October 10th Deadline Mean for Your Crypto Investments? The October 10th deadline for a potential ETF Deadline is more than just a date on the calendar; it’s a potential inflection point for Solana and the crypto market. Here’s what investors should consider: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on news and updates related to Solana ETF applications and SEC announcements. Reliable sources like Bloomberg and reputable crypto news outlets are essential. Manage Expectations: While the deadline is set, SEC approval is not guaranteed. Be prepared for both positive and negative outcomes. Market volatility around this date is highly probable. Diversify Your Portfolio: Regardless of the ETF outcome, diversification remains a sound investment strategy. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, even if you are bullish on Solana. Understand Risk Tolerance: Crypto investments are inherently risky. Assess your risk tolerance and invest accordingly. ETFs can mitigate some risks associated with direct crypto ownership, but risks remain. Beyond October 10th: The Future of Solana and Crypto ETFs Whether the SEC approves a Solana ETF by October 10th or not, the trajectory of crypto ETFs is clear: they are becoming an increasingly important part of the financial landscape. The demand for regulated and accessible crypto investment products is growing, and ETFs are a natural evolution in this space. Even if this particular deadline passes without approval, the push for a Crypto ETF , including those based on Solana, will likely continue. The industry is maturing, and regulatory frameworks are slowly catching up. The October 10th deadline is a significant marker in the journey toward a Solana ETF. It represents the earliest possible date for a final decision and underscores the ongoing dialogue between the crypto industry and regulatory bodies like the SEC. While uncertainty remains, the potential benefits of a Solana ETF are undeniable, promising to broaden access, enhance legitimacy, and inject significant capital into the Solana ecosystem. Keep watching this space – the next few months could be pivotal for Solana and the future of crypto investment.

The class action lawsuit alleged BofA violated New York’s Exempt Income Protection Act (EIPA) by mishandling and charging improper fees to customers who had been slapped with court-order restraints. Specifically, the lawsuit says that BofA grouped multiple accounts together before calculating how much of the customers’ funds were legally protected, leading to more funds being frozen than allowed by law. The lawsuit also alleged BofA issued checks to debtors for the exempt amount by regular mail, meaning that the class members faced delays in accessing the money needed for daily expenses. BofA has agreed to the terms of the settlement without admitting to any wrongdoing. On top of the multi-million-dollar payout, BofA says it is permanently changing its practices, including: Stopping aggregating accounts when computing how much money is protected by law. Notifying account holders of their rights if their accounts had been restrained. Halting the practice of issuing checks for exempt funds so customers can access their money as needed via debit cards, online bank transfers and others. The settlement is subject to court approval.

Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda has voiced the need for an interim crypto rules framework. This isn’t about long-term, rigid structures, but rather a nimble, short-term approach designed to nurture blockchain innovation while the complexities of permanent crypto regulation are ironed out. Is this the breath of fresh air the crypto industry has been waiting for? Let’s dive into the details. Why an Interim Crypto Regulatory Framework? Uyeda’s suggestion, made during a roundtable discussion of the SEC’s Cryptocurrency Task Force (TFT), highlights a critical challenge: how to regulate a rapidly evolving space without stifling its growth. He pointed out the necessity to explore more efficient ways to regulate within a comprehensive federal framework. The core idea is to create a supportive environment for blockchain innovation to flourish in the short term, paving the way for more robust and well-considered crypto regulation in the future. Think of it like building a house. You need scaffolding to support the structure while the permanent walls are being constructed. This interim framework is the scaffolding for the crypto industry. Key Benefits of a Short-Term Crypto Regulatory Approach Fosters Innovation: By providing clear, albeit temporary, guidelines, businesses gain the confidence to innovate without fear of immediate, potentially restrictive, long-term regulations. This is crucial for unleashing the full potential of blockchain innovation . Flexibility and Adaptability: Interim frameworks can be more easily adjusted and updated as the crypto landscape evolves. This agility is vital in a sector known for its rapid pace of change. Reduced Uncertainty: The current regulatory uncertainty is a major hurdle for crypto businesses. A short-term framework can provide much-needed clarity and reduce anxiety, encouraging investment and growth. Inclusivity: Uyeda emphasized the need for an “inclusive federal regulatory framework.” This suggests a desire to create rules that are accessible and fair for all participants in the crypto space, not just large institutions. What Could an Interim Framework Look Like? Conditional Exemptions Uyeda specifically mentioned a “conditional exemption system” as a possible component of this interim SEC regulatory framework . What could this mean in practice? Imagine a system where certain crypto activities or projects are granted exemptions from existing securities laws, provided they meet specific conditions. These conditions could include: Transparency Requirements: Projects might need to provide clear and accessible information about their operations, tokenomics, and risks. Investor Protection Measures: Implementing safeguards to protect investors from fraud and manipulation, perhaps through disclosure requirements or limitations on investment amounts for certain types of investors. Operational Standards: Establishing basic operational standards for crypto exchanges and platforms to ensure security and reliability. Time Limits: Exemptions could be granted for a limited period, aligning with the “interim” nature of the framework, and reviewed periodically. Challenges and Considerations While the idea of an interim SEC regulatory framework is promising, there are challenges to consider: Defining “Interim”: How long is “short-term”? Clarity on the duration of the interim framework is crucial to avoid prolonged uncertainty. Balancing Innovation and Protection: Striking the right balance between fostering blockchain innovation and protecting investors will be delicate. Regulations must be robust enough to prevent harm but not so restrictive as to stifle progress. Coordination: Effective crypto regulation requires coordination among various regulatory bodies, not just the SEC. Ensuring a unified approach will be essential. Industry Input: For the framework to be truly effective and inclusive, active engagement with the crypto industry is paramount. Roundtable discussions like the one Uyeda participated in are a good starting point. The Cryptocurrency Task Force and Future Discussions The roundtable discussion where Uyeda made these remarks was the first of four scheduled meetings of the SEC’s Cryptocurrency Task Force (TFT). The focus of this initial meeting was on adjusting cryptocurrency trading regulations. This indicates that the SEC is actively engaging with the complexities of crypto regulation and seeking input from various stakeholders. The fact that the SEC is holding these discussions and considering innovative approaches like interim frameworks is a positive sign. It suggests a willingness to adapt and find pragmatic solutions to regulate the crypto space effectively without hindering its transformative potential. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on developments from the SEC and the Cryptocurrency Task Force. These discussions will directly shape the future of crypto regulation . Engage in Dialogue: If you are involved in the crypto industry, consider participating in industry forums and discussions to contribute your perspective to the regulatory conversation. Prepare for Change: Whether you are a crypto investor, developer, or business owner, be prepared for regulatory changes. An interim framework could bring both opportunities and adjustments to the way you operate. Conclusion: A Sensational Step Towards Balanced Crypto Regulation? Mark Uyeda’s suggestion of an interim crypto regulation framework is a potentially sensational development. It signals a nuanced approach from the SEC, acknowledging the need to support blockchain innovation while working towards long-term regulatory clarity. This could be a crucial step in fostering a healthy and thriving crypto ecosystem in the United States. The coming months will be critical as the SEC continues its discussions and potentially moves towards implementing this innovative regulatory strategy.

For years, Bitcoin has been touted as ‘digital gold,’ a safe haven in times of economic uncertainty. But what if this narrative is fundamentally flawed? Recent findings suggest a surprising twist: Bitcoin correlation is increasingly mirroring the movements of tech stocks , rather than acting as a true alternative to gold . Let’s dive deep into this fascinating shift and explore what it means for your crypto investments. Is Bitcoin Really Digital Gold? Unpacking the Correlation Conundrum The idea of Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ has been a cornerstone of its appeal, especially for investors seeking diversification away from traditional markets. The narrative painted a picture of Bitcoin as an uncorrelated asset, a hedge against inflation and economic downturns, much like its precious metal counterpart, gold. However, a recent report from Franklin Templeton Digital Assets throws a wrench into this long-held belief. The report highlights a critical divergence in price action, suggesting that Bitcoin’s price movements are becoming increasingly intertwined with the tech stocks , specifically the Nasdaq, rather than with gold price fluctuations. Here’s a breakdown of the key findings: Correlation with Tech Stocks Surges: The report reveals that Bitcoin’s correlation with tech-heavy indices like the Nasdaq can reach as high as 0.7. This indicates a strong positive relationship – when tech stocks rise, Bitcoin tends to follow suit, and vice versa. Weak Correlation with Gold: In stark contrast, Bitcoin’s correlation with gold rarely climbs above 0.3. This weak correlation suggests that Bitcoin and gold largely move independently of each other, challenging the ‘digital gold’ thesis. Challenging the Narrative: Franklin Templeton argues that Bitcoin’s inherent volatility, exposure to regulatory changes, and speculative nature make it fundamentally different from gold, which is traditionally seen as a store of value and a safe-haven asset. Why is Bitcoin Mimicking Tech Stocks? Delving into the Drivers So, why are we witnessing this shift in Bitcoin correlation ? Several factors are likely at play, contributing to Bitcoin’s increasing alignment with tech stocks : Risk-On Asset Perception: Despite its aspirations of being ‘digital gold,’ Bitcoin is often perceived by many investors as a risk-on asset, similar to growth stocks in the technology sector. When investor sentiment is bullish and risk appetite is high, both tech stocks and Bitcoin tend to benefit. Conversely, during periods of uncertainty or economic downturn, both may face selling pressure. Institutional Investment Flows: The growing institutional adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could be a significant factor. Many institutional investors allocate capital across various asset classes, including technology stocks and now, digital assets. Investment strategies that allocate to both tech and crypto might inadvertently contribute to correlated price movements. Technological Innovation Narrative: Bitcoin, at its core, is a technological innovation. It’s intertwined with the broader narrative of disruptive technologies and digital transformation, themes that heavily influence the tech stock market. This shared narrative can drive investor interest and potentially lead to correlated price action. Macroeconomic Factors: While the report suggests independent price movements are largely the norm, both Bitcoin and tech stocks can react to broader macroeconomic events. For instance, interest rate hikes or changes in monetary policy can impact both sectors, albeit perhaps for different reasons. Gold vs. Bitcoin: A Tale of Two Assets in Times of Global Uncertainty While the long-term correlation might be weak, it’s crucial to examine how both assets react to specific global events. The recent market activity provides a compelling example. As reported by Crypto Briefing , we observed contrasting reactions: Bitcoin’s Rebound on PPI Data: Bitcoin recently experienced a notable rebound, surging above $83,000. This surge was triggered by lower-than-expected Producer Price Index (PPI) data, which suggested easing inflationary pressures. This positive economic data boosted risk assets, including tech stocks and Bitcoin. Gold’s Record High Amid Trade Tensions: Simultaneously, gold reached a record high of $3,236. This surge was fueled by escalating U.S.-China trade tensions, highlighting gold’s traditional role as a safe-haven asset during geopolitical uncertainty. This divergence underscores a crucial point: while both assets can react to global events, their underlying drivers and investor perception remain distinct. Gold’s price surge was driven by fear and uncertainty, while Bitcoin’s rebound was linked to positive economic data and risk-on sentiment. Navigating the Crypto Investment Landscape: Actionable Insights So, what does this mean for you, the crypto investor? Understanding the Bitcoin correlation with tech stocks versus gold provides valuable insights for your crypto investment strategy: Re-evaluate Diversification Strategies: If you’re seeking true portfolio diversification and aiming to reduce correlation with traditional equity markets, relying solely on Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ might be insufficient. Consider incorporating other assets with lower correlation to both tech stocks and Bitcoin. Monitor Tech Sector Performance: Keep a close eye on the performance of the tech sector, particularly indices like the Nasdaq. Tech stock trends could offer valuable clues about potential Bitcoin price movements. Understand Risk Profiles: Acknowledge that Bitcoin, at least currently, behaves more like a risk-on tech asset than a safe-haven like gold. Adjust your risk tolerance and investment strategy accordingly. Stay Informed on Macroeconomic Factors: While correlation is important, macroeconomic events and overall market sentiment will continue to play a significant role in both Bitcoin and gold price movements. Stay informed about economic data releases, geopolitical developments, and central bank policies. The Future of Bitcoin: Beyond the ‘Digital Gold’ Narrative? The findings presented by Franklin Templeton challenge the simplistic ‘digital gold’ narrative surrounding Bitcoin. While Bitcoin may eventually evolve into a more uncorrelated asset, its current behavior suggests a stronger affinity with the technology sector. This isn’t necessarily a negative development. The tech sector is known for innovation and growth potential, and Bitcoin’s association with it could attract further investment and adoption. However, for investors seeking a true safe-haven asset and portfolio diversification, it’s crucial to understand Bitcoin’s evolving correlation dynamics. The ‘digital gold’ narrative might need to be revisited, and investment strategies should be adapted to reflect the reality of Bitcoin’s price movements in relation to both tech stocks and gold price . The world of crypto investment is constantly evolving, and staying informed and adaptable is key to navigating its complexities successfully.

A recent deep dive by 21 Shares, a leading asset manager and crypto ETP investing platform , has unveiled the meme coin’s massive potential, positioning it as a formidable player in the crypto space . 21Shares Releases New Dogecoin Report On April 8, 21Shares published an in-depth report on Dogecoin’s performance over the years, tracing its origins as a humorous internet meme to its evolution into the world’s largest and most popular meme-based cryptocurrency. In its report, the asset manager called Dogecoin “the meme that made it,” implying that the meme coin, previously seen as a joke , has defied expectations to become a dominant force in the market. Launched in 2013, just four years after Bitcoin’s debut, Dogecoin began as an internet meme featuring a unique Shiba Inu dog theme. However, over the years, Dogecoin has evolved into a symbol with much greater potential, driven by its powerful community, widespread adoption , explosive price growth , and emerging use cases. 21Shares also describes Dogecoin as an “emotion” due to its cultural significance rather than technical features. Unlike other cryptocurrencies that focus on advanced technological solutions and innovation, Dogecoin’s strength lies in its relevance and connection to online culture . According to the asset manager, memes currently represent the lifeblood of the internet, and DOGE has successfully captured this essence. The meme coin did not chase trends like traditional coins but integrated itself into the crypto world by becoming digital folklore. While many other meme coins have come and gone, DOGE has remained, gaining its strength from the emotion and identity it represents for its community. 21Shares has suggested that Dogecoin’s true power comes from its community actions , which have created a cycle of success. The attention from its carefully grown community brings liquidity, while a strong sense of belonging keeps members engaged and invested. Additionally, the advocacy for passionate supporters encourages growth and further promotes the meme coin’s value. In the crypto market, where attention is scarce, sentiment from the community plays a significant role in driving financial movements. This grassroots network is the engine that has pushed Dogecoin higher, underscoring its massive potential. DOGE’s Journey From Meme To Mainstream In its report, 21Shares explains how Dogecoin is moving beyond its meme origins and becoming a mainstream asset. The asset manager highlighted its impressive performance over the past decade, revealing that DOGE has experienced a historic return of 130,000%, making it the best-performing cryptocurrency in the top 25 by market capitalization . This explosive growth has transformed DOGE into a $30 billion asset, attracting millions of supporters. Key factors also drive this growth, including fast, low-cost transactions, rising mainstream acceptance , and a vibrant community . Since its price peak during the bull market in 2021 , Dogecoin’s user base has grown exponentially. The number of wallet addresses has nearly doubled from 44 million to 84 million in less than four years, signaling immense adoption and mainstream recognition.",Altcoins|21Shares|bitcoin|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|meme coin|Shiba Inu,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|RUNE|FET|SEI|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CAKE|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-04-12 00:30:22

Imagine the aroma of fries mixed with the electrifying buzz of crypto – a combination that might have been, but for now, remains just a thought. The National Center for Public Policy Research, a McDonald’s shareholder, put forward the idea, suggesting that embracing Bitcoin could solidify McDonald’s market leadership. But the golden arches seem to be staying grounded in tradition for now. Let’s dive into what exactly happened and what it means for corporate crypto adoption. Why a Bitcoin Proposal for McDonald’s? The core argument from the National Center for Public Policy Research was simple yet compelling: as more and more major corporations are dipping their toes (or diving headfirst) into the cryptocurrency waters, shouldn’t McDonald’s also consider adding Bitcoin investment to its financial strategy? Their proposal highlighted the growing trend of companies diversifying their balance sheets with digital assets, positioning it as a move to stay ahead of the curve and maintain a competitive edge. Think of companies like MicroStrategy or Tesla, who have made significant Bitcoin allocations. The proposal suggested McDonald’s could benefit from similar strategic diversification. Here’s a breakdown of the rationale: Following the Trend: The proposal pointed out that numerous companies are already incorporating Bitcoin into their financial reserves. Maintaining Leadership: By adopting Bitcoin, McDonald’s could be seen as innovative and forward-thinking, reinforcing its position as a market leader. Potential Financial Benefits: Bitcoin’s potential for appreciation could offer McDonald’s a new avenue for returns on their assets. Essentially, the shareholder group believed that a Bitcoin proposal was a strategic move for McDonald’s to future-proof its finances and brand image in an increasingly digital world. McDonald’s Response: No Bitcoin Discussion at Shareholder Meeting Despite the seemingly logical arguments presented in the Bitcoin proposal , McDonald’s didn’t bite. The company officially announced that this particular proposal would not be up for discussion at their upcoming May shareholder meeting. This wasn’t a simple oversight; McDonald’s actively filed documentation with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to ensure the proposal was kept off the agenda. The SEC, in turn, validated McDonald’s stance, confirming the company’s right to decide which proposals are discussed at its shareholder meetings. So, why the cold shoulder from the house of the Big Mac? Several factors might be at play: Risk Aversion: McDonald’s is a publicly traded company with a responsibility to stakeholders. Bitcoin, while having potential, is also known for its volatility. A large corporation like McDonald’s might be wary of the perceived risk associated with holding a significant amount of Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Focus on Core Business: McDonald’s primary business is fast food. Management might prefer to concentrate on core operations, expansion, and traditional financial instruments rather than venturing into the relatively new and complex world of cryptocurrency investments. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. McDonald’s, with its vast international operations, might be hesitant to engage with Bitcoin until there’s clearer and more consistent regulatory frameworks in place worldwide. The Shareholder Meeting and Corporate Governance This situation highlights interesting aspects of corporate governance and the role of the shareholder meeting . Shareholder meetings are platforms where company management and shareholders can interact, discuss company performance, and vote on important matters. Shareholders have the right to submit proposals, but not all proposals are guaranteed to be discussed or voted upon. Companies, like McDonald’s, have mechanisms and rights, often validated by regulatory bodies like the SEC, to manage the agenda of these meetings. This instance shows the balance of power between shareholders and corporate management. While shareholders can voice their opinions and suggest strategic directions, ultimately, the company’s leadership has significant control over what gets formally considered and acted upon. What Does This Mean for Corporate Bitcoin Adoption? While McDonald’s decision might seem like a setback for proponents of corporate Bitcoin adoption , it’s crucial to view it in perspective. Not every company will, or should, jump into Bitcoin immediately. McDonald’s specific business model, risk appetite, and strategic priorities differ from companies like tech firms or those in the financial sector that have been quicker to adopt Bitcoin. However, this episode does underscore several key points regarding corporate crypto strategies: Diversity in Corporate Approaches: Companies will have varied approaches to cryptocurrency. Some will be early adopters, some will be cautious observers, and others might completely avoid it. This diversity is natural and reflects different business needs and philosophies. Shareholder Influence: This case demonstrates the potential for shareholder activism in pushing for crypto adoption. While this particular proposal was rejected for discussion, it signals a growing interest among some investors in seeing corporations explore digital assets. Long-Term Trend: Despite McDonald’s current stance, the broader trend of corporate interest in cryptocurrencies is likely to continue. As the crypto market matures, regulations become clearer, and use cases expand, more companies may reconsider their position on digital assets like Bitcoin. Actionable Insights: Is Bitcoin Right for Your Business? Whether you’re a shareholder, a business owner, or simply curious about the intersection of crypto and corporations, McDonald’s situation offers some valuable insights. Thinking about corporate Bitcoin adoption for your own business or investments? Consider these points: Consideration Actionable Insight Risk Tolerance Assess your company’s risk appetite. Bitcoin is volatile. Is your business prepared for potential price swings? Strategic Alignment Does Bitcoin align with your long-term business strategy? How would it fit into your financial goals and brand image? Regulatory Landscape Stay informed about crypto regulations in your operating jurisdictions. Seek legal and financial advice to navigate compliance. Shareholder/Stakeholder Sentiment Gauge the interest and concerns of your shareholders and stakeholders regarding crypto adoption. Open communication is key. Ultimately, the decision to adopt Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency is a complex one, requiring careful consideration of various factors unique to each business. Conclusion: A Pause, Not a Full Stop on Corporate Crypto? McDonald’s decision to not discuss the Bitcoin proposal at its shareholder meeting isn’t necessarily a definitive ‘no’ to crypto forever. It’s more accurately a ‘not now.’ It reflects a cautious approach from a major corporation, prioritizing its current strategies and risk management. However, the conversation around corporate Bitcoin adoption is far from over. Shareholder interest is evident, and the broader trend towards digital assets is undeniable. While you might not be able to buy your Big Mac with Bitcoin just yet, the seeds of change are sown. Keep watching this space – the future of corporate finance and cryptocurrency is still being written, one proposal, one shareholder meeting, and one SEC filing at a time.

43231455,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148933,1744418406,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crucial AI Copyright Fight: Law Professors Support Authors Against Meta,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-copyright-meta-authors-lawsuit/,"In a significant development for the burgeoning field of AI and content creation, a group of distinguished law professors has stepped into the legal ring, siding with authors locked in a copyright dispute with tech giant Meta. This case, revolving around Meta’s Llama AI models and their training on copyrighted ebooks, could set a precedent for how intellectual property is treated in the age of artificial intelligence. For those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, where digital ownership and rights are paramount, this legal battle over AI Copyright is a crucial one to watch. Why is the Meta AI Lawsuit a Landmark Case for Copyright? The heart of the matter lies in the lawsuit, Kadrey v. Meta, where authors like Richard Kadrey, Sarah Silverman, and Ta-Nehisi Coates accuse Meta of using their ebooks to train its Llama AI models without proper authorization. The professors, in their amicus brief, argue against Meta’s defense of ‘fair use’, calling it an overreach. Let’s break down why this is so important: Challenging ‘Fair Use’ in the AI Era: Meta claims its use of copyrighted material for AI training falls under ‘fair use’. The professors argue this is a dangerous expansion of fair use, suggesting it grants AI developers unprecedented privileges compared to human creators. ‘Transformative’ Use Debate: A key aspect of fair use is whether the use is ‘transformative’. Meta argues its AI training is transformative. The professors counter that using copyrighted works to train AI is akin to educating human authors – a core purpose of the original works, thus not truly ‘transformative’. Commercial Intent and Competition: The brief highlights Meta’s for-profit nature and the potential for AI-generated content to directly compete with the original copyrighted works. This commercial aspect further weakens Meta’s fair use argument, according to the professors. Essentially, the professors are saying that if Meta’s argument succeeds, it could drastically erode copyright protections, paving the way for tech companies to freely utilize copyrighted works for commercial AI development without compensating creators. This has profound implications for all digital content creators, including those in the crypto art and NFT space. Llama AI and the Core of the Copyright Dispute Meta’s Llama AI models are at the center of this controversy. These large language models require vast amounts of data for training, and authors allege their copyrighted ebooks were part of this training data. The lawsuit claims Meta not only used these ebooks but also removed copyright management information (CMI) to conceal the alleged infringement. Judge Vince Chhabria’s decision to allow the case to proceed, despite dismissing part of it, is a victory for the authors. He acknowledged that copyright infringement is a ‘concrete injury’ and that the authors have sufficiently alleged Meta’s intentional removal of CMI. This ruling indicates that the court is taking the authors’ claims seriously and is willing to scrutinize Meta’s AI training practices under copyright law. Copyright Law in the Age of Artificial Intelligence: Navigating Uncharted Waters This case, alongside others like The New York Times v. OpenAI, underscores the urgent need to clarify Copyright Law in the age of AI. The existing legal frameworks, designed for a pre-AI world, are being tested by these new technologies. Key questions are emerging: What constitutes ‘fair use’ in AI training? Can tech companies freely use copyrighted material to train commercial AI models under the guise of fair use? Is AI-generated content a derivative work? If AI models are trained on copyrighted works, are the outputs they generate considered derivative works, thus infringing on the original copyrights? How should copyright be enforced in the AI era? Traditional copyright enforcement mechanisms may be inadequate to address the scale and nature of AI-driven copyright issues. The answers to these questions will have far-reaching consequences for innovation, creativity, and the balance of power between technology companies and content creators. The outcome of the Meta AI Lawsuit and similar cases will shape the future landscape of digital rights and responsibilities. The Concept of Fair Use : Is Meta Stretching its Boundaries? The legal doctrine of Fair Use allows for limited use of copyrighted material without permission for purposes like criticism, commentary, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. Meta argues its AI training falls under fair use, claiming it’s transformative and non-commercial in the context of model training itself. However, the professors and authors vehemently disagree. The professors’ brief argues persuasively that Meta’s use is not truly transformative because it serves a purpose similar to the original works – education and knowledge dissemination. Furthermore, they emphasize the commercial nature of Meta and the potential for AI-generated content to directly compete with the authors’ works in the marketplace. This commercial angle is a critical point of contention in the fair use debate. For the crypto community, understanding fair use in the AI context is vital. As blockchain technology increasingly intersects with AI, particularly in areas like decentralized AI and AI-driven content platforms, navigating copyright and fair use will become even more crucial. Actionable Insights and the Road Ahead The legal battles surrounding AI and copyright are just beginning. Here’s what you need to know and consider: Stay Informed: Follow cases like Kadrey v. Meta and The New York Times v. OpenAI. Their outcomes will set important precedents. Support Creators’ Rights: Advocate for fair compensation and recognition for content creators in the AI age. This is aligned with the ethos of digital ownership championed by the crypto community. Engage in the Debate: Participate in discussions about AI ethics, copyright, and the future of content creation. Your voice matters in shaping these evolving norms. Consider Legal Implications: If you are developing or using AI technologies, especially in a commercial context, be mindful of copyright laws and potential fair use limitations. Seek legal counsel to ensure compliance. The Meta AI Lawsuit is more than just a legal dispute; it’s a bellwether for the future of AI, copyright, and the rights of creators in the digital age. As AI continues to evolve and permeate various sectors, including the cryptocurrency world, understanding these legal and ethical dimensions is paramount.
