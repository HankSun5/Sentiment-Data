Here’s Why and When,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-lend-your-xrp-to-institutions-heres-why-and-when/,"Brett (@Brett_Crypto_X), a prominent voice in the digital asset space, recently issued a direct message to XRP holders, emphasizing the importance of long-term vision over short-term gains. His post encouraged investors to rethink their approach by taking advantage of market dips to accumulate XRP rather than looking for exit points. He believes those who understand what they hold with XRP will never sell the asset and urges the community to prioritize strategic accumulation and future utility. $XRP holders, it's time to rethink your approach—accumulate during the dips. Once regulations hit, lend your $XRP to institutions and enjoy passive income. I’m fed up with folks asking when to sell. If you truly understand what you’ve got, the answer is simple: never. — Brett (@Brett_Crypto_X) April 10, 2025 Shifting the Narrative from Selling to Lending According to Brett, XRP’s real value will be realized once regulatory clarity enters the market, and the recent conclusion of the Ripple lawsuit has sped up this process. He pointed to the growing possibility of lending digital assets to institutions as a future avenue for generating passive income. By doing so, holders can earn a yield on their assets without liquidating them. This approach reframes XRP as a long-term financial tool instead of a speculative asset, especially once institutions gain regulatory approval to operate more freely in crypto markets. Institutional Interest and Strategic Accumulation Many XRP proponents believe that major financial institutions, including firms like BlackRock, are positioning themselves to acquire XRP at relatively low prices . This aligns with the idea that these institutions see XRP as a critical piece in the evolving global financial infrastructure. Supporters argue that XRP’s underlying technology and its intended use case in facilitating cross-border payments and improving liquidity between financial entities make it an ideal asset for integration into traditional finance. The attention from major firms also validates its long-term relevance, even if the current market price does not yet reflect that value. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Regulation as a Catalyst for Adoption Many XRP holders believe that the path will be clear for institutional adoption once regulatory frameworks are finalized. Ripple is now free to sell XRP to institutions , and with demand rising, lending tokens to banks, financial platforms, or other entities may become viable and potentially lucrative. This scenario depends on establishing proper custody, compliance, and lending mechanisms, but the interest shown by institutions suggests that such infrastructure is already being developed. Instead of looking for exit strategies, Brett and other experts encourage committed holders to accumulate and hold to participate in a future financial system where XRP plays a foundational role. For those who recognize XRP’s intended function and the interest it has garnered from institutional players, the current period may represent an opportunity to build and prepare rather than exit.

In 2023, James sued James sued DCG and its CEO Barry Silbert, DCG’s now-bankrupt lending arm Genesis Global Capital and its former CEO Michael Moro and crypto exchange Gemini, alleging that they worked together to cover up a gaping $1 billion hole in Genesis’ balance sheet caused by the wipe-out of Singapore-based crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) in 2022. James said DCG and Genesis made “false assurances” on social media that DCG had absorbed Genesis’ losses from 3AC’s implosion when, in fact, they had just papered over the hole with a promissory note, pleading to pay Genesis $1.1 billion over 10 years at a 1% interest rate. While DCG has adamantly maintained that the promissory note was legitimate, James’ suit claimed that DCG has “never made a single payment under the Note.” While Gemini and Genesis both settled with the OAG, DCG, Silbert and Moro have fought them tooth and nail. Last spring, DCG and both executives filed motions to dismiss the suit, alleging that the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) had failed to state a claim — essentially arguing that they were not selling securities and thus should not be sued under New York State securities laws. But the judge presiding over the case disagreed in her Friday ruling, writing that the OAG had, at least at the current stage of the case, adequately alleged that the Gemini Earn program — the now-defunct Gemini lending product that went belly-up in November 2022 and which sits at the center of James’ case — was a security. Crane did, however, agree to toss out two of James’ claims against DCG, Moro and Silbert — one claim under New York’s Executive Law that they engaged in a scheme to defraud in the first degree, and another that they engaged in a conspiracy in the fifth degree — ruling that those claims were duplicative. Though Crane ruled the case can proceed, DCG said it isn’t done fighting. “As we have stated from the beginning, the allegations against DCG are a thin web of innuendo, mischaracterizations, and unsupported conclusions,” a spokesperson for DCG told CoinDesk. “We’re encouraged by the judge’s dismissal of the New York Attorney General’s most outrageous claims based on alleged violations of criminal fraud and conspiracy statutes. We will continue to fight this baseless lawsuit as we remain focused on our mission in support of the digital assets industry.”",Policy|Letitia James|DCG|Barry Silbert,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-11 22:14:48

With the market buzzing with possibilities, it’s not just the usual suspects like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu capturing attention. Newer meme coins are making waves, some even promising unique features that could make them the next big thing. Among these, some coins stand out in particular—like Troller Cat ($TCAT), which is set to launch soon, and others like Floki Inu, Turbo, Bonk, Popcat, and Notcoin, all gaining traction in the meme coin market. In this article, we’ll look at how these meme coins are heating up and why Troller Cat, in particular, might be the one to watch, especially with its upcoming presale and whitelist phase. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or new to the meme coin game, this list will give you the inside scoop on the rising stars in the crypto universe. 1. Troller Cat ($TCAT)- The New Meme Coin You Shouldn’t Miss Troller Cat is quickly gaining momentum as one of the most promising meme coins in 2025. Early investors are gearing up for something special as the presale rapidly approaches. With its focus on a unique play-to-earn (P2E) game center, Troller Cat is rumored to have deflationary mechanics that will reduce its supply and, ultimately, increase demand. This is exactly the kind of buzz that crypto enthusiasts love. The $TCAT whitelist is currently open, giving early adopters a chance to secure their positions before the presale goes live. If you’re looking to get in early on a meme coin with tremendous potential, the TrollerCat whitelist is your ticket. By signing up, you’ll not only be among the first to access the presale but could potentially enjoy high staking rewards. Analysts are already speculating that Troller Cat could follow the success of other big meme coins, rewarding those who act quickly. 2. Floki Inu ($FLOKI) – A Viking Meme Coin with Strong Community Support Floki Inu is a meme coin that’s built a loyal following, inspired by Elon Musk’s dog, Floki. It’s been making significant strides with its growing ecosystem and passionate community. The coin’s popularity surged after Musk tweeted about it, but it’s the community that’s really propelled Floki Inu forward. As a meme coin with real utility, it’s now working on its own NFT marketplace and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. Floki Inu made it to this list because it has the right balance of meme culture and growing ecosystem potential. The coin’s value has been steadily climbing, and its dedicated community makes it a formidable player in the meme coin space. 3. Turbo ($TURBO)- Speeding Ahead in the Meme Coin Race Known for its fast-moving nature, Turbo has been catching the attention of meme coin enthusiasts for its unique approach to engaging the community. The coin has made waves with its promise of high-speed transactions and decentralized governance. Unlike some meme coins, Turbo focuses on scalability, aiming to provide a faster, more efficient alternative in the meme coin market. Turbo’s ability to scale as the market grows makes it stand out. Investors are noticing this underdog coin, with many seeing it as a promising long-term investment. Turbo has earned its place on this list due to its rapid growth and unique features. 4. Bonk ($BONK) – A Meme Coin with Meme Potential Bonk made a splash on the meme coin scene by positioning itself as a fun, community-driven coin. Originating from the Solana blockchain, Bonk quickly gained traction for its meme value, even though it wasn’t initially intended to be anything more than a community experiment. However, it has since built a solid reputation, primarily due to its active community and growing user base. Despite its playful nature, Bonk is showing real promise. Its success is largely due to its community-first approach and strong backing from the Solana ecosystem. Bonk has made it to this list because of its fun vibes, viral success, and ongoing community engagement. 5. Popcat ($POPCAT) – The Meme Coin with Real Buzz Popcat is based on the popular meme of the cat that gained viral fame due to its wide appeal. The creators behind Popcat have capitalized on this meme, turning it into a fun, engaging cryptocurrency. Despite the playful concept, Popcat is drawing serious attention for its rapidly growing community and meme-driven marketing approach. Why has Popcat made it to this list? It’s simple: the meme factor. Popcat has tapped into the meme culture like few other coins have. It’s fun and easy to understand, and everyone loves a viral meme, making it one of the more promising meme coins today. 6. Notcoin ($NOT) – A Meme Coin with a Twist Notcoin is one of the newest meme coins on the scene, and it’s already making waves due to its unique branding and twist on the classic meme coin format. Unlike traditional meme coins, Notcoin seeks to bring value to its community by introducing features that are typically associated with serious projects, like a deflationary model and utility in DeFi platforms. Notcoin made it to this list because it combines the fun of meme coins with the seriousness of a utility coin. It’s capturing the attention of investors who are looking for the next big meme coin with real utility potential. 7. Would ($WOULD): The Underdog Meme Coin That’s Gaining Momentum Would has quietly become one of the most intriguing players in the meme coin space, drawing attention with its unique charm and growing community. While it doesn’t yet boast the recognition of giants like Dogecoin, its combination of playful branding and a solid development plan has piqued the interest of crypto enthusiasts. The token’s lighthearted approach has attracted a following of younger investors eager to be part of something fun yet potentially lucrative. Analysts believe that Would Coin is one to watch, as it’s creating waves despite being in its infancy. What truly sets Would apart is its focus on sustainability and its active community. Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype, Would has a roadmap in place with real goals, collaborations, and influencer partnerships. The buzz surrounding its potential is palpable, and as the meme coin market continues to evolve, Would could be the unexpected dark horse that surprises investors. Keep an eye on this one—it might just be the next big thing. Conclusion Based on the latest research, the best meme coins to keep an eye on are Troller Cat, Floki Inu, Turbo, Bonk, Popcat, and Notcoin. However, Troller Cat stands out as the next big meme coin with its potential for huge returns and unique features like its rumored deflationary P2E model and staking rewards.

Buffett’s net worth is now $153.5 billion after surging $11.5 billion this year alone, reports Bloomberg. Buffett’s gains stand out amid the tariff-induced selloff triggered by President Trump, which wiped trillions of dollars from global equities. And his gains come despite this month’s sell off, which reduced Buffett’s 2025 winnings by $14.5 billion. Buffett, who is now ranked fourth among global billionaires, is one of only two in the top 20 that grew richer this year. He’s alongside L’Oreal heiress Francoise Bettencourt Meyers, who has added $1.8 billion. After the tariff news hit, the top 500 billionaires shed over $500 billion in just two days. Elon Musk alone suffered a $134 billion loss, with net worth now standing at about $297 billion. Meanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett’s conglomerate, saw an 8.8% share decline since April 2, outperforming the S&P 500’s 10.7% fall. The company’s relative resilience stems from its focus on the property and casualty sector, which remains less affected by global trade disruptions. Buffett has avoided major deals, while trimming stakes in Apple and Bank of America, which have both been hit hard by the tariffs.

This marks its first move under its newly introduced digital asset treasury strategy, which involves staking. Janover Stakes its SOL Holdings As part of its new strategy, Janover plans to commence staking of its SOL holdings, which will generate more revenue for the tech firm. The company takes this laudable step only a week after its Board of Directors formally approves a new treasury policy. This lays the foundation for accumulating crypto assets over the long term. Moreover, the board preferred Solana as the first asset for this initiative. The company’s management highlighted how this step represents the first capital deployment from the $42 million financing round that it previously closed. Noteworthy, Janover’s decision comes when market conditions are favorable to investors. Most of these stakers are getting significant returns from their investments. According to Joseph Onorati, Janover’s CEO, the recent SOL purchase aligns with the company’s objective to become the most efficient and transparent platform for cryptocurrency accumulation in the public markets. Janover Plans to Operate Solana Validators Apart from staking the popular coin, Janover wants to operate a few Solana validators to improve its participation. Specifically, taking this step will allow the company to further participate in securing the Solana network while earning rewards that can be reinvested into the Janover treasury. In the company’s leadership opinion, this is a crucial move toward scaling its operations. More importantly, they are excited about the prospect that this will have no impact on Janover’s efficient capital deployment strategy. Solana Use Cases is on the Rise Again, this Janover move reflects Solana’s growing appeal, even among traditional financial institutions. Two weeks ago, top asset management firm BlackRock added its USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) to the Solana network. This expansion connected Traditional Finance (TradFi) with blockchain and included Solana in its ecosystem. Before then, Swiss-based digital asset company Taurus expanded its digital asset custody and token services to the Solana blockchain . This enabled banks to issue, manage, and securely store digital assets on Solana. Similarly, PayPal and Venmo users can now buy, sell, and hold LINK and SOL in their accounts.

Market trends indicate wallets between 1,000 and 10,000 Bitcoin are expanding at a rate higher than the 30-day average, reports CryptoQuant. Related Reading: From Joke To Juggernaut: Dogecoin Value Revolution Gets Nod From Global Asset Giant Large Investors Display High Confidence In Bitcoin The rise in the number of large crypto holders indicates rising confidence in the future of the cryptocurrency. These investors, usually not exchanges or mining pools, are important in maintaining the value of Bitcoin. Their increasing interest comes as Bitcoin’s market capitalization hits $1.58 trillion, with dominance over other cryptocurrencies at more than 60%. Bitcoin recently hit $83,400 before correcting slightly to settle above $80,000. The increase in these high wallet balances is consistent with Bitcoin’s recent price gains, indicating market strength despite external pressures. Large investor demand for Bitcoin is accelerating.

Typically bullish, signals strong investor confidence. pic.twitter.com/hR5Rumj6A6 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) April 10, 2025 Analysts Look To Price Gap Patterns For Future Projections Some market observers have offered their predictions on what direction the top digital asset may take next. An X (formerly Twitter) analyst by the name of Enzy Bitcoin says that Bitcoin usually goes up after the filling up of price gaps. The analyst mentioned the latest gap between $70,000 and $75,000, that Bitcoin may reach $130,000 in the near future based on historical trends. Source: CryptoQuant Another analyst, BitBull, equated Bitcoin’s stability to recent volatility in US stock markets. As the traditional markets have grappled with volatility, Bitcoin has remained firm above $80,000. Prices below $100,000 may still be acceptable entry points for investors, some experts say. BTC Long-Term Target Extremely Positive Looking further down the road, other market observers posted a very favorable prognosis for Bitcoin’s future only recently, emphasizing the significance of being cognizant of market cycles, particularly during pricing fluctuations like when in a bear trap. The analysts’ projection reads as unusually bullish, that perhaps Bitcoin may get to a whopping $250,000 price tag. This vision also predicts meaningful growth for major alternative cryptocurrencies. Market Cap Hits $1.58 Trillion While Recovery Keeps Momentum The latest price bounceback of the flagship crypto has taken its aggregate market value to $1.58 trillion when this report was made. This follows its appreciation by over $8,000 from recent lows, demonstrating the capability of the cryptocurrency to bounce back quickly from temporary declines. Related Reading: XRP ETF Launch Impresses Even In Bear Market, Says Analyst The market dominance of the cryptocurrency has also grown, currently standing at over 60% of the total crypto market capitalization. The dominance indicates that Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency and continues to attract investors who desire growth as well as a store of value. Although Bitcoin failed to sustain its short surge to $83,500, sustaining above $81,000 demonstrates resilience in the prevailing market environment.

Dogecoin’s path to $1 seems like a distant dream, while Shiba Inu’s 13% price jump lacks the fundamentals to back it up. Meanwhile, Ruvi AI (RUVI) is emerging as a game changer in the blockchain space, offering investors a much more profitable and stable opportunity. Set within a decentralized AI powered ecosystem, Ruvi is not just another crypto token; it’s a blueprint for scalable returns backed by innovation, real world utility and exceptional presale benefits. If you thought the 1160% ROI days in crypto were over, Ruvi AI is here to prove otherwise. The Problems with Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Dogecoin has its cultural appeal but the hard reality is it’s trading at cents and far from its all time highs. Even the most optimistic analysts are saying Doge won’t hit $1 for years and will need a speculative market and sustained celebrity endorsements to keep any momentum. Shiba Inu fares no better, with a 56% surge in trading volume only to reveal lackluster on-chain fundamentals. With a burn rate that has stalled and no deflationary measures, the SHIB token is more spark than fire for long term investors. Both tokens are symbols of meme culture and are held back by a lack of true innovation. Their legacy is in viral hype and speculative trading, neither of which deliver the consistent growth that today’s investors demand. What Makes Ruvi AI a Better Opportunity Ruvi AI turns the speculative crypto market on its head by providing an ecosystem for growth and utility. As the ultimate SuperApp for AI driven content, Ruvi allows users to generate text, image, audio and video content and get rewarded with $RUVI tokens. This isn’t a system built on fleeting market hype; it’s a self sustaining platform using blockchain to empower creators, businesses and developers. The Ruvi AI presale takes it to another level by offering incredible opportunities for early adopters to benefit from its tiered system. Unlike Dogecoin and Shiba Inu where ROI is dependent on market forces, Ruvi AI’s structure ensures its value grows with user engagement and ecosystem growth. VIP Tier Example: The Path to Extraordinary ROI The presale got investors attention fast and hit its first milestone just a few days after launch, raising over 100,000$ with more than 10M tokens sold. The benefits of Ruvi AI’s token system become clear when you look at its VIP bonus presale tiers. By buying 200,000 $RUVI tokens you get an 80% bonus, effectively doubling your holdings. With the presale price at $0.01, that means you can get into VIP 4 by investing $2,000. What does that mean for ROI when Ruvi AI’s utility driven token lists at $0.07? Your 200,000 tokens become 360,000 and their value is $25,200. That’s a 1160% ROI, showing the sheer potential of Ruvi compared to the uncertainty of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. For investors who won’t settle for mediocrity, the VIP 4 tier is the ultimate opportunity to maximize returns. Ruvi AI vs Meme Tokens There’s a reason Ruvi AI feels like a breath of fresh air in today’s crypto market. Where tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu collapse under the weight of speculative trading, Ruvi thrives on innovation and real world utility. Its decentralized model allows a community driven approach where token holders have governance rights and help shape its roadmap. Open to developers, contributors and content creators, Ruvi becomes more valuable the more it’s used. Meme tokens have little to offer beyond market sentiment and are especially vulnerable to price reversals, whale dumps and fading public interest. While Dogecoin waits for a bull market and Shiba Inu hopes for volume spikes, Ruvi AI is delivering immediate tangible value to its active users. A Smarter Future with Ruvi AI The crypto market is changing and so should your investment strategy. Ruvi AI is the intersection of community, utility and innovation, outperforming meme tokens in every way. Its presale mechanics offer unparalleled entry points, now is the time for forward thinking investors to get in. With a proven roadmap and built-in incentives like the VIP 4 tier, Ruvi AI isn’t just competing, it’s redefining what smart crypto investing looks like. Stop chasing speculative assets and start using an ecosystem that delivers gain potential while empowering its community to shape the future of blockchain and AI. Ruvi AI is the future of the digital economy.

The image shows the top five XRP wallets, with Uphold leading at 1.83% of the total XRP supply, followed by another large wallet holding 1.56%, identified by the community as one of the Bithumb wallets. Binance and Ripple also have several top positions, reinforcing the perception of strong institutional backing behind XRP. Top XRP Holders Revealed: Uphold, Binance, and Ripple Dominate with Billions in Reserves! Someone with unnamed hold approx 3 billion $XRP pic.twitter.com/jceBi8ryxz — Brett (@Brett_Crypto_X) April 10, 2025 Brett’s post pointed to the growing momentum surrounding XRP and emphasized how entities accumulating billions in tokens signal long-term confidence in the asset. Additionally, experts are increasingly encouraging retail investors to accumulate XRP, anticipating a pivotal role for the token in the future of finance. The concentration of such large amounts of tokens in institutional hands suggests that individual holders may have to move quickly to secure a meaningful position before broader adoption drives further demand. Institutional Dominance and the Road Ahead The image in Brett’s post revealed Uphold at the top with over 1.83 billion XRP, valued at around $3.7 billion. The second-highest wallet, now believed by the community to belong to Bithumb, holds over 1.56 billion XRP, worth approximately $3.1 billion. Binance, the largest global exchange, appears third with around $2.7 billion in holdings. Ripple controls two of the top five wallets, accounting for over 2.5 billion XRP combined. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Such heavy accumulation by institutions underscores a broader trend: increasing confidence in XRP’s future utility. Many analysts argue that XRP’s speed and low-cost transactions make it well-suited for cross-border payments and financial infrastructure, and this view appears to be supported by these major holdings. Now that Ripple is free to sell tokens to institutional investors , this adoption could rise rapidly in the coming months as regulatory clarity improves. Retail Investors May Face Pressure to Accumulate Several community responses to Brett’s post echoed a sense of urgency. One commenter remarked , “When giants are stacking billions in XRP, you don’t second guess, you accumulate.” This reflects a belief that the growing concentration of XRP in institutional wallets may limit availability for retail investors as adoption increases. Climbing the ranks of token holders has become significantly difficult . With over 3 billion XRP held collectively by the top three wallets alone, the data suggests that retail investors face an increasingly competitive landscape. One prominent XRP proponent recently stated that not holding at least 1,000 XRP is insanity . Brett and the broader XRP community message is clear: institutional interest is growing, and those who act early could benefit most.

Qubetics, Cosmos & Sonic Might Be the Smartest Picks of 2025",https://thecoinrise.com/looking-for-the-top-crypto-to-buy-qubetics-cosmos-sonic-might-be-the-smartest-picks-of-2025/,"Cosmos just gave the interoperability game a major glow-up. With the launch of Eureka on April 10, Cosmos transformed its IBC protocol from an in-house connector into a universal standard. This isn’t some copy-paste bridge job. Eureka lets Cosmos-based chains connect directly with Ethereum—natively. No clunky workarounds, no user drop-off, and no liquidity bleed. For developers building multichain apps with serious scale in mind, this is the roadmap. Cosmos isn’t just expanding; it’s redefining multichain architecture. That’s the kind of tech move that puts a token on any serious list of the top crypto to buy this year. Over on Sonic’s side, Fantom’s rebrand brought more than just a new name. Since January 2025, Sonic (S) has rolled out a full-scale upgrade focused on high-speed performance, streamlined interoperability, and revamped tokenomics with aggressive burning mechanisms. While S is still down nearly 40% for the year, large-scale trendlines show price movement hugging a key ascending support for 540+ days. That’s not noise; that’s a long-term base. Even with short-term pain, Sonic is bouncing off solid structural support—a classic recipe for those scouting the top crypto to buy on a technical reset. Now throw Qubetics into the mix—a project that isn’t patching holes but rebuilding the plumbing of digital finance from the ground up. The $TICS token powers a platform that’s solving what its predecessors fumbled: asset utility, legal compliance, and seamless interoperability. This isn’t a whitepaper dream—it’s a live infrastructure shift. And that’s exactly why Qubetics is drawing heavy attention from the smart money crowd sizing up the top crypto to buy with real-world upside. Qubetics ($TICS): Interoperability with Actual Utility Qubetics isn’t just building bridges—it’s laying down digital superhighways. The platform’s interoperability layer lets users, businesses, and entire institutions connect to multiple blockchains without friction. Whether it’s cross-border finance, data transfer, or tokenized identity flows, Qubetics runs on an architecture designed to unify ecosystems instead of fragmenting them. That matters when real-world value exchange is on the line. Qubetics’ decentralized framework makes it easy for a logistics company in Dallas to sync assets with a payment processor in Seoul, or for a freelance developer in Miami to tap into multi-chain liquidity without trusting a third-party bridge. For professionals, enterprises, and Web3-native users alike, Qubetics delivers cross-chain composability with security and compliance at the core. That’s why it’s front and center in every credible breakdown of the top crypto to buy for 2025. Qubetics Presale Snapshot & ROI Potential The Qubetics presale is currently in Stage 29. So far, more than 507 million $TICS tokens have been sold to over 24,600 holders, raising upwards of $16 million. The token price at this stage is $0.1573. Early buyers who entered at Stage 1 for $0.01 are already sitting on a 1473% gain. But it’s not too late. At $0.1573, $TICS still offers serious upside. If it hits $1, that’s a 535% return. At $5, it’s 3078%. At $6, it’s 3713%. At $10, that’s a 6256% ROI. And if $TICS reaches $15 after mainnet launch? That’s a 9434% return for current-stage buyers. It’s no stretch to say this is one of the best crypto presale opportunities going right now—and clearly a top crypto to buy before it hits major exchanges. Cosmos (ATOM): The Interoperability Blueprint The launch of Eureka marks a seismic shift for Cosmos. Until now, most multichain development relied on bridges—messy, slow, and usually centralized. With Eureka, Cosmos flipped the script by enabling true native interoperability between Ethereum and IBC-connected chains. This puts Cosmos in a whole new league. Developers can now create seamless dApps across ecosystems without liquidity fragmentation or user exit points. It turns Cosmos from an ecosystem play into a multichain nucleus. For any serious builder or backer looking for the top crypto to buy with structural potential, ATOM just got promoted. The timing couldn’t be better either. As more DeFi and NFT projects look for alternatives to slow, congested networks, Cosmos is stepping in with clean, secure, and scalable solutions. Sonic (S): Rebranded and Ready to Run Sonic (formerly Fantom) might be down 40% YTD, but don’t mistake the chart for the tech. Since its rebrand, Sonic has doubled down on infrastructure upgrades that include enhanced scalability, faster settlement, and deeply restructured tokenomics that lean on burning mechanisms to reduce supply. Sonic’s current trend suggests a wave-based correction, now entering a long-term accumulation phase. Price projections based on historical growth suggest S could climb significantly by 2026 and beyond. But the real setup? It’s technical. The asset has bounced off its ascending support line five times in 540+ days. That’s textbook base-building. For technical traders and early adopters chasing the top crypto to buy during cycle resets, Sonic is a prime candidate. The story here isn’t just a rebound. It’s a repositioning—and it could easily catch markets sleeping. Final Thoughts This isn’t about hype cycles or meme-fueled spikes. The top crypto to buy today comes down to one thing: infrastructure with purpose. Qubetics is addressing cross-chain finance with real utility and a presale that’s still hot. Cosmos is breaking multichain boundaries with native Ethereum interoperability. Sonic is laying low while building a bullish technical base. If timing is the key to crypto profits, these three names offer radically different but equally promising entries. For buyers eyeing the best 100x setups or short-term breakout cycles, this isn’t a list to scroll past. This is a lineup to act on. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs 1. Why is Qubetics considered a top crypto to buy in 2025? Qubetics offers unmatched utility through its interoperability infrastructure and is currently in a high-ROI presale stage. 2. How is Cosmos different after the Eureka upgrade? Cosmos now supports native IBC-to-Ethereum connections, eliminating bridges and boosting developer adoption. 3. What makes Sonic (S) a strong pick despite the 40% drop? Sonic’s ascending trendline and infrastructure reboot suggest long-term accumulation and bullish potential. 4. What is the current stage and price of the Qubetics presale? Stage 29 at $0.1573 per token, with 24,600+ holders and over $16 million raised. 5. Is Qubetics just for long-term holders? No. Its ongoing presale stage offers significant short-term ROI potential as well. The post Looking for the Top Crypto to Buy?

43229373,https://cryptonews.com/?p=350670,1744413543,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/43229373.jpeg,US Bitcoin Miners Prepare for Business Disruptions Due to China Tariffs,https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-miners-us-tariffs-escalate-disruption/,"Bitcoin (BTC) miners in the United States are preparing for business disruptions as the trade war between the US and China continues. On Thursday, April 9 the White House announced that the 125% import tax on China was in addition to a 20% tariff that President Trump imposed for China’s role in supplying fentanyl to the US. President Trump clarified that he has raised tariffs on Chinese goods by a total of 145% since taking office. Bitcoin Miners Face Increasing Buildout Costs While Trump’s newly enforced tariffs with China are having a major impact on the S&P 500, Bitcoin miners are also being hit hard . The US is heavily reliant on Bitcoin mining hardware produced in Southeast Asia, especially by companies like Bitmain , MicroBT, and Canaan. On April 2, Trump’s hiked tariffs also placed levies on Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia. These regions are home to some of the largest mining rig manufacturers. U.S. tariffs on Bitcoin mining machines just spiked across key manufacturing countries. China jumped from 25% to 54%. Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand went from 2% to over 20–30%. If U.S. demand drops, we could start seeing cheaper rigs show up abroad. pic.twitter.com/XQ2VlNTIij — Esprezzo (@Esprezzoapp) April 9, 2025 As a result, US-based miners that source equipment from these regions are facing business disruptions. ​​ Jaime McAvity, CEO of Cormint Data Systems – a US-based mining company – told Cryptonews that Cormint sources components from China including miners, transformers, pdus, power supplies and containers. “The tariffs will contribute to higher buildout costs,” McAvity said. “Miners that were manufactured in China are now completely uneconomical to import to the USA.” McAvity further stated that US firms that ordered equipment from China but have yet to take delivery will likely sell them in the Chinese market. “This will contribute to weaker demand and lower prices — creating an attractive investment opportunity for non-US based miners,” he said. Jill Ford, founder of Bitford Digital – a Texas-based company specializing in Bitcoin mining solutions and hosting services – told Cryptonews that the newly imposed China tariffs will hit American Bitcoin miners the hardest. According to Ford, US miners are now looking at a 22–36% increase in the cost of mining machines. “That kind of margin shift is significant – especially in an industry where efficiency is everything,” Ford said. “When US miners are forced to pay that much more per machine, it becomes incredibly difficult to remain competitive with international miners who aren’t facing the same cost pressures.” US miners face rising costs due to Trump's tariffs on China, potentially shifting $BTC mining offshore. Tariffs could increase equipment costs by 22-36%, impacting expansion plans. pic.twitter.com/NXaYkBvyNR — Alerts Via Web3 (@AlertsViaWeb3) April 9, 2025 Short-Term Disruption or Major Setback? Given this, Ford believes that the newly imposed US tariffs on China will create a major setback for the growth and global competitiveness of the American Bitcoin mining sector. For context, the American Bitcoin mining industry is an important player in the global market. The United States accounted for over 40% of the Bitcoin network’s global hashrate — the total computing power securing the Bitcoin protocol — at the end of 2024. Two US-based mining pools, Foundry USA and MARA Pool, accounted for over 38.5% of all blocks mined. According to TheMinerMag, Foundry USA grew its hashrate from 157 exahashes per second (EH/s) at the start of 2024 to roughly 280 EH/s by December. Yet with the majority of mining hardware being manufactured in China, Ford noted that US miners are looking at an added 36% cost per machine. “That kind of price hike will clearly force tough decisions. For many miners, it will no longer make economic sense to mine in the US – we can expect to see more mining operations shift overseas where equipment is more affordable and the market is healthier,” she stated. On the other hand, McAvity pointed out that as a result of the tariffs mining suppliers are in the process of onshoring production to the US – including Cormint. With this in mind, he views the tariffs with China as “a temporary business disruption.” “Since US production costs are higher than China, it will contribute to a long-term increase in costs, but it shouldn’t be too bad,” McAvity said. Echoing this, Ford remarked that it will be a smart move for US Bitcoin miners to start exploring alternatives from US-based manufacturers like Auradine, for example. “These alternatives are becoming more viable, and we’re already seeing global leaders like Whatsminer producing machines domestically. Bitmain is also planning to open a US warehouse this summer,” she said. Tariff’s Impact on Bitcoin Hashrate Higher operational costs in the US will make it less attractive for miners to expand their operations. However, miners in countries unaffected by the tariffs could gain a competitive edge. “The tariffs will likely slow hashrate growth in the US, but I don’t see them slowing global hashrate overall,” Ford said. “In fact, we’ll probably see hashrate continue to rise outside the US as mining operations shift to more cost-effective regions.” While this may be, McAvity pointed out that most miners with already installed Hashrate will likely welcome the slow growth in new Hashrate. Echoing this, Scott Offord, owner and founder of Bitcoin Mining World, told Cryptonews that the short-term effect might actually help existing miners with slightly better profitability. “Longer-term concerns about decentralization remain valid,” Offord said. “Miners should closely monitor how hashrate distribution shifts globally as a result.” US Bitcoin Miners Must Adapt or Die In addition to monitoring hashrate distribution, Ford stated that adaptability will be the key to success for US based miners. “Miners who diversify their supply chains and stay nimble will be in the best position to weather this,” she said. Shedding light on this, Offord advises Bitcoin miners dealing with tariffs to be proactive. “Secure existing in-stock inventory quickly, explore sourcing from lower-tariff countries, and prioritize partnerships with manufacturers assembling rigs in the USA. Optimize your current equipment’s lifespan and efficiency through careful maintenance and better tuning,” he said. Indeed, well-prepared Bitcoin miners will likely be impacted much less. Zach Bradford, CEO of US-based Bitcoin miner CleanSpark, told Cryptonews that CleanSpark is prepared for the tariffs, noting that the majority of the company’s miners and infrastructure required to meet near-term goals are already stateside. “While these tariffs may slow down competitors who lack our scale and resilience, we’re confident in our ability to maintain our momentum and lead the industry forward,” Bradford said.

Adding fuel to the fire, whispers of looming Trump tariffs are sending shivers down the spines of tech innovators, especially those dreaming of moonshot projects . Let’s dive into the week’s biggest tech letdowns and potential economic earthquakes, unpacked from Bitcoin World’s Equity podcast. Meta’s Llama Launch: A Damp Squib in the AI Race? Meta’s grand unveiling of its latest AI models was met with a collective ‘meh’ from the tech community. Despite being touted as the next leap in “open-ish” AI, Scout, Maverick, and Behemoth failed to ignite the expected excitement. Critics were quick to point out a distinct lack of innovation, a crucial element in today’s fiercely competitive AI race . Was this a genuine misstep, or something more calculated? The plot thickened as accusations of benchmark tampering began to surface on social media platforms like X and Reddit. Whispers of a mysterious ex-employee and discrepancies between public and private performance metrics added layers of intrigue to the Meta Llama saga. The attempt to regain the spotlight quickly devolved into a PR headache for the tech giant. Here’s a quick rundown of the key concerns surrounding Meta’s Llama release: Underwhelming Performance: Critics argue the models don’t represent a significant leap forward, especially compared to competitors. Benchmark Tampering Allegations: Rumors suggest Meta might have manipulated benchmarks to inflate the perceived performance of their models. Performance Discrepancies: Questions arise about the gap between how the models perform in controlled, private settings versus real-world, public applications. PR Backlash: The messy rollout and accusations have damaged Meta’s reputation in the AI space. Is Meta prioritizing impressive test scores over genuine, business-driving innovation? As Kirsten from Equity podcast aptly put it, “creating something to do well on a test doesn’t always translate to good business.” Trump Tariffs: A Looming Threat to Tech Innovation? Beyond the Meta Llama drama, another significant concern is the potential impact of Trump tariffs . The podcast episode delves into Trump’s renewed push for tariffs and how companies are bracing for potential economic fallout. While the specifics are still unfolding, the implications for moonshot projects and the broader tech industry are substantial. Why are tariffs a worry for innovative ventures? Increased Costs: Tariffs raise the price of imported components and materials, essential for many tech products, including AI hardware and infrastructure. Supply Chain Disruptions: Trade wars and tariffs can create uncertainty and instability in global supply chains, hindering production and innovation. Reduced Investment: Economic uncertainty due to tariffs can deter investment in long-term, high-risk projects like moonshot projects . Global Competitiveness: Tariffs can make domestic companies less competitive in the global market, especially in fast-evolving sectors like AI. For startups and companies pursuing ambitious, long-term goals, Trump tariffs represent a significant headwind. These projects often rely on global collaboration, international talent, and access to worldwide markets. Tariffs could stifle the very innovation they aim to foster. Beyond Llama and Tariffs: Other Highlights from Equity Podcast The Equity podcast episode wasn’t just about Meta Llama and Trump Tariffs . Here’s a quick peek at other fascinating topics discussed: Secretive EV Startup Backed by Bezos: Uncover the mystery surrounding Slate Auto, a Bezos-backed EV startup, and whether it’s his ‘Plan B’ in the electric vehicle space. Colossal Biosciences’ Dire Wolf Discovery: Explore the groundbreaking Dire Wolf discovery by Colossal Biosciences and question whether this breakthrough truly justifies the startup’s massive $10B+ valuation. Stay Tuned for More Insights This week’s Equity podcast episode provides a crucial snapshot of the tech world’s current anxieties and excitements. From the Meta Llama launch failing to impress to the looming threat of Trump tariffs on moonshot projects , and the intriguing developments in the EV and biotech sectors, there’s a lot to unpack.

43229650,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148832,1744414221,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Data Privacy Scrutiny: Ireland Investigates X’s Alarming Grok AI Training Tactics,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ireland-investigates-x-grok-data/,"Hold onto your data! In a move that’s sending ripples through the tech world, Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC) has launched a formal investigation into Elon Musk’s social media giant, X. The probe centers around concerns that X might be leveraging the European user data to fuel the training of its generative AI model, Grok. This development raises critical questions about data privacy and the boundaries of AI development, especially under the stringent regulations of GDPR. Why is Ireland’s DPC Investigating X Over Grok AI Training? The heart of the matter lies in how X is processing publicly accessible posts from European users. The DPC, known for its robust enforcement of GDPR , wants to determine if X has a legitimate legal basis for using this data to train its Grok AI chatbot. This investigation is not just a slap on the wrist; it’s a serious inquiry into whether X is playing by the rules when it comes to handling the personal information of its European users in the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence. Here’s a breakdown of what we know: The Trigger: The DPC initiated the investigation following concerns about X potentially using European users’ public posts for AI training purposes. GDPR at the Forefront: The investigation hinges on the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which mandates companies to have a valid legal basis for processing personal data. Powerful Regulator: Ireland’s DPC isn’t a newcomer to holding tech giants accountable. They have a track record of issuing substantial fines to major players like Microsoft, TikTok, and Meta. Past Actions: Interestingly, the DPC had already sought a court order last year to restrict X from using European user data for AI training models , indicating a pre-existing concern. What Does This Mean for Your Data Privacy? This investigation shines a spotlight on the often-murky waters of data privacy in the age of AI. Many users are unaware of how their publicly posted data might be used to train these powerful AI models. The DPC’s probe aims to clarify these practices and ensure that companies like X are transparent and compliant with regulations like GDPR when it comes to user data. Key Takeaways for Users: Awareness is Key: Be mindful that your public posts on platforms like X could potentially be used to train AI. GDPR Protection: If you are a European user, GDPR is in place to protect your data privacy rights. Regulatory Scrutiny: Regulators are actively examining how tech companies use data for AI training , signaling increased oversight in this area. The Shadow of GDPR: What Fines Could X Face? The stakes are incredibly high for X. Under GDPR , Ireland’s DPC has the authority to impose fines of up to 4% of a company’s global revenue. For a company the size of X, this could translate into billions of dollars. The precedent set by previous DPC fines against Meta, totaling nearly 3 billion euros, underscores the potential financial repercussions. This investigation serves as a stark reminder that non-compliance with GDPR can lead to significant financial penalties. Potential Implications of GDPR Fines: Aspect Details GDPR Fines Up to 4% of global revenue DPC’s Track Record History of substantial fines against tech companies Financial Impact on X Potentially billions of dollars in fines Industry-Wide Impact Sets a precedent for data privacy in AI training across the tech industry Grok AI and the Data Dilemma: How Much Data is Too Much? X’s AI venture, xAI, and its chatbot Grok are at the center of this controversy. The question arises: how much European user data is being used, and is it being done ethically and legally? While AI models require vast amounts of data for effective AI training , the source and usage of this data are under increasing scrutiny. The investigation highlights the ongoing debate about balancing innovation in AI with the fundamental rights of data privacy . The Data Question for Grok AI: Data Sources: Where exactly is Grok AI getting its training data from, specifically from European users? Opt-in vs. Opt-out: Was there clear and informed consent from users regarding the use of their data for AI training ? Transparency: Is X being transparent about its data usage practices for Grok AI? Ethical Considerations: Beyond legal compliance, are there ethical implications to using public user data for AI training models without explicit consent? Looking Ahead: The Future of Data Privacy and AI Training The Ireland DPC’s investigation into X is more than just a company-specific issue; it’s a bellwether for the future of data privacy in the age of AI. As AI models become increasingly sophisticated and data-hungry, regulatory bodies worldwide are likely to intensify their scrutiny of data handling practices. This investigation could set crucial precedents for how companies can ethically and legally utilize user data for AI training while respecting GDPR and similar data protection frameworks. The outcome will be closely watched by tech companies, regulators, and users alike, as it will shape the evolving landscape of AI development and European user data rights.

The change of gears could be attributed to the commission of the newly formed SEC Crypto Task Force, whose mandate is to harmonize securities laws for digital assets. 🚨NEW: The @SECGov and @binance have jointly asked the court to pause the case against the exchange for another 60 days. According to a recent filing, they’ve had “productive” talks, partly tied to the Crypto Task Force’s work, and say a continued pause is in everyone’s best… pic.twitter.com/0vH5MiE8wr — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) April 11, 2025 In the court documents filed to the US District Court, the lawyers of the SEC and Binance agreed to reveal “constructive communications” about the case. The parties agreed that the pause would be enough to negotiate and obtain the necessary approvals. In 2023, the SEC sued Binance for operating an unregistered clearing agency, broker, and exchange via its U.S. affiliate. The regulator also accused Binance of misusing customer assets and altering trading volumes on its U.S. platform. The recent filing reveals that more consideration has been given to how the SEC’s Crypto Task Force might bear on its case against Binance. This task force was created earlier this year to improve the regulation of the crypto industry, which has defined contemporary cases. As a response, the SEC and Binance have also contended that the continuance of the stay is in the best interest of the judicial economy. The current pause was intended to end on Monday but can be actually extended for the next 60 days if provided by the court. Binance’s legal troubles continue Binance has faced numerous legal issues since its formation in 2023. The SEC’s lawsuit accused Binance and CZ of bypassing US laws to get richer while subjecting investors to risks. In November 2023, CZ resigned from the CEO position and entered a plea before the DOJ on money laundering and money-transmitting business without a license. In the DOJ case, Binance consented to settle for more than $4 billion in fines. CZ was convicted in April 2024 and was given a four-month imprisonment but was later released in September of the same year. Binance continues to operate despite regulations and is also involved in the SEC-formed working group. Formed in February 2025, the task force aims to establish clear guidelines for digital assets. Such a broad policy can be considered an important move in shifting regulation clarification. Ripple and SEC near final settlement approval In another related development, Ripple Labs and the SEC draw closer to an end to a legal battle. Since both parties have filed cross-motions to stay their appeals pending settlement of the case, both appeals were withdrawn. This filing submitted to the U.S Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit affirms the existence of an agreement in principle. Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, publicly stated that the SEC would withdraw some components of the appeal related to the July 2023 ruling, which was beneficial for Ripple. However, the SEC must review and ratify the proposed plan. According to the legal representatives, more time would also be required for the SEC Commission to approve the resolution. After approval, the District Court would deliver an indicative ruling to complete the settlement. Market analysts have predicted approval to happen in sync with the appointment of Paul Atkins as SEC Chairman. Atkins, a nominee under the current Trump administration, received Senate approval recently and is expected to assume office shortly. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

They’ve integrated USD1, a U.S. dollar stablecoin linked to World Liberty Financial – a project connected to the family of former U.S. President Donald Trump – as a new collateral asset . This move is generating buzz and sparking conversations across the crypto community. Let’s dive into what this means for users, the market, and the future of stablecoins. What’s the Buzz About Falcon Finance and USD1 Stablecoin? For those unfamiliar, Falcon Finance is a stablecoin issuer that has been making waves in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Backed by DWF Labs, a well-known entity in the crypto investment and web3 space, Falcon Finance aims to provide robust and reliable stablecoin solutions. Now, they’re taking a bold step by adding USD1 to their list of supported collateral assets. USD1 stablecoin itself is quite interesting. It’s a U.S. dollar pegged stablecoin issued by World Liberty Financial. What makes it particularly noteworthy is its association with World Liberty Financial, a project driven by the family of Donald Trump. This connection instantly adds a layer of intrigue and, for some, perhaps even controversy, given the polarizing nature of the Trump name in global politics and finance. Why is Adding USD1 as Collateral Asset a Big Deal? So, why is Falcon Finance’s decision to include USD1 as a collateral asset significant? Let’s break down the key benefits and implications: Expanded Options for Users: Adding USD1 broadens the spectrum of assets users can leverage within the Falcon Finance ecosystem. This increased choice is always a welcome development, giving users more flexibility in managing their crypto portfolios. Potential for Increased Liquidity: Introducing a new, potentially popular stablecoin like USD1 as collateral can boost liquidity within Falcon Finance’s platform. Higher liquidity generally translates to smoother transactions and potentially better yields for users engaging in DeFi activities like lending and borrowing. Market Diversification: By supporting USD1, Falcon Finance is diversifying its collateral base. This reduces reliance on a single or limited number of assets and can contribute to a more robust and resilient platform overall. Attracting a New User Base?: The Trump family association with USD1 might attract a specific segment of users who are politically aligned or simply curious about projects linked to prominent figures. This could potentially expand Falcon Finance’s user base and market reach. Navigating the Landscape: Benefits and Challenges of USD1 Collateral While the addition of USD1 as a collateral asset presents several advantages, it’s crucial to consider both the potential benefits and challenges. Here’s a balanced perspective: Benefits: Novelty Factor: USD1’s unique background can generate media attention and user interest simply due to its connection to the Trump family. This novelty could be a powerful marketing tool and draw in curious investors. Potential for Growth: If World Liberty Financial and the USD1 stablecoin project gain traction, early integration as a collateral asset could position Falcon Finance favorably in a growing market. Ideological Alignment (for some): For individuals who are supporters of Donald Trump or his political ideologies, USD1 might represent a stablecoin that resonates with their values, potentially leading to increased adoption within this demographic. Challenges: Political Polarization: The Trump name is highly divisive. Associating with USD1 could alienate users who are politically opposed to Trump, potentially limiting the broader appeal of Falcon Finance. Regulatory Scrutiny: Projects with high-profile or politically connected figures often face increased regulatory attention. USD1 and Falcon Finance might be subject to closer examination by regulatory bodies. Reputational Risks: Any controversies or negative press associated with Donald Trump or his family could indirectly impact the reputation of USD1 and, by extension, platforms like Falcon Finance that support it. Market Volatility and Trust: Like all stablecoins, USD1 will need to maintain its peg to the U.S. dollar. Market volatility and any doubts about its reserves or operational transparency could erode trust and negatively affect its viability as collateral. USD1 Stablecoin and Falcon Finance: A Deeper Dive To better understand the implications, let’s consider some key aspects in more detail: Feature Falcon Finance USD1 Stablecoin Type Stablecoin Issuer & DeFi Platform U.S. Dollar Pegged Stablecoin Backing DWF Labs World Liberty Financial (Trump Family Linked) Function Provides stablecoin solutions, now accepts USD1 as collateral Aims to be a reliable digital representation of the U.S. dollar Significance of Collaboration Expands collateral options, potentially increases liquidity and user base Gains wider platform adoption, enhances visibility Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? So, what should crypto users and investors make of this development? Here are some actionable insights: For Falcon Finance Users: If you are already using Falcon Finance, the addition of USD1 gives you more options for collateralizing your positions. Explore how this new asset can fit into your DeFi strategies. For USD1 Holders: If you hold USD1, its inclusion as collateral on Falcon Finance increases its utility and potential use cases within the DeFi ecosystem. For DeFi Enthusiasts: Keep an eye on how USD1 performs as collateral on Falcon Finance. Monitor its liquidity, stability, and user adoption. This could be an interesting case study of how politically connected or novelty stablecoins fare in the market. Due Diligence is Key: As with any crypto investment or platform, always conduct thorough research. Understand the risks associated with both Falcon Finance and USD1 before engaging with them. Pay attention to audits, transparency reports, and community sentiment. Conclusion: A Bold Move with Potential and Questions Falcon Finance’s decision to add USD1 stablecoin as a collateral asset is undoubtedly a bold and attention-grabbing move. It introduces a unique element into the DeFi landscape – a stablecoin with direct ties to a prominent political family. While this could bring benefits like increased user interest and market diversification, it also comes with potential challenges related to political polarization, regulatory scrutiny, and reputational risks. The success of this integration will depend on various factors, including the performance and stability of USD1, the broader market response, and how effectively Falcon Finance navigates the potential challenges. It’s a development worth watching closely as it unfolds in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency and stablecoins.

43229928,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148865,1744414814,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Landmark Crypto Regulation: Pakistan Proposes Essential Compliance Framework,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/pakistan-crypto-regulation-framework/,"In a significant move for the digital asset landscape, Pakistan is stepping up its game in the cryptocurrency arena. The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has unveiled a proposed regulatory framework specifically designed for cryptocurrencies. This isn’t just another set of rules; it’s a compliance-focused approach meticulously crafted to align with the stringent guidelines set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). For anyone involved in or observing the crypto space in Pakistan, this development is essential to understand. Understanding Cryptocurrency Regulation in Pakistan The core of this initiative is the proposed cryptocurrency regulation in Pakistan . Spearheaded by the FIA, this framework is not about stifling innovation but about fostering a secure and compliant environment for digital currencies to thrive. According to reports from Cointelegraph, the primary objective is to ensure adherence to international standards, particularly those concerning terrorism financing, anti-money laundering (AML), and know-your-customer (KYC) procedures. This move signals a maturing perspective on digital assets within Pakistan, acknowledging their potential while prioritizing national security and financial integrity. Key aspects of the proposed cryptocurrency regulation in Pakistan include: Focus on FATF Compliance: The framework is built around the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force, an intergovernmental body setting global standards on money laundering and terrorist financing. Balancing Innovation and Security: FIA Director Sumera Azam emphasized that the regulations aim to strike a delicate balance. The goal is to encourage technological advancement in the digital currency sector without compromising national security. Addressing Financial Crimes: A major driver behind this regulatory push is to combat the potential misuse of cryptocurrencies for illicit activities, including money laundering and terrorism financing. Protecting Investors: By implementing KYC processes and AML measures, the framework seeks to create a safer environment for individuals and institutions engaging with cryptocurrencies in Pakistan. Why FATF Crypto Compliance is Crucial The emphasis on FATF crypto compliance is not arbitrary. FATF’s recommendations are globally recognized benchmarks for combating financial crimes. For Pakistan, adhering to these standards is particularly important for several reasons: International Recognition and Trust: Compliance with FATF guidelines enhances Pakistan’s credibility within the international financial community. It signals that the nation is serious about tackling financial crime and operating within global norms. Avoiding the Grey List: Pakistan has been under increased scrutiny from FATF in the past. Robust FATF crypto compliance measures can help prevent being placed on or remaining on the FATF grey list, which can have negative economic repercussions. Facilitating International Collaboration: A compliant framework makes it easier for Pakistan to collaborate with other nations in combating cross-border financial crimes involving cryptocurrencies. Promoting Responsible Crypto Adoption: By aligning with FATF standards, Pakistan can encourage the responsible adoption of cryptocurrencies, attracting legitimate businesses and investments while deterring illicit activities. AML and KYC: Cornerstones of Pakistan’s Crypto Framework At the heart of the proposed regulations are Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) processes. These are not new concepts in traditional finance, but their application to the crypto world in Pakistan is a critical development. Effective AML KYC Pakistan measures are designed to: AML (Anti-Money Laundering) KYC (Know Your Customer) Purpose: To prevent the use of the financial system for money laundering, which is the process of making illegally-gained proceeds appear legitimate. Purpose: To verify the identity of customers to prevent identity theft, financial fraud, money laundering, and terrorist financing. Measures: Transaction monitoring, reporting suspicious activities, record-keeping, and compliance programs. Measures: Customer identification procedures (CIP), customer due diligence (CDD), and ongoing monitoring of customer activity. Benefits in Crypto Context: Reduces the risk of cryptocurrencies being used for illicit activities, protects the integrity of the financial system. Benefits in Crypto Context: Enhances security, prevents fraud, and builds trust in the crypto ecosystem, making it safer for users. For cryptocurrency exchanges and service providers operating in Pakistan, robust AML KYC Pakistan compliance will be non-negotiable under the new framework. This will likely involve implementing systems and procedures to verify user identities, monitor transactions for suspicious patterns, and report any illicit activities to the relevant authorities. The Broader Pakistan Crypto Framework: Balancing Act Beyond AML and KYC, the overall Pakistan crypto framework aims to create a structured and balanced ecosystem. It’s not just about restrictions; it’s about providing a clear pathway for the development and adoption of digital currencies within a regulated environment. This framework is expected to address several key areas: Licensing and Registration: Establishments dealing with cryptocurrencies may need to obtain licenses and register with regulatory bodies to operate legally in Pakistan. Taxation: The framework may clarify the tax implications of cryptocurrency transactions and holdings, providing clarity for both businesses and individuals. Consumer Protection: Regulations could include measures to protect consumers from fraud, scams, and market manipulation within the crypto space. Innovation and Growth: While compliance is paramount, the framework is also expected to foster innovation by providing a clear and predictable regulatory landscape for crypto businesses to operate and grow. Navigating the Pakistan Digital Currency Policy Landscape The proposed regulatory framework is a significant step in shaping Pakistan digital currency policy . It reflects a pragmatic approach, acknowledging the global trend towards digital assets while prioritizing risk management and compliance. For stakeholders in the crypto space, including investors, businesses, and technology enthusiasts, understanding this evolving policy landscape is crucial. Actionable Insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of the latest developments in Pakistan’s cryptocurrency regulations. Follow updates from the FIA and other relevant government bodies. Prepare for Compliance: If you are operating a crypto-related business in Pakistan, start preparing for stricter AML and KYC requirements. Invest in compliance infrastructure and training. Engage with Regulators: Participate in industry consultations and dialogues with regulators to contribute to the development of effective and balanced regulations. Educate Users: Promote user education on the importance of compliance, security, and responsible crypto practices. Conclusion: A Promising Step Towards a Regulated Crypto Future Pakistan’s proposed compliance-focused regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies is a promising development. It signals a move towards a more structured and secure digital asset ecosystem. By prioritizing FATF compliance, AML, and KYC, Pakistan is taking proactive steps to mitigate risks while potentially unlocking the benefits of cryptocurrency innovation. While challenges may lie ahead in implementation and adaptation, this framework represents a significant leap forward in the evolution of Pakistan digital currency policy .

43230068,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148867,1744415111,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Unstoppable ChatGPT Dominates Global App Download Charts, Surpassing TikTok and Instagram",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/chatgpt-dominates-app-downloads/,"In a remarkable turn of events in the ever-evolving digital landscape, ChatGPT has achieved a feat that underscores its growing influence and user adoption. Forget doomscrolling on social media for a moment, because the AI chatbot that’s been on everyone’s lips (and screens) has just hit a major milestone. ChatGPT became the most downloaded app worldwide in March, dethroning the usual suspects like Instagram and TikTok from their top spots in the global app arena. Let’s dive into the details of this impressive surge and what it means for the future of AI and mobile applications. ChatGPT’s Astonishing Ascent to the Top of App Downloads March marked an unprecedented month for ChatGPT, as it soared to become the world’s most downloaded app, excluding games. This isn’t just a minor victory; it’s a seismic shift in the download charts . For the first time, ChatGPT has claimed the monthly download crown, surpassing established giants like Instagram and TikTok. This milestone is not just a testament to ChatGPT’s popularity but also highlights the increasing mainstream adoption of AI technology. Here’s a breakdown of ChatGPT’s phenomenal March performance: Record-Breaking Downloads: ChatGPT amassed a staggering 46 million new downloads in March alone. Month-over-Month Growth: Installs jumped by an impressive 28% compared to February. Chart-Topping Position: This surge propelled ChatGPT to the No. 1 position, outperforming Instagram (No. 2) and TikTok (No. 3). This data, recently reported by app intelligence provider Appfigures, paints a clear picture: ChatGPT is not just a trending topic; it’s a dominant force in the global app market. What Fueled ChatGPT’s Download Surge? While the raw numbers are impressive, it’s crucial to understand what factors contributed to this massive spike in app downloads . Several upgrades and market dynamics appear to have played a significant role: Image Generation Upgrade: March saw the first major enhancement to ChatGPT’s image generation capabilities in over a year. This update sparked viral trends, particularly the Studio Ghibli style image generation, captivating users and driving engagement. Content Moderation Adjustments: OpenAI’s decision to remove some content moderation safeguards for images likely broadened the creative possibilities and appeal of ChatGPT. AI Voice Feature Upgrade: Improvements to ChatGPT’s AI voice feature further enhanced user experience and utility. However, Appfigures suggests that these feature upgrades might not be the sole drivers of this download frenzy. The firm’s founder and CEO, Ariel Michaeli, offers a compelling perspective: “It’s starting to feel like ChatGPT is becoming a verb, a lot like how Google did in the 2000s, to the point where many don’t think ‘AI’ but rather ‘ChatGPT.” This “ChatGPT as a verb” phenomenon suggests that the chatbot’s brand recognition is becoming synonymous with AI itself. When people think of AI, or hear about exciting developments in the field, ChatGPT is often the first application that comes to mind. This brand power could be a significant factor in its download charts success. The ChatGPT Effect: Brand Recognition and AI Dominance ChatGPT’s brand recognition isn’t just a marketing buzzword; it’s a tangible advantage in the competitive landscape of AI chatbots . Michaeli’s observation highlights a crucial point: ChatGPT’s name is now so deeply ingrained in the public consciousness that it benefits from the overall excitement surrounding AI, even from the buzz generated by its competitors. Consider these points regarding ChatGPT’s brand power: First-Mover Advantage: ChatGPT gained significant traction early on, establishing itself as the go-to AI chatbot for many users. Name Recognition: The name “ChatGPT” is now widely recognized and understood, even by those less familiar with AI technology. Halo Effect: Excitement around AI in general, including competitors like Grok or Claude, often inadvertently drives users to download ChatGPT due to its dominant brand presence. This brand dominance poses a challenge for other AI chatbots . Anthropic’s Claude, for instance, reportedly faces an uphill battle in achieving comparable download numbers, not necessarily due to technological inferiority, but partly due to weaker brand recognition. Grok, backed by Elon Musk, might fare better due to Musk’s personal brand and the X platform for distribution, showcasing the power of brand association in the AI space. TikTok and Instagram: Still Major Players in the App Arena While ChatGPT stole the spotlight in March, it’s essential to acknowledge the continued dominance of Instagram and TikTok in the global app ecosystem. These platforms have consistently held top positions in download charts and remain incredibly popular worldwide. Here’s a quick look at their recent performance and influence: App Previous Ranking (Jan-Feb 2025) March 2025 Ranking Key Factors TikTok No. 1 No. 3 Earlier download surge due to potential US ban concerns; still a social media giant. Instagram No. 2 No. 2 Held No. 1 position throughout 2024; strong popularity, especially among US teens. Instagram’s consistent popularity, particularly among younger demographics in the US, is highlighted by a Piper Sandler survey, which found it to be the most-used social app among U.S. teens (87% monthly usage), surpassing TikTok (79%) and Snapchat (72%). The Broader App Download Landscape Beyond the top three, March’s download charts reflect the continued strength of social media and communication apps. Meta’s Facebook and WhatsApp rounded out the top 5, while other notable apps in the top 10 included CapCut, Telegram, Snapchat, Meta’s Threads, and Temu. Collectively, the top 10 apps garnered an impressive 339 million downloads in March, exceeding February’s 299 million, indicating a robust and growing app market. Conclusion: The Dawn of the AI App Era? ChatGPT’s ascent to the top of the global app download charts is more than just a statistical anomaly; it’s a powerful indicator of shifting user behavior and the increasing centrality of AI in our digital lives. While social media giants like Instagram and TikTok remain formidable, ChatGPT’s triumph signals a potential new era – one where AI-powered applications are not just niche tools but mainstream utilities, shaping how we interact with technology daily. The brand recognition ChatGPT has cultivated, combined with ongoing advancements in AI capabilities, positions it as a frontrunner in this evolving landscape. As AI continues to permeate various aspects of our lives, ChatGPT’s download charts success may well be a harbinger of things to come – a future where AI chatbots and similar applications play an even more prominent role in the mobile app ecosystem.

In a surprising turn, Binance Research’s latest report suggests otherwise. While traditional markets, particularly the U.S. Treasury market, grapple with heightened volatility and the looming threat of carry trade liquidations, Bitcoin appears to be showing unexpected resilience. Let’s dive into the key findings of this intriguing report and explore what it means for the future of crypto investments. Is Bitcoin Volatility Really Tamer Than We Think? For years, Bitcoin volatility has been a double-edged sword. It’s attracted adventurous investors seeking high returns, but simultaneously deterred more risk-averse institutional players. However, the narrative might be shifting. Binance Research’s report highlights that despite increased correlation with broader market trends, Bitcoin’s price swings haven’t been as dramatic as one might expect, especially when juxtaposed against the turbulence in the U.S. Treasury market. Key Takeaways from Binance Research on Bitcoin Volatility: Unexpected Stability: Bitcoin’s realized volatility is currently lower than many anticipated, considering the macroeconomic uncertainties. Treasury Market Turmoil: The U.S. Treasury market is exhibiting significant volatility, creating potential risks for carry trades. Correlation, Not Chaos: While Bitcoin’s correlation with traditional markets has increased, it hasn’t necessarily translated into amplified volatility for the cryptocurrency itself. Central Bank Lifeline?: The report suggests that potential liquidity support from global central banks could act as a buffer, providing a safety net for the crypto market. Factor Impact on Bitcoin Volatility U.S. Treasury Market Volatility Potential to increase market-wide risk sentiment, but Bitcoin’s volatility remains comparatively contained. Increased Market Correlation Leads to some influence from traditional market movements, but not necessarily heightened Bitcoin-specific volatility. Central Bank Liquidity Support Could act as a stabilizing force, potentially further reducing perceived and actual crypto volatility . Crypto Volatility vs. Traditional Market Turmoil: A Stark Contrast? The report underscores a crucial point: while the cryptocurrency market is often perceived as a hotbed of volatility, traditional financial instruments, particularly government bonds, are currently facing their own set of challenges. The U.S. Treasury market, a cornerstone of global finance, is experiencing fluctuations that are raising eyebrows and triggering concerns about broader financial stability. This situation puts the spotlight on crypto volatility in a new light. Is it possible that in certain macroeconomic climates, Bitcoin could actually represent a relatively less volatile asset compared to segments of the traditional financial system? Treasury Market Jitters: Why Should Crypto Investors Care? Why should cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors pay attention to the rumblings in the treasury market ? The answer lies in interconnectedness. Financial markets, despite their diverse asset classes, are not isolated islands. Volatility in the U.S. Treasury market, often considered a benchmark for global risk-free rates, can have ripple effects across the entire financial landscape. Here’s why it matters for crypto: Risk Sentiment: Treasury market instability can heighten overall risk aversion in the market. This can lead investors to reduce exposure to perceived ‘riskier’ assets, including cryptocurrencies. Carry Trade Liquidations: The report mentions the risk of carry trade liquidations. In simple terms, carry trades involve borrowing in a low-interest-rate currency to invest in a higher-yielding asset. Volatility in the treasury market can disrupt these strategies, potentially leading to forced selling and market downturns, impacting all asset classes, including crypto. Liquidity Concerns: Treasury market stress can sometimes signal broader liquidity issues in the financial system. Liquidity is the lifeblood of any market, and its contraction can negatively affect asset prices. Central Banks to the Rescue? Potential Liquidity Support The Binance Research report offers a glimmer of hope amidst the market uncertainty. It suggests that potential liquidity support from global central banks could provide a cushion for the cryptocurrency market. Central banks play a crucial role in maintaining financial stability. In times of market stress, they can inject liquidity into the system to prevent credit crunches and market meltdowns. How could this benefit crypto? Market Stabilization: Central bank intervention can calm market nerves and reduce overall volatility, benefiting all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Improved Liquidity: Increased liquidity in the broader financial system can trickle down to the crypto market, making trading smoother and potentially supporting price levels. Investor Confidence: Central bank support can signal a commitment to financial stability, boosting investor confidence and potentially attracting more capital to the crypto space. Navigating the Current Market Landscape: Actionable Insights So, what are the actionable takeaways for crypto investors from this Binance Research report? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on macroeconomic developments, particularly in the U.S. Treasury market and any signals from global central banks. Manage Risk: While Bitcoin volatility might be lower than expected currently, the crypto market is still inherently volatile. Ensure your portfolio risk is aligned with your risk tolerance. Diversification: Diversification remains a prudent strategy. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, even if that basket is Bitcoin. Consider diversifying across different cryptocurrencies and asset classes. Long-Term Perspective: Focus on the long-term fundamentals of the crypto market and individual projects. Short-term volatility, even if surprisingly contained, is still a factor. Conclusion: A Silver Lining in Market Uncertainty? Binance Research’s report offers a fascinating perspective on the current market dynamics. The finding that Bitcoin volatility is lower than expected, especially amidst the turbulence in the U.S. Treasury market, is noteworthy. While caution remains paramount in navigating the crypto landscape, the potential for central bank support and the relative stability of Bitcoin compared to some traditional market segments could present a powerful silver lining for crypto enthusiasts. The situation is fluid, and continuous monitoring is key, but this report certainly provides food for thought and a potentially more optimistic outlook than some might have anticipated.

This decision follows what both parties described as “productive discussions” and will provide more time for further deliberations. US SEC and Binance Agree To Pause Legal Proceedings The SEC initially sued Binance in 2023, accusing the exchange and its executives, including former CEO Changpeng Zhao, of violating federal securities laws, who is now the Strategic Advisor to Pakistan’s Crypto Council. The charges centred on Binance’s operation as an unlicensed clearing agency, broker, and exchange. Additional allegations included the commingling of funds and manipulation of trading volume on Binance.US, its U.S. affiliate. These serious claims led to the ongoing litigation, which was paused multiple times to allow the parties to negotiate and clarify their positions. Earlier this year, the SEC requested a 60-day pause in the case to allow for discussions around a new crypto task force to clarify how securities law might apply to digital assets. That pause was set to expire on April 14, 2025, but the SEC and Binance have now mutually agreed to extend it for an additional two months. Reasons for the Continued Binance SEC Pause The SEC, in its filing, explained that the discussions between both parties had focused on how the work of the newly formed crypto task force could impact the case. The task force, created to address regulatory issues in the cryptocurrency sector, may provide clearer guidance on how U.S. securities law applies to digital assets. The SEC also pointed out that additional time was needed for authorization from the Commission before making any decisions or revisions in the scope of the case. Binance, for its part, agreed that an extension of the pause was in everyone’s best interest and would help to facilitate the ongoing discussions between the two sides. “The continued pause is appropriate and in the interest of judicial economy,” the filing stated. Both the SEC and Binance have indicated that they aim to resolve the matter efficiently, without unnecessary delays or complications. Crypto Task Force’s Role in the Case The SEC’s newly established crypto task force may shape how digital asset transactions are treated under U.S. law. In a recent statement, Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda emphasized the importance of clear regulations for the cryptocurrency market and noted that the task force’s role is to create long-term solutions for regulating crypto trading. Uyeda also suggested that a “time-limited, conditional exemptive relief framework” might be appropriate to allow innovation in blockchain technology while maintaining regulatory oversight. He encouraged market participants to contribute their views on where such exemptions might be necessary to foster industry growth. The crypto task force’s efforts may influence how the SEC handles its case against Binance and its broader approach to regulating the digital asset space. The task force aims to ensure that U.S. law can adapt to the rapidly evolving technology behind cryptocurrencies while also protecting investors and ensuring market integrity. Next Steps in the Legal Proceedings With the case now paused for another 60 days, the SEC and Binance will continue their discussions and await further guidance from the crypto task force. The next update on the case’s status will come after the 60-day period. As the pause continues, like the Ripple vs SEC case , stakeholders in the cryptocurrency industry will closely monitor the outcome of the discussions, as the case could set important precedents for future regulatory actions. The SEC, as a result, has clarified that it is focused on ensuring compliance with securities laws, while Binance has stated its commitment to working within the framework of U.S. regulations.

43230341,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148882,1744415759,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking OpenAI Lawsuit: Ex-Staffers Unite Against For-Profit AI Transition,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/openai-lawsuit-non-profit-transition/,"In a dramatic turn of events shaking the foundations of the artificial intelligence world, a group of former OpenAI employees has thrown their weight behind Elon Musk’s lawsuit against the AI giant. This isn’t just another legal squabble; it’s a battle for the soul of AI, questioning whether altruistic missions can survive in the cutthroat world of tech profits. For crypto enthusiasts and investors closely watching the tech landscape, this lawsuit could signal significant shifts in how AI development and governance are perceived and regulated, potentially impacting blockchain applications and the future of decentralized AI. Why are Ex-OpenAI Staffers Taking a Stand? Twelve former OpenAI employees have formally submitted an amicus brief, essentially a ‘friend of the court’ filing, supporting Elon Musk’s claims. Their core argument? That OpenAI’s proposed shift from a non-profit ethos to a fully for-profit transition fundamentally betrays its original mission. These aren’t just disgruntled ex-employees; they are individuals who were deeply invested in OpenAI’s initial vision. Let’s break down their key concerns: Mission Betrayal: The brief argues that converting the non-profit arm’s controlling stake in OpenAI would directly violate the organization’s founding principles. Breach of Trust: They claim this restructuring would break the trust with employees, donors, and stakeholders who believed in OpenAI’s non-profit commitments. Safety Concerns: The ex-staffers worry that a for-profit OpenAI might prioritize financial gains over AI safety and responsible development. These concerns echo sentiments voiced by some of these individuals previously. Gretchen Krueger has publicly advocated for greater accountability, while Daniel Kokotajlo and William Saunders have warned against a “reckless” race for AI dominance. Carrol Wainwright has even cautioned against trusting OpenAI’s promises of future ethical conduct. Their collective action underscores the gravity of their worries. The Contentious History of OpenAI’s Structure OpenAI’s organizational structure is a bit of a maze, and understanding it is crucial to grasping the current non-profit vs. for-profit transition debate. Here’s a timeline: Year Event Significance 2015 Founded as a non-profit organization. Mission: Ensure AI benefits all humanity. 2019 Converted to a “capped-profit” model. Retained a non-profit wing with controlling stake. Present Pushing for full Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) status. Aiming for further restructuring towards a fully for-profit model. Musk’s lawsuit centers on the argument that OpenAI is abandoning its original non-profit mission. While a judge denied a preliminary injunction to halt the conversion, the case is set for a jury trial in spring 2026, indicating the legal battle is far from over. Why Does the Non-Profit Structure Matter? According to the ex-employees’ brief, the current structure, with a non-profit controlling the corporate arm, isn’t just an organizational quirk; it’s “crucial” and “critical” to OpenAI’s mission. They argue that this structure was deliberately designed to safeguard against purely financial motivations overshadowing the goal of beneficial AI. Here’s why they believe it’s so important: Mission Alignment: The non-profit governance ensures decisions are made with humanity’s benefit in mind, not just shareholder returns. Charter Commitments: OpenAI’s charter document outlines key principles for its mission, which were treated as binding commitments internally. Recruitment Tool: OpenAI used its unique governance structure to attract talent, contrasting itself with competitors like Google and Anthropic. The brief even recounts a 2020 all-hands meeting where CEO Sam Altman allegedly emphasized the “paramount” importance of non-profit governance in prioritizing safety and societal benefits over short-term profits. This highlights the perceived internal understanding that the non-profit element was fundamental to OpenAI’s identity and purpose. The Fear of a Fully For-Profit OpenAI The ex-staffers warn of a dystopian scenario if OpenAI becomes fully for-profit . They suggest this could incentivize the company to cut corners on safety and concentrate powerful AI in the hands of shareholders. A key concern is the “merge and assist” clause in OpenAI’s charter. This clause pledges OpenAI to stop competing and assist any “value-aligned, safety-conscious” project that achieves Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) first. In a purely for-profit model, the brief argues, OpenAI might have little incentive to honor this commitment. Growing Opposition to OpenAI’s Transition The ex-OpenAI employees are not alone in their opposition. Earlier this week, a coalition of organizations, including non-profits and labor groups, petitioned the California Attorney General to block OpenAI’s for-profit transition . They accuse the company of failing to protect its charitable assets and subverting its mission of safe AI. Encode, another non-profit, echoed similar concerns in a previous amicus brief. OpenAI, however, maintains that the for-profit transition will strengthen its non-profit arm, providing resources for “charitable initiatives” in healthcare, education, and science. They claim the non-profit will benefit from billions of dollars through its controlling stake. In a series of posts on X, OpenAI stated they are “getting ready to build the best-equipped nonprofit the world has ever seen.” High Stakes for OpenAI The pressure is on OpenAI to finalize its for-profit conversion by the end of this year or next. Failure to do so could jeopardize significant capital raised recently. This timeline adds urgency to the ongoing legal battles and public scrutiny. The coming months will be critical in determining the future trajectory of OpenAI and the broader landscape of AI ethics and governance.

After bouncing from recent lows, XRP is now pushing against the $1.96 resistance level — a breakout above could signal a new bull phase for the asset. As the broader market stirs back to life in Q2 , some analysts believe XRP may finally have the momentum to regain its former highs, especially if global remittance use cases begin to accelerate. The token remains a favorite for long-term holders aiming for a 2x–5x move by year’s end. ETHEREUM: ALL EYES ON SCALABILITY AND STAKING IN 2025 Ethereum remains the backbone of the decentralized ecosystem, and in April 2025 , it’s once again at the center of the conversation. With increased Layer-2 adoption and a surge in staking participation, ETH is showing renewed strength just above the critical $2,000 mark. Devs are optimistic that upcoming EIP upgrades and cross-chain integrations will push ETH back toward its all-time high. Institutional interest is also picking up, with ETH-based ETFs and DeFi staking products capturing attention. As a result, many expect Ethereum to serve as a stabilizing force in portfolios while also offering mid-term upside — potentially delivering a solid 3x–4x by Q4 2025 if conditions align. SOLANA: SURGING DEVELOPER ACTIVITY AND DAPP EXPLOSION Solana has been making serious noise in Q2 2025 , buoyed by an explosion in developer activity and new dApps launching on-chain. With transaction speeds outpacing competitors and fees staying ultra-low, SOL has re-established itself as the go-to network for high-performance applications. Traders are watching for a sustained move above $200 , which could open the doors to a parabolic run similar to 2021 . If the network maintains uptime and community growth, Solana could easily climb into the top three by market cap — and offer a potential 5x–10x window for early 2025 entrants. MAGACOIN FINANCE: THE DARK HORSE GATHERING STEAM JOIN OVER 12,500+ INVESTORS – SECURE YOUR SPOT NOW While XRP, ETH, and SOL dominate headlines, one rising star is making its way into high-level watchlists: MAGACOIN FINANCE . The project has quietly amassed a major following, with influencers, YouTubers, and Telegram communities buzzing over what some are calling the “ SHIBA of 2025 — but with structure.” Despite the wider market’s hesitancy, MAGACOIN FINANCE has already surpassed record levels in presale traction, a rare feat for a newcomer. Its multi-stage launch model, strong political meme branding, and early viral traction have analysts whispering about a possible 70x surge before the year ends. With its price at $0.0002908 some projections go even further, claiming that a $100 investment could return $10,000 — a whopping 2,900% gain — if market conditions and community hype align post-listing. The real story? MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t just a memecoin. It’s shaping up to be a movement, and savvy investors are already positioning before listings go live.

The top US crypto exchange rolled out support for Wayfinder (PROMPT) on Thursday, the same day the token launched. Wayfinder bills itself as an omni-chain tool “providing groundbreaking ways for AI to interact with blockchain environments.” The project’s whitepaper notes that it will also be used for blockchain-based games. “Wayfinder is an AI agent framework able to power blockchain-based games, with Parallel Studios’ Colony as an initial game incorporating Wayfinder’s technology, as well as provide generalized on-chain AI capabilities to both developers and non-technical users. Wayfinder’s innovations in enabling AI agents to operate within blockchain environments are achieved via the development of what is being termed ‘wayfinding paths,’ which serve as an instruction set and roadmap for AI agents. This enables them to navigate blockchain environments with the goal of attaining a unique endpoint, such as a particular DEX on XYZ chain, a decentralized marketplace, or a Web3 enabled tool.” PROMPT is down more than 27% on its first day of trading. Coinbase listed the asset with an “ experimental label ,” which the platform uses for tokens that pose certain risks, such as price swings and canceled orders because of lower trading volume and availability.

After a stretch of sideways movement and bearish pressure that left the altcoin range-bound, ADA is now displaying signs of revival. The current price action might not be explosive, but it carries the hallmarks of a market quietly building strength one step at a time. This growing momentum suggests that bulls are gradually returning to the scene with renewed confidence. While caution remains across the broader crypto landscape, ADA’s calculated pace might actually be a sign of strength rather than weakness. Instead of rushing into overbought conditions, the altcoin is laying a solid foundation that could support a more durable rally. The Calm Setup For A Calculated Climb In a recent post on X, crypto analyst Gemxbt pointed out that Cardano exhibited a bullish structure, as the price trends steadily above 5, 10, and 20-hour moving averages. This alignment of short-term moving averages typically signals sustained buying pressure and growing bullish momentum in the market. It also suggests that the bulls are maintaining control in the short term, keeping Cardano on a steady upward path. Related Reading: Cardano Price Prediction: ADA Set To Crash To $0.4 After Correction To Liquidity Zone Gemxbt’s observation reinforces that ADA’s recent price action isn’t just a temporary spike but rather a sign of strengthening technical foundations. When prices remain consistently above multiple key moving averages, it often reflects increased trader confidence and a favorable environment for further upward movement. He further noted that a key resistance level lies around the $0.62 mark, which could act as a near-term hurdle for ADA’s price advance. On the downside, solid support has formed near the $0.56 level, providing a cushion against potential pullbacks. These levels are crucial in determining the next directional move, as a break above resistance could trigger further gains, while a fall below support might signal short-term weakness. Gemxbt also highlighted that the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is currently crossing above the signal line, which suggests growing buying interest. This crossover typically marks the beginning of a momentum shift in favor of the bulls, increasing the likelihood of continued price appreciation. Potential Breakout Possibilities: What To Watch For If Cardano continues its upward trajectory and successfully breaks above the $0.68 resistance level, it could open the door to more gains. The next key levels to watch are at $0.81 and $0.90, where the price may encounter additional selling pressure. A break above these levels would push ADA toward even higher targets, such as $1.17 and $1.58. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Rockets Over 60%, Crushing Bears in a Stunning Rally! However, if ADA fails to break through the $0.68 level and retreats, the first support to monitor would be around $0.56 to $0.52, which has historically acted as a strong floor. A drop below these levels could signal a shift in market sentiment and lead to a deeper pullback.

For those deeply invested in the crypto world, especially Solana (SOL), the latest update from Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart is crucial. Are we on the verge of seeing a Solana ETF finally hit the market? Let’s dive into the details and understand what this could mean for you and the broader crypto landscape. Why is the Solana ETF Deadline of October 10th Generating Buzz? According to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, the earliest final deadline for a Solana ETF application is now set for October 10th. This date isn’t just plucked out of thin air; it represents a critical point in the regulatory process. Seyffart highlighted in a recent podcast that it’s improbable for the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) or its dedicated Crypto Task Force to reach a decision on approving a Crypto ETF of this nature before this date. This essentially sets the stage for a nail-biting wait until at least October for any definitive news. But why is this deadline so important, and what makes a Solana ETF such a hot topic? Regulatory Timelines: The SEC has specific timelines for reviewing and approving or rejecting ETF applications. October 10th represents a key milestone in this process for any potential SOL ETF . Market Anticipation: The crypto market, particularly Solana enthusiasts, are eagerly anticipating a positive decision. An approved Solana ETF could unlock significant institutional investment in SOL. Analyst Insights: James Seyffart’s statements carry weight in the ETF world, and his setting of this deadline provides a concrete timeframe for market expectations. What are the Potential Benefits of a Solana ETF? The introduction of a Solana ETF could be a monumental step for the Solana ecosystem and the broader cryptocurrency market. Let’s explore some of the key benefits: Increased Accessibility for Investors: An ETF makes investing in Solana significantly easier for retail and institutional investors. They wouldn’t need to navigate crypto exchanges, wallets, or private key management. Buying and selling SOL would be as straightforward as trading stocks through traditional brokerage accounts. Boost to Solana’s Market Capitalization: ETFs can channel substantial capital into the underlying asset. Approval of a SOL ETF could lead to a significant influx of funds into Solana, potentially driving up its price and market capitalization. Legitimization of Solana as an Asset Class: An ETF approval by the SEC would lend further legitimacy to Solana as a recognized and investable asset class. This could attract more institutional investors who are currently hesitant to invest directly in cryptocurrencies. Enhanced Liquidity: ETFs are traded on exchanges, providing high liquidity. A Solana ETF would enhance the overall liquidity of SOL, making it easier for investors to buy and sell without significantly impacting the price. Diversification Opportunities: For investors looking to diversify their portfolios, a Solana ETF offers a convenient way to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency market without directly holding SOL tokens. Challenges and Hurdles in SEC Approval for a Crypto ETF While the prospect of a Crypto ETF , especially a Solana ETF, is exciting, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges and regulatory hurdles that must be overcome. The SEC has been cautious in approving cryptocurrency-based ETFs, and for good reason. Here are some of the key challenges: Challenge Description Market Manipulation Concerns The SEC has expressed concerns about the potential for market manipulation in the cryptocurrency space, which could affect the price and stability of a Crypto ETF . Custody and Security Ensuring the secure custody of the underlying Solana assets for an ETF is a critical concern. The SEC needs to be convinced that robust and reliable custody solutions are in place. Regulatory Uncertainty The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. The SEC is navigating uncharted territory, and its approach to crypto ETFs is still being developed. Volatility of Crypto Assets Cryptocurrencies, including Solana, are known for their volatility. The SEC needs to assess how this volatility might impact the risk profile of a SOL ETF and investor protection. Defining ‘Crypto Task Force’ Role James Seyffart specifically mentioned the SEC’s Crypto Task Force. Understanding the exact role and influence of this task force in the ETF approval process is crucial but remains somewhat opaque. What Does the October 10th Deadline Mean for Your Crypto Investments? The October 10th deadline for a potential ETF Deadline is more than just a date on the calendar; it’s a potential inflection point for Solana and the crypto market. Here’s what investors should consider: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on news and updates related to Solana ETF applications and SEC announcements. Reliable sources like Bloomberg and reputable crypto news outlets are essential. Manage Expectations: While the deadline is set, SEC approval is not guaranteed. Be prepared for both positive and negative outcomes. Market volatility around this date is highly probable. Diversify Your Portfolio: Regardless of the ETF outcome, diversification remains a sound investment strategy. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, even if you are bullish on Solana. Understand Risk Tolerance: Crypto investments are inherently risky. Assess your risk tolerance and invest accordingly. ETFs can mitigate some risks associated with direct crypto ownership, but risks remain. Beyond October 10th: The Future of Solana and Crypto ETFs Whether the SEC approves a Solana ETF by October 10th or not, the trajectory of crypto ETFs is clear: they are becoming an increasingly important part of the financial landscape. The demand for regulated and accessible crypto investment products is growing, and ETFs are a natural evolution in this space. Even if this particular deadline passes without approval, the push for a Crypto ETF , including those based on Solana, will likely continue. The industry is maturing, and regulatory frameworks are slowly catching up. The October 10th deadline is a significant marker in the journey toward a Solana ETF. It represents the earliest possible date for a final decision and underscores the ongoing dialogue between the crypto industry and regulatory bodies like the SEC. While uncertainty remains, the potential benefits of a Solana ETF are undeniable, promising to broaden access, enhance legitimacy, and inject significant capital into the Solana ecosystem. Keep watching this space – the next few months could be pivotal for Solana and the future of crypto investment.

The class action lawsuit alleged BofA violated New York’s Exempt Income Protection Act (EIPA) by mishandling and charging improper fees to customers who had been slapped with court-order restraints. Specifically, the lawsuit says that BofA grouped multiple accounts together before calculating how much of the customers’ funds were legally protected, leading to more funds being frozen than allowed by law. The lawsuit also alleged BofA issued checks to debtors for the exempt amount by regular mail, meaning that the class members faced delays in accessing the money needed for daily expenses. BofA has agreed to the terms of the settlement without admitting to any wrongdoing. On top of the multi-million-dollar payout, BofA says it is permanently changing its practices, including: Stopping aggregating accounts when computing how much money is protected by law. Notifying account holders of their rights if their accounts had been restrained. Halting the practice of issuing checks for exempt funds so customers can access their money as needed via debit cards, online bank transfers and others. The settlement is subject to court approval.

Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda has voiced the need for an interim crypto rules framework. This isn’t about long-term, rigid structures, but rather a nimble, short-term approach designed to nurture blockchain innovation while the complexities of permanent crypto regulation are ironed out. Is this the breath of fresh air the crypto industry has been waiting for? Let’s dive into the details. Why an Interim Crypto Regulatory Framework? Uyeda’s suggestion, made during a roundtable discussion of the SEC’s Cryptocurrency Task Force (TFT), highlights a critical challenge: how to regulate a rapidly evolving space without stifling its growth. He pointed out the necessity to explore more efficient ways to regulate within a comprehensive federal framework. The core idea is to create a supportive environment for blockchain innovation to flourish in the short term, paving the way for more robust and well-considered crypto regulation in the future. Think of it like building a house. You need scaffolding to support the structure while the permanent walls are being constructed. This interim framework is the scaffolding for the crypto industry. Key Benefits of a Short-Term Crypto Regulatory Approach Fosters Innovation: By providing clear, albeit temporary, guidelines, businesses gain the confidence to innovate without fear of immediate, potentially restrictive, long-term regulations. This is crucial for unleashing the full potential of blockchain innovation . Flexibility and Adaptability: Interim frameworks can be more easily adjusted and updated as the crypto landscape evolves. This agility is vital in a sector known for its rapid pace of change. Reduced Uncertainty: The current regulatory uncertainty is a major hurdle for crypto businesses. A short-term framework can provide much-needed clarity and reduce anxiety, encouraging investment and growth. Inclusivity: Uyeda emphasized the need for an “inclusive federal regulatory framework.” This suggests a desire to create rules that are accessible and fair for all participants in the crypto space, not just large institutions. What Could an Interim Framework Look Like? Conditional Exemptions Uyeda specifically mentioned a “conditional exemption system” as a possible component of this interim SEC regulatory framework . What could this mean in practice? Imagine a system where certain crypto activities or projects are granted exemptions from existing securities laws, provided they meet specific conditions. These conditions could include: Transparency Requirements: Projects might need to provide clear and accessible information about their operations, tokenomics, and risks. Investor Protection Measures: Implementing safeguards to protect investors from fraud and manipulation, perhaps through disclosure requirements or limitations on investment amounts for certain types of investors. Operational Standards: Establishing basic operational standards for crypto exchanges and platforms to ensure security and reliability. Time Limits: Exemptions could be granted for a limited period, aligning with the “interim” nature of the framework, and reviewed periodically. Challenges and Considerations While the idea of an interim SEC regulatory framework is promising, there are challenges to consider: Defining “Interim”: How long is “short-term”? Clarity on the duration of the interim framework is crucial to avoid prolonged uncertainty. Balancing Innovation and Protection: Striking the right balance between fostering blockchain innovation and protecting investors will be delicate. Regulations must be robust enough to prevent harm but not so restrictive as to stifle progress. Coordination: Effective crypto regulation requires coordination among various regulatory bodies, not just the SEC. Ensuring a unified approach will be essential. Industry Input: For the framework to be truly effective and inclusive, active engagement with the crypto industry is paramount. Roundtable discussions like the one Uyeda participated in are a good starting point. The Cryptocurrency Task Force and Future Discussions The roundtable discussion where Uyeda made these remarks was the first of four scheduled meetings of the SEC’s Cryptocurrency Task Force (TFT). The focus of this initial meeting was on adjusting cryptocurrency trading regulations. This indicates that the SEC is actively engaging with the complexities of crypto regulation and seeking input from various stakeholders. The fact that the SEC is holding these discussions and considering innovative approaches like interim frameworks is a positive sign. It suggests a willingness to adapt and find pragmatic solutions to regulate the crypto space effectively without hindering its transformative potential. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on developments from the SEC and the Cryptocurrency Task Force. These discussions will directly shape the future of crypto regulation . Engage in Dialogue: If you are involved in the crypto industry, consider participating in industry forums and discussions to contribute your perspective to the regulatory conversation. Prepare for Change: Whether you are a crypto investor, developer, or business owner, be prepared for regulatory changes. An interim framework could bring both opportunities and adjustments to the way you operate. Conclusion: A Sensational Step Towards Balanced Crypto Regulation? Mark Uyeda’s suggestion of an interim crypto regulation framework is a potentially sensational development. It signals a nuanced approach from the SEC, acknowledging the need to support blockchain innovation while working towards long-term regulatory clarity. This could be a crucial step in fostering a healthy and thriving crypto ecosystem in the United States. The coming months will be critical as the SEC continues its discussions and potentially moves towards implementing this innovative regulatory strategy.

For years, Bitcoin has been touted as ‘digital gold,’ a safe haven in times of economic uncertainty. But what if this narrative is fundamentally flawed? Recent findings suggest a surprising twist: Bitcoin correlation is increasingly mirroring the movements of tech stocks , rather than acting as a true alternative to gold . Let’s dive deep into this fascinating shift and explore what it means for your crypto investments. Is Bitcoin Really Digital Gold? Unpacking the Correlation Conundrum The idea of Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ has been a cornerstone of its appeal, especially for investors seeking diversification away from traditional markets. The narrative painted a picture of Bitcoin as an uncorrelated asset, a hedge against inflation and economic downturns, much like its precious metal counterpart, gold. However, a recent report from Franklin Templeton Digital Assets throws a wrench into this long-held belief. The report highlights a critical divergence in price action, suggesting that Bitcoin’s price movements are becoming increasingly intertwined with the tech stocks , specifically the Nasdaq, rather than with gold price fluctuations. Here’s a breakdown of the key findings: Correlation with Tech Stocks Surges: The report reveals that Bitcoin’s correlation with tech-heavy indices like the Nasdaq can reach as high as 0.7. This indicates a strong positive relationship – when tech stocks rise, Bitcoin tends to follow suit, and vice versa. Weak Correlation with Gold: In stark contrast, Bitcoin’s correlation with gold rarely climbs above 0.3. This weak correlation suggests that Bitcoin and gold largely move independently of each other, challenging the ‘digital gold’ thesis. Challenging the Narrative: Franklin Templeton argues that Bitcoin’s inherent volatility, exposure to regulatory changes, and speculative nature make it fundamentally different from gold, which is traditionally seen as a store of value and a safe-haven asset. Why is Bitcoin Mimicking Tech Stocks? Delving into the Drivers So, why are we witnessing this shift in Bitcoin correlation ? Several factors are likely at play, contributing to Bitcoin’s increasing alignment with tech stocks : Risk-On Asset Perception: Despite its aspirations of being ‘digital gold,’ Bitcoin is often perceived by many investors as a risk-on asset, similar to growth stocks in the technology sector. When investor sentiment is bullish and risk appetite is high, both tech stocks and Bitcoin tend to benefit. Conversely, during periods of uncertainty or economic downturn, both may face selling pressure. Institutional Investment Flows: The growing institutional adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could be a significant factor. Many institutional investors allocate capital across various asset classes, including technology stocks and now, digital assets. Investment strategies that allocate to both tech and crypto might inadvertently contribute to correlated price movements. Technological Innovation Narrative: Bitcoin, at its core, is a technological innovation. It’s intertwined with the broader narrative of disruptive technologies and digital transformation, themes that heavily influence the tech stock market. This shared narrative can drive investor interest and potentially lead to correlated price action. Macroeconomic Factors: While the report suggests independent price movements are largely the norm, both Bitcoin and tech stocks can react to broader macroeconomic events. For instance, interest rate hikes or changes in monetary policy can impact both sectors, albeit perhaps for different reasons. Gold vs. Bitcoin: A Tale of Two Assets in Times of Global Uncertainty While the long-term correlation might be weak, it’s crucial to examine how both assets react to specific global events. The recent market activity provides a compelling example. As reported by Crypto Briefing , we observed contrasting reactions: Bitcoin’s Rebound on PPI Data: Bitcoin recently experienced a notable rebound, surging above $83,000. This surge was triggered by lower-than-expected Producer Price Index (PPI) data, which suggested easing inflationary pressures. This positive economic data boosted risk assets, including tech stocks and Bitcoin. Gold’s Record High Amid Trade Tensions: Simultaneously, gold reached a record high of $3,236. This surge was fueled by escalating U.S.-China trade tensions, highlighting gold’s traditional role as a safe-haven asset during geopolitical uncertainty. This divergence underscores a crucial point: while both assets can react to global events, their underlying drivers and investor perception remain distinct. Gold’s price surge was driven by fear and uncertainty, while Bitcoin’s rebound was linked to positive economic data and risk-on sentiment. Navigating the Crypto Investment Landscape: Actionable Insights So, what does this mean for you, the crypto investor? Understanding the Bitcoin correlation with tech stocks versus gold provides valuable insights for your crypto investment strategy: Re-evaluate Diversification Strategies: If you’re seeking true portfolio diversification and aiming to reduce correlation with traditional equity markets, relying solely on Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ might be insufficient. Consider incorporating other assets with lower correlation to both tech stocks and Bitcoin. Monitor Tech Sector Performance: Keep a close eye on the performance of the tech sector, particularly indices like the Nasdaq. Tech stock trends could offer valuable clues about potential Bitcoin price movements. Understand Risk Profiles: Acknowledge that Bitcoin, at least currently, behaves more like a risk-on tech asset than a safe-haven like gold. Adjust your risk tolerance and investment strategy accordingly. Stay Informed on Macroeconomic Factors: While correlation is important, macroeconomic events and overall market sentiment will continue to play a significant role in both Bitcoin and gold price movements. Stay informed about economic data releases, geopolitical developments, and central bank policies. The Future of Bitcoin: Beyond the ‘Digital Gold’ Narrative? The findings presented by Franklin Templeton challenge the simplistic ‘digital gold’ narrative surrounding Bitcoin. While Bitcoin may eventually evolve into a more uncorrelated asset, its current behavior suggests a stronger affinity with the technology sector. This isn’t necessarily a negative development. The tech sector is known for innovation and growth potential, and Bitcoin’s association with it could attract further investment and adoption. However, for investors seeking a true safe-haven asset and portfolio diversification, it’s crucial to understand Bitcoin’s evolving correlation dynamics. The ‘digital gold’ narrative might need to be revisited, and investment strategies should be adapted to reflect the reality of Bitcoin’s price movements in relation to both tech stocks and gold price . The world of crypto investment is constantly evolving, and staying informed and adaptable is key to navigating its complexities successfully.

Imagine the aroma of fries mixed with the electrifying buzz of crypto – a combination that might have been, but for now, remains just a thought. The National Center for Public Policy Research, a McDonald’s shareholder, put forward the idea, suggesting that embracing Bitcoin could solidify McDonald’s market leadership. But the golden arches seem to be staying grounded in tradition for now. Let’s dive into what exactly happened and what it means for corporate crypto adoption. Why a Bitcoin Proposal for McDonald’s? The core argument from the National Center for Public Policy Research was simple yet compelling: as more and more major corporations are dipping their toes (or diving headfirst) into the cryptocurrency waters, shouldn’t McDonald’s also consider adding Bitcoin investment to its financial strategy? Their proposal highlighted the growing trend of companies diversifying their balance sheets with digital assets, positioning it as a move to stay ahead of the curve and maintain a competitive edge. Think of companies like MicroStrategy or Tesla, who have made significant Bitcoin allocations. The proposal suggested McDonald’s could benefit from similar strategic diversification. Here’s a breakdown of the rationale: Following the Trend: The proposal pointed out that numerous companies are already incorporating Bitcoin into their financial reserves. Maintaining Leadership: By adopting Bitcoin, McDonald’s could be seen as innovative and forward-thinking, reinforcing its position as a market leader. Potential Financial Benefits: Bitcoin’s potential for appreciation could offer McDonald’s a new avenue for returns on their assets. Essentially, the shareholder group believed that a Bitcoin proposal was a strategic move for McDonald’s to future-proof its finances and brand image in an increasingly digital world. McDonald’s Response: No Bitcoin Discussion at Shareholder Meeting Despite the seemingly logical arguments presented in the Bitcoin proposal , McDonald’s didn’t bite. The company officially announced that this particular proposal would not be up for discussion at their upcoming May shareholder meeting. This wasn’t a simple oversight; McDonald’s actively filed documentation with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to ensure the proposal was kept off the agenda. The SEC, in turn, validated McDonald’s stance, confirming the company’s right to decide which proposals are discussed at its shareholder meetings. So, why the cold shoulder from the house of the Big Mac? Several factors might be at play: Risk Aversion: McDonald’s is a publicly traded company with a responsibility to stakeholders. Bitcoin, while having potential, is also known for its volatility. A large corporation like McDonald’s might be wary of the perceived risk associated with holding a significant amount of Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Focus on Core Business: McDonald’s primary business is fast food. Management might prefer to concentrate on core operations, expansion, and traditional financial instruments rather than venturing into the relatively new and complex world of cryptocurrency investments. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. McDonald’s, with its vast international operations, might be hesitant to engage with Bitcoin until there’s clearer and more consistent regulatory frameworks in place worldwide. The Shareholder Meeting and Corporate Governance This situation highlights interesting aspects of corporate governance and the role of the shareholder meeting . Shareholder meetings are platforms where company management and shareholders can interact, discuss company performance, and vote on important matters. Shareholders have the right to submit proposals, but not all proposals are guaranteed to be discussed or voted upon. Companies, like McDonald’s, have mechanisms and rights, often validated by regulatory bodies like the SEC, to manage the agenda of these meetings. This instance shows the balance of power between shareholders and corporate management. While shareholders can voice their opinions and suggest strategic directions, ultimately, the company’s leadership has significant control over what gets formally considered and acted upon. What Does This Mean for Corporate Bitcoin Adoption? While McDonald’s decision might seem like a setback for proponents of corporate Bitcoin adoption , it’s crucial to view it in perspective. Not every company will, or should, jump into Bitcoin immediately. McDonald’s specific business model, risk appetite, and strategic priorities differ from companies like tech firms or those in the financial sector that have been quicker to adopt Bitcoin. However, this episode does underscore several key points regarding corporate crypto strategies: Diversity in Corporate Approaches: Companies will have varied approaches to cryptocurrency. Some will be early adopters, some will be cautious observers, and others might completely avoid it. This diversity is natural and reflects different business needs and philosophies. Shareholder Influence: This case demonstrates the potential for shareholder activism in pushing for crypto adoption. While this particular proposal was rejected for discussion, it signals a growing interest among some investors in seeing corporations explore digital assets. Long-Term Trend: Despite McDonald’s current stance, the broader trend of corporate interest in cryptocurrencies is likely to continue. As the crypto market matures, regulations become clearer, and use cases expand, more companies may reconsider their position on digital assets like Bitcoin. Actionable Insights: Is Bitcoin Right for Your Business? Whether you’re a shareholder, a business owner, or simply curious about the intersection of crypto and corporations, McDonald’s situation offers some valuable insights. Thinking about corporate Bitcoin adoption for your own business or investments? Consider these points: Consideration Actionable Insight Risk Tolerance Assess your company’s risk appetite. Bitcoin is volatile. Is your business prepared for potential price swings? Strategic Alignment Does Bitcoin align with your long-term business strategy? How would it fit into your financial goals and brand image? Regulatory Landscape Stay informed about crypto regulations in your operating jurisdictions. Seek legal and financial advice to navigate compliance. Shareholder/Stakeholder Sentiment Gauge the interest and concerns of your shareholders and stakeholders regarding crypto adoption. Open communication is key. Ultimately, the decision to adopt Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency is a complex one, requiring careful consideration of various factors unique to each business. Conclusion: A Pause, Not a Full Stop on Corporate Crypto? McDonald’s decision to not discuss the Bitcoin proposal at its shareholder meeting isn’t necessarily a definitive ‘no’ to crypto forever. It’s more accurately a ‘not now.’ It reflects a cautious approach from a major corporation, prioritizing its current strategies and risk management. However, the conversation around corporate Bitcoin adoption is far from over. Shareholder interest is evident, and the broader trend towards digital assets is undeniable. While you might not be able to buy your Big Mac with Bitcoin just yet, the seeds of change are sown. Keep watching this space – the future of corporate finance and cryptocurrency is still being written, one proposal, one shareholder meeting, and one SEC filing at a time.

43231455,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148933,1744418406,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crucial AI Copyright Fight: Law Professors Support Authors Against Meta,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-copyright-meta-authors-lawsuit/,"In a significant development for the burgeoning field of AI and content creation, a group of distinguished law professors has stepped into the legal ring, siding with authors locked in a copyright dispute with tech giant Meta. This case, revolving around Meta’s Llama AI models and their training on copyrighted ebooks, could set a precedent for how intellectual property is treated in the age of artificial intelligence. For those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, where digital ownership and rights are paramount, this legal battle over AI Copyright is a crucial one to watch. Why is the Meta AI Lawsuit a Landmark Case for Copyright? The heart of the matter lies in the lawsuit, Kadrey v. Meta, where authors like Richard Kadrey, Sarah Silverman, and Ta-Nehisi Coates accuse Meta of using their ebooks to train its Llama AI models without proper authorization. The professors, in their amicus brief, argue against Meta’s defense of ‘fair use’, calling it an overreach. Let’s break down why this is so important: Challenging ‘Fair Use’ in the AI Era: Meta claims its use of copyrighted material for AI training falls under ‘fair use’. The professors argue this is a dangerous expansion of fair use, suggesting it grants AI developers unprecedented privileges compared to human creators. ‘Transformative’ Use Debate: A key aspect of fair use is whether the use is ‘transformative’. Meta argues its AI training is transformative. The professors counter that using copyrighted works to train AI is akin to educating human authors – a core purpose of the original works, thus not truly ‘transformative’. Commercial Intent and Competition: The brief highlights Meta’s for-profit nature and the potential for AI-generated content to directly compete with the original copyrighted works. This commercial aspect further weakens Meta’s fair use argument, according to the professors. Essentially, the professors are saying that if Meta’s argument succeeds, it could drastically erode copyright protections, paving the way for tech companies to freely utilize copyrighted works for commercial AI development without compensating creators. This has profound implications for all digital content creators, including those in the crypto art and NFT space. Llama AI and the Core of the Copyright Dispute Meta’s Llama AI models are at the center of this controversy. These large language models require vast amounts of data for training, and authors allege their copyrighted ebooks were part of this training data. The lawsuit claims Meta not only used these ebooks but also removed copyright management information (CMI) to conceal the alleged infringement. Judge Vince Chhabria’s decision to allow the case to proceed, despite dismissing part of it, is a victory for the authors. He acknowledged that copyright infringement is a ‘concrete injury’ and that the authors have sufficiently alleged Meta’s intentional removal of CMI. This ruling indicates that the court is taking the authors’ claims seriously and is willing to scrutinize Meta’s AI training practices under copyright law. Copyright Law in the Age of Artificial Intelligence: Navigating Uncharted Waters This case, alongside others like The New York Times v. OpenAI, underscores the urgent need to clarify Copyright Law in the age of AI. The existing legal frameworks, designed for a pre-AI world, are being tested by these new technologies. Key questions are emerging: What constitutes ‘fair use’ in AI training? Can tech companies freely use copyrighted material to train commercial AI models under the guise of fair use? Is AI-generated content a derivative work? If AI models are trained on copyrighted works, are the outputs they generate considered derivative works, thus infringing on the original copyrights? How should copyright be enforced in the AI era? Traditional copyright enforcement mechanisms may be inadequate to address the scale and nature of AI-driven copyright issues. The answers to these questions will have far-reaching consequences for innovation, creativity, and the balance of power between technology companies and content creators. The outcome of the Meta AI Lawsuit and similar cases will shape the future landscape of digital rights and responsibilities. The Concept of Fair Use : Is Meta Stretching its Boundaries? The legal doctrine of Fair Use allows for limited use of copyrighted material without permission for purposes like criticism, commentary, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. Meta argues its AI training falls under fair use, claiming it’s transformative and non-commercial in the context of model training itself. However, the professors and authors vehemently disagree. The professors’ brief argues persuasively that Meta’s use is not truly transformative because it serves a purpose similar to the original works – education and knowledge dissemination. Furthermore, they emphasize the commercial nature of Meta and the potential for AI-generated content to directly compete with the authors’ works in the marketplace. This commercial angle is a critical point of contention in the fair use debate. For the crypto community, understanding fair use in the AI context is vital. As blockchain technology increasingly intersects with AI, particularly in areas like decentralized AI and AI-driven content platforms, navigating copyright and fair use will become even more crucial. Actionable Insights and the Road Ahead The legal battles surrounding AI and copyright are just beginning. Here’s what you need to know and consider: Stay Informed: Follow cases like Kadrey v. Meta and The New York Times v. OpenAI. Their outcomes will set important precedents. Support Creators’ Rights: Advocate for fair compensation and recognition for content creators in the AI age. This is aligned with the ethos of digital ownership championed by the crypto community. Engage in the Debate: Participate in discussions about AI ethics, copyright, and the future of content creation. Your voice matters in shaping these evolving norms. Consider Legal Implications: If you are developing or using AI technologies, especially in a commercial context, be mindful of copyright laws and potential fair use limitations. Seek legal counsel to ensure compliance. The Meta AI Lawsuit is more than just a legal dispute; it’s a bellwether for the future of AI, copyright, and the rights of creators in the digital age. As AI continues to evolve and permeate various sectors, including the cryptocurrency world, understanding these legal and ethical dimensions is paramount.

Due to this reason, investors have shifted their focus towards projects that offer actual utility. Among these projects, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining a lot of attention. It is a decentralized finance protocol that is known for its growth potential and structure. Analysts predict that its price could go up to 1600% soon. Many, hence, say that it may be the most promising crypto in 2025. Currently, each token is priced at $0.025 during the 4th presale phase. This coin is still under the radar but it won’t stay there for a long time. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance provides a non-custodial and decentralized environment. Users in this ecocystem can lend and borror digital assets on-chain. The platform is supporting interest-earning deposits, and collateral based borrowing. It gives users access to liquidity while also making sure that they retain ownership of their coins. After depositing coins like USDT or Ethereum, users get mtTokens. These are a type of ERC-20 tokens that are equivalent to the deposit value. The tokens gradually provide yield to the users. And users can track these tokens in real time or use them with other DeFi platforms. As such, it gives users a lot of transparency and flexibility. Borrowers, in turn, can access funds by locking supported assets as collateral. Each asset comes with a Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio that helps manage the protocol’s stability while still offering borrowing power to users. The interest paid by borrowers flows back into the ecosystem, sustaining returns for liquidity providers. There are many reasons why Mutuum Finance is gaining attention. It is not just due to the early traction. But its token MUTM is also linked to the platform directly. It does not rely on speculation by the market. Instead, its value is actually dependent on usage and utility. Users borrow using the platform and allocate fees to purchasing MUTM from the market. The tokens get distributed to mtToken holders. This creates a cycle that allows consistent engagement and long-term holding. In other words, the system is directly linked to the value of the token. Hence, those who want to invest in projects offering utiltiy and growth may want to consider MUTM. As such, its not just another presale that makes empty promises. The project has actually laid a foundation for consistent long-term growth. Momentum around MUTM is building. The project has raised more than $6.45 million with 8000 current holders. Furthermore, the project is in the 4th presale phase and is expected to reach $0.03 after this stage. This means that the current window may be the last one before early investors will get priced out and broader market starts recognizing the coin. Looking ahead, analysts project the token could hit $0.40 or higher not long after it goes live. Based on today’s price of $0.025, that would mean a return of up to 16x. With a growing number of investors tracking the next crypto to hit $1, MUTM is increasingly being seen as a serious contender heading into 2025. A major reason for this confidence is Mutuum’s launch strategy. Unlike many presale tokens that offer no product for months post-listing, Mutuum is on track to debut its beta platform alongside the token release. This gives early supporters a clear advantage—they won’t just be holding a token, they’ll be using it in a live, functioning DeFi protocol from day one. In addition to its core lending and borrowing mechanics, Mutuum is building an overcollateralized stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. This stablecoin will be minted using assets locked in the protocol, helping expand Mutuum’s use cases and boost the total value locked (TVL) within the ecosystem. Combined with attractive APYs on deposits and flexible borrowing options, this makes MUTM appealing not just as a token, but as a platform for long-term crypto investment strategies. With a fixed token supply of 4 billion, a live product roadmap, and a clear incentive structure for users, MUTM is positioning itself as a strong choice for investors focused on real value. The project doesn’t promise overnight success — it focuses on functionality, sustainability, and organic growth. For those exploring new crypto coins before broader market rotation, Mutuum Finance is worth a closer look — especially at its current price.

The bill , spearheaded by Senate Democrats Sheldon Whitehouse and John Fetterman, is designed to tackle the environmental effects of increasing energy demand while shielding households from higher energy costs, according to Bloomberg. Key provisions of the Clean Cloud Act and industry reactions Named the Clean Cloud Act , the proposed legislation requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish an emissions performance standard for data centers and crypto mining facilities with more than 100 KW of installed IT nameplate power. The standard would be determined by regional grid emissions intensities, aiming for an 11% annual reduction in emissions. The bill also introduces penalties for surpassing the established limits, starting at $20 per ton of CO2e, with the fine increasing annually by inflation plus an additional $10. “Surging power demand from crypto miners and data centers is outpacing the growth of carbon-free electricity,” notes a minority blog post on the US Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works website. According to the post data centers, electricity usage will account for up to 12% of the US total power demand by 2028. The rapid growth of data centers is projected to generate approximately 2.5 billion metric tons of CO2 emissions globally by the end of the decade, according to research from Morgan Stanley. Matthew Sigel, VanEck’s head of research, argues that the proposed legislation targets Bitcoin miners and similar operations for their energy consumption in a “Losing ‘Blame the Server Racks’ Strategy,” as he stated in an April 11 post on X. Moreover, the law may conflict with US policy under President Donald Trump, who reversed a 2023 executive order from former President Joe Biden that set AI safety standards. Trump has also expressed his goal of making the US the “world capital” of both AI and cryptocurrency. Bitcoin miners pivot to AI data-center hosting The draft law comes as Bitcoin miners, including Galaxy, CoreScientific, and Terawulf, increasingly pivot toward supplying high-performance computing (HPC) power for AI models, VanEck said . Still, it has yet to be passed in the Senate. Bitcoin miners have struggled in 2025 as declining cryptocurrency prices weigh on business models already impacted by the Bitcoin network’s most recent halving. According to Coin Metrics, miners are “diversifying into AI data-center hosting as a way to expand revenue and repurpose existing infrastructure for high-performance computing.” According to Coin Metrics, miners’ incomes began to stabilize in the first quarter of 2025. However, the recovery could be cut short if ongoing trade wars disrupt miners’ business models. Nicholas Roberts-Huntley, CEO of Concrete & Glow Finance, noted that aggressive tariffs and retaliatory trade policies could create obstacles for node operators, validators, and other core participants in blockchain networks. He continued to say that the infrastructure supporting crypto, not just the assets, can become collateral damage in times of global uncertainty.

Coinbase made a notable case for the utility of XRP in global finance in its recent filing with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The document is part of Coinbase’s request to self-certify the listing of XRP futures contracts on its derivatives trading platform, with the launch scheduled for April 21. BREAKING: Coinbase Says #XRP Utility in ODL Makes It Attractive to Financial Institutions! pic.twitter.com/ZnX4jeAnUk — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) April 10, 2025 XRP’s Role in Financial Efficiency As part of its filing, Coinbase described XRP as a digital asset that serves a distinct purpose in streamlining international transactions. The exchange referenced the asset’s integration into Ripple’s enterprise-level payment systems. According to the filing, XRP’s use as a bridge currency within ODL enables real-time foreign exchange settlement, reducing transaction fees and processing times for cross-border remittances and corporate transfers. Experts believe XRP’s utility makes it a safe haven . Coinbase suggests that these advantages position the asset as a viable solution for financial institutions, payment processors, and remittance platforms looking to optimize settlement mechanisms. The company emphasized that these qualities have made XRP appealing to industry players seeking faster and more cost-effective alternatives to traditional banking rails. The statements suggest that Coinbase views XRP not just as a speculative instrument but as a utility-driven asset with meaningful applications in global finance. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Concerns Over Coinbase Terminology Prominent figures in the XRP community quickly responded to the details within Coinbase’s filing. WrathofKahneman (@WKahneman), a well-known community member, drew attention to the specifics of Coinbase’s language. Specifically, WrathofKahneman pointed out that Ripple had already moved away from branding its services under the “ODL” name as of 2023, having replaced it with what is now known as its Crypto Liquidity solution. While ODL is still commonly used, the filing’s continued reference to the term led some observers to speculate whether the exchange has direct insight into Ripple’s operations or if it relied on legacy information. The Future is Bright for XRP Despite the language, the filing itself is a step toward launching XRP futures trading on Coinbase’s derivatives arm, a development that many within the crypto sector see as a milestone. If approved, it would mark a significant return of XRP-related derivatives to U.S.-regulated platforms. Moreover, some within the community view this as a potential precursor to the eventual approval of XRP spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which would significantly expand investor access to the asset.

Bitcoin Dominance Rises To Major Rejection Zone,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/is-it-time-for-altcoin-season/,"Crypto analyst El Crypto has raised the possibility of an altcoin season happening soon. The analyst alluded to Bitcoin’s dominance rising to a major rejection zone, which could be bullish for altcoins. Altcoin Season May Be Imminent As Dominance Hits Major Rejection Zone In an X post, El Crypto suggested that the altcoin season may be imminent as Bitcoin’s dominance hits a major resistance zone. He revealed that BTC’s dominance again touched a zone that has led to rejection every time in the last one and a half years. He added that the Stochastic Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also in the overbought area, while a bearish cross has now happened again. Related Reading: Waiting For An Altcoin Season? Analyst Says A Weekly Close Above This Level Would Trigger A Rally Based on this, the analyst remarked that the market looks to be in for some fun, hinting at an altcoin season. Crypto analyst CryptoElites also affirmed that Bitcoin’s dominance has reached its peak. He further affirmed that next up is a massive altcoin rally, which will usher in the alt season. In another X post, the crypto analyst alluded to the USDT and USDC dominance ratio. He claimed that the market was at a critical trend reaction point right now. CryptoElites then mentioned that if the stablecoins’ dominance breaks down, then the altcoin season will officially begin. Crypto analyst Kevin Capital also looked to provide a bullish outlook towards the altcoin season. In an X post, he highlighted the global liquidity index overlaid with the Dogecoin price. In line with this, he remarked that it might be time for market participants to start paying attention to this. So far, altcoins have been mirroring Bitcoin’s price action, suffering a similar downtrend amid the trade war. However, if the altcoin season were to kick into full gear, these altcoins could easily decouple from the flagship crypto and outperform. Ethereum is known to lead this altcoin season, but that may not be the case this time, as ETH has underperformed throughout this cycle. Still Bitcoin Season For Now Blockchain Center data shows that it is still Bitcoin season for now, as the flagship crypto continues to outperform most altcoins. In the past 90 days, only seven out of the top 50 coins have outperformed the flagship crypto. These coins include Mantra, GateToken, Monero, LEO, Tron, and FastToken. Related Reading: Altcoin Season: Crypto Expert Reveals Why $425 Billion Is Important For it to be altcoin season, 75% of the top 50 coins would need to outperform Bitcoin over the last 90 days. Although almost all coins have witnessed declines within this timeframe, BTC has suffered a 22% drop, which is less than what these altcoins have seen during this period. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $80,900, down over 1% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

This initiative would allow crypto exchanges to experiment more freely in emerging sectors, including potentially offering tokenized securities. SEC mulls exemptions to let crypto exchanges tokenized securities Tokenized securities are blockchain-based versions of traditional financial instruments, such as stocks and bonds, issued as fungible digital assets. Ahead of the agency’s second-ever digital assets roundtable—this time centered on crypto trading—Republican commissioners proposed the idea of granting exemptions that could soon enable platforms like Coinbase to explore offering tokenized securities alongside their existing crypto offerings. “I encourage market participants that are developing new ways to trade securities using blockchain technology to provide input on where exemptive relief may be appropriate,” Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda said in a pre-recorded video statement. According to Uyeda, a “time-limited, conditional exemptive relief framework” could offer unregistered crypto exchanges the freedom to innovate in areas like tokenized securities before rules and laws are written on the subject. Commissioner Hester Peirce, who heads the SEC’s newly formed crypto task force, voiced support for the idea during live remarks at the agency’s Washington headquarters on Friday—advocating for the potential benefits of an exemptive relief framework tailored for crypto exchanges. She noted that participating firms could see what works and what doesn’t, technically and commercially. Peirce added such trials could inform the Commission’s rulemaking efforts. A couple of months ago, Peirce backed the idea of a “digital securities sandbox” that would have enabled U.S. crypto firms to collaborate with their British counterparts in testing new approaches to “the issuance, trading, and settlement of securities.” However, the proposal failed to gain traction with crypto-skeptical SEC Chair Gary Gensler at the helm. SEC faces pushback over sandbox proposal Other countries, including Colombia, have explored the concept of a crypto-focused regulatory sandbox. In the past, the United States has implemented similar frameworks to promote innovation in traditional finance sectors, such as loan underwriting. However, allowing crypto exchanges, which are not currently regulated by the SEC, to venture into trading tokenized stocks and bonds—if even temporarily—might not be without its risks. The SEC’s only remaining Democratic commissioner, Caroline Crenshaw, seemed to reference these concerns during her remarks on Friday. She noted that crypto exchanges pose unique risks because they already “perform multiple services under one roof,” whereas regulated securities exchanges spread those functions across separate entities to mitigate risk. Crenshaw warned that, beyond the impact on individual investors, these persistent risks could disrupt the orderly functioning of crypto markets and pose broader threats to the banking system and traditional financial infrastructure.

The decline began early on April 11 , with ETH losing momentum after testing resistance at around $1,637 . Despite brief midday stabilization, bearish pressure continued to dominate, dragging the price to a new short-term low. This move comes as the crypto market enters a period of uncertainty in Q2 , with major tokens facing headwinds from macroeconomic shifts and investor caution.

At its current presale price of $0.1573, early buyers are eyeing potential returns of up to 9,435% if $TICS hits $15. That’s why developers across South America—who’ve seen how legacy rails fail—are now aligning with Qubetics. It’s not hype. It’s momentum, with measurable progress. This isn’t just the best crypto for quick profit —it’s a movement. What Early Backers Could Gain From Qubetics: ROI Scenarios That Speak for Themselves The current presale price of Qubetics ($TICS) stands at $0.1573—and this stage won’t last forever. For those eyeing a position before the next stage increase, the math is both clear and compelling. With projected ROI percentages already mapped out up to a $15 valuation, even modest entries could lead to jaw-dropping returns. Here’s how different allocations would shape up if $TICS hits that future $15 milestone. A $100 entry today would secure approximately 635 $TICS, which could turn into $1,500 to $9,525, depending on the token’s future valuation. With $200, you’re looking at 1,270 $TICS, putting your future potential between $3,000 and $19,050. Polygon (MATIC) – Whale Moves and a $1B Ecosystem Revival Polygon might’ve flown under the radar in Q1, but the signals from Q4 2024 flipped the entire narrative. Within just 48 hours, whales stacked over 59 million MATIC tokens—a move that screamed long-term conviction. Why? Because Polygon isn’t just a sidechain anymore. With massive scaling solutions like zkEVM in play, the protocol’s becoming a serious contender for enterprise-grade dApps, especially in regions with high traffic but limited on-chain bandwidth. By the end of 2024, Polygon’s Total Value Locked (TVL) surged past $1 billion, indicating a real spike in utility and builder activity. Add the bullish breakout above the 200-day EMA, and Polygon is firmly back in conversation for high-impact use cases. While some coins are floating on sentiment, Polygon’s rise is backed by utility that appeals to devs and validators alike. That blend of tech depth and market traction makes MATIC a strong mention among the best crypto for quick profit this quarter. But here’s where it gets even better for the South American tech crowd: With gas fees optimized, cross-chain connectivity, and growing validator support, Polygon is now the smart builder’s pick for scalable deployment. It’s real, it’s live, and it’s earning traction in ways that can’t be ignored. Sonic (SONIC) – Layer-1 Just Got Lightning Fast In December 2024, Sonic Labs officially flipped the switch on its Layer-1 mainnet—and it hasn’t looked back since. Built from the ground up for high-speed, modular smart contracts, Sonic’s launch marked a new chapter for real-time Web3 applications. Just one month later, on January 7, 2025, the SONIC token officially debuted. But what turned heads wasn’t just the token—it was the tokenomics. 57% of SONIC’s total supply is now flowing straight to community-focused initiatives. That’s more than a statement—it’s a structural commitment to decentralization. In February 2025, BitMEX greenlit SONIC, making it tradable and accessible. And to scale secure distribution? Sonic Labs struck a strategic partnership with Sentio to deliver 190 million native tokens, streamlining staking and strengthening on-chain trust. With SONIC trading at $0.23 and rising by 14.09% today, it’s capturing attention fast. But what really makes Sonic one of the best crypto for quick profit candidates is the sheer agility of its ecosystem. It’s fast, open, and riding high on developer adoption. South American projects needing real-time settlements and low-latency deployments are finding Sonic’s new chain too good to pass up. Why These Three Are Dominating April’s Top Crypto Picks Polygon has scale and whale traction. Sonic has speed and fresh community energy. But Qubetics? It has the full picture. Real utility, developer tools, fiat integration, and a working asset tokenization platform—all wrapped inside a red-hot crypto presale. So, what’s the common thread here? Simplicity, speed, and sovereignty. That’s the trifecta modern blockchain adopters crave. These coins aren’t riding the hype train—they’re laying down real tech that supports real change. And with the market heating up across Latin America, from Salvadoran remittance corridors to Chilean DeFi hubs, these three cryptos are locked in as the best crypto for quick profit this April. Smart early buyers know timing matters. But so does tech. And right now, to join the best crypto presale before the next price stage kicks in? That’s not a gamble. That’s strategic entry.

Qubetics ($TICS), Polygon (MATIC), and Sonic (SONIC) are leading April 2025’s charts due to real-world use cases, presale momentum, and rapid blockchain innovation. Why is Qubetics considered a top pick for crypto gains? Because of its Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace, $16M+ raised, 24,600+ token holders, and ROI potential based on its current presale stage. What makes Sonic unique among new Layer-1 projects? Sonic’s modular Layer-1 mainnet, community-first tokenomics, and its 14% daily surge make it a serious contender for fast-deploying Web3 developers.

He flagged state-by-state regulation of crypto trading as a concern, warning it could lead to a “patchwork of state licensing regimes.” Uyeda said that a favorable federal regulatory framework would ease the burden for market participants wishing to offer tokenized securities and non-security crypto assets, allowing them to operate under a single SEC license instead of navigating “fifty different state licenses.” He urged crypto market participants to share feedback on areas where “exemptive relief” could be appropriate. Source: US Securities and Exchange Commission Uyeda also reiterated the benefits of blockchain technology in financial markets during the roundtable discussion. “Blockchain technology offers the potential to execute and clear securities transactions in ways that may be more efficient and reliable than current processes,” Uyeda said.

The report investigated whether former SEC official William Hinman had a conflict of interest when he said Ethereum was not a security. At the time, Hinman was still getting payments from his former law firm, which was linked to Ethereum. William Hinman in Ethereum-related decisions In May 2022, Empower Oversight asked the OIG to investigate Hinman’s financial relationship with his former law firm, Simpson Thacher, which represented Ethereum, a major cryptocurrency participant. In a speech in 2018, Hinman had stated that Ethereum was not a security. The answer was no. The key point was that he was still being paid by Simpson Thacher at the time. The report also noted that properly disclosed his monetary relationships, and did not personally enrich himself. However, Empower Oversight was not satisfied. They argued that the probe was too limited, as it sidestepped broader questions about how the SEC handles conflicts of interest in general and how it decides which crypto companies to target. “ By narrowly focusing on whether criminal charges should be brought against Hinman, the SEC OIG completely missed the bigger issue here—an erosion of public trust in the agency due to inadequate transparency and an undeniable lack of faith in the integrity of its cryptocurrency enforcement decisions, ” Foster said. The OIG’s December 9, 2024, report answered one very narrow question: had Hinman violated any criminal conflict-of-interest law? The response was no. He reported they had to struggle to publish fundamentals.

The data, which spans from late 2013 through 2025, highlights multiple instances in which XRP went through a protracted bear market before staging an explosive rally. Two particular examples stand out in Egrag’s assessment: the 2017 surge in which XRP rose over 2,700% from its pre-rally price levels, and the 2021 run-up that saw the asset climb by more than 1,000%. Egrag Predicts XRP Surge To $19–$45 The chart reveals a consistent framework that relies on the interplay between the 21-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the 33-week Simple Moving Average (MA). These moving averages are shown crossing during bearish cycles and then eventually curving upward, implying the formation of a bottom. Related Reading: 62.8% Of XRP Realized Cap Held By New Investors: Sign Of Fragility? Historically, XRP’s final bullish legs—often culminating in “blow-off tops”—began once the price retook the 21 EMA and the 33 MA, with the 777-day (and in one instance, 770-day) window before those bullish crosses recurring as a noteworthy time cycle. “Men lie, women lie, but charts don’t,” says Egrag. “I’m not improvising here; I’m relying on historical data to present future predictions. Will it rhyme exactly? No, because if it were that easy, everyone would be a multimillionaire!” According to the chart, XRP has already mirrored some of the patterns seen in 2017 and 2021, a parallel that leads Egrag to posit two potential price targets if the token completes another blow-off top scenario. While he acknowledges various complicating factors, the analyst believes XRP could rally as much as 2,700%—taking the asset to approximately $45—or, in a more moderate iteration, 1,050% to just below $20. “Now, here’s my measured move: if #XRP mimics either of these cycles, we could see price movements of 2,700% or 1,050%, putting XRP around $45 or $19!” he notes, referencing the previous explosive expansions. Egrag cites past cycles to support these targets, pointing to how XRP found support at the 21 EMA in 2017 just before launching into its last blow-off phase. In 2021, the coin rallied once it decisively broke above both the 21 EMA and 33 MA. Related Reading: XRP Primed for a Comeback as Key Technical Signal Hints at Explosive Move To underscore the method behind using both indicators, Egrag adds that “market makers use the same moving averages to see where support and resistance are and act against us. So I am using different moving averages—one is fast (exponential) and one is simple—to understand price action better.” He emphasizes these signals are lagging indicators but can still confirm whether market sentiment is shifting from bearish to bullish. Notably, Egrag’s personal long-standing target for XRP has been $27. He underlines that nothing is guaranteed, especially in a market characterized by what he calls “human reactions and behaviors.” Quoting a line from the film Margin Call, he explains, “You cannot control it, stop it, or slow it, or even slightly alter it…you have to just react. Make a lot of money if you get it right, or you’ll be left by the side of the road if you get it wrong.” Yet he notes that it is wise to strategize selling—or “DCA (Dollar-Sell-Average)—if circumstances call for it, to mitigate risk. At press time, XRP traded at $2.00.

On-chain data shows that Punk #3100 changed hands for 4,000 ETH, translating to approximately $6.07 million via a private transaction on the official CryptoPunks marketplace. The NFT is one of just nine Alien Punks in the original 10,000-piece CryptoPunks collection created by Larva Labs in 2017. Recognized for its distinctive blue skin and bandana, the Alien Punk is part of the most sought-after group in the NFT space. The $10M Loss Blockchain data from Arkham Intelligence shows that this particular NFT previously sold in March of last year for 4,500 ETH, then valued at more than $16 million. The sale ranks as the third most expensive single NFT transaction by dollar value. Just days after that transaction, Punk #7804 exchanged for 4,850 ETH worth roughly $16.42 million at the time, marking the second-largest deal in the collection’s history. However, due to Ethereum’s price drop over the past year, Thursday’s 4,000 ETH sale amounted to just over $6 million, resulting in the seller making a $10 million loss from the transaction. While the parties in the exchange remain unidentified, Etherscan records show that the purchasing wallet received 4,001 ETH from an account labeled “Coinbase Prime 2” shortly before the sale. Alien CryptoPunks continue to dominate the top end of the NFT market. They are the rarest type in the collection, even more than the 88 Zombie Punks or the 24 Ape Punks. The top seven of the highest-value on-chain CryptoPunk sales involve these variants. CryptoPunks Hit by Market Downturn Despite their status, CryptoPunks have not been immune to the broader downturn in the NFT market. Data from NFT Price Floor shows that their asking price has dropped nearly 43% in the last three months, currently sitting at $71,031. This figure marks a notable decline from the collection’s peak in November 2021, when the figure exceeded $400,000. Originally offered for free in 2017, the digital assets have evolved into cultural symbols of the early NFT era. In 2022, the intellectual property rights were acquired by Yuga Labs, creator of the Bored Ape Yacht Club. Earlier this year, speculation swirled about a possible sale of the product’s IP. However, Yuga Labs co-founder Greg Solano dismissed the rumors, stating that while many parties had approached the company, there were no plans to divest any time soon.

While XRP , Solana (SOL) , and Bitcoin (BTC) are strong contenders for consistent growth, those aiming for outsized results are looking toward MAGACOINFINANCE —the early-stage crypto that’s built for this kind of leap. Current Market Performance (BTC, SOL, XRP, MAGACOINFINANCE) Bitcoin (BTC) trades at $81,812 , Solana (SOL) at $182 , and XRP at $1.99 —all showing long-term strength.

XRP is rising on regulatory clarity and growing liquidity. Solana (SOL) dominates tokenized assets and is leading Web3 real-world use. All three are solid bets—but may not deliver 10,000% from current levels. Worth Watching Too: ADA, XLM, AVAX Cardano (ADA) at $0.68 is seeing quiet L1 activity pick up. Stellar (XLM) at $0.17 is regaining attention in global remittance use. Avalanche (AVAX) at $49.20 leads subnet expansion and gaming adoption. They’re solid—but MAGACOINFINANCE is built for the kind of return $100 investors dream about. Conclusion As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, both established and emerging digital assets present unique opportunities. While Bitcoin (BTC) , Ripple (XRP) , and Solana (SOL) pursue growth strategies, MAGACOINFINANCE distinguishes itself with its innovative approach and attractive pre-sale incentives.

Bitcoin Wallets With 10+ Tokens Have Seen Their Count Go Up Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has discussed about how the trend in the Supply Distribution has looked for the cryptocurrency’s key holders. The “Supply Distribution” here is an indicator that measures, among other things, the number of wallets that belong to a particular group. The investors or addresses are divided into these cohorts based on the number of tokens that they are holding in their balance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance: BTC’s MVRV Outpaces ETH’s For Record 812 Days The 1 to 10 coins group, for instance, includes all investors who own between 1 and 10 tokens. In the context of the current topic, the coin range of interest is the 10+ coins one (with the upper limit being infinity). At the current exchange rate, the cutoff for this range converts to around $821,000, so the only investors who would be able to qualify for it would be the large ones. Two key cohorts in particular fall in this range: the sharks and whales. The influence of any entity in the market goes up the more coins that they hold, so the sharks and whales with their sizeable holdings can occupy an important spot in the ecosystem. As such, the trends related to them can be worth keeping an eye on. The Supply Distribution allows for one such way to track these investors. Below is the chart for the indicator shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in its value over the last few months: As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin Supply Distribution for the 10+ coins range was following a slight overall downtrend during the last few weeks, but in the past day, the metric’s value has seen a turnaround. This suggests that the sharks and whales are now growing in number again. The reversal in the population of these large entities has come as US President Donald Trump has announced a 90-day pause on the tariffs for most countries. The tariffs had earlier unleashed FUD on the market, leading to a crash for BTC and other digital assets. With the news of the pause, however, the coins have shown a rebound. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breakout Above This Level Could Set Stage For $208,550 Top, Analyst Says During the jump, wallets with 10+ coins have gone up by 132, which is the largest jump since February 20th. The analytics firm notes that this indicates “a higher level of confidence from crypto’s key stakeholders.” It now remains to be seen whether the big-money investors would continue to buy into Bitcoin in the coming days or not. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $82,100, down around 1% in the last week.

Garlinghouse Eyes Long-Term Crypto Growth Claman pointed out that Bitcoin, which surged to a high of $107,000 after the election, has since dropped to around $86,000. She asked Garlinghouse about the market’s future and where he sees prices heading, especially amid wildly different predictions — from $250,000 per Bitcoin to much lower forecasts. Garlinghouse opened up about the importance of taking a long-term perspective. “I don’t think about it in short-term timeframes. I think about the macro trends in crypto and the XRP ecosystem,” he said. “XRP has been the best-performing major crypto over the last 90 days. We’re focused on where the industry will be in three years, not the next six months.” Ripple Makes Bold $1.25B Acquisition He also discussed Ripple’s recent $1.25 billion acquisition of Prime Broker Hidden Road — the largest in the company’s history and reportedly the biggest in the crypto industry to date. Garlinghouse said that such a move wouldn’t have been possible a year ago due to what he described as a “coordinated attack” on the industry by the U.S. government, including restrictive IRS rules and banking regulations that discouraged crypto adoption. Great interview by @LizClaman of @bgarlinghouse . Liz asks Brad, if he would’ve made the $1.25 billion acquisition of Prime Broker Hidden Road one year ago? Great question!

Mark Uyeda opens the event Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda presided over the session, joined by Commissioners Hester Peirce and Caroline Crenshaw. The conference was called “Between a Block and a Hard Place” and brought together the most important players from both the traditional and crypto finance world to achieve practical solutions for making blockchain technology a part of the current markets. Nicholas Losurdo serves as moderator The panel members were representative of a broad spectrum of institutions. Nicholas Losurdo, a partner at Goodwin Procter LLP, was the roundtable moderator. Gregory Tusar, Coinbase’s Vice President of Institutional Product, provided perspective from one of the largest US crypto exchanges. Tyler Gellasch emphasizes crypto broker registration Tyler Gellasch, President and CEO of Healthy Markets Association, made a strong point about crypto brokers registering with regulators so that there is transparency and improved oversight of the markets. He also made the point that brokers should know whom they are dealing with, instead of just encrypted information. Jon Herrick, New York Stock Exchange Chief Product Officer, discussed the effect of ETF approvals, indicating that they have simplified investor entry into digital assets through known and regulated pathways. He further noted that ETFs potentially enable traditional financial institutions to utilize digital assets in new ways, most notably as collateral. Dave Lauer supports transparency and fair markets Richard Johnson, founder and CEO of Texture Capital, and Dave Lauer, co-founder of Urvin Finance and We the Investors, both commented on how markets might evolve to facilitate tokenized assets. Katherine Minarik gives a DeFi legal view Chief Legal Officer of Uniswap Labs Katherine Minarik represented the DeFi industry and the ways decentralized platforms are structured differently than traditional exchanges. Christine Parlour, Finance and Accounting Chair at UC Berkeley, offered academic perspectives on structural changes required to enable regulation to be more effective. Chelsea Pizzola, Associate General Counsel at Cumberland DRW, and Austin Reid, FalconX Global Head of Revenue and Business, added their legal and institutional trading industry perspectives in the crypto sector. Hester Peirce reflects on learnings from the first roundtable Hester Peirce, a Commissioner of the SEC, said that she found the initial roundtable useful in informing her opinion on when crypto assets would be subject to securities laws. She hoped this roundtable would be as fruitful, pointing to the diversity of participants—from national securities exchanges and alternative trading systems to crypto-native companies. Richard Gabbert, the head of the Crypto Task Force, was supposed to emphasize the importance of investor-centric regulation. The conversation pointed out that existing federal regulations were not written with blockchain and decentralized finance in mind, resulting in mismatches between how crypto markets operate and how they are regulated. The roundtable also discussed the age-old problem of state-by-state licensing under which crypto exchanges such as Coinbase have to get licensed in all 50 states. Many in the industry are advocating for one SEC license with which they can operate nationwide, which would ease compliance and make operating less cumbersome. Panelists explained how current rules such as the order protection rule or prohibitions on listing unregistered securities cause issues when attempting to bring tokenized securities into traditional markets. They also recognized that crypto platforms tend to be different, having custody, clearing, and execution all on the same platform, as opposed to the distinct systems in traditional finance. In spite of these difficulties, there was a general optimism about the potential of blockchain to transform the way markets operate. From 24/7 trading through smart contracts to enhancing collateral management and settlement of transactions, the roundtable demonstrated that most industry leaders view blockchain as a means to make financial systems more efficient. The SEC is weighing whether to grant temporary exemptions to spur innovation while longer term rules are being formulated. In total, the roundtable emphasized that regulators and market participants must work together to develop a framework that benefits both innovation and investor protection.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-12 04:47:21

Lower Than You Think,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/bitcoin-maxi-takes-aim-ethereums-true-value-lower-than-you-think/,"Bitcoin maximalist Samson Mow has doubled up on his value criticism of Ethereum’s price, asserting ETH is still overvalued despite Bitcoin’s price almost quadrupling since 2022. The JAN3 CEO referred to the glaring disparity in performance between the two top cryptocurrencies over a near three-year span. Related Reading: XRP ETF Launch Impresses Even In Bear Market, Says Analyst Price Gap Grows As Bitcoin Rises According to data, Ethereum now sits at $1,558, essentially the same as its August 2022 price of $1,600. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has climbed from $21,500 to $82,302 – an eye-popping 270% rise. The widening gap has only served to bolster Mow’s contention that Ethereum’s price does not correlate with its fundamentals. Mow re-tweeted his August 23, 2022 post this week to emphasize his steadfast stance. His criticism focuses on supply variations between the cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has less than 21 million overall coins, while Ethereum boasts 122 million circulating tokens. #Ethereum is overvalued. 1 BTC = $21.5k 1 ETH = $1.6k 21M BTC supply (actually less) 122M ETH supply (72M premined) Adjusted for unit bias (ETH price at 21M units) one ETH would be $9.3k. So some people are paying $9.3k per unit of something that’s 60% printed from thin air. — Samson Mow (@Excellion) August 23, 2022 ‘60% Minted Out Of Thin Air’ Claim Targets Ethereum’s Origins Based on Mow’s quotations, about 72 million ETH tokens (approximately 60% of the supply) were premined at the time of Ethereum’s launch. Token creation before the start of public mining has been quite an issue for purists in cryptocurrency for some time. Possibly, the Bitcoin maximalist suggested that if 21 million coins were all there would be in supply for Ethereum like in Bitcoin, then each ETH would be valued today at around $9,300. Mow is again targeting investors in Ethereum, saying they are paying too much for an asset whose supply is exaggerated. Sensitive To Macroeconomic Forces Ethereum recently fell to a multi-year low of $1,380 on the back of global tariff trade war tensions. The cryptocurrency bounced back immediately to $1,680 on April 9 after US President Donald Trump declared a three-month tariff tariff hike pause on various countries, with China being the exception. These movements illustrate how both cryptocurrencies are still sensitive to macroeconomic forces even as they have different value propositions and market performances. Ether down in the last week. Source: Coingecko Related Reading: From Joke To Juggernaut: Dogecoin Value Revolution Gets Nod From Global Asset Giant Long-Standing Campaign Against Ethereum Continues This is not Mow’s first time criticizing Ethereum. He has been vocal against ETH for years. In November 2024, he cautioned investors that the fate of Ethereum could be the same as their favorite tokens. Mow, who forecasts Bitcoin to hit $1 million this year, has told investors to sell everything, including Ethereum, and invest in Bitcoin instead. The debate underscores deep-seated differences in cryptocurrency investment philosophies. While Bitcoin maximalists such as Mow focus on scarcity and Bitcoin’s “digital gold” status, Ethereum supporters highlight the platform’s smart contract abilities and wider applications ecosystem. As the price differential between the two leading cryptocurrencies continues to expand, these debates regarding relative value and suitable pricing models draw greater interest from investors and market analysts in common.

Sun’s X post came just hours after speculation grew over an April 11 Wall Street Journal report , which alleged that Zhao agreed to provide evidence on Sun as part of his plea deal, citing sources familiar with the matter.

The report added, “that arrangement hasn’t previously been reported.” Zhao hasn’t publicly addressed the reports at the time of publication, but the day before, he warned his 10 million X followers that he had been told a “baseless hit piece” about him was being written. Sun commended Zhao’s integrity and said that the DoJ is one of T3 Financial Crime Unit’s (T3 FCU) — which Tron co-founded along with Tether and TRM Labs — “closest and most trusted partners.” “To this day, his conduct and principles remain the highest standard I strive to follow as a founder,” Sun said of Zhao. Sun added: “Whether it’s CZ or our partners at the DOJ, we maintain direct, honest communication at all times.

CZ is both my mentor and a close friend—he has played a crucial role in supporting me during my entrepreneurial journey. To this day, his conduct and principles remain the highest standard I strive to follow as a founder. At the same… — H.E. Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) April 12, 2025 However, Justin Sun, in response, called the allegations “baseless” and publicly defended CZ, calling him both a mentor and a close friend. He stressed that Tron maintains honest and direct communication with the DOJ and praised President Trump’s crypto leadership , expressing confidence in the U.S. market. Binance Eyes U.S. Comeback The backdrop to this controversy is Binance’s renewed effort to rebuild its U.S. standing. The company’s leadership, including CEO Richard Teng, recently met with Treasury officials to push to reduce or eliminate the independent monitor currently overseeing its anti-money-laundering controls. That monitor was part of a $4.3 billion settlement following Binance’s 2023 guilty plea for allowing illicit financial activity on its platform. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Binance Lawsuit Paused 60 Days as SEC Focuses on New Crypto Task Force , Reports also suggest that Binance is aligning itself with Trump-linked ventures, specifically World Liberty Financial’s USD1 stablecoin , heavily backed by Justin Sun and the Trump family. A listing of the token on Binance could generate major profits while potentially opening the door for CZ’s pardon under a new administration. The Bigger Picture As U.S. crypto enforcement shifts under Trump-era changes, including the pause of DOJ monitorships, Binance appears to be positioning itself for a strategic return. CZ, despite serving a brief prison term, remains a central figure in the company’s vision for revival. While he denies ties to World Liberty Financial, insiders say CZ’s long-standing connections may play a key role in Binance’s next chapter. With power players like Justin Sun, the Trump family, and the DOJ interests all converging, CZ’s future and Binance’s U.S. comeback hangs in the balance. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In one such move, the ongoing legal battle between the U.S. SEC and Binance has been officially paused for another 60 days. This move comes after what both sides have described as “productive discussions,” with the focus now shifting to how the SEC’s newly established crypto task force could impact the outcome of the case and the broader digital asset industry. NEW: The @SECGov and @binance have jointly asked the court to pause the case against the exchange for another 60 days. According to a recent filing, they’ve had “productive” talks, partly tied to the Crypto Task Force’s work, and say a continued pause is in everyone’s best… pic.twitter.com/0vH5MiE8wr — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) April 11, 2025 A Long-Running Legal Dispute In an X post, Fox Journalist Eleanor Terrett shared that the SEC and Binance have jointly requested another 60-day pause. Both parties believe the pause serves everyone’s best interest, with the next update expected after the 60 days. The SEC filed a lawsuit against Binance in 2023 , accusing the crypto exchange and its then-CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), of operating as an unregistered clearing agency, broker, and exchange. Additional allegations included fund commingling and manipulation of trading volumes on Binance US. Since then, the case has seen several pauses to allow time for negotiation and regulatory discussions. Earlier this year, the SEC requested a 60-day pause to give room for conversations related to the crypto task force’s impact on how digital assets should be regulated under securities law. That pause was supposed to end on April 14, 2025, but both parties have now asked the court to extend it through mid-June. Focus Shifts to Crypto Task Force The SEC’s crypto task force is expected to play a key role in shaping future regulations for the industry. According to the SEC’s latest filing, discussions with Binance have revolved around how the task force’s findings may affect the case. There’s a growing hope that the task force could provide clearer guidelines on applying existing securities laws to crypto transactions. Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda has emphasized that the task force aims to strike a balance between fostering blockchain innovation and maintaining investor protection. He also hinted at the possibility of introducing conditional exemptions to support industry growth while still enforcing compliance. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Binance Founder Changpeng Zhao Denies DOJ Deal to Testify Against Justin Sun , What the Pause Means for Binance and the Industry However, this extended pause will be beneficial for Binance to look for possible settlement options and be in line with regulations.

Binance has acknowledged that the continued pause is in everyone’s best interest. While the pause may not be the end, it certainly sets the stage for major regulatory developments in the months ahead. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Recent statistics from the token’s official burn tracker revealed that almost 17 million coins were removed from the circulating supply in just a day. As a result, crypto traders and investors anticipate a highly bullish price trajectory for the token ahead, abiding by economic principles. Simultaneously, SHIB Knight, a renowned community member, has further asserted that a $0.000015 price target for the token looms right over the horizon. Shiba Inu Burn Rate Bursts 1000%, What’s Fueling The Surge? According to the latest data from Shibburn on X , the Shiba Inu burn rate has surged 984.58% in the past 24 hours. As per the data, 16.94 million coins have been removed from the total supply over the past day. Source: Shibburn site Following the abovementioned burn chronicle, the total number of coins burnt to date was evaluated as 410.74 trillion tokens. Further, the total circulating supply shredded down to 584.37 trillion SHIB tokens at the time of reporting. Notably, two separate wallet addresses were collectivelyggested that the responsible for boosting the Shiba Inu burn rate today. Shibburn’s data suwallet addresses “0xa9d1e08c7” and “0xa20833” burnt 10 million and 4.3 million SHIB tokens, respectively. Traders and investors view this saga as bullish news, given that supply reduction could prompt a price upswing even if the demand for the asset remains the same. SHIB Price Eyes $0.000015? At the time of reporting, SHIB coin’s price jumped over 3% and exchanged hands at $0.00001220. The meme coin pumped from a low of $0.00001183 over the past day. This price upswing mirrors a bullish impact fueled via the recent SHIB burn rate surge. Besides, the price upswing also falls in line with today’s broader market trend, signaling that a recovery-like trend is cooking. Bitcoin price regained a hold above $83K after slipping as low as $74K this week. Altcoins and meme coins have mainly mimicked this uptrend, with Shiba Inu recovering from a weekly low at the $0.000010 level. In response, broader market sentiments orbiting the meme coin are already optimistic. Moreover, community member SHIB Knight has posted on X amid this upswing, revealing that $0.00001570 is the short-term price target.

That wave turned retail traders into millionaires — but let’s face it, those days are gone. XRP’s current market cap, regulatory entanglements, and long-standing consolidation around the $0.20–$0.60 range make another 50x moonshot nearly impossible. So, where’s the next opportunity? WHY XRP’S BEST DAYS ARE BEHIND IT To 50x from today, XRP would need to hit a market cap larger than $1.9 trillion , eclipsing even Bitcoin’s all-time highs. With Ripple still fighting an uphill battle with the SEC and its ecosystem seeing more stagnation than innovation, the upside for XRP is limited. Institutional support may help it survive — but not send it soaring. Investors holding out for a $20 XRP are clinging to hope, not data. WHERE THE HYPE IS SHIFTING: MAGACOIN FINANCE PRESALE SELLING OUT – CLICK HERE TO SECURE A SPOT NOW While blue chips plateau, meme-fueled, community-driven coins like MAGACOIN FINANCE are proving there’s still 100x potential in this market — especially during presale phases. Though the exact figures remain under wraps, insiders confirm MAGACOIN FINANCE is approaching a huge mark in early funding. What’s more telling than capital raised is the ferocious buzz : growing Telegram communities, watchlists on CoinGecko, and whispers across crypto Twitter calling it “the next SHIBA with structure.” The most exciting part? Listings haven’t even begun. Presale phases are rapidly selling out, and when a token generates this level of heat pre-launch, it’s usually a sign of explosive demand to come. THE DIFFERENCE IS STRUCTURE + MOMENTUM JOIN OVER 12,500+ INVESTORS – SECURE YOUR SPOT NOW Coins like PEPE and FLOKI went viral without fundamentals — MAGACOIN FINANCE is following the same trajectory, but with a roadmap, stage-based tokenomics , and a polished community launch strategy. If it mirrors what SHIBA did — or even 30% of that — the upside is still wild with the current price of $0.0002908 . Especially when you’re entering before centralized exchange listings and mainstream media mentions. Crypto doesn’t hand out 2,900% ROI anymore on post-listing tokens. That kind of multiplication is reserved for ultra-early entries — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the few still offering that shot. With Q2 2025 expected to bring broader market bullishness and major meme coins already saturating retail attention, newer tokens with viral DNA are perfectly positioned to breakout. MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t trying to be the next XRP. It’s trying to be what XRP once was — the breakout no one saw coming until it was already too late. FINAL THOUGHTS: A MARKET LOOKING FOR THE “NEXT” GET 50% EXTRA TOKENS INSTANTLY — USE PROMO CODE: MAGA50X BEFORE IT EXPIRES XRP’s time has passed for exponential growth. It’s not that it’s dead — it’s just matured. The altcoin crowd is hunting for newer stories, cheaper entries with current price of $0.0002908 , and tokens with community-first narratives. That’s exactly what MAGACOIN FINANCE is delivering — and why it’s quickly climbing watchlists. If you missed SHIBA, PEPE, and FLOKI, this might be the cycle’s one last whisper of early alpha.

At the start of the week, stocks and crypto saw a sharp drop as new tariffs were looming. But as soon as Trump announced a 90-day pause on the tariffs on all countries except China, the markets swiftly rebounded. Bitcoin is now back to its $82,000 levels. While there were debates over whether Bitcoin acted like a safe-haven or was it just another risky asset, nevertheless, Bitcoin was more resilient than most assets. Heading into the weekend, according to market intelligence platform Santiment , these trending tokens are leading the charge as crypto discussions heat up. Starting with Ethereum, there are discussions going on comparing Ether’s performance to Bitcoin and other crypto currencies. However, users have also expressed criticism over its long-term viability due to its declining market dominance and competition from other tokens. Ethereum is currently trading at $1,568 down over 13% in the past week. ONDO: Ondo has recently been listed on Binance, one of the top crypto exchanges globally by volume, which has triggered excitement in the community after ONDO was chosen for trading though a community vote. Many investors are optimistic over ONDO’s potential as its trading is all set to begin on April 11, 2025. Next up is Solana which is trending as traders focus on its price moves and strategies. SOL is one of the top altcoins which is gaining momentum which is also increasing its visibility and relevance. Analyst suggests that SOL is testing a key breakout level and could reach $200 if it holds. Besides, there is growing speculations around SOL ETF approval. Bloomberg’s James Seyffart confirmed that the final deadline is October 10 but said there’s some chance that the SEC may act sooner. However, approval by that date is strongly expected. Next up is the flagship crypto Bitcoin which is seen as a resilient asset when compared to others. When China revealed a tariff rate of 125% on US goods in response to Trump’s 145% levy, then Gold, which is often perceived as a safe haven shooted up while Bitcoin held its ground and did not panic like stocks. There are trending discussions going on about investments, trading strategies and market predictions. Several investment strategies are circulation like dollar-cost averaging and how crucial it is to hold onto Bitcoin as a safety net against market volatility. Users are also confident of Bitcoin’s potential growth contrasting it with other crypto currencies like Ether. Analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted that Bitcoin is breaking above a key resistance level at $82,360. If it could continue rising, then the next target could be $91,500. ORCA : This altcoin is trending as it has showed a notable price increase. It also features in the list of daily gainers which gets a lot of attention from crypto traders. XCN: Onyxcoin is trending as it is frequently mentioned in crypto investment decisions and predictions. Experts are bullish over the token expecting significant price increases.

Recall that the token dumped to $0.407 (on CoinGecko) on April 5, which became an all-time low . However, it bounced off almost immediately and soared past $0.75 just a day later. It has failed to maintain its run and was taken south once again during the massive volatility induced by Trump’s Trade War during the trading week. Nevertheless, it has emerged as one of the two top performers on a daily scale now, trailing only BONK. PI is up by over 15% and now trades close to $0.7 once again. Consequently, its market cap has risen to $4.7 billion on CoinGecko, which places it in 31st place in terms of largest assets. Still, PI was once close to breaking within the top $10 alts, when its price stood close to $3. While today’s performance is quite bullish, there are certain warning signs about its short-term moves. The number of tokens to be unlocked in the next few days is quite high, reaching up to 10 million on April 18. Such large number of coins getting unlocked at the same time could lead to increased selling pressure and further downside.

On the other hand, the DOGE whale accumulation could provide an additional boost for the rally ahead. Dogecoin Price Analysis: Bullish Breakout Potential Emerges After facing a steep correction of over 70%, Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing signs of a potential breakout. The cryptocurrency is currently forming a tight falling wedge pattern, a classic technical setup often considered bullish. Adding to the optimism, the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates a bullish divergence, suggesting the downward momentum could be waning. Source: TradingView Traders are closely watching for a breakout above the wedge’s trendline, which could signal a shift in market sentiment. If confirmed, such a breakout might pave the way for renewed upside momentum with next immediate targets of $0.35 and $0.50. After facing strong selloff earlier this week, Dogecoin price has reclaimed the crucial $0.16 support level hinting that the bottom is already in for the meme coin. Analysts are hoping for a massive rally to $5 as the whale accumulation surges. Prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez reported that the DOGE whales have purchased approximately 1.83 billion DOGE, valued at around $640.5 million, over a two-day period. This surge in whale activity suggests a potential bullish outlook for the meme-based cryptocurrency. Source: Santiment Martinez highlighted that while retail investors have been focusing on newer meme tokens, whales have been quietly increasing their DOGE holdings. Such a massive accumulation could set the stage for notable price movements going ahead. Key Catalysts for DOGE Ahead Dogecoin price has been subject to global macro developments and the escalating Trump tariff war over the past few months. However, the markets have started to look beyond it as Bitcoin price is showing strength while consolidating around $82,000 levels. Furthermore, as per the Coinglass data, the DOGE futures open interest is up 5.62% at $1.50 billion. This shows that traders are turning bullish for the asset class moving ahead. On April 9, 2025, 21Shares unveiled a strategic partnership with the House of Doge to introduce the Dogecoin Exchange-Traded Product (ETP), trading under the ticker DOGE. Duncan Moir, President of 21Shares, emphasized the significance of the collaboration, stating, “The Dogecoin ETP offers investors the most direct and accessible way to engage with the Dogecoin ecosystem.” The post Dogecoin Price Gearing for A 3X Rally Amid DOGE Whale Accumulation appeared first on CoinGape .",24/7 Cryptocurrency News|Altcoin News|Dogecoin (DOGE)|dogecoin etf|dogecoin price,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-04-12 06:04:49

This Underrated DeFi Project Just Crossed 8K Holders,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/this-underrated-defi-project-just-crossed-8k-holders/,"The post Next Crypto to Explode in 2025? This Underrated DeFi Project Just Crossed 8K Holders appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In a market often dominated by overhyped tokens and recycled narratives, it’s rare to see a DeFi project steadily grow its community before launch—without media noise or influencer-driven price spikes. Yet, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is doing exactly that. The protocol just surpassed 8,100 on-chain holders, a milestone that signals quiet but strong interest from long-term participants. With its presale moving rapidly and price locked at $0.025, many investors are starting to look at MUTM as a serious contender for 2025’s next crypto to explode. What makes this especially interesting isn’t just the holder count—it’s the timing. Mutuum is preparing for several major steps, including the launch of its beta platform and a full smart contract audit by CertiK, one of the most recognized names in blockchain security. This combination of adoption and accountability is turning heads. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol built to address one of the most practical needs in crypto: efficient, non-custodial access to capital. Rather than using a closed or overly complex system, Mutuum allows users to deposit assets into smart contracts and earn passive income through interest-bearing mtTokens. These mtTokens are more than just placeholders—they reflect real-time yield. As others borrow from the protocol, interest is automatically accrued to the mtTokens without users needing to stake, lock, or manage anything manually. It’s passive income designed for simplicity and scale, giving users full control of their funds at all times. Borrowers, meanwhile, use overcollateralized positions to access liquidity without having to sell their assets. It’s a model that fits well into the habits of both retail and whale investors, especially in bullish markets where holding core assets like ETH or stablecoins can lead to stronger long-term gains. The early interest in Mutuum is backed by real numbers. The project has raised over $6.5 million so far during its presale, with participation from a mix of DeFi veterans and newer investors who recognize value early. While other tokens chase listing announcements before building anything, Mutuum has focused on fundamentals. Crossing the 8K holder mark during presale alone is a major signal. It shows that investors aren’t just buying in—they’re holding on. This kind of retention is often seen in tokens with long-term appeal, not quick-flip narratives. The price is expected to move up to $0.03 in the next phase, and the public launch is confirmed at $0.06, which already gives today’s buyers a 2.4x upside. But for many, it’s not just about the price—it’s about what comes next. One of the most critical elements for any DeFi protocol is smart contract security, and Mutuum is taking it seriously. The team has officially announced an upcoming audit by CertiK, a trusted name that has reviewed some of the largest projects in the crypto space. This audit will ensure that the protocol’s smart contracts meet strict safety standards, further reinforcing investor trust before the token launches on exchanges. Security is a growing concern in DeFi, and the inclusion of CertiK at this stage adds credibility—not just to the codebase but to the project’s long-term commitment to doing things right. MUTM isn’t just a governance token or a speculative asset—it’s a part of the protocol’s economic engine. A portion of Mutuum’s platform revenue is set aside to buy MUTM tokens on the open market, which are then redistributed to users who hold mtTokens. This means that long-term contributors aren’t just earning interest—they’re also receiving added value through recurring token distributions tied to real platform activity. This model connects demand for the token with the actual use of the protocol. It’s not driven by hype, but by engagement—and that’s exactly the kind of structure long-term investors tend to look for. Mutuum Finance is still early, and it’s priced like it. But unlike many presale tokens that struggle to justify their valuations, MUTM has already proven it has a real foundation: utility, a working model, community growth, and third-party validation through its upcoming CertiK audit. For those asking what’s next in DeFi—and which project might quietly lead the next wave—Mutuum is worth serious attention. It’s an underrated protocol with momentum, a clear vision, and now, over 8,000 holders who seem to agree. Whether you’re looking for smart passive yield, exposure to early-stage DeFi, or just the best crypto coin to buy before 2025 heats up, MUTM may be one of the best options on the table right now.

ChatGPT Breaks Down Ripple’s Road to a New Bull Run,https://cryptopotato.com/can-xrp-explode-again-chatgpt-breaks-down-ripples-road-to-a-new-bull-run/,"TL;DR Despite its substantial price surge in the past several months, XRP failed to break its 2018 all-time high but came agonizingly close. It has retraced substantially since then, alongside the rest of the market, but ChatGPT believes there are certain factors that could restart its bull run. What Happened With XRP? CryptoPotato reported recently that everything seemed to be going in Ripple’s way ever since the US elections in November last year. Trump’s victory meant an upcoming regulatory change, which was particularly important for the company due to its long-standing legal fight against the local securities watchdog. That lawsuit has effectively ended now, just a few months after Trump’s promised changes came into effect. XRP was name-dropped by the same POTUS to be potentially included in the country’s strategic crypto reserve. There are multiple companies that had filed to launch their own exchange-traded funds tracking XRP’s performance. More recently, another massive development was announced as the company bought a large prime broker for $1.25 billion, which is set to be a game-changer for Ripple and its cross-border token. Yet, XRP’s biggest gains came in the months leading to the actual changes, lawsuit closure, and big purchases, which brought speculations on whether that run was just another classic ‘sell-the-news’ event. The asset peaked in January this year at $3.4, thus matching its record from seven years ago. Since then, it has been mostly downhill, and XRP even slipped below the coveted $2 support on several occasions. Can the Bull Run Start Over? While analysts have their own view on what can restart XRP’s bull run, we decided to ask ChatGPT for its own take. The AI chatbot outlined the aforementioned Ripple ETFs that have to be approved to impact the asset’s price because they can ‘open the gates to institutional flow, like we saw with Bitcoin.’ Second, ChatGPT listed the dire market conditions as of late. An improvement on that front could propel another price surge for XRP, which outperformed most crypto assets during the November-January run. The AI machine sees utility growth and adoption for Ripple’s cross-border payment systems, as well as major partnerships, as the next potential reasons that could lead to an XRP price pump. Whale activity is also important for the price movements of a crypto asset, and ChatGPT noted that many such market participants have disappeared from the XRP landscape as of late. If they return with massive purchases as they did after the elections, the asset could go parabolic once again. Lastly, the chatbot mentioned that XRP needs to break out of the crucial resistance levels at $2.5 and $3 to aim for a new all-time high. “A clean breakout from these resistance zones, with volume, could trigger momentum traders and algorithms,” ChatGPT concluded.

The crypto platform will likely reset revenue targets after a period of inflated crypto valuations while now focusing on a more stable subscription revenue. Coinbase remains highly profitable with a $9.3 billion cash balance. Investors should consider building a position during this weakness while anticipating some downside potential due to lowered expectations. Along with the market slump, Coinbase Global, Inc. ( COIN ) has fallen back to yearly lows. Unfortunately, cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, weren't similarly wiped out providing a far clearer path upwards. My investment thesis is more Bullish on the stock after the froth is gone with a potential double bottom around $160, but the company likely comes out with weak Q2'25 targets. Source: Finviz Resetting Revenue Targets At the recent highs, Coinbase was a tough buy due to the stretched valuation combined with elevated crypto valuations. In essence, the stock was priced for perfection and the company faced the recent scenario where the underlying crypto assets slipped, leading to a reduction in expected revenues. Though, so far, Bitcoin hasn't fallen dramatically, only slipping to $80K. The cryptocurrency is still above the $60K levels from last year, while falling from recent highs around $100K. Source: Coinbase With the hype burned out of the crypto market, Coinbase can build on a more normal transaction base starting in Q2. After all, the big revenue ramp in 2024 only got the business back to the 2022 peak levels of $2.3+ billion in quarterly revenues when Bitcoin originally reached $50K. Data by YCharts The main cryptocurrency doubled and Coinbase didn't even reach the prior peak revenue levels. The company has even made progress to diversify away from Bitcoin trading revenues, with Subscription and Services revenues slowly growing to $641 million in Q4. With Bitcoin surging from $60K at the start of October in Q4 to $100K by mid-December, the business was in an ideal transaction environment during Q4'24. Coinbase saw transaction revenues soar 88% QoQ to $1.35 billion in a jump that likely isn't repeatable for the rest of 2025. Source: Coinbase Q4'24 shareholder letter Coinbase would appear to face some lower transaction revenues during Q1'25, leading to a possible collapse in transactions during Q2. The company only saw Q2/Q3 transaction revenues around $650 million last year, some $900 million lower than the spike in Q4. As back in 2022 and 2023, Coinbase saw both the assets under management and transaction volume slump when crypto prices fell. As an example, transaction values slipped from $1,650 billion in 2021 to only $468 billion by 2023. Coinbase produced $2.2 billion in Q4 revenues and the current estimates are for quarterly revenue only dipping to ~$1.95 billion over the next few quarters. Back in 2022, the business plunged more than 50% to a low of only $0.6 billion. Data by YCharts When reporting Q4 results, Coinbase discussed Q1'25 transaction revenue of $750 million through February 11. The company was on pace for another quarter of $1.5 billion in transaction revenues, but Bitcoin fell from $95K to below $80K to start April. The analyst estimates appear far too high for the reality of the crypto market, where transaction revenues are volatile. Revenues tend to spike like in Q1'24 and Q4'24 followed by much weaker quarters where both transaction volumes and values plunge. Investors have to expect a weak outlook for Q2 after this volatile tariff policy likely leads to people pulling back on trading. More Stock Appeal The stock is far more appealing here, with the market cap back down to $42 billion. Coinbase ran to the prior peak of nearly $350 and the stock is suddenly down over 50% on the anticipation of weaker revenues. Coinbase remains highly profitable with the consensus estimates predicting a $7+ EPS for the next few years, leading to a P/E multiple of ~23x. The risk is that these numbers need to be cut, but ultimately the stock is at an attractive valuation based on the crypto market growing over time to justify a premium valuation. The crypto platform only has transaction expenses at 14% of net revenue, making the business highly profitable. Coinbase is spending about $550 million in adjusted operating expenses on a quarterly basis, to the point where Subscription and Services revenues targeted at $725 million for Q1'25 nearly cover most operating expenses. The company has a massive cash balance of $9.3 billion due to generating net income of $2.6 billion last year. The crypto business is printing money regardless of the volatility. Coinbase just needs to adjust revenue expectations for the reset to be complete. The company will report Q1 results and reset expectations for Q2 in a few weeks, providing an opportunity to use the double bottom here around $160 as an initial entry point with some capital held back for even lower prices and a cut in revenue expectations. A standard method is to invest up to 50% of a full position now, with 50% held back for potentially lower prices. Takeaway The key investor takeaway is that Coinbase Global is far more interesting here, with the stock trading at the yearly lows and some of the excess in cryptocurrencies ringed from the market. Investors should use the weakness to start building a position, knowing some potential downside exists on a lowering of revenue expectations for the next quarter.",COIN,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-04-12 06:52:10

The recent roundtable conference hosted by the SEC’s Crypto Task Force has shed light on the agency’s potential regulatory shift, with a vision for the US to lead in innovation and technology. Providing more insights into the US SEC’s potential crypto regulations, Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett shared an X post. Let’s unveil the key details shared by Terrett and the SEC’s possible moves ahead. US SEC Shifts Gears: Latest Updates on Crypto Regulations In a significant development, the US SEC’s Crypto Task Force conducted a roundtable conference focusing on crypto-friendly regulations. The regulator envisions building a comprehensive framework that could bolster the growth of blockchain technology. Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett, in her recent X post, commented on Acting SEC Chair Mark Udeya’s hint at the Commission’s potential decisions. According to Udeya, the SEC is gearing up to introduce a “sandbox” crypto regulation for tokenized securities. Terrett noted that the sandbox approach could be implemented for both registered and unregistered firms that offer tokenized securities. Significantly, this development comes on the heels of the SEC and Binance’s joint decision to pause the ongoing legal case. What is Sandbox Regulation? In a separate thread, Eleanor Terrett demystified sandbox crypto regulation, clarifying the community’s doubts. “A regulatory sandbox is when regulators allow market participants to operate outside existing laws in order to be able to experiment with new technology without the threat of being sued,” stated Terrett. Notably, this temporary arrangement gives regulators time to develop tailored guidelines or regulations for the emerging technology. Unlike the previous administration’s approach of suing companies for non-compliance, a sandbox fosters innovation while providing a framework for future oversight. US SEC’s New Crypto Regulations Foster Blockchain Growth As highlighted by Mark Udeya, the US SEC is putting effort into introducing new crypto regulations, focusing on innovation. He cited, “A time-limited, conditional exemptive relief framework for registrants and non-registrants could allow for greater innovation with blockchain technology within the United States in the near term.” Furthermore, Udeya posited that the SEC is working towards a long-term solution to ease the community’s burden. He added that the new crypto regulations could provide a relief, especially to the market participants offering tokenized securities and non-security crypto assets. Recently, the US SEC released disclosure guidance for crypto assets that are deemed securities. The Division of Corporation Finance has issued guidance for issuers. They emphasized the importance of clear and transparent disclosures in key areas. This includes business descriptions, risk factors, and financial statements.

The Cardano founder has predicted that the price of the alpha crypto could hit $250,000 by the end of this year due to Big Tech entering the crypto arena and regulatory progress. Bitcoin to Explode to $250,000 by Year-End In a recent interview with CNBC , Charles Hoskinson stated that Bitcoin, currently priced at $82,705, could be primed for a dramatic surge as early as this year, with technology behemoths like Microsoft and Apple moving into crypto. The world’s largest crypto has endured increased volatility in recent weeks, spurred by President Donald Trump’s aggressive trade policies, which have heightened inflation concerns and limited appetite for risk assets among investors. After slumping below $75,000 earlier this week, Bitcoin rebounded on Wednesday after Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs of at least 10% on all U.S. imports. BTC, which has gained 1.3% in the past day, has fared better than the broader crypto market, which saw its market capitalization plunge 0.8% since yesterday, according to CoinGecko data. Hoskinson doesn’t expect these tariffs to escalate into a prolonged global trade war with widespread negative consequences. “What will happen is that the tariff stuff will be a dud, and that people will realize that the world is willing to negotiate, and it’s really just US versus China,” he said. The Ethereum co-founder believes Bitcoin could rise to $250,000 “by the end of this year or next year” as tariff concerns ease off. Hoskinson forecasts that the global economy will adjust to a ‘new normal,’ after which the U.S. Federal Reserve will likely slash interest rates, thus making capital cheaper. That implies that more “fast, cheap money” could pour into crypto. Macroeconomic Factors Underpinning Bitcoin Price Hoskinson also predicted that upcoming U.S. legislation, including a stablecoin bill and the Digital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act, would be a boon for the crypto industry. These bills, currently progressing through Congress, seek to establish a clear regulatory framework for digital assets. Stablecoins could enjoy widespread adoption by the “Magnificent 7” tech giants, such as Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon (AMZN), Hoskinson added. The ADA creator further pointed to steady adoption of crypto assets and geopolitical shifts as other factors that could propel Bitcoin prices. As a result, Hoskinson expects a temporary lull in the market “for probably the next three to five months,” followed by a significant surge of speculative interest around August or September. “That’ll carry through probably another six to 12 months,” he postulated.",Bitcoin|News|ADA|Bitcoin News|Cardano,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-12 06:56:23

Not Likely, But This $0.007 Token Could Go to $5",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/04/can-shiba-inu-shib-reach-1-if-bitcoin-btc-hits-500000-not-likely-but-this-0007-token-could-go-to-5,"Speculation abounds regarding Shiba Inu's (SHIB) potential to hit $1 if Bitcoin skyrockets to $500,000—yet most analysts deem this improbable due to SHIB’s astronomical token supply. Instead, investor focus is shifting toward nascent, more scalable tokens like Lightchain AI . Priced at a mere $0.007, Lightchain AI has already amassed $18.7 million in its presale, luring capital from those prioritizing tangible utility and sustainable growth. By integrating blockchain with artificial intelligence, the project endeavors to construct a transparent, decentralized ecosystem underpinned by robust tokenomics and governance. While SHIB's $1 aspiration remains a distant improbability, Lightchain AI’s trajectory toward $5 appears considerably more plausible. SHIB Hitting $1 Remains Unrealistic Despite BTC Growth ​As Bitcoin is rapidly picking up the pace, the chance that Shiba Inu (SHIB) should appear at a $1 price is utterly unlikely due to the fact that today this virtual currency has a huge outsized supply of about 589 trillion coins. To get to the point of $1, the market capitalization would need to be around $589 trillion which is an amount that is greater than the total financial assets in the world combined. Thus even if they use a burn-strategy to dramatically reduce the currency in circulation, the sheer scope of the task makes it nearly impossible; at the current rate of burn, we need to wait for more than 40000 years to disappear enough tokens that the $1 target comes close to reality. Therefore, SHIB can be expected to undergo price variations and could possibly advance but it would be farfetched to think that it will reach $1.​ Lightchain AI at $0.007 Could Be Your $5 Crypto Jackpot Lightchain AI , currently priced at $0.007, presents a unique opportunity for early investors aiming for long-term gains. What sets it apart is its strong governance model—on-chain voting empowers token holders to shape the platform’s evolution directly. All proposals are transparently recorded on the blockchain, ensuring accountability and community trust. Developer accessibility is also a core strength: with APIs, SDKs, and a dedicated sandbox environment, developers can easily build, test, and deploy decentralized AI applications. This combination of governance integration, open development tools, and a fair token price makes Lightchain AI a hidden gem with serious upside potential. As utility becomes the new driver in crypto, LCAI stands ready to turn early bets into major wins. Grab Lightchain AI Tokens for Your Next AI Project! Decentralized and democratized artificial intelligence is on the rise, and Lightchain AI is at the forefront of this movement. With its unique combination of governance integration, open development tools, and fair token pricing, LCAI offers a promising platform for companies and developers looking to incorporate AI into their projects. If you're interested in leveraging LCAI's technologies and benefits, now is the time to grab some tokens. As utility becomes a key factor in the crypto market, early investments in LCAI could lead to major returns in the future.

Swissblock says on the social media platform X that Bitcoin’s momentum to the upside is not yet a sign of a convincing breakout. “Don’t let your guard down yet! The 90-day trade war extension eases tensions, but we’re not out of the woods. Bitcoin breaks $78,000-$79,000, now holding above $80,000. Are we in the clear?” Swissblock says the Bitcoin Risk Signal – which uses several indicators, including price data, on-chain data and a selection of other trading metrics to gauge whether BTC is at risk of a major drawdown – is not yet indicating a market bottom has been reached. “Market risk must ease for a true bottom. It’s under control but still elevated, not in a low-risk regime yet. We need to see a clear decline in risk.” Source: Swissblock/X According to Swissblock, Bitcoin remains in a downtrend. “For the bottom to progress, market trend must signal formation. We’re in a downtrend phase, normal in bottoming cycles: bottom-downtrend-uncharted. The bottom is close, but not confirmed.” Source: Swissblock/X Swissblock says that for Bitcoin to confirm a bullish reversal, the flagship crypto asset needs to hold $80,000 as support. “Bitcoin must hold $80,000 and consolidate to break the downward compression.

This can be showcased by the fact that , according to CoinGecko data, the price of DOGE has dropped by 14 % in the past week to hit $0.157 at the time of writing. As a result, renowned market analyst, Ali Martinez, believes that Dogecoin is in a dilemma, with $0.16 being a critical zone. Martinez pointed out , “Dogecoin is at a make-or-break level. If $0.16 holds, a rally to $0.57 could follow. If it fails, a drop to $0.06 becomes likely.” Source: Ali Martinez Since Dogecoin finds itself on a tightrope, the apex meme coin will need to dust itself off and reclaim $0.16 to rekindle the bullish fire. Is all Hope Lost? As Dogecoin traverses bearish territory, all hope is not lost for the meme coin OG. This is founded on the formation of an inverse head and shoulder pattern, which could signal DOGE’s bottom.

43241588,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148932,1744441575,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Update: SEC & Binance File Joint Motion to Extend Litigation Pause – Hopeful Sign for Crypto?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-binance-litigation-pause-extended/,"In a potentially hopeful turn of events for the cryptocurrency industry, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Binance have once again jointly requested a 60-day suspension of their ongoing litigation. This marks the second such request, hinting at potentially positive developments behind the scenes. Are we witnessing a breakthrough in the complex landscape of crypto regulation ? Let’s dive into the details of this crucial development. Why Another Litigation Pause? Exploring the SEC & Binance Joint Motion According to Eleanor Terrett, host of ‘Crypto In America’ on X (formerly Twitter), both the SEC and Binance have indicated that they are engaged in ‘productive discussions’. These discussions reportedly revolve around the activities of the SEC’s Cryptocurrency Task Force . The core argument for this second pause mirrors the first – allowing space for these discussions to progress without the immediate pressure of active litigation. This joint motion for a litigation pause signals a potential shift from adversarial courtroom battles to a more conciliatory approach. But what does this mean for Binance, the SEC, and the broader crypto market? Key Highlights of the Joint Motion: Productive Discussions: Both parties cite ongoing ‘productive discussions’ related to the SEC’s Cryptocurrency Task Force. Mutual Benefit: The motion emphasizes that a delay is in ‘everyone’s best interests’, suggesting a shared goal in finding a resolution. Second 60-Day Pause: This is the second time both parties have jointly requested a 60-day suspension, indicating sustained dialogue. Precedent Set: The court previously approved a similar 60-day suspension in February, suggesting a willingness to accommodate these pauses. Binance Litigation : A Step Back from the Battlefield? The initial Binance litigation , initiated by the SEC, has been a significant point of concern within the crypto community. The SEC’s lawsuit against Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) in June 2023 included a range of serious allegations, including operating unregistered exchanges, broker-dealers, and clearing agencies. A prolonged and contentious legal battle is typically costly, time-consuming, and can create significant uncertainty. This joint motion to pause litigation could be interpreted as both parties acknowledging the potential drawbacks of protracted legal proceedings and exploring avenues for a more negotiated settlement. Potential Benefits of a Litigation Pause: Reduced Legal Costs: Pausing litigation can help curb the escalating legal expenses for both the SEC and Binance. Focused Discussions: It allows both parties to dedicate resources and attention to productive dialogue rather than courtroom preparations. Market Stability: A move towards resolution, even if incremental, can inject a degree of stability into the cryptocurrency market, which often reacts negatively to regulatory uncertainty. Potential for Settlement: These discussions could pave the way for a potential settlement, avoiding a lengthy and unpredictable court battle. The SEC’s Cryptocurrency Task Force : What’s on the Table? The mention of the SEC’s Cryptocurrency Task Force is particularly noteworthy. This task force is responsible for coordinating efforts to identify and address securities law violations within the cryptocurrency and digital asset space. The ‘productive discussions’ likely involve Binance addressing concerns raised by the task force, potentially related to compliance, operational practices, and investor protection. What specific activities are under discussion? While details remain scarce, we can speculate on potential areas: Regulatory Clarity: Discussions might be aimed at clarifying regulatory expectations and establishing a clearer framework for crypto exchanges operating in the U.S. Compliance Frameworks: Binance may be working with the SEC to enhance its compliance frameworks to align with U.S. regulations. Investor Protection Measures: The SEC is likely interested in ensuring robust investor protection measures are in place on platforms like Binance. Operational Transparency: Discussions could involve improving transparency in Binance’s operational practices and reporting. Crypto Regulation in the US: Navigating a Complex Landscape The broader context of crypto regulation in the United States remains complex and evolving. The SEC has taken a firm stance on regulating cryptocurrencies as securities, leading to enforcement actions against various crypto entities. The Binance case is a prime example of this assertive regulatory approach. However, there’s also growing recognition within the industry and among policymakers that a more balanced and pragmatic approach to crypto regulation is needed. The current ‘regulation by enforcement’ approach has been criticized for creating uncertainty and stifling innovation. Could this joint motion signal a potential shift towards a more collaborative regulatory environment? Challenges and Considerations: SEC’s Stance: The SEC has historically maintained a strict regulatory posture towards crypto. A significant shift in approach may face internal resistance. Binance’s Global Operations: Binance operates globally, and any agreement with the SEC will need to consider its international operations. Broader Regulatory Framework: A lasting solution requires a more comprehensive and clearer regulatory framework for the crypto industry in the U.S., which goes beyond individual enforcement actions. Timeframe: Even with productive discussions, reaching a comprehensive resolution could still be a lengthy process. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? For crypto investors, this news of a second litigation pause offers a glimmer of hope amidst regulatory uncertainty. While it’s crucial to avoid premature optimism, here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on further developments related to the SEC-Binance discussions and any official statements from both parties. Market Volatility: Be prepared for potential market volatility. Positive news could lead to upward price movement, while setbacks could trigger dips. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that regulatory clarity, while desirable, is a long-term process. Focus on projects with strong fundamentals and robust compliance measures. Diversification: As always, diversification remains a key strategy to mitigate risk in the volatile crypto market. Conclusion: A Potential Turning Point in SEC & Binance Saga? The joint motion by the SEC and Binance to extend the litigation pause is a significant development. It suggests that both parties are actively seeking a path towards resolution through dialogue rather than solely through adversarial legal battles. While the outcome of these ‘productive discussions’ remains uncertain, this move offers a potential breakthrough in the ongoing saga and could signal a more constructive phase in the evolution of crypto regulation in the United States. The crypto community will be watching closely to see if this pause leads to a more amicable and positive future for Binance and the broader industry.

It is specifically developed for decentralised finance, high-frequency trading, and real-time digital exchanges. It is known for its unmatched transaction speed. How the SEI Community Is Reacting? As Donald Trump is now one of the most influential figures in the United States, it is natural for WLF’s investment decisions to gain extraordinary market attention . The SEI community has responded positively to WLF’s decision to purchase SEI tokens. The move could be seen as a signal of strategic positioning in the crypto space by World Liberty Fi. SEI Price Outlook: What Analysis Say Until recently, the SEI market had been in a bearish zone. In the last one year, the market has plummeted by over 75.9%. In the last 30 days, the market has dropped by 12%. In the last 14 days alone, the market has declined by 14.4%. At the start of this month, the price of SEI was $0.1720. Since then, the market has slipped by 4.36%. On April 7, the price touched as low as $0.1293. However, on April 6, strong buying pressure emerged in the SEI market. On that day alone, the market grew by over 10.52%. Even though sellers regained control of the market on April 10, they were only able to cause a small correction of 4.11 – far lower compared to April 6’s massive growth. In the last 24 hours, the SEI price has witnessed a rise of 7.8%. In the last one hour alone, the market has climbed by 3.4%. In conclusion, Trump-affiliated investments in SEI could trigger increased confidence in the project, especially from institutional investors. If World Liberty FI continues its crypto activity, SEI might experience stronger demand and visibility in the coming weeks. However, broader market conditions and global sentiment will still play a key role in determining the long-term performance of the token. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

43241679,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148940,1744441808,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Ethereum Relief: SEC Clears Hinman in Landmark Speech, No Ethics Breach Found",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-clears-hinman-ethereum-speech/,"In a significant development for the crypto world, particularly for Ethereum enthusiasts, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially cleared former SEC Corporation Finance Director William Hinman of any ethical misconduct concerning his controversial 2018 speech. This speech, where Hinman declared that Ethereum (ETH) was not a security, has been a subject of intense debate and scrutiny. Now, the SEC’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) report brings a decisive conclusion, finding no criminal or ethical violations. Let’s dive into the details of this groundbreaking report and what it means for the future of crypto regulation and Ethereum. Decoding the SEC’s Hinman Speech Clearance: What Happened? For those deeply invested in the crypto space, especially in Ethereum , William Hinman’s 2018 speech was a landmark moment. Speaking at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit, Hinman stated that Ether transactions were not securities transactions. This statement was widely interpreted as a tacit approval of Ethereum’s decentralized nature and its divergence from traditional securities. However, this speech also sparked controversy, particularly concerning Hinman’s past and future associations with the law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett (STB), which had ties to crypto projects, including Ethereum-related entities. Allegations of conflict of interest and ethical breaches surfaced, prompting an investigation by the SEC’s Office of Inspector General. The central question was whether Hinman’s speech was influenced by his personal or professional interests, especially considering his previous and subsequent employment at STB. The OIG report aimed to determine if Hinman violated any ethics rules or criminal statutes in relation to his Ethereum speech. Key Findings: No Ethics Breach in Hinman’s Ethereum Stance The OIG report’s conclusion is clear and definitive: no criminal or ethics violations were found. The report states several key points: No Direct Financial Impact: The OIG found no evidence that Hinman’s speech had a direct or predictable effect on his financial interests. This was crucial in dismissing allegations of personal gain or insider influence. No SEC Involvement with Former Firm Matters: The investigation revealed no indication that Hinman was involved in SEC matters related to his former firm, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, further dispelling concerns about conflicts of interest. Collaborative Speech Drafting: Importantly, the report highlighted that Hinman’s speech was not a solo endeavor. It was a collaboratively drafted document, reviewed and contributed to by multiple divisions within the SEC. This suggests the speech represented a broader SEC perspective rather than solely Hinman’s personal views. These findings are pivotal in understanding the context and intent behind Hinman’s crypto regulation remarks. It indicates a degree of internal consensus within the SEC at the time regarding Ethereum’s classification. Empower Oversight’s Criticism: A Narrow Scope? While the OIG report exonerates Hinman of criminal and ethical breaches, it has not been without criticism. Empower Oversight, the organization that obtained the report, has voiced concerns about its scope. They argue that the OIG’s investigation was too narrowly focused, primarily looking for potential criminal conflicts of interest. According to U.Today’s report, Empower Oversight believes the investigation should have delved deeper into other potential ethical lapses beyond just criminal violations. This criticism raises questions about the thoroughness of ethics oversight in regulatory bodies. While the OIG addressed the most serious allegations, the debate about the broader ethical implications of regulatory officials’ pronouncements and their connections to private firms might continue. It highlights the ongoing tension between public service and private sector opportunities for individuals with regulatory expertise. Implications for Ethereum and the Crypto Market: What Does This Mean? The SEC clearing Hinman in the Hinman speech case has several significant implications for Ethereum and the broader cryptocurrency market: Reinforces Ethereum’s Non-Security Status (Indirectly): While the OIG report is not a legal ruling on Ethereum’s security status , it validates the context surrounding Hinman’s speech. By clearing Hinman, the SEC implicitly acknowledges that his speech, which stated Ethereum was not a security, did not stem from unethical or conflicted motives. This can be interpreted as a subtle endorsement of the views expressed in the speech. Reduced Regulatory Uncertainty: The cloud of ethical doubt over a significant SEC statement regarding Ethereum has been lifted. This can contribute to reduced regulatory uncertainty surrounding Ethereum, potentially fostering greater investment and development in the Ethereum ecosystem. Precedent for Future SEC Guidance: The collaborative nature of Hinman’s speech drafting, as highlighted in the report, suggests that SEC guidance on crypto assets is often a product of internal consensus. This could provide a framework for understanding future SEC pronouncements and how they are developed. Continued Scrutiny on Regulatory Ethics: Despite Hinman’s clearance, the criticism from Empower Oversight underscores the ongoing need for vigilance regarding ethics in regulatory bodies. The crypto community and the public will likely continue to scrutinize the interactions between regulators and the industries they oversee. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Evolving Regulatory Landscape For participants in the cryptocurrency market, especially those focused on crypto regulation , the Hinman report offers several actionable insights: Insight Actionable Step Regulatory statements, even informal ones, can have significant market impact. Stay informed about speeches, statements, and guidance from regulatory bodies like the SEC. Monitor official channels and news sources. SEC’s internal processes for crypto regulation are collaborative. Understand that SEC positions are often the result of internal discussions and consensus-building. Look for patterns and consistency in SEC communications. Ethics scrutiny of regulators is a crucial aspect of market integrity. Support organizations and initiatives that promote transparency and accountability in regulatory bodies. Engage in public discourse on regulatory ethics. Ethereum’s regulatory path is becoming clearer, but vigilance is still needed. Continue to monitor regulatory developments specifically concerning Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. Engage with legal and regulatory experts to understand evolving compliance requirements. Conclusion: A Chapter Closed, But the Story Continues The SEC’s OIG report clearing William Hinman of ethical violations in his Ethereum speech marks the closing of a significant chapter in the ongoing narrative of crypto regulation. It provides relief and clarity regarding a statement that has shaped perceptions of Ethereum’s regulatory standing for years. While Empower Oversight’s concerns about the scope of the investigation remind us of the complexities of regulatory ethics, the report’s findings are nonetheless impactful. For the crypto community, this development reinforces the importance of understanding regulatory signals, engaging in informed discussions, and staying vigilant as the regulatory landscape continues to evolve. The journey of defining clear and fair rules for the crypto world is far from over, but the Hinman report offers a valuable point of reflection and a step forward in that journey.

This also means that the Helium WiFi Hotspots are not considered securities. Helium can now continue developing WiFi infrastructure and providing crypto incentives without worrying about the SEC subjecting it to never-ending legal suits. The Helium team remains positive with their vision of creating a fully connected world with the help of blockchain technology. Gary Gensler, the former SEC chair, made one final lashing out, targeting Helium with an enforcement action. Helium announced on its blog that the case was unfairly dismissed, meaning the SEC cannot raise similar cases against Helium in the future. Helium also announced that its tokens, including its WiFi tokens, can now be declared saints. Helium operates a blockchain network responsible for around 375,000 WiFi Hotspots, aiming to decentralize the WiFi business. Its market capitalization was around $5 billion in 2021 and has since dropped to $480 million. Since Trump’s inauguration, the SEC has dropped several high-profile cases, including Ripple, Coinbase, and Uniswap. “Today marks a major win for Helium and The People’s Network”, wrote Helium on their blog. “Nova Labs, the founding team behind Helium, confirms the SEC has agreed to dismiss with prejudice its claims that Nova Labs sold unregistered securities. With this dismissal, we can now definitively say that all compatible Helium Hotspots and the distribution of HNT, IOT, and MOBILE tokens through the Helium Network are not securities”. The SEC, however, will still fine Nova Labs with a $200,000 fine related to their civil case involving major firms, including Nestle, Lime, and Salesforce. The SEC claimed that they engaged in fundraising misconduct by making inflated claims about their relation to major firms, during a 2021-2022 token sale. The SEC argues that they inflated their valuation to $1 billion by luring investors under false pretenses. Despite Helium only having limited contact with companies like Nestle, they presented these companies as partners and users of their technology. However, The $200k settlement allows Helium to move on without admitting guilt. Crypto projects, moreover, should learn a lesson from the incident, remembering the dangers of marketing a fundraising campaign. “With the dismissal of the SEC’s unregistered securities claims with prejudice” , Helium wrote on their blog, “the outcome establishes that selling hardware and distributing tokens for network growth does not automatically make them securities in the eyes of the SEC”.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News|SEC,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|REGULATION|HNT|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-12 07:13:30

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/bitcoin-dedicated-platform-says-ripple-has-changed-the-game-for-xrp-forever-heres-why/,"A recent tweet from Bitcoin.com News has drawn attention to what it calls a “defining moment” for XRP and the XRP Ledger. Referring to Ripple’s $1.25 billion acquisition of Hidden Road, the tweet highlights the potential for this development to reshape the cryptocurrency’s role in traditional finance. The post notes that Hidden Road, a prime brokerage firm handling over $10 billion in daily volume and processing over 50 million transactions, is now “plugged into XRP,” suggesting that this move could fundamentally shift how the asset is used in global markets. According to Bitcoin.com News, Ripple hasn’t just acquired a company—it has positioned XRP to serve as the infrastructure for a new era of financial settlement. Ripple didn’t just buy a company—it changed the game for XRP forever The $1.25B Hidden Road deal is more than a headline.

The report emphasizes that Ripple’s move could unlock access to trillions of dollars in traditional finance and dramatically scale the use of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) across institutional platforms. The deal also aligns with Ripple’s longstanding goal of bridging the gap between blockchain technology and legacy finance systems. Institutional Reach and Technology Integration The $1.25 billion acquisition brings with it access to Hidden Road’s significant client base, which includes over 300 institutional investors. These firms represent a wide range of financial activities, including trading, asset management, and liquidity provisioning. By embedding XRP into the clearing and settlement processes used by Hidden Road, Ripple seeks to demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the XRPL. David Schwartz, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, underscored this point by suggesting that billions in trades could be settled instantly on the XRPL, turning the ledger into a functional component of the financial system’s infrastructure. Stablecoin Integration and Future Utility Hidden Road’s infrastructure will also support Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD. According to the Times Tabloid article, this integration will provide a mechanism for efficient cross-margining and settlement, further embedding Ripple’s products within the global financial system. By linking RLUSD and XRP with the core functions of a major prime broker, Ripple aims to offer a full-stack solution that meets the needs of institutional finance.

This consistent demand signals rising institutional interest in XRP-related products, especially after recent legal clarity surrounding Ripple. Teucrium’s CEO Sal Gilbertie called the new 2x XRP ETF their “most successful launch ever.” In an interview with ETF analyst Neta Geraci, he said the product’s debut saw an overwhelming response, even though it flew under the radar at first. The ETF launched right after the old SEC leadership stepped down , which Gilbertie noted was a smart timing move. Trading under the ticker XXRP, the fund gives investors double the daily movement of XRP, making it ideal for those who want to bet short-term on XRP’s price swings. It kicked off with around $5 million in volume, which, while much smaller than big Bitcoin ETFs , was still considered strong for today’s market by expert Eric Balchunas. The volume on $XXRP is impressive, these are big numbers for Day Two-Four, esp for a 2x indie in a whack market. Child's play vs bitcoin ETFs of course, but really strong, this thing is finding an audience quickly pic.twitter.com/IOUtQFW8bd — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) April 11, 2025 Strong Debut Reflects Soaring Demand After its launch on NYSE Arca , the leveraged XRP ETF had an impressive first week. It opened with $5.5 million in trading volume and closed at $23.37. Activity picked up fast, with volume hitting over $13 million on April 9 and the price climbing to $28.92. The ETF reached its weekly high at $29.21 on April 11, with $8.57 million traded. Legal Clarity and New XRP Futures Fuel Optimism The ETF’s rising popularity aligns with broader trends in the XRP ecosystem. On March 20, Bitnomial launched XRP futures , expanding institutional access to the asset. Even more importantly, the U.S. SEC has officially ended its lawsuit against Ripple Labs, a case that cast doubt over XRP’s regulatory status for years. This legal closure has opened the door for new XRP-focused products. Many asset managers are now hopeful about XRP ETF approvals, especially after the SEC’s recent green light for Ethereum ETF options , hinting at a more crypto-friendly stance. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple CEO Talks XRP Price Surge and Bitcoin Price Forecasts , XRP Price Riding the Momentum With the legal cloud lifted, XRP’s outlook appears stronger than ever.

The banking giant believes that Ripple will soar by over 200% in the coming years. In this article, we explore several factors that support the bank’s bullish thesis. Top 3 Reasons Why XRP Price Can Hit $5.50 This Year Standard Chartered’s Geoff Kendrick’s forecast says that XRP price will soar by 200% to $5.50 before the end of 2025. If Ripple attains this price, the altcoin will attain a $319 billion market cap and become the largest altcoin. Let’s explore why this rally is likely to happen. Inflows to the First XRP ETF in the US Earlier this week, Teucrium Investment launched the first leveraged XRP ETF in the US. As a recent Coingape article reported, this ETF has secured five straight days of inflows. This shows high market interest in the product despite macroeconomic concerns from the ongoing US-China trade war. According to data from Teucrium, the 2x Long Daily XRP ETF has amassed $17.2 million in net assets after trading for only five days. During the same period, spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs recorded steady outflows. This makes it likely that the XRP price will attain the Standard Chartered target of $5.50. US Government May Hold $50M XRP The US government may hold $50M XRP tokens according to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. While speaking to Fox Business, Garlinghouse noted that the settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might go to the US government. “The SEC is going to end up with $50 million, the US government is getting $50M. We have even talked about making that available in XRP.” Ripple’s settlement in the SEC case may see the token being the first altcoin to be added to a digital assets stockpile. This is bullish for XRP price and could aid a rally to $5.50 as Standard Chartered predicted. Regulatory Clarity Lastly, the newly found regulatory clarity for Ripple after the SEC case ended makes the $5.50 target attainable. The end of this case will see Ripple secure adoption from retail and institutional investors, triggering a massive price rally. The SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit has been weighing on XRP price for years since it was opened in late 2020. With the weight being lifted, XRP will likely unlock a massive 200% rally. XRP Price Technical Analysis XRP price today trades at $2,03 with a slight 2.3% gain in 24 hours. The altcoin is now eyeing resistance at the 78.6% Fibonacci level of $2.10. If Ripple overcomes this resistance, it may recover past $2.23. The RSI is also flashing bullish signs after rising to 57. Meanwhile, the MACD has also flipped positive, which is a sign that the current uptrend is growing strong and may extend. XRP/USDT: 4-Hour Chart To sum up, several bullish catalysts make the $5.50 target price for XRP by Standard Chartered attainable. Factors like the end of the SEC case, endorsement by the US government, and interest in the recently launched XRP ETF will support the parabolic 200% gains for Ripple before year-end.

Now in Phase 4 of its 11-phase presale, the token is priced at $0.025, with Phase 5 set to increase the price by 20% to $0.03. 400 million tokens have been claimed by early joiners, who are benefiting from a system built to maximize returns through multifaceted tokenomics. Investors buying now will make a 140% profit once launched, with MUTM listing at $0.06. Post-launch, analysts expect another spike to $4.50, as Mutuum Finance’s unique mechanisms and rapid adoption kick in. Here are three key factors driving estimates of $6 by mid-2025. Presale and Well-Defined Tokenomics Strategic planning of the MUTM presale structure has successfully attracted investor interest in Mutuum finance. The presale introduces token pricing at $0.025 during this phase but the price will rise across multiple periods until it reaches a $0.06 listing price at the conclusion. The progressive pricing model stimulates supporter rewards and establishes momentum by emptying available token quantities at each stage. The transition to Phase 5 delivers a 20% profit opportunity known as paper gain to all current buyers. Strong tokenomics together with this strategy create additional confidence in investors. Phase 4 users can expect a minimum 140% profit at $0.06 when the platform launches utilities while analysts project the price will reach $4.50. The projected returns from Mutuum Finance depend on its revenue-sharing system that uses platform fees to repurchase tokens through redemption to lower supply levels permanently. The presale has raised more than $6.5 million while showing constant acceleration which indicates further demand growth is unlikely. Demand Generation through Buy-and-Distribute Mechanism Mutuum Finance implements its growth strategy through the core buy-and-distribute protocol. The revenue stream automatically acquires MUTM tokens from public exchanges to route into purchases. The tokens that Mutuum Finance purchases go to stakers and liquidity providers in order to strengthen long-term holding and support persistent buying pressure. The continuous self-feeding system controls token supply while driving prices upward because market fluctuations fail to affect it. Mutuum Finance enhanced their platform capabilities by launching a new dashboard display of the token holder rankings for the top 50 individuals. Additional bonus tokens can be accumulated by high earners through their individual score performance. These promotional plays generate increased visibility and fan engagement during the presale period through a $100,000 prize giveaway which reflows into the ecosystem development. A Practical Solution To Decentralized Borrowing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) instead ties its value to real DeFi applications rather than being a speculation token. It uses overcollateralized loans to allow users to lend and borrow from each other, making it impossible for users to default while providing lenders with liquidity. Users deposit assets like ETH or stablecoins to mint interest-bearing mtTokens, which accumulate over time, and can be traded across DeFi platforms. When the market is on the up, a lender will be able to charge a high rate for the ability to borrow funds, which means the rates that people are given will reflect the current economic climate, whereas they could also take the lower during the down times. Additionally, a peer-to-peer lending feature enables the direct negotiation of loan terms, which increases its utility for niche assets such as meme coins. This capability makes Mutuum Finance an all-in-one platform for anyone looking for DeFi services, whether institutional or retail, allowing users to do everything on the platform. Moving Forward The development team of Mutuum Finance is currently in the final stages of issuing a smart contract audit with CertiK, which is expected to greatly boost investor confidence. As each is completed, results will be shared through official channels. At the same time, phase four of the presale is gathering momentum, as it provides one of the last chances to buy MUTM below the $0.03 mark ahead of exchange listings.

A new bill introduced by U.S. Senators Sheldon Whitehouse and John Fetterman is sending ripples through the crypto world. The Clean Cloud Act proposes to levy fees on data centers and cryptocurrency mining facilities that exceed carbon emission benchmarks. This move signals a significant shift towards environmental accountability within the digital asset space, but what does it really mean for Bitcoin and the future of crypto mining? Let’s dive into the details of this groundbreaking legislation. Understanding the Clean Cloud Act: Targeting Bitcoin Mining Carbon Emissions The heart of the matter lies in the Clean Cloud Act , a draft bill designed to address the growing environmental concerns associated with energy-intensive industries like cryptocurrency mining and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Recognizing the substantial energy demands of data centers and, particularly, Bitcoin mining operations, the bill aims to mitigate the risk of surging energy prices and reduce the overall carbon footprint. But how exactly does it plan to achieve this? Emission Performance Standards: The bill mandates the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish emission performance standards specifically for data centers and crypto mining facilities with a significant IT load (100 kilowatts or more). Annual Emission Reduction Targets: These standards are designed to drive down emissions by 11% annually. The reduction target is based on the emissions intensity of the local power grid, acknowledging regional variations in energy sources. Carbon Emission-Based Fees: Here’s where it gets interesting. Facilities exceeding these emission standards will face fees, initially set at $20 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂e). This financial penalty is designed to incentivize cleaner practices and make polluting energy sources less economically viable. In essence, the Clean Cloud Act is a direct attempt to regulate the environmental impact of Bitcoin and other energy-intensive digital technologies by making carbon emissions a tangible cost for these operations. Why Focus on Bitcoin Mining Carbon Emissions? The spotlight on Bitcoin mining carbon emissions isn’t arbitrary. Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, while lauded for its security, is notoriously energy-hungry. Globally, Bitcoin mining consumes a vast amount of electricity, a significant portion of which still comes from fossil fuels, contributing substantially to carbon emissions. Critics argue that this energy consumption undermines global climate goals and exacerbates environmental problems. This bill underscores a growing global awareness and concern about the ecological footprint of cryptocurrencies. As governments worldwide grapple with climate change, industries perceived as major contributors to carbon emissions are increasingly facing regulatory scrutiny. Cryptocurrency regulation , particularly concerning environmental impact, is becoming a hot topic on the legislative agenda. Potential Impacts and Challenges of the Clean Cloud Act The Clean Cloud Act , while aiming for a greener future, is not without its potential challenges and implications for the cryptocurrency industry. Potential Benefits: Environmental Responsibility: The most obvious benefit is the push towards more environmentally responsible practices in Bitcoin mining . By making carbon emissions costly, the bill incentivizes miners to seek out cleaner energy sources. Grid Stability: By reducing overall energy demand from large data centers and mining facilities, the bill could contribute to grid stability, particularly in regions with strained energy infrastructure. Innovation in Green Mining: The financial pressure from emission fees could spur innovation in green mining technologies and renewable energy adoption within the crypto mining sector. Potential Challenges: Increased Operating Costs: For mining facilities that rely on carbon-intensive energy sources, the Bitcoin mining fees imposed by the bill could significantly increase operating costs, potentially impacting profitability. Competitive Disadvantage: U.S.-based miners might face a competitive disadvantage compared to miners in regions with less stringent environmental regulations, potentially leading to a shift in mining operations to other countries. Implementation Complexity: Defining and enforcing emission performance standards for a decentralized and rapidly evolving industry like cryptocurrency mining can be complex and require robust monitoring and verification mechanisms. Defining ‘Excessive’ Emissions: The 11% annual reduction target based on local grid intensity might be perceived as aggressive by some and insufficient by others, sparking debate about the fairness and effectiveness of the benchmarks. Is This the Future of Cryptocurrency Regulation? The introduction of the Clean Cloud Act is a strong signal that environmental considerations are no longer on the periphery of cryptocurrency regulation. Governments are increasingly recognizing the need to balance innovation in the digital asset space with broader societal goals, including climate action. Whether this specific bill becomes law in its current form remains to be seen. It will likely face scrutiny and debate from various stakeholders, including the cryptocurrency industry, environmental groups, and energy providers. However, the underlying trend is clear: the era of ignoring the environmental impact of Bitcoin and other energy-intensive cryptocurrencies is rapidly closing. This legislative effort could pave the way for more comprehensive and globally coordinated approaches to cryptocurrency regulation , particularly concerning energy consumption and environmental sustainability. The crypto industry will need to adapt and innovate to thrive in a future where environmental responsibility is not just a choice, but a regulatory requirement. Conclusion: A Critical Moment for Crypto and the Environment The Clean Cloud Act represents a pivotal moment in the ongoing conversation about cryptocurrency and its environmental footprint. It’s a clear indication that lawmakers are taking the Bitcoin mining carbon emissions issue seriously and are prepared to implement measures that could significantly reshape the industry. While the bill presents challenges, it also offers an opportunity to drive innovation towards greener and more sustainable cryptocurrency practices. The coming months will be crucial in determining the fate of this legislation and its lasting impact on the crypto landscape.

Token unlocking will take place on April 18th at 03:00 Turkish time (UTC+3). Memecoin is currently unlocking 493,150 TRUMP tokens daily, worth around $3.94 million per day. According to blockchain data, TRUMP’s current market cap is $1.6 billion, with a fully diluted valuation of around $8 billion. Of the maximum supply of 1 billion, 200 million tokens (20%) are currently available for use, while the remaining 800 million (80%) are locked. TRUMP is currently trading at $8, an 84% drop from its peak price just before Trump’s presidential inauguration on January 20. The sharp drop in price coincided with a significant drop in user engagement. All-time chart showing the huge decline in the TRUMP token.

This week, the AI community witnessed a dramatic turn as Meta, a tech titan, faced scrutiny over the real capabilities of its much-anticipated Maverick AI model. Initially touted for a high score on the LM Arena benchmark using an experimental version, the vanilla, unmodified Maverick model has now been tested, and the results are in: it’s lagging behind the competition. Let’s dive into what this means for the AI model benchmark landscape and for Meta. Why is the AI Community Buzzing About Meta’s Maverick Model and its Benchmark Results? Earlier this week, controversy erupted when it was revealed that Meta had used an experimental, unreleased iteration of its Llama 4 Maverick model to achieve a seemingly impressive score on LM Arena, a popular crowdsourced AI model benchmark . This move led to accusations of misrepresentation, prompting LM Arena’s maintainers to issue an apology and revise their evaluation policies. The focus then shifted to the unmodified, or ‘vanilla,’ Maverick model to assess its true standing against industry rivals. The results are now in, and they paint a less flattering picture. The vanilla Maverick, identified as “Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct,” has been benchmarked against leading models, including: OpenAI’s GPT-4o Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro As of Friday, the rankings placed the unmodified Meta Maverick AI model below these competitors, many of which have been available for months. This raises critical questions about Meta’s AI development trajectory and its competitive positioning in the rapidly evolving AI market. The release version of Llama 4 has been added to LMArena after it was found out they cheated, but you probably didn’t see it because you have to scroll down to 32nd place which is where is ranks pic.twitter.com/A0Bxkdx4LX — ρ:ɡeσn (@pigeon__s) April 11, 2025 What Factors Contribute to the Maverick Model’s Performance Gap? Meta’s own explanation sheds some light on the performance discrepancy. The experimental Maverick model, “Llama-4-Maverick-03-26-Experimental,” was specifically “optimized for conversationality.” This optimization strategy appeared to resonate well with LM Arena’s evaluation method, which relies on human raters comparing model outputs and expressing preferences. However, this tailored approach also underscores a critical point about LM Arena and similar benchmarks. While LM Arena offers a platform for crowdsourced AI model evaluation, it’s not without its limitations. As previously discussed, its reliability as a definitive measure of an AI model’s overall capabilities has been questioned. Optimizing a model specifically for a particular benchmark, while potentially yielding high scores in that context, can be misleading. It can also obscure a model’s true performance across diverse applications and real-world scenarios. Developers might find it challenging to accurately predict how such a benchmark-optimized model will perform in varied contexts beyond the specific parameters of the AI performance evaluation. Meta’s Response and the Future of Llama 4 In response to the unfolding situation, a Meta spokesperson provided a statement to Bitcoin World, clarifying their approach to AI model development. They emphasized that Meta routinely experiments with “all types of custom variants” in their AI research. The experimental “Llama-4-Maverick-03-26-Experimental” was described as a “chat optimized version we experimented with that also performs well on LMArena.” Looking ahead, Meta has now released the open-source version of Llama 4 . The spokesperson expressed anticipation for how developers will customize and adapt Llama 4 for their unique use cases, inviting ongoing feedback from the developer community. This open-source approach may foster broader innovation and uncover novel applications for Llama 4, even as the vanilla version faces AI performance challenges in benchmarks like LM Arena. Key Takeaways on Meta’s Maverick Model and AI Benchmarks: Benchmark Context Matters: The incident highlights the importance of understanding the context and methodology of AI model benchmarks . Scores on platforms like LM Arena should be interpreted cautiously and not be seen as the sole determinant of a model’s overall utility. Optimization Trade-offs: Optimizing AI models for specific benchmarks can lead to inflated scores that may not reflect real-world performance across diverse tasks. Transparency and Openness: Meta’s release of the open-source Llama 4 is a positive step towards transparency and community-driven development in the AI space. Developer Customization is Key: The true potential of models like Llama 4 may lie in the hands of developers who can tailor and fine-tune them for specific applications, going beyond generic benchmark performance. The recent events surrounding Meta’s Maverick model serve as a crucial reminder of the complexities in evaluating AI performance and the need for nuanced perspectives beyond benchmark rankings. As the AI landscape continues to evolve, critical analysis of evaluation methodologies and a focus on real-world applicability will be paramount.

43242686,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148971,1744444216,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent: NY Judge Greenlights Critical Securities Fraud Case Against DCG in Crypto Legal Battle,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ny-judge-dcg-securities-fraud/,"Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! The legal drama in the crypto world just took another critical turn. A New York judge has given the green light for Attorney General Letitia James’ civil securities fraud case against Digital Currency Group (DCG), its CEO Barry Silbert, and former Genesis Global Capital CEO Michael Moro to proceed. This isn’t just another day in crypto town; this decision could have significant ripple effects across the industry. Let’s dive into what this all means. Why is the DCG Securities Fraud Case Moving Forward? In a nutshell, the judge in New York found enough merit in the Attorney General’s allegations to allow the securities fraud case to move to trial. Filed back in 2023, the lawsuit accuses DCG and its affiliates, along with crypto exchange Gemini, of attempting to hide a staggering $1 billion hole in Genesis’ balance sheet. This alleged cover-up followed the dramatic collapse of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital in 2022 – a period many of us remember for its market turmoil. While Gemini and Genesis have already settled with the state, DCG, Silbert, and Moro fought back, seeking to dismiss the case. Their core argument? The Gemini Earn program, a key element in the allegations, didn’t involve securities and therefore shouldn’t fall under the state’s securities laws. However, the judge wasn’t convinced. Let’s break down the key players and what’s at stake: Digital Currency Group (DCG): A major crypto venture firm facing serious allegations. Barry Silbert: CEO of DCG, now personally in the legal crosshairs. Genesis Global Capital: A DCG affiliate at the heart of the alleged financial shortfall. Gemini: Crypto exchange involved through its Earn program, which has already settled with the state. New York Attorney General Letitia James: Leading the charge, claiming investor fraud and seeking accountability. The Heart of the Matter: The Gemini Earn Program and Securities The crux of DCG’s defense was that the Gemini Earn program wasn’t a security. Why is this important? Because securities are subject to stricter regulations and legal frameworks designed to protect investors. If the Gemini Earn program is deemed a security, it opens up a whole new level of legal scrutiny. The Attorney General argued that the Gemini Earn program indeed functioned as a security offering. The judge agreed, stating that the Attorney General had “adequately alleged” this point. This is a significant win for the prosecution and a major setback for DCG’s defense. To understand why this program is so contentious, let’s look at its features: Feature Description Gemini Earn Program Offered by Gemini in partnership with Genesis, allowing users to lend their crypto in exchange for interest. Yield Generation Users expected to earn interest, implying a return on investment, a key characteristic of securities. Centralized Management The program was managed by Gemini and Genesis, with users relying on their expertise and actions. Risk of Loss As events unfolded, users faced significant risk of losing their deposited crypto, highlighting the investment nature. What Does This Crypto Legal Battle Mean for the Industry? This crypto legal battle is far more than just a dispute between DCG and the New York Attorney General. It’s a bellwether for how regulators and courts are viewing crypto products and services. The decision to allow the case to proceed signals a tougher stance on crypto firms, especially those offering yield-generating products. Here’s why this case is so important for the broader crypto ecosystem: Regulatory Scrutiny: It reinforces the idea that crypto firms are not operating in a regulatory vacuum. Expect increased oversight. Precedent Setting: The outcome could set precedents for future cases involving crypto lending and yield programs. Investor Protection: It underscores the importance of investor protection in the crypto space, a growing concern for regulators worldwide. Market Confidence: How this case unfolds will likely impact market confidence, particularly in centralized crypto platforms. Barry Silbert and DCG Under Pressure: What’s Next? With the dismissal motion denied, Barry Silbert and DCG are now facing a full-blown trial. This means they will have to present a robust defense against the Attorney General’s claims. The stakes are incredibly high, not just for DCG and Silbert personally, but for their reputation and future in the crypto industry. The road ahead for DCG involves: Preparing for Trial: Building a legal strategy to counter the Attorney General’s evidence. Potential Settlement: While they initially resisted, a settlement might become a more attractive option to avoid a potentially damaging trial. Reputational Damage Control: Managing public perception and investor confidence during this challenging period. Industry Impact: Navigating the broader industry repercussions and regulatory shifts that may arise from this case. Final Thoughts: A Decisive Moment for Crypto Regulation? The New York judge’s decision is a decisive moment in the ongoing saga of crypto regulation. It highlights the increasing pressure on crypto firms to comply with traditional financial regulations, particularly when it comes to products that resemble securities. As this case progresses, it will be crucial to watch how it shapes the future landscape of crypto finance and investor protection. One thing is clear: the era of unchecked crypto operations is rapidly coming to an end.

In return, Changpeng Zhao (CZ) would provide the US DoJ executives with evidence related to Tron founder Justin Sun. Responding to it, Sun said that he sees CZ as his mentor and that he has nothing to hide from the authorities. Justin Sun Addresses Rumors, Affirms Trust in Binance CEO Responding to the circulating rumors, Tron founder Justin Sun emphasized his strong ties with Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). In a message on the X platform, the Tron founder wrote: “CZ is both my mentor and a close friend—he has played a crucial role in supporting me during my entrepreneurial journey”. Sun praised Zhao’s leadership and ethics, calling them “the highest standard I strive to follow as a founder. He also highlighted TRON’s collaborative relationship with the DOJ, describing the department as “one of T3FCU’s closest and most trusted partners”. The Tron founder assed that the joint efforts between the two parties have focused on protecting global users through various cases. “Whether it’s CZ or our partners at the DOJ, we maintain direct, honest communication at all times. I have full trust in each and every one of them,” Sun affirmed. Additionally, Justin Sun said that he’s very optimistic about favourable crypto policy initiatives under U.S. President Donald Trump. Also, sharing optimism about TRON’s prospects, stating, “As the President’s earliest crypto choice, TRX is set to be one of the beneficiaries of this success. ALL IN USA!” Is WSJ On A Hit Job Against CZ? Just ahead of the WSJ report , Binance chief Changpeng Zhao shared on X platform, exposing the media platform. He wrote: “Multiple people have told me again WSJ is writing another baseless hit piece about me”. Last month, a WSJ report also stated that the Trump family was eyeing a stake deal in Binance.US , in return for pardoning CZ from his prison term. CZ later denied the allegations, calling them baseless. In another development on Friday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Binance jointly requested a federal judge to extend the pause in their ongoing legal case by an additional 60 days. The motion comes after both parties described recent talks as “productive discussions,” with the extension intended to allow more time for continued deliberations and potential resolution.

Simultaneously, the company has been in discussions to partner with a Trump family-backed cryptocurrency initiative, marking a notable alignment between the embattled crypto exchange and the former president’s inner circle. The discussions, confirmed by individuals familiar with the matter, signal Binance’s effort to regain traction in the U.S. market following its $4.3 billion settlement with federal regulators in 2023 for facilitating illicit financial activity. Binance pushes to end U.S. oversight as Trump family eyes strategic crypto alliance According to people familiar with the meeting, Binance CEO Richard Teng and Chief Legal Officer Eleanor Hughes requested that Treasury officials remove the monitorship or reduce its duration and scope. The current oversight requires extensive oversight from the Treasury and the Justice Department. At the same time, Binance is exploring a potential listing of a new dollar-pegged stablecoin, USD1, launched by World Liberty Financial, a venture backed by former President Donald Trump’s family. The Trump-affiliated crypto firm aims to capitalize on Binance’s global reach of over 250 million users and its daily trading volume of $65 billion to propel USD1 into a major player in the digital currency ecosystem. The talks illustrate an emerging alliance between Binance and Trump-world figures. Binance, facing regulatory pressure and operational restrictions in the U.S., could benefit from political goodwill. Trump, who has already pardoned several crypto industry figures, may be poised to ease regulatory scrutiny on digital assets. In return, the Trump family gains financially from increased circulation of USD1. Stablecoin issuers like Tether made over $13 billion in profits last year, largely from interest income on reserves. Binance’s support could drive massive adoption of USD1 and potentially bring in similar windfalls. Sources told the Wall Street Journal that Trump family representatives have also talked with Binance about acquiring a stake in Binance US, the exchange’s faltering U.S. subsidiary. Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, who pleaded guilty to federal charges and served a four-month prison term, is reportedly seeking a presidential pardon. This move could be facilitated by strengthening ties with the Trump camp. Crypto diplomacy in Abu Dhabi sparks Binance–Trump alliance The Binance and Trump Family relationship was catalyzed at a high-level crypto conference in Abu Dhabi last December, shortly before Trump’s second inauguration. In a private VIP room dubbed the “Whale Only” lounge, Zhao mingled with Eric Trump and other Trump associates, including Steve Witkoff, who is a special Middle East envoy. Eric Trump used the opportunity to promote World Liberty and the “digital-currency golden age” under his father’s renewed leadership. Since then, business discussions between Binance and World Liberty Financial have accelerated. The exchange is also reportedly fine-tuning its internal anti-money-laundering controls, though some insiders claim these efforts may weaken checks on high-risk users — a claim Binance denies. Binance’s interest in political alliances extends beyond potential partnerships. The company reportedly established internal task forces to prepare for a U.S. reentry under a second Trump administration and to pursue a pardon for Zhao. Binance’s past dealings with figures like Justin Sun — founder of the Tron blockchain and a major investor in World Liberty — have also raised eyebrows. Over half of last year’s illicit crypto activity reportedly occurred on Tron. Sun, who is facing SEC scrutiny, invested $75 million into World Liberty’s token earlier this year. Following the investment, the regulatory watchdog asked a federal court to pause its fraud lawsuit against him. As part of his plea deal, Zhao agreed to provide information to prosecutors about Sun’s activities, sources revealed. Justice Department ends crypto oversight The Justice Department recently announced the dissolution of its cryptocurrency unit and the suspension of corporate monitorships — the very mechanism currently overseeing Binance. This reflects a shift in the regulatory winds. The “Ending Regulation by Prosecution” announcement suggests a broader rollback in crypto enforcement under the Trump administration. A Treasury spokesperson confirmed the meeting with Binance was one of many held with industry stakeholders. A Binance spokesperson described the monitorships as “inefficient and costly burdens” and reaffirmed the exchange’s commitment to “supporting any government seeking to balance innovation with user protections.” The spokesperson for World Liberty noted that USD1 aims to be “accessible for millions around the globe,” asserting that Binance is still an integral player in crypto’s global market. The White House declined to comment on whether Zhao or any other individuals are under consideration for presidential pardons.

When a figure as influential as former President Donald Trump speaks about the U.S. dollar, the global financial markets – including the ever-exciting cryptocurrency sphere – perk up and listen. Recently, Trump made a confident statement suggesting a significant strengthening of the US Dollar , coupled with optimistic expectations for improved relations with China. But what does this mean for the global economy , international trade , and your crypto portfolio? Let’s dive into the details. Trump’s Bold Prediction: A Stronger US Dollar on the Horizon? According to a post by Watcher.Guru on X (formerly Twitter), Donald Trump declared that the US Dollar is poised to “rise significantly and become stronger than ever.” This statement, coming from a former president known for his direct and often market-moving pronouncements, has certainly grabbed attention. But what’s behind this bullish outlook? And more importantly, what are the potential ripple effects across different sectors, especially in the context of international trade and digital currencies? Decoding the Dynamics: Why a Stronger US Dollar Matters A strengthening US Dollar isn’t just a number on a currency exchange chart; it’s a key indicator with far-reaching implications. Let’s break down why this matters: Impact on Imports and Exports: A strong dollar makes U.S. imports cheaper for American consumers, potentially helping to keep inflation in check. Conversely, it makes U.S. exports more expensive for foreign buyers, which could impact the competitiveness of American goods and services in the global market. Influence on Global Debt: Many countries, especially emerging economies, hold debt denominated in US Dollars . A stronger dollar means these debts become more expensive to repay in their local currencies, potentially straining their economies. Commodity Prices: Many commodities, like oil and gold, are priced in US Dollars . A stronger dollar can sometimes lead to a decrease in commodity prices, as it takes fewer dollars to purchase the same amount of commodities. Investor Sentiment: A strong dollar is often seen as a sign of a robust U.S. economy , which can attract foreign investment into dollar-denominated assets. To understand the potential benefits and challenges, let’s consider a quick comparison: Aspect Benefits of a Strong US Dollar Challenges of a Strong US Dollar Consumers Cheaper imports, potentially lower inflation. – U.S. Exporters – Exports become more expensive, potentially reducing competitiveness. Global Debtors – Dollar-denominated debts become more expensive to repay. Investors Sign of a strong U.S. economy, attracting investment. – China and the US Dollar: Navigating the Complex Relationship Trump’s statement also included optimism about achieving a “positive outcome” in relations with China . The economic relationship between the U.S. and China is one of the most crucial in the world, and the US Dollar plays a significant role in this dynamic. Here’s how a stronger US Dollar and improved relations could intertwine: Trade Balance: A stronger dollar could potentially exacerbate the trade imbalance between the U.S. and China by making Chinese goods cheaper for American consumers and American goods more expensive for Chinese buyers. However, improved relations might lead to new trade agreements or adjustments that could mitigate this effect. Currency Manipulation: The U.S. has often accused China of manipulating its currency to gain a trade advantage. A stronger US Dollar could put pressure on other currencies, including the Chinese Yuan, and how China manages its currency will be closely watched. Geopolitical Implications: Positive outcomes in U.S.- China relations could lead to greater stability in global markets and reduced geopolitical risks, which can be beneficial for overall economic growth. Crypto’s Reaction: Will Bitcoin and Altcoins Respond to a Surging US Dollar? For cryptocurrency enthusiasts, the strength of the US Dollar is always a point of interest. Historically, there’s often been an inverse relationship between the US Dollar and assets like Bitcoin. When the dollar strengthens, assets like Bitcoin, sometimes viewed as alternative stores of value, can see fluctuations. Here’s what to consider in the crypto context: Investment Flows: A stronger US Dollar might make dollar-denominated investments more attractive, potentially diverting some investment away from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies in the short term. Global Crypto Markets: For investors outside the U.S., a stronger dollar can make cryptocurrencies priced in dollars more expensive in their local currencies, potentially affecting demand. Inflation Hedge Narrative: If a stronger dollar helps to curb inflation, it could potentially reduce the appeal of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as inflation hedges, although this narrative is complex and debated. Navigating the Economic Tides: Actionable Insights for Investors So, what should investors, particularly those in the crypto space, take away from Trump ‘s statements and the potential for a stronger US Dollar ? Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on macroeconomic indicators, including currency movements, inflation data, and developments in U.S.- China relations. News from figures like Trump can be market-moving, but it’s crucial to look at broader economic trends. Diversify Your Portfolio: Diversification is key in any investment strategy. Consider having a mix of assets, including traditional investments and cryptocurrencies, to mitigate risks associated with currency fluctuations and market volatility. Understand Global Interconnections: The global economy is interconnected. Events in one part of the world, or statements from influential figures, can have ripple effects everywhere, including the crypto market. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term market reactions can be volatile, maintain a long-term perspective on your investments. The cryptocurrency market, in particular, is known for its long-term growth potential despite short-term fluctuations. Conclusion: A Stronger Dollar, Global Dynamics, and the Crypto World Donald Trump ‘s prediction of a stronger US Dollar and optimism regarding China injects a fresh layer of complexity into the global economic narrative. For those in the cryptocurrency world, understanding these macroeconomic shifts is paramount. A stronger dollar can have multifaceted impacts, influencing everything from trade balances to investment flows and potentially shaping the trajectory of the crypto market. As always, staying informed, being adaptable, and maintaining a balanced perspective are your best tools for navigating these dynamic times. The interplay between the US Dollar , global economy , and the burgeoning crypto space is set to remain a captivating story to watch unfold.

Key On-Chain Metric Reveals Insights,https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/ethereum-capitulation-nearing-its-end-key-on-chain-metric-reveals-insights/,"According to a recent X post by seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez, Ethereum (ETH) may have already gone through its capitulation phase for this market cycle. Notably, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is down more than 55% over the past year. Is Ethereum Capitulation Over? Unlike Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins such as XRP, Solana (SOL), and SUI, Ethereum has endured a challenging two-year stretch. The cryptocurrency was trading at $1,892 exactly two years ago, on April 11, 2023, and is now priced around $1,560 – over 17% lower. Related Reading: Is Ethereum Repeating Its 2020 Trend Reversal? Analyst Predicts ETH To ‘Explode’ In Q2 2025 In contrast, BTC has surged from approximately $41,000 two years ago to $82,127 at the time of writing – an increase of nearly 100%. While SOL currently trades below its April 2023 price, unlike ETH, it did manage to reach a new all-time high (ATH) of $293 earlier this year in January. Understandably, sentiment toward ETH – among both retail and institutional investors – is hovering near all-time lows. However, Martinez believes that “smart money” may be accumulating at current levels, anticipating a near-term reversal. The analyst pointed out that Ethereum’s Entity-Adjusted Dormancy Flow has recently dropped below one million. Martinez added: This historically indicates a macro bottom zone, meaning $ETH might be undervalued and long-term holders are less inclined to sell. It also suggests: sentiment is low, capitulation may have occurred, smart money might be accumulating. For the uninitiated, Ethereum’s Entity-Adjusted Dormancy Flow is an on-chain metric that compares the market cap to the dormancy – the average age of ETH being moved – adjusted for unique entities instead of raw addresses. The metric helps identify whether the market is overheated or undervalued by tracking the behavior of long-term holders. If ETH follows historical trends, it may be approaching a momentum reversal. In a separate X post, crypto trader Merlijn The Trader suggested that Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) is nearing a peak, which could shift capital into altcoins and trigger a short-term rally. At the time of writing, BTC.D stands around 63.5%. A potential pivot by the US Federal Reserve toward quantitative easing (QE) could inject fresh liquidity into the market, possibly sparking a mini altcoin rally. ETH Demands Cautious Optimism While there are multiple signs that ETH may be close to bottoming out, some indicators suggest that there could be continued weakness for the digital asset before any meaningful momentum shift. Related Reading: Analyst Spots Key Ethereum Resistance Levels While RSI Hints At Bullish Divergence In a recent analysis, Martinez warned that ETH could fall as low as $1,200 if the current sell-off continues. Further, ongoing capital outflows from US-based spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETF) remain a concern for the asset’s short-term outlook. That said, crypto analyst NotWojak recently noted that ETH may be on the verge of a breakout, with a potential upside target of $1,835. At press time, ETH is trading at $1,557, down 2.3% in the past 24 hours.

You’re not alone. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a key indicator of market sentiment, has just signaled a significant shift. Let’s dive into what this means for you and your crypto investments. Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: What Is It? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a powerful tool designed to gauge the overall sentiment of the cryptocurrency market. Think of it as a mood ring for the crypto world. It analyzes various factors to determine whether the market is experiencing fear or greed, two dominant emotions that heavily influence investment decisions. Ranging from 0 to 100, the index breaks down as follows: 0-25: Extreme Fear – Suggests investors are extremely worried, often indicating a potential buying opportunity. 26-49: Fear – Indicates fear is prevalent in the market, suggesting caution among investors. 50-75: Greed – Signals that greed is taking over, potentially pointing towards market exuberance and a possible bubble. 76-100: Extreme Greed – Represents excessive optimism, often a warning sign of an impending market correction. The index isn’t based on gut feelings; it’s calculated using a weighted average of six key market indicators, giving a comprehensive view of market sentiment: Factor Weight Description Volatility 25% Measures the current and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing it with the 30-day and 90-day averages. Unusually high volatility can indicate fear. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Compares current market momentum and volume with the 30-day and 90-day averages. High buying volumes signal greed, while low volumes can indicate fear. Social Media 15% Analyzes social media sentiment, particularly on platforms like Twitter and Reddit, to understand public opinion on Bitcoin and crypto. Surveys 15% Conducts weekly crypto polls to gauge investor sentiment directly. Bitcoin Dominance 10% Measures Bitcoin’s dominance compared to other cryptocurrencies. A rise in Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate a fear-driven market as investors flock to the perceived safety of Bitcoin. Google Trends 10% Analyzes Google Trends data for Bitcoin-related search queries to understand general public interest and sentiment. Shift to the ‘Fear’ Zone: What Does This Mean for Crypto Market Sentiment? Recently, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index experienced a notable shift. As of April 12, it registered at 43, a decrease of 18 points from the previous day. This move propelled the index out of the ‘Extreme Fear’ zone (below 25) and into the ‘Fear’ zone (26-49). While this might seem like a positive progression from ‘Extreme Fear’, it still signifies that fear remains a dominant emotion in the crypto market . This transition suggests a slight improvement in overall market sentiment, but it’s crucial to remember that ‘Fear’ still implies caution. Investors are still wary, likely due to ongoing market uncertainties, regulatory concerns, or broader economic factors. The drop of 18 points highlights the volatile nature of the crypto market and how quickly sentiment can change. Navigating Market Volatility: How to Use the Fear & Greed Index to Your Advantage? So, how can you, as a crypto investor, use this information to your advantage in this period of market volatility ? Identify Potential Buying Opportunities: Historically, periods of ‘Extreme Fear’ on the index have often presented lucrative buying opportunities. When fear is rampant, asset prices can be suppressed, creating chances to buy quality cryptocurrencies at lower prices. However, ‘Fear’ zone, while less extreme, still suggests potential caution. It might be a good time for selective buying, focusing on fundamentally strong projects. Manage Risk: Conversely, high ‘Greed’ or ‘Extreme Greed’ readings can be seen as warning signs. When the market is overly greedy, it might be a good time to take profits or reduce your exposure to the market, preparing for potential corrections. The current ‘Fear’ zone suggests that excessive risk-taking should be avoided, and a more balanced approach to portfolio management is advisable. Confirm Market Trends: Use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index in conjunction with other technical and fundamental analysis tools. It shouldn’t be the sole basis for your investment decisions but rather a valuable supplementary indicator to confirm or question your market assessments. For instance, if the index shows ‘Fear’ but technical indicators suggest an upward trend, it might indicate a potential accumulation phase before a significant rally. Understand Market Psychology: The index is invaluable for understanding the overall psychology of the market. It helps you detach from emotional decision-making. When fear is high, it’s easy to get caught up in panic selling. The index reminds you to consider the broader market sentiment and make more rational decisions. Bitcoin Dominance and Fear: Is Bitcoin Still the Safe Haven? Bitcoin dominance is another critical factor within the index. During times of market uncertainty and fear , investors often flock to Bitcoin, perceived as the oldest and most established cryptocurrency. An increase in Bitcoin dominance can sometimes correlate with higher fear levels in the broader crypto market. Monitoring Bitcoin dominance alongside the Fear & Greed Index can provide deeper insights into market dynamics. If Bitcoin dominance is rising while the index is in ‘Fear’, it could indicate a flight to safety within the crypto space itself. Conclusion: Staying Informed and Making Wise Decisions in a Fearful Market The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s shift to the ‘Fear’ zone is a noteworthy development. It serves as a reminder of the inherent volatility and emotional nature of the cryptocurrency market. By understanding and utilizing this index, you can gain valuable insights into market sentiment, make more informed investment decisions, and navigate the often turbulent waters of crypto trading with greater confidence. Remember, knowledge is power, especially in the fast-paced world of crypto. Staying informed and adaptable is key to long-term success.

However, weak market participation and low momentum suggest a high probability of continued consolidation and short-term retracements. XRP Price Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart Ripple’s recent impulsive decline has been paused at a significant confluence of support levels, including the 200-day moving average at $1.8, the 0.5–0.618 Fibonacci retracement zone, and the lower boundary of a descending wedge pattern. This zone has acted as a key demand region, temporarily halting the downtrend. Moreover, the emergence of a bullish divergence between the RSI and price action further supports the possibility of a short-term rebound, potentially targeting the wedge’s upper boundary near the 100-day MA at $2.5. However, the broader market environment remains characterised by low activity and weak momentum, suggesting that XRP is likely to continue oscillating within the wedge pattern until a decisive breakout occurs. A valid breakout, either above or below the wedge, could result in significant volatility and liquidation cascades, driving an impulsive move in the breakout’s direction. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, XRP initially broke below both the descending wedge and expanding wedge patterns, triggering a wave of fear and suggesting a bearish continuation. However, this breakdown quickly turned into a false breakout, forming a bear trap as the price bounced back above the broken support levels. Since then, XRP has been gradually retracing toward its prior swing high of $2.2. A successful breach and close above this level would mark a bullish market structure shift, potentially opening the path toward the $2.5 resistance zone. Conversely, failure to break above $2.2 would reaffirm the existing bearish structure, making further downside in the medium term more probable.

This move comes as the exchange eyes a potential collaboration with World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a crypto venture linked to the Trump family, adding a layer of intrigue to Binance’s strategic maneuvers. Is Binance attempting a strategic reset in its relationship with U.S. regulators while simultaneously exploring new business avenues? Let’s dive into the details of this unfolding story. Why is Binance Pushing for Eased Regulatory Oversight ? Binance’s recent meeting with the U.S. Treasury Department signals a clear intent: to recalibrate its operational framework within the U.S. market. This push for reduced regulatory oversight is not happening in isolation. It’s intrinsically linked to Binance’s past missteps and its future ambitions. Here’s a breakdown: Past Challenges: Binance pleaded guilty in 2023 to AML violations, a significant setback that led to increased scrutiny and operational adjustments. Re-entry Strategy: Easing regulatory oversight is crucial for Binance’s aspirations to re-establish a strong presence in the lucrative U.S. market. AML Monitor Removal: A key request from Binance is the removal of the anti-money-laundering (AML) monitor currently overseeing its compliance. This indicates a desire for more operational autonomy. Strategic Timing: This initiative coincides with discussions about a potential business deal with WLFI, suggesting a multi-pronged approach to strengthen its U.S. position. Essentially, Binance is attempting to turn a new page, aiming to demonstrate a commitment to compliance while seeking a more manageable regulatory environment. But is this a feasible strategy, given the heightened regulatory focus on the crypto industry? Crypto Exchange Compliance Under the Microscope: What’s at Stake? The request for reduced oversight comes at a time when crypto exchange compliance is under intense scrutiny globally. Regulators worldwide are tightening their grip on digital asset platforms to combat money laundering, terrorism financing, and protect investors. For Binance, a global giant, demonstrating robust compliance is not just a legal necessity but also a matter of maintaining its reputation and market position. Here are key aspects of crypto exchange compliance that are particularly relevant to Binance’s situation: Compliance Area Significance for Binance Potential Challenges Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Crucial to avoid penalties and maintain operational licenses. Directly related to Binance’s 2023 guilty plea. Implementing and continuously updating AML programs to meet evolving regulatory standards. Know Your Customer (KYC) Essential for verifying user identities and preventing illicit activities. A cornerstone of AML compliance. Balancing stringent KYC procedures with user experience and privacy concerns. Sanctions Compliance Ensuring transactions do not involve sanctioned individuals or entities. Vital for operating in regulated markets. Keeping up with dynamic sanctions lists and implementing effective screening mechanisms. Data Privacy and Security Protecting user data and preventing breaches. Increasingly important under global data protection regulations. Investing in robust cybersecurity infrastructure and adhering to diverse data privacy laws. Binance’s ability to navigate these compliance challenges will significantly impact its future operations and its standing with regulators and users alike. The WLFI Connection: A Trump Family Stablecoin and Potential Profits? The plot thickens with Binance exploring a potential deal with World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a cryptocurrency venture with ties to the Trump family. This connection introduces a political dimension to Binance’s U.S. strategy. The discussions reportedly involve listing WLFI’s dollar-pegged stablecoin , a move that could be financially beneficial for the Trump family. What makes this WLFI stablecoin deal noteworthy? Political Influence: The Trump family’s involvement brings potential political leverage, which could be strategically advantageous for Binance in navigating U.S. regulations. Market Access: Listing a stablecoin associated with a prominent name could attract a new segment of users and increase trading volumes on Binance. Financial Gains: For the Trump family, a successful stablecoin listing on a major exchange like Binance could generate substantial profits and further their foray into the crypto space. Reputational Risks: However, associating with politically charged figures also carries reputational risks, especially given the polarized political climate in the U.S. The potential WLFI stablecoin listing is a high-stakes gamble that could either significantly boost Binance’s U.S. prospects or entangle it in further controversy. The crypto community is keenly observing how this unfolds. Changpeng Zhao (CZ) and the Shadow of the Wall Street Journal Adding another layer of complexity is the statement from former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ). Changpeng Zhao mentioned on X (formerly Twitter) that he anticipates another negative story from The Wall Street Journal. This preemptive statement underscores the ongoing media scrutiny and potential challenges Changpeng Zhao and Binance continue to face. Why is this relevant? Media Narrative: Negative press from a reputable publication like The Wall Street Journal can significantly impact public perception and regulatory sentiment towards Binance. CZ’s Influence: Despite stepping down as CEO, Changpeng Zhao remains a prominent figure in the crypto world and his statements carry weight. Timing Concerns: The timing of a potentially negative WSJ article coinciding with Binance’s regulatory discussions and the WLFI deal could be strategically damaging. Reputational Damage Control: Binance might be preemptively addressing potential negative news to mitigate its impact and control the narrative. Changpeng Zhao’s concerns highlight the intense pressure Binance is under, not just from regulators but also from the media, as it attempts to reshape its image and operations in the U.S. Navigating the Future of Binance in the US: A Calculated Risk? Binance’s current maneuvers – seeking eased Binance US regulation , engaging with WLFI, and bracing for potential negative press – paint a picture of a company at a crossroads. Its efforts to reduce regulatory oversight are ambitious and fraught with challenges. The outcome will depend on a complex interplay of regulatory decisions, business deals, and public perception. Key Takeaways: Binance’s attempt to ease Binance US regulation is a strategic priority for re-entering the U.S. market. Crypto exchange compliance remains a critical hurdle for Binance and the entire industry. The potential WLFI stablecoin deal introduces both opportunities and risks, including political and reputational considerations. Changpeng Zhao’s anticipation of negative press underscores the ongoing scrutiny Binance faces. Ultimately, Binance’s journey in the U.S. is a high-stakes game with uncertain outcomes. The crypto world watches intently to see if Binance can successfully navigate these turbulent waters and secure a stable foothold in the American market.

The new timeline is now set for May 2025, stretching an already long wait even further. For users who’ve been hoping to get their money back soon, this news comes as yet another setback. The platform mentioned internal reasons for the delay but didn’t share any clear details. That silence is stirring up fresh worry, with many in the crypto community wondering if the exchange will actually follow through. So what’s really going on behind the scenes? Let’s break it down. Nischal Shetty Responds nischal shetty nischal shetty Nischal Shetty is the Founder of India's largest and extremely trusted crypto exchange platform called WazirX. He is an entrepreneur who is passionate about technology, blockchain, crypto, and innovation. Founded WazirX in 2018 with a mission to involve every Indian in the blooming Blockchain revolution, built along with a team of passionate blockchain believers and hardcore traders.

Entrepreneur Developer/Programmer Chief Executive Officer Author , co-founder of both WazirX and blockchain project Shardeum, responded to the growing concerns about the delay. In a post on X, Shetty called the rumors surrounding the situation baseless FUD – short for fear, uncertainty, and doubt – and reassured the community that the process is still going according to plan. There’s some FUD claiming that the WazirX fund distribution is delayed. It was previously communicated that the next step after the vote is to seek court sanction of the scheme. Court hearing is scheduled for 13th May. We’re on track and fully focused. Please ignore the noise,… — Nischal (Shardeum) (@NischalShetty) April 11, 2025 The Next Step Before Funds Are Released The confusion seems to be caused by a misunderstanding of the process. Many users believed that funds would start being distributed immediately after the recent user vote. However, Shetty pointed out that the next official step is getting approval from the court for the distribution plan. That hearing is scheduled for May 13. Until the court gives the green light, WazirX cannot move forward with releasing the funds. Timeline Is Still on Track, Says Shetty Shetty stressed that nothing has been pushed back or delayed. The current timeline is still in place, and the legal process is a necessary part of making sure the funds are handled properly. It also helps protect both WazirX and its users. He encouraged the community to ignore online speculation and stay focused on the facts. Trust at Stake After Binance Split WazirX has faced its share of difficulties, especially after its public split from Binance Binance - binance@miceneurol.com Centralised Exchange Cryptocurrencies Trading App Cryptocurrency investment . This fund distribution has become a major step in the exchange’s effort to rebuild trust with its user base. Shetty once again highlighted the team’s commitment to being transparent and keeping the community updated throughout the process. Appreciate the update. However, it’s crucial for WazirX to focus on swift and transparent fund distribution without any undue delays or excuses. Customers are closely watching — even if they’re not making much noise right now. Trust is everything, especially if there are future… — FLORA ECO DINE (@Floraecodine) April 12, 2025 Why It Matters A lawful and orderly execution of the fund distribution plan is not just important for WazirX users; it also sets an example for how Indian crypto exchanges can operate under legal oversight. The outcome could influence broader sentiment around the Indian crypto ecosystem, which has been under increasing regulatory scrutiny. For now, Shetty’s message is clear: everything is still on track, and users need to stay patient and confident. The next important date is May 13, when the court will review the distribution plan. Until then, the WazirX team says it will stay focused and continue sharing updates with the community. May will likely be the month that defines WazirX’s future – one way or another. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

A groundbreaking new cryptocurrency survey has just dropped, revealing some truly astonishing insights into how Americans are engaging with digital assets. Forget the naysayers – the numbers are in, and they paint a vibrant picture of growing acceptance and positive experiences in the crypto space. Let’s dive into the details of this eye-opening study and explore what it means for the future of finance. Astonishing Crypto Ownership Statistics: One in Five Americans Now Holds Digital Assets The headline figure from this massive cryptocurrency survey is simply staggering: 21% of adult Americans now own cryptocurrency. That’s more than one in five people! This data, unearthed by The Harris Poll in a study commissioned by the U.S. National Cryptocurrency Association and highlighted by CryptoSlate, showcases the significant strides digital currencies have made in mainstream acceptance. With a whopping 53,805 participants, this poll isn’t just large – it’s the largest cryptocurrency survey of its kind ever conducted, giving us an unprecedentedly clear view of the landscape. Let’s break down some of the key demographics revealed by this extensive research: Age is a Major Factor: The youth are leading the charge into the crypto revolution. A significant 67% of cryptocurrency holders are under the age of 45. This indicates a strong correlation between younger generations and the adoption of new financial technologies. However, it’s not just a young person’s game – a notable 15% of crypto owners are over 55, suggesting a broadening appeal across age groups. Gender Distribution: While the crypto space is often perceived as male-dominated, the survey reveals a more nuanced picture. 67% of holders are male, while 31% are female. This points towards a growing, though still evolving, gender balance within the cryptocurrency community. There’s clearly room for further growth in female participation, and initiatives promoting inclusivity will be crucial. The Positive Impact of Crypto: A Resounding 76% Report Enhanced Financial Well-being Beyond just ownership numbers, the survey delves into the crucial question of impact. And the results are overwhelmingly positive. A remarkable 76% of cryptocurrency holders reported that digital assets have had a positive impact on their personal lives. This figure is a powerful testament to the perceived benefits and value that individuals are deriving from their crypto investments and involvement. But what exactly constitutes this positive impact ? While the survey doesn’t detail specific reasons, we can infer several potential factors based on common motivations for cryptocurrency adoption: Financial Empowerment: Cryptocurrencies offer individuals greater control over their finances, bypassing traditional intermediaries. For many, this sense of empowerment is a significant positive. Investment Opportunities: The potential for high returns in the cryptocurrency market is a major draw. For those who have seen their investments grow, the financial gains undoubtedly contribute to a positive impact . Technological Innovation: Many crypto enthusiasts are drawn to the underlying technology and its potential to revolutionize various industries beyond just finance. Being part of this technological evolution can be inherently rewarding. Community and Learning: The cryptocurrency community is vibrant and engaged. For many, the sense of belonging and the continuous learning opportunities contribute to a positive overall experience. Understanding Crypto Adoption: What’s Driving the Surge? The rise in crypto adoption is not happening in a vacuum. Several factors are likely contributing to this increasing trend: Increased Awareness and Education: Media coverage, online resources, and educational platforms are making cryptocurrencies more accessible and understandable to the general public. As knowledge grows, so does comfort and willingness to participate. Growing Institutional Interest: Major financial institutions and corporations are increasingly entering the crypto space, lending legitimacy and attracting a wider range of investors. This institutional validation helps to alleviate concerns about risk and volatility. Technological Advancements: Improvements in blockchain technology, user-friendly wallets, and easier on-ramps for purchasing crypto are making it simpler than ever for individuals to get involved. Inflationary Concerns: In times of economic uncertainty and rising inflation, some individuals are turning to cryptocurrencies as a potential hedge against traditional currency devaluation. Navigating the Digital Asset Landscape: Actionable Insights for Newcomers and Veterans Alike Whether you’re a crypto newbie or a seasoned veteran, understanding these trends is crucial. Here are some actionable insights to consider: For Beginners: Do your research! Start with reputable educational resources to understand the basics of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Begin with small investments and gradually increase your exposure as you become more comfortable. Consider using user-friendly platforms with robust security features. For Experienced Holders: Stay informed about regulatory developments and market trends. Diversify your portfolio and consider exploring different types of digital assets beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. Engage with the community and continue to learn and adapt in this rapidly evolving space. For Everyone: Be aware of the risks associated with cryptocurrency investing. Volatility is inherent in the market, and it’s essential to invest responsibly and only with funds you can afford to lose. Prioritize security and protect your private keys. The Future is Digital: Embracing the Crypto Revolution This cryptocurrency survey provides compelling evidence that digital assets are no longer a niche phenomenon. They are becoming an increasingly integrated part of the American financial landscape, with a significant portion of the population not only owning crypto but also experiencing tangible positive impact . As awareness, education, and technological infrastructure continue to improve, we can expect to see further growth in crypto adoption and integration into everyday life. The crypto revolution is not just on the horizon – it’s already here, and it’s reshaping the future of finance in profound ways.

Businesses in South Korea and the United States are now accepting the token for everyday transactions. This highlights Pi Network’s growing presence in the digital economy. Curious to know more? Read on! Pi Coin Adoption Explodes: Korean Retailers and US Realty Firm Now Accept Payments Pi is no more a mere crypto, which is confined to the limited space of trading or speculation. Reports reveal that Pi Coin is now being used for real payments. According to reports, retailers, particularly skincare stores, in South Korea, have started accepting Pi Coin as a form of payment . Earlier, there were rumours that Asian retailers were considering various possibilities of using Pi Coin as a form of payment. It appears that the trend is not limited to Asia. In the US state of Florida, Zito Realty , a renowned real estate company, has announced its decision to accept payments in Pi Coin, note reports. Florida is known for its pro-crypto stance. Recently, Florida’s Insurance and Banking Subcommittee cleared a bill advocating the creation of a state-level Bitcoin reserve . This is the first state Bicoin reserve bill to pass the House committee with zero votes against it. Fintech Platforms Like Banxa Simplify Pi Access Fintech platform Banxa has begun offering Pi Coin through cards and digital wallets. This makes it easier for regular users to buy and use Pi. Recently, Banxa purchased no fewer than 30.5 million Pi Coins , worth nearly $19 million. By allowing direct buying and selling, the platform is supporting the transformation of Pi into a currency with real market value. Technical Outlook: What Price Charts Say About Pi Coin Even though when Pi intally hit the market, it created extreme excitement, with a 2,524% growth within seven days of its launch, since February 27, the price of the token has slipped over 76.65%. Currently, the price stands at $0.6575 – around 552.183% above where the price was on February 20 (the day that the token hit the market). Anyway, in the last seven days, Pi has seen a surge of 42%. In the last 24 hours alone, the price has grown over 10.3%. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : New Pi Network Ad System Lets Developers Earn Pi Through In-App Crypto Ads , The RSI of Pi stands at 42.84.

Lightchain AI is rapidly gaining traction, raising an impressive $18.7 million during its presale, with tokens priced at just $0.007. While DOGE thrives on its meme-driven popularity, Lightchain AI stands out with a forward-thinking ecosystem that combines blockchain technology and artificial intelligence. With tangible real-world applications and strong early backing, Lightchain AI is emerging as a serious contender, poised to rival DOGE in the next bull market. DOGE Shows Signs of Another Big Move in 2025 ​Dogecoin (DOGE) is looking poised for similar trends from previous bullish cycles, which in 2025 may introduce the possibility of a huge price surge. It is noted by analysts that DOGE is generally structured in a ""rounding bottom"" way, that historically mostly ends in parabolic rallies. A number of reports show a 100% likelihood of a continued bullish price movement if DOGE keeps its support levels. Price predictions for 2025 may take a wide range, from cautious ones to those forecasting prices between $0.26 and $0.35 the most probable ones. The possibilities, though, have to be taken with a grain of salt as launching ventures with the native volatility of the cryptocurrency market can be risky for investors, so do expect me to be wary.​ New Projects Are Gaining Ground Fast Against Meme Coins While meme coins rely on hype, new utility-driven projects like Lightchain AI are quickly gaining ground with real-world value. Lightchain AI goes beyond speculation by offering a decentralized infrastructure for AI execution, complete with parallelized task processing and low-latency performance.

The latest spark? Reports suggesting that Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the former CEO of Binance, implicated Justin Sun, the founder of TRON, in alleged criminal activity . This news sent ripples through the crypto community, leaving many wondering about the truth behind these claims and the potential fallout. But fear not, crypto enthusiasts! Justin Sun has stepped into the spotlight to address these rumors head-on. Justin Sun Responds to Shocking Allegations Justin Sun , known for his active presence on social media and direct engagement with the crypto community, didn’t keep us waiting. Responding to the swirling reports, Sun took to X (formerly Twitter) to issue a statement. His message was clear: he was unaware of these circulating rumors and expressed surprise at the implications. Let’s break down Justin Sun’s key points in his response: Denial of Awareness: Sun stated he was “unaware of the circulating rumors,” suggesting that the reports came as news to him. Defense of CZ: He described CZ as a “mentor and close friend,” emphasizing their positive relationship and CZ’s support throughout his entrepreneurial journey. This is a significant point, as it paints a picture of camaraderie rather than animosity or betrayal. Trust in DOJ: Justin Sun highlighted the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) as a “trusted partner” in global efforts to protect users. This is a strategic move, positioning himself and CZ within a framework of cooperation with regulatory bodies. Transparent Communication: Sun asserted that he maintains “direct and transparent communication” with both CZ and the DOJ. This suggests openness and a willingness to cooperate, aiming to dispel any notions of secrecy or evasion. Here’s Justin Sun’s response in his own words, as shared on X: I am unaware of the circulating rumors, and CZ is and always will be my mentor and close friend. I have always admired his entrepreneurial journey and his advice and support has been invaluable to me over the years. I also want to emphasize that the US Department of Justice has… — H.E. Justin Sun 孙宇晨 (@justinsuntron) December 12, 2023 The Allegations: What Did CZ Allegedly Say? So, what exactly are these “circulating rumors” that Justin Sun is addressing? The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported that Changpeng Zhao (CZ) , as part of his plea deal related to anti-money-laundering violations, agreed to provide evidence on Sun to U.S. prosecutors. This is a serious claim, suggesting that CZ might have implicated Justin Sun in potential wrongdoing as part of his legal agreement. Let’s break down the context: CZ’s Plea Deal: Changpeng Zhao (CZ) recently stepped down as Binance CEO and pleaded guilty to anti-money-laundering violations. This in itself is a significant event in the crypto world, given Binance’s position as a leading exchange. WSJ Report: The Wall Street Journal, a reputable financial publication, reported that CZ’s plea deal included an agreement to provide evidence against Justin Sun . Nature of Evidence: The exact nature of the evidence CZ allegedly agreed to provide remains unclear. It’s important to note that “evidence” doesn’t automatically equate to guilt or criminal charges. It simply means information that prosecutors might find relevant to an investigation. Anti-Money Laundering Focus: CZ’s plea deal was related to anti-money-laundering violations. If the alleged evidence against Justin Sun is linked to similar issues, it could have serious implications for Sun and TRON. Why Would CZ Implicate Justin Sun in Criminal Activity? This is the million-dollar question. Why would Changpeng Zhao (CZ) , described by Justin Sun as a “mentor and close friend,” potentially implicate him in criminal activity ? Several possibilities could be at play: Legal Strategy: In plea deals, it’s common for prosecutors to seek information on other potential wrongdoers. Providing information on Justin Sun could have been a strategic move by CZ to secure a more favorable plea agreement for himself. Genuine Concerns: It’s also possible that CZ has genuine concerns about Justin Sun’s activities and felt compelled to share information with authorities. We can only speculate about the internal dynamics and motivations at play. Regulatory Pressure: Both Binance and TRON have faced regulatory scrutiny in the past. Increased pressure from regulatory bodies could be leading to heightened scrutiny and a desire to cooperate with investigations. It’s crucial to remember that these are just potential explanations. Without more information, the exact reasons behind the alleged implication remain speculative. What are the Potential Implications for Justin Sun and TRON? The reports of Changpeng Zhao (CZ) implicating Justin Sun in criminal activity , even if just allegations at this stage, could have significant implications for both Justin Sun and the TRON ecosystem. Potential Challenges for Justin Sun and TRON: Challenge Description Reputational Damage Even allegations of criminal activity can tarnish Justin Sun’s reputation and the image of TRON. This can impact investor confidence and user trust. Regulatory Scrutiny Increased scrutiny from regulatory bodies is highly likely if U.S. authorities are indeed investigating Justin Sun based on CZ’s alleged evidence. Legal Battles Depending on the nature of the investigation and any potential charges, Justin Sun could face costly and time-consuming legal battles. Impact on TRON Ecosystem Negative news surrounding Justin Sun can indirectly impact the TRON ecosystem, potentially affecting the price of TRX and the adoption of TRON-based projects. However, it’s also important to consider that Justin Sun has a history of navigating challenges and controversies. His prompt and public response, emphasizing his relationship with CZ and cooperation with the DOJ, suggests a proactive approach to managing this situation. Actionable Insights: What Should Crypto Users and Investors Do? In times of uncertainty like these, it’s essential for crypto users and investors to remain informed and exercise caution. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with credible news sources regarding this developing situation. Follow reputable crypto news outlets and financial publications for the latest updates. Exercise Caution: Consider the potential implications for TRON and TRX. If you hold TRX or are involved in TRON-based projects, be aware of the potential volatility and risks associated with negative news. Diversify Your Portfolio: As always, diversification is key in the crypto market. Avoid putting all your eggs in one basket, especially when uncertainty looms around a particular project or individual. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t rely solely on rumors or social media buzz. Conduct thorough research and due diligence before making any investment decisions. Understand the risks involved and invest responsibly. A Waiting Game: What Happens Next? For now, we are in a waiting game. Justin Sun has denied awareness of the rumors and defended his relationship with Changpeng Zhao (CZ) . The truth behind CZ’s alleged evidence and the DOJ’s potential investigation remains to be seen. The crypto community will be watching closely for further developments in this unfolding saga. Will this be a minor blip, or will it escalate into a major challenge for Justin Sun and TRON? Only time will tell. In conclusion, the reports of Changpeng Zhao (CZ) implicating Justin Sun in alleged criminal activity have injected a dose of drama into the crypto world. Justin Sun’s swift response attempts to quell the rumors and maintain a positive narrative. However, the underlying allegations and potential regulatory implications warrant close attention. As this story develops, staying informed and exercising caution will be paramount for crypto enthusiasts and investors alike.

This could be a short term relief framework for digital assets that could allow both registered and unregistered crypto firms to innovate while the agency frames permanent solutions. She clarified that a regulatory sandbox allows the market participants to test new ideas without fully following the current laws for a limited times. This lets them innovate without fear of lawsuits while regulators work on better rules. “It’s what the prior administration could have done but instead they chose to sue companies for not being compliant,” she remarked. Uyeda Calls for Unified Crypto Rules Uyeda’s opening remarks suggested that crypto firms could benefit more from a unified federal framework instead of multiple state licensing rules. He proposed for temporary exemptions and asked for feedback while rules are developed. “While the Commission works to develop a long-term solution to address these issues, a time-limited, conditional exemptive relief framework for registrants and non-registrants could allow for greater innovation with blockchain technology within the United States in the near term,” the agency stated. The agency emphasized that it would support short term innovation in blockchain-based securities trading and is inviting market participants who are developing ways to trade securities using blockchain, to suggest where such exemptions could help. It is waiting for the Congress to pass a crypto market-structure law which would then allow it to draft rules for the digital asset market. While lawmakers believe this could happen as soon as this year, it will still take more time after that for the SEC and other relevant agencies to write and enforce the actual regulations. Uyeda pointed out that existing crypto platforms were capable of offering both tokenized securities and non-security tokens and the new platforms could offer 24/7 activity. Experts Urge Tailored Crypto Rules Experts noted that the current rules don’t fit crypto and called for new ones for problems specific to blockchains, decentralized trading, and existing crypto trading. Panelists also raised concerns about high-speed trading and lack of position disclosure in crypto and noted that the unregulated nature of multiple markets enables front-running and hidden activities. At the SEC’s second crypto roundtable, Uyeda and SEC Commisioner Hester Peirce highlighted that many crypto platforms are interested in operating both SEC regulated activities and those that don’t fall under the agency’s scope, together. Incoming Chair Paul Atkins is expected to continue the agency’s evolving approach to digital assets. Peirce stressed that SEC and the Congresss need to fill the gaps in crypto regulations as more firms mix securities and non-securities trading. The agency’s next roundtables will cover custody rules on April 25, tokenization and TradFi-DeFi crossover on May 12, and DeFi challenges in the U.S. on June 6. The SEC recently issued new guidance for companies dealing with crypto assets that are deemed to be securities. It stressed the need for clear disclosures about the business, risks and financial details to better inform the investors.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-12 08:54:58

POL Price Prediction Potential low Potential average Potential high POL Price Prediction April 2025 $0.17 $0.28 $0.35 POL price prediction 2025 Ethereum fees increase dramatically during a bull market, making it too expensive for regular cryptocurrency users. That’s why Polygon became popular during the last bull market. But this time, in 2025, Polygon has tougher competition from Arbitrum, Optimism, and Starknet. However, Polygon’s Proof of Stake (PoS) chain can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) and is cheaper than chains like Arbitrum and Optimism. Hence, increasing adoption might drive up its price in 2025. In 2025, the price of Polygon is forecasted to reach a minimum level of $0.15. It’s anticipated to achieve a maximum level of $1.57, with an average price of $1.39 throughout the year.

AAVE faces hurdles as it attempts to regain lost ground. Meanwhile, XYZverse is nearing a significant achievement with its presale edging toward the $13 million mark. This article examines these developments and their potential impact on the market. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it’s attracting both sports fans and crypto enthusiasts, creating a unique crossover that’s gaining serious traction. With a strong presale and an engaged community, some investors are already eyeing major potential gains. More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.003333 by Stage 12, with over 70% of the $15 million milestone already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a final presale target price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” Of course, in crypto, nothing is guaranteed, but the excitement is undeniable. Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. By bringing together traditional sports fans and the fast-moving crypto space, XYZVerse is building something different—something with entertainment value and real engagement. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Terra Classic (LUNC): A New Chapter in Digital Payments Terra Classic (LUNC) is a cryptocurrency that builds on the original Terra blockchain. Terra was created to make global payments faster and more affordable by using stablecoins tied to traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar and South Korean won. Launched in 2019, it combined the stability of regular money with the security of blockchain technology. In May 2022, the original Terra chain was renamed Terra Classic, and its native token became LUNA Classic (LUNC). LUNC aims to continue Terra’s vision of easy and stable global transactions. It supports stablecoins that help keep prices steady, making it useful for everyday payments. In today’s market, where many cryptocurrencies are volatile, LUNC’s focus on stability sets it apart. While new coins and technologies are emerging, LUNC offers a proven platform that could appeal to those interested in practical uses of cryptocurrency. As the crypto world grows and changes, LUNC remains a noteworthy option in the quest for accessible and reliable digital payments. Aave: A New Way to Lend and Borrow Cryptocurrency Aave is changing how people think about money and loans. It’s a place on the Ethereum network where you can lend or borrow digital money without needing a bank. Everything is managed by computer programs called smart contracts, so you don’t have to trust a company—just the code. Aave works with 17 different kinds of cryptocurrencies. When you lend your crypto, you get special tokens called aTokens that show how much you’ve lent and help you earn interest. One of the most exciting things about Aave is something called flash loans. These are quick loans that don’t need any security deposit, but you have to pay them back right away, in the same transaction. This takes advantage of how fast the Ethereum network works. There’s also a token named AAVE that’s important to how everything runs. If you hold AAVE, you get benefits like paying lower fees and helping decide how Aave changes in the future. You can even stake your AAVE tokens to help keep the system safe. Right now, with more people interested in decentralized finance, Aave’s easy-to-use system and special features make it stand out among other cryptocurrencies. Conclusion LUNC and AAVE show promise, but XYZVerse, the first all-sport memecoin, unites sports fans globally and targets 20,000% growth with its community-driven ecosystem.

The post, which was shared on April 10, 2025, outlines several possibilities for the digital asset’s short-term direction, with particular emphasis on the price’s current position relative to key structural levels. The chart is paired with Elliott Wave labeling, suggesting the potential start of a strong impulsive move if specific conditions are met. There are a few different scenarios that can play out on $XRP here, and it will be dependent to some extent on what $BTC does in the coming days, but this would be the most bullish scenario that I am keeping an eye out for. We are at the POB (point of breakdown) that took us… https://t.co/pq97wV41Z9 pic.twitter.com/XEKWvK2L0e — CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) April 10, 2025 In his commentary, CrediBULL Crypto identifies that XRP is currently situated at the “POB,” or Point of Breakdown, which previously marked the level at which the asset lost its hold on a key range and fell into what he terms the “key BUY ZONE,” represented in green on the chart. CrediBULL notes that should XRP break above this POB level “impulsively,” it would represent a “fantastic sign” for bulls. His annotated chart shows a potential five-wave impulse to the upside, indicating that such a breakout could lead to an aggressive rally. The projection in his chart sees a possible push past the $2.00 level, moving through the red resistance zone, with wave counts labeling a possible path toward $2.75. Elliott Wave Structure Suggests a Developing Impulse The visual analysis includes a labeled Elliott Wave count that started from the recent low in the green zone. CrediBULL has outlined the beginning of a potential five-wave impulsive structure, marking the formation of wave i and a possible retracement into wave ii. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 If wave ii concludes without breaking the prior low and XRP reclaims the POB with strength, the expected wave iii could begin. This would be followed by a brief corrective wave iv and a final push to wave v, completing the impulse move. Market Conditions and Bitcoin’s Influence Remain Central While the focus is clearly on XRP, CrediBULL Crypto openly states that the success of this bullish outlook will “depend to some extent on what $BTC does in the coming days.” This acknowledgement reflects a broader market sentiment, where altcoins often react to Bitcoin’s price movements . Should Bitcoin remain stable or continue its upward trend, the probability of a bullish breakout for XRP increases. Should Bitcoin enter a sharp correction, XRP may follow suit and revisit the green buy zone. In response to a community member’s question regarding this downside possibility, CrediBULL confirmed that if such a scenario occurs, he would expect “a larger base to form there,” suggesting the possibility of prolonged consolidation rather than a complete breakdown. Key Levels to Watch as XRP Approaches Inflection Point At the time of the tweet, XRP was trading around $1.96. The POB sits slightly above this level, and a breakout beyond it would indicate a shift in sentiment. The red zone from roughly $2.00 to $2.20 represents near-term resistance, while the green zone from $1.50 to $1.80 remains the identified support area for further retracement. CrediBULL Crypto’s latest analysis positions XRP at a critical decision point where a new bullish impulse may begin or further base-building may be required. The outcome in the days ahead will depend heavily on reclaiming key technical levels and the overall state of the cryptocurrency market.

The digital asset world is once again under the spotlight, but this time, it’s not about soaring prices or the next big DeFi innovation. We’re diving into a serious legal drama unfolding in Taiwan, involving the crypto platform Steaker. Get ready to unpack the details of a shocking crypto scheme indictment that has sent ripples through the industry. What’s the Shocking News About Steaker and the Crypto Scheme? In a development that has caught the attention of investors and regulators alike, Taiwanese prosecutors have officially indicted four top executives from the digital asset management platform, Steaker . Among those facing charges is the very founder of the company. The allegations are serious: raising a staggering NT$1.48 billion – that’s about $45.8 million USD – through what authorities are calling illegal cryptocurrency investment schemes. This alleged operation spanned a three-year period, casting a long shadow over the platform and its dealings. According to reports from the United Daily News and confirmed by the Taipei District Prosecutors Office, Steaker is in hot water for allegedly operating an unauthorized deposit-taking business. This is a violation of Taiwan’s Banking Act, adding a layer of legal complexity to the already concerning situation. But what exactly did Steaker allegedly do to land themselves in such trouble? Diving Deeper: Unpacking the Alleged Illegal Cryptocurrency Investment Scheme While details are still emerging, the core of the accusation revolves around Steaker’s operation as an unauthorized deposit-taking entity. But what does this mean in the context of a crypto scheme ? Let’s break it down: Unauthorized Deposit Taking: The charges suggest Steaker may have been operating like a bank without the necessary licenses. In many jurisdictions, including Taiwan, accepting deposits from the public is a regulated activity requiring specific authorization. Investment Schemes Under Scrutiny: The indictment points to “illegal cryptocurrency investment schemes.” This suggests that the prosecutors believe Steaker offered investment products or services that were not compliant with local financial regulations. Significant Sum Involved: The NT$1.48 billion figure is substantial. It indicates a large number of investors may have been affected, and the scale of the alleged operation is considerable. Multi-Year Operation: The fact that this alleged activity spanned three years suggests a systematic and potentially long-term strategy, rather than a one-off incident. To understand the gravity, imagine entrusting your funds to a platform promising lucrative returns, only to find out later that the entire operation might be deemed illegal. This is the kind of scenario investors in Steaker may be facing, and it underscores the critical importance of regulatory compliance in the crypto space. Why is Taiwan Taking Such a Strong Stance on Crypto Schemes? Taiwan , like many other jurisdictions globally, is grappling with how to regulate the burgeoning cryptocurrency market. This indictment of Steaker executives can be seen as part of a broader trend of increasing regulatory scrutiny worldwide. Several factors might be at play: Investor Protection: A primary concern for regulators is safeguarding the public from financial scams and risky investment schemes. The crypto market, with its volatility and complexity, can be particularly vulnerable to such activities. Financial Stability: Unregulated financial activities can pose risks to the overall financial system. Governments are keen to ensure that the growth of the crypto market doesn’t destabilize the economy. Combating Illicit Activities: Cryptocurrencies have been sometimes associated with money laundering and other illicit activities. Strong regulatory frameworks are seen as essential to mitigate these risks. Setting a Precedent: The action against Steaker could be a signal from Taiwanese authorities that they are serious about enforcing financial regulations in the crypto space and will not tolerate unauthorized operations. This case serves as a stark reminder that while the crypto world offers exciting opportunities, it also comes with significant risks and regulatory complexities. For investors, understanding the legal and regulatory landscape is just as crucial as understanding the technology and market dynamics. What Does This Indictment Mean for Steaker Users and the Wider Crypto Market? The immediate impact is undoubtedly felt by Steaker users who may be uncertain about the future of their investments. The indictment raises serious questions about the platform’s operations and the security of user funds. For the wider crypto market, this event has several implications: Increased Regulatory Focus: We can expect to see even greater attention from regulators in Taiwan and potentially other countries on cryptocurrency platforms and their compliance with financial laws. Due Diligence is Paramount: For investors, this case underscores the absolute necessity of conducting thorough due diligence before investing in any crypto platform. Understanding the regulatory standing of a platform should be a key part of this process. Reputational Damage: Incidents like this can damage the overall reputation of the crypto industry, reinforcing negative perceptions and potentially hindering broader adoption. Call for Clearer Regulations: While enforcement is crucial, the industry also needs clear and well-defined regulations. Ambiguity can create confusion and make it difficult for legitimate businesses to operate compliantly. Actionable Insights: How to Navigate the Risky Waters of Crypto Investments The Steaker situation, while concerning, provides valuable lessons for anyone involved in or considering entering the cryptocurrency space. Here are some actionable insights to keep in mind: Actionable Insight Description Research Platform Compliance Before investing in any crypto platform, thoroughly investigate its regulatory compliance. Does it operate within legal frameworks? Are they transparent about their licenses and registrations? Understand Investment Risks Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile and risky. Never invest more than you can afford to lose, and be wary of platforms promising unrealistically high returns. Diversify Your Holdings Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversifying your crypto portfolio across different assets and platforms can help mitigate risk. Stay Informed About Regulations Keep up-to-date with the evolving regulatory landscape in your jurisdiction and globally. Regulations can significantly impact the crypto market. Seek Professional Advice If you’re unsure about the complexities of crypto investments or regulations, consult with a qualified financial advisor. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for the Crypto Industry? The indictment of Steaker executives in Taiwan over an alleged $45.8 million crypto scheme is more than just a legal case; it’s a potential wake-up call for the entire cryptocurrency industry. It underscores the critical need for robust regulatory compliance, investor protection, and responsible platform operations. As the crypto market matures, events like this will likely become more frequent, highlighting the ongoing tension between innovation and regulation. For investors, the key takeaway is clear: vigilance, due diligence, and a healthy dose of skepticism are essential when navigating the exciting but often treacherous waters of illegal cryptocurrency investment and the broader digital asset landscape.

In a recent interview with Financial Times , Collins assured that the Federal Reserve has tools at its disposal to address sudden liquidity crunches or dysfunctions in market operations. While she emphasized there is no cause for alarm yet, her comments come as investors grow uneasy over a wave of asset selloffs hitting both stocks and bonds . As a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), Collins’ remarks carry significant weight. The committee, which steers interest rate policy in the U.S., has already taken a softer stance this year by slowing its pace of quantitative tightening. In March, it reduced the cap on Treasury redemptions by a staggering 80%, a clear signal that the Fed is willing to pivot to preserve market health if necessary. Bitcoin Fate Tied to Dollar Liquidity What happens next with Fed policy won’t just sway equities or bond markets — it’s also likely to impact the cryptocurrency space, particularly Bitcoin. A growing body of research suggests that BTC price is more sensitive to global liquidity conditions than even its own underlying network fundamentals. A 2024 study from Kingston University professors J. Miao and Jinsha Zhao concluded that U.S. dollar liquidity has become a major driver of BTC price action, especially in the post-pandemic era. Their analysis found that liquidity conditions accounted for over 65% of BTC price movement — an eye-opening figure that reinforces Bitcoin’s growing correlation with broader macroeconomic currents. Macro Winds May Stir the Crypto Market Echoing this sentiment, macroeconomist Lyn Alden dubbed Bitcoin a “global liquidity barometer.” She pointed out that trends in global M2 — a broad money supply measure — often precede shifts in BTC’s trajectory. The early March uptick in global liquidity and signs of a reviving business cycle could suggest a favorable setup for BTC heading into Q2. If history holds, easing liquidity from central banks could recharge risk assets, including digital currencies. As the Fed watches markets with a cautious eye and investors search for direction, Bitcoin appears to be waiting on its cue — one that could come not from a blockchain upgrade, but from the shifting tone of global monetary policy.

Speaking at an event in Hot Springs, Arkansas, Musalem warned that recent economic and policy developments, including trade and fiscal changes, could lead to a dual challenge of rising prices and weakening employment. That risk, once seen as a less likely outcome, is now “closer to the bottom line,” he said. “Uncertainty about the net impact and timing of new trade, immigration, fiscal and regulatory policies on prices, employment and economic activity is high,” Musalem said. “A scenario in which inflation rises and the labour market softens at the same time is a distinct possibility that must be considered.” Musalem said it was important to keep long-term inflation expectations stable and called for incoming data to continue to be closely monitored. “I believe it remains appropriate for monetary policy to remain cautious, carefully monitor incoming data and comprehensively assess the outlook and risks to employment and inflation,” Musalem said. Musalem's comments come as some Fed officials have signaled they are willing to keep interest rates steady in the face of potential inflationary pressures, particularly those linked to tariffs resulting from President Donald Trump's policies. Musalem said he expects the current economic expansion to continue, though likely at a slower pace. He cited falling stock prices and tightening financial conditions, including widening credit spreads, as factors that could drag on growth if they continue. He also reiterated concerns that some tariff-related price increases could have lasting effects and that the Fed may need to counter those effects with policy moves. However, he acknowledged the difficulty of detecting such effects in real time. Related News: Donald Trump's Cryptocurrency Project Responds to Allegations of Dumping Large Amounts of Altcoins “It may be appropriate to guard against a second round of inflationary effects,” Musalem said, noting that most long-term inflation expectations remain close to the Fed’s 2% target, but a University of Michigan survey showed signs of increasing concerns. Americans expect average prices to rise 4.4% over the next five to 10 years, the most since 1991, according to data released Friday. Short-term price growth expectations also rose to 6.7%, the highest since 1981. “The combination of high economic policy uncertainty, tighter financial conditions and retaliation by trading partners to US tariffs poses downside risks to economic growth and employment,” Musalem concluded. “Ensuring that inflation expectations are well anchored provides a balanced approach to monetary policy with an appropriate focus on the maximum employment side of the task.” New York Fed President John Williams said that U.S. economic growth is expected to slow significantly due to tariff policies and reduced immigration, and that real GDP growth is likely to fall below 1%. Williams also predicted that unemployment will rise to between 4.5% and 5% next year, while inflation will rise to between 3.5% and 4%. *This is not investment advice.

Crypto analyst Oscar Ramos brought attention to the interview, highlighting key takeaways that suggest XRP could be gearing up for a breakout year in 2025. The interview underscored Ripple’s expanding role in the global financial ecosystem and reaffirmed its long-term vision for XRP. IF You OWN $XRP You are prob gonna love this – Ripple CEO has MASSIVE News for You – Fox Business wants an XRP Prediction – Brad Gives a Bitcoin Prediction – The game is set, #XRP will SOAR in 2025 – You need more XRP ASAP – Crypto will make Millionaires pic.twitter.com/0zXvlSTbbq — Oscar Ramos (@realOscarRamos1) April 12, 2025 Ripple CEO’s Message on Fox Business Garlinghouse did not hold back his optimism for XRP and the broader crypto space in the Fox Business segment. He emphasized Ripple’s strong positioning amid shifting regulatory dynamics and expanding global adoption. According to him, the company is finally seeing the momentum it has been building toward for years, especially with regulatory clarity in key markets like the U.S. becoming more plausible. Garlinghouse clarified that XRP is not just another speculative asset but a cornerstone of Ripple’s cross-border payments infrastructure . With increasing institutional interest and integration across major financial corridors, XRP is on track to fulfill its utility-first mission. Mainstream Attention Meets Market Momentum Ripple’s CEO’s appearance on Fox Business sends a strong message that mainstream finance is taking XRP seriously, reflecting the company’s growing influence in discussions about the future of money. Garlinghouse’s appearance marked a major PR win for the project, reaffirming that Ripple is not just part of the crypto world but an active player in the global financial conversation. Oscar Ramos captured the sentiment well in his X post, noting how the interview hinted that the “game is set” and that XRP may be preparing for a significant leg up as the next market cycle takes shape. Bitcoin Forecast and XRP’s Utility Advantage During the same interview, Garlinghouse also gave a noteworthy forecast on Bitcoin, affirming its role as a digital store of value. However, he pointed out that tokens with real-world utility, like XRP, will drive the next wave of adoption. While Bitcoin may continue to be seen as digital gold, XRP’s role as a liquidity bridge in global payments gives it a unique edge—one that traditional finance institutions are starting to recognize and adopt.

With the dust beginning to settle from Ripple’s long-standing battle with the SEC and positive regulatory developments on the horizon, 2025 is shaping up to be XRP’s defining year. The combination of legal clarity, technical fundamentals, global partnerships, and mainstream visibility is positioning XRP as a leader in the next phase of the crypto bull run. Oscar Ramos’ post urged XRP holders not to overlook these signals, stating that anyone who owns XRP “will love what’s coming.” He concluded with a compelling call to action: “You need more XRP ASAP.” While not investment advice, it reflects a growing sentiment among analysts and the community alike—that XRP is on the verge of a significant revaluation. The Final Word Ripple’s public-facing momentum, capped by Brad Garlinghouse’s Fox Business interview, adds credibility to the belief that XRP’s value has yet to be realized. With a bullish macro outlook, real-world adoption accelerating, and Ripple’s global expansion continuing at full speed, the foundation is being laid for what could be XRP’s most transformative year yet. For long-time believers and new entrants alike, this moment might not just be the calm before the storm—it could be the signal before the surge.

Chinese companies are leading the AI arms race. Chinese politician and computer scientist Lou Qinjian said as much, recently commending DeepSeek for their accomplishments: “DeepSeek adheres to an open-source approach and promotes the widespread application of AI technology globally, which contributes Chinese wisdom to the world,” he said. “ Through the rise of companies like DeepSeek, we can see the innovation and inclusiveness of China’s technological development .” You might also like: AI’s trust problem can be solved using ZK solutions | Opinion In February, at the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit in Paris, US Vice President JD Vance made clear where the Trump Administration stands on artificial intelligence. He said that, first and foremost, the Trump administration will ensure that American AI technology remains “the gold standard” worldwide and that US companies remain the partner of choice for international companies and foreign countries. The Vice President argued that excessive regulation in the AI sector would kill the nascent industry, and that the administration would encourage pro-AI growth policies. “And I’d like to see that deregulatory flavor, making its way into a lot of the conversations at this conference,” he said . Vance also made it clear that AI should be free of ideological bias and that “American AI will not be co-opted into a tool for authoritarian censorship.” Finally, the Trump administration will safeguard a pro-worker growth path for AI so it can create jobs in the United States. Vance also brought up the notion of foreign adversaries weaponizing AI software to rewrite history, surveil users, and censorship. As Vance stated : “ This is hardly new, of course, as they do with other tech. Some authoritarian regimes have stolen and used AI to strengthen their military intelligence and surveillance capabilities, capture personal data, and create propaganda to undermine other nations’ national security. ” He warned conference attendees against partnering with such regimes. “From CCTV to 5G equipment, we’re all familiar with cheap tech in the marketplace that’s been heavily subsidized and exported by authoritarian regimes,” he said. “But as I know, and I think some of us in this room have learned from experience, partnering with them means chaining your nation to an authoritarian master that seeks to infiltrate, dig in, and seize your information infrastructure.” Under the hood of DeepSeek DeepSeek shocked global markets in January with low-cost models that made it seem like US companies were now behind in the AI arms race. The AI lowered the costs of developing reliable AIs, proving itself to be a powerful and cost-efficient open-source language model. It changed the way we view how much capital and computational resources are needed to develop AI. Researchers across the Western world are now left playing catch-up, studying DeepSeek’s technical advances and social implications. There are clear benefits to DeepSeek. For instance, startups without the deep pockets of Google and OpenAI can now compete in the AI sector. AI models can do more with less in the post-DeekSeep world. The company claims it took a mere $6 million using 2,000 Nvidia H800 graphics processing units (GPUs) versus the $80 million to $100 million cost of GPT-4 and the 16,000 H100 GPUs needed for Meta’s LLaMA 3. The Hangzhou-based startup’s AI model employs reasoning capabilities that allow smaller models, whereas other AIs have had to employ larger models. It also uses reinforcement learning, eliminating the need for supervised fine-tuning. Moreover, DeepSeek’s multi-head latent attention (MHLA) mechanism decreases memory usage to 5%, down from 13%, in earlier AI methods. DeepSeek raises privacy concerns and questions regarding data-sourcing and copyright. DeepSeek is open-weighted, not open source. Open source models share the full source code and data, and open weight models share trained weights but not the code. Therefore, the exact source code used to train the models is not available. Due to DeepSeek’s open weight model, it is unknown what its sources are. This seems to be the way most AI companies operate. DeepSeek made public its R1 training and open weight models, which will allow other AI developers to copy and build on the model, but not its sources. DeepSeek and geopolitics A race for AI dominance between China and the US has come into focus, while Russian capabilities on the matter remain a secret. Sberbank—Russia’s largest state-owned bank—has revealed its intentions to collaborate with Chinese researchers on AI projects. Russia and China, which share what they call a “no limits” strategic partnership, have long talked about AI cooperation—including in military applications—but little is publicly known about its depth or scope. Sberbank, under CEO German Gref, once a Soviet-style former state savings bank burdened by onerous bureaucracy, is today one of Russia’s leading players in artificial intelligence. It released its GigaChat model in 2023. “Sberbank has many scientists. Through them, we plan to conduct joint research projects with researchers from China,” Sberbank First Deputy CEO Alexander Vedyakhin told Reuters. As the AI arms race heats up, the benefits of open source innovation come to the forefront.

The analyst pseudonymously known as Credible Crypto tells his 466,900 followers on the social media platform X that it is within the realm of possibility for Curve DAO ( CRV ) to witness an over 400% rally from current levels. Credible says he sees CRV following in the footsteps of the payments altcoin XRP ( XRP ) when it witnessed a massive price rise in late Q4. “This is actually quite feasible because once we clear $0.60-$0.80, the next major resistance on CRV is at $2-$3. We already saw how quickly XRP went from $0.50 to $3+ [last] year when many said it wasn’t possible and/or were laughing at the idea. Have been hearing the same with regards to CRV for months now from those who haven’t spent any time actually understanding the protocol, and I’m expecting a similar outcome.” CRV is trading at $0.598 at time of writing. Turning to XRP, CredibleCrypto says the “most bullish scenario” for the fourth-largest crypto asset could materialize if XRP manages to rise above a major resistance level. “If we can break back above this point of breakdown [at around $2.20] impulsively, it would be a fantastic sign.” Source: Credible Crypto/X XRP is trading at $2.00 at time of writing.

However, the cryptocurrency reacted well to the tariff pause against nearly every country (aside from China, when the situation escalated) and jumped above $82,000 on Wednesday evening.

Let’s dive into the details and understand what’s driving this trend. Seventh Day of Bitcoin ETF Outflows: What’s Happening? According to data from Farside Investors, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a net outflow of $1 million on April 11. While $1 million might seem small in the grand scheme of things, it’s the continuation of a pattern that’s raising eyebrows. This marks the seventh straight day of withdrawals from these highly anticipated investment products. What does this persistent outflow tell us about the current state of the crypto investment landscape? BITB Leads the Exodus: Decoding the Bitcoin ETF Outflow Data Let’s break down where these outflows are coming from. The primary driver behind the recent negative flow was Bitwise’s BTC ETF , known by its ticker BITB. BITB witnessed a significant $12.3 million exit from its fund on April 11. This substantial outflow indicates that a portion of investors are pulling their capital from this particular ETF. But is it all doom and gloom? Interestingly, not all spot Bitcoin ETFs are experiencing outflows. ARK Invest’s ARKB, for instance, bucked the trend, registering $11.3 million in inflows on the same day. This inflow into ARKB partially offset the overall negative figure, suggesting that while some ETFs are losing assets, others are still attracting investment. It highlights a nuanced picture within the broader Bitcoin ETF outflows narrative. Spot Bitcoin ETF Flows on April 11, 2024: A Snapshot To get a clearer picture, let’s look at the performance of individual ETFs on April 11: ETF Ticker Net Flow (USD Million) Bitwise Bitcoin ETF BITB -12.3 ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ARKB +11.3 Other ETFs – No Change As you can see, the outflows were concentrated in BITB, while ARKB saw positive movement. The fact that other ETFs reported no changes suggests that the overall market sentiment might be selectively shifting rather than experiencing a widespread panic sell-off. Analyzing Investment Trends: What Do Bitcoin ETF Outflows Mean? What can we infer from these investment trends ? Consecutive days of outflows, even if small in net value, can indicate a few potential scenarios: Profit Taking: Investors who bought into spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier might be taking profits after a period of market gains. Shifting Sentiment: The outflows could reflect a change in market sentiment, possibly driven by macroeconomic factors, regulatory uncertainties, or concerns about Bitcoin’s price volatility. Rotation into Other Assets: Investors might be reallocating their capital to other asset classes, including other cryptocurrencies or traditional investments, seeking potentially higher or safer returns. Temporary Blip or Start of a Trend?: It’s crucial to consider whether these outflows are a short-term correction or the beginning of a more prolonged trend. Further monitoring of daily flows will be essential to determine the long-term implications. Navigating Crypto Investment Decisions Amidst ETF Flows For those involved in crypto investment , understanding these ETF flows is crucial. Here are a few actionable insights to consider: Stay Informed: Keep track of daily Bitcoin ETF outflows and inflows from various providers. Monitoring these flows can provide valuable insights into market sentiment and potential price movements. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification across different cryptocurrencies and asset classes can help mitigate risk. Understand Your Risk Tolerance: Crypto investments are inherently volatile. Assess your risk tolerance and invest accordingly. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Before making any investment decisions, conduct thorough research on the specific ETFs, the underlying assets, and the broader market conditions. Conclusion: Decoding Bitcoin ETF Signals The recent Bitcoin ETF outflows , while seemingly small in isolation, are noteworthy due to their persistence. The divergence in flows between BITB and ARKB highlights the nuanced dynamics within the spot Bitcoin ETF market. Whether this is a temporary phase or the start of a more significant trend remains to be seen. For investors, staying informed, understanding market signals, and making well-researched decisions are paramount in navigating the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency investments.

34779183,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=601465,1744449848,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/34779183.jpeg,Getting started with crypto casinos – A complete guide,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/getting-started-with-crypto-casinos-a-complete-guide/,"We have all heard of traditional online casinos and games like blackjack, poker, dice, and more. However, inefficient transactions and a lack of privacy/security are the biggest concerns among players who play games in such casinos. Crypto casinos, on the other hand, fuse traditional casinos with de-fi. The result? Fast and efficient transactions, high security, and often no need for KYC. For instance, platforms like BETS.IO let you play a huge range of classic casino games using cryptocurrency without an ID—others like BC.GAME lets you sign up for an account with your crypto wallet. The fact that registration on most crypto casinos takes an instant (all you need is an email) and payouts are instant means that you can play on the go. And since no ID is required, you don’t even have to worry about social stigmas related to online gambling. But since the crypto casino narrative is currently hot and trendy, many scam platforms have also popped up. As such, users need to ensure they are only playing in licensed and legitimate cryptocurrency casinos. In this guide, we will teach you how to get started with crypto casinos. Choose a reputable crypto casino. What makes a crypto casino reliable? Some players may answer, “a wide range of betting options.” But that’s not entirely the case. Most crypto casinos offer a seemingly unlimited number of games, but they lack transparency and efficiency in payouts. There’s no point in risking your money in a casino where the payout is either not guaranteed or delayed indefinitely with no options for a follow-up. Hence, guaranteed payout (such as on BETS.IO ) is the only factor determining whether a crypto casino is legitimate and trusted. Fairness and licenses Imagine going to a casino where all the games are rigged in the house’s favor. You can never expect to win in such a casino in the long run. Yes, traditional casinos often create rules to ensure the house wins 70% of the time. Even some unlicensed crypto casino platforms have unfair and rigged systems, where the players will always lose in the long run. Such platforms are often hard to discern because their flashy designs and user interfaces are similar to reputable casinos. Hence, fairness is the first and most important aspect you should consider. Besides that, the casino should also be licensed. This ensures that the platform has been thoroughly audited and trusted by third-party organizations. Licensed platforms are also less likely to indefinitely hold your deposits or run away with your winnings. Support for many cryptocurrencies It is one of the few factors that may not be a big deal for most players, yet it’s a nice addition. If a platform is legit, players often make do with a lack of support for cryptocurrencies. After all, one can quickly swap crypto using any dex or a centralized exchange like Binance or Coinbase. So, support for a wide range of cryptocurrencies is like a cherry on top. It’s not necessary, rather nice to have. Crypto casinos like BC.GAME supports coins like BTC, DOGE, XRP, ADA, DAI, ETH, USDT, TRX, POL, and more. No identity verification or KYC KYC (know your customer) is often required in traditional and crypto casinos. Platforms like these often want to log your real name, home address, government identification documents, phone number, and more information. However, that goes against one of the major tenets of de-fi and cryptocurrencies: anonymity. Also, most people are uncomfortable providing such details to a casino, as they want to keep such activities a secret from their friends and family. Certain casinos, like BETS.IO, continue to uphold user anonymity and allow players to register simply with an email. No other documentation is required to play, win, and cash out. Generous bonuses Most crypto casinos offer certain daily, weekly, or monthly bonuses, including sign-up, deposit, cashback, and more. This is a way for them to give back to the player community. BETS.IO follows a similar approach and offers incredibly generous bonuses. When you make your first deposit, you can win a 100% bonus for up to 1 BTC and 100 free spins. Similarly, the second deposit gives you 75% up to 1,000 USDT and 75 free spins. There’s more; you can also get 10% daily cashback, weekend reload bonuses, and more. On the other hand, with BC.GAME , you win a 120% first deposit bonus. On the second deposit, you win a 100% deposit bonus. Similarly, the third deposit gives you a 150% deposit bonus, while the fourth gives you a 100% deposit bonus. Each of the four deposits gives you 100 free spins. There are more bonuses for active players, such as the rakeback program, where players earn bonuses for every wager. Register at the casino Most crypto casinos that don’t require an ID have a simple registration step. All that you have to do is provide your email address and set a password, and that’s it. Then, you can make a deposit and start playing games. In this guide, we will use BETS.IO and BC.GAME since they are trusted and legitimate no-ID casinos. Set up a standard crypto wallet like Phantom The first step is to set up a cryptocurrency wallet. Later, you will connect this wallet to the cryptocurrency casino. As a general safety measure, never use your main wallet. Note that your wallet choice will depend on which cryptocurrency you want to use in the casino. In this case, we use the Phantom wallet, which supports Solana, Base, Polygon, Ethereum, and Bitcoin assets. Creating a new wallet specifically for casinos is always recommended, and you should load funds you’re comfortable with losing. This helps prevent compulsive gambling. 1. Go to the Phantom app and click on “Download for Chrome.” The website will automatically detect your browser and provide you with the relevant download button. 2. Chrome’s web store will open. After that, you need to click on the “Add to Chrome” button to download the Phantom wallet extension to your browser. 3. Click “Create a new wallet” or “I already have a wallet.” In this guide, we are going to create a new wallet. 4. Enter a password for your new wallet. Then, view and save your secret recovery phrase, and click “Continue.” 5. Click “Receive” to add funds, then choose your preferred cryptocurrency. In this guide, we decided to use Ethereum. Then, copy your wallet address and send funds to it from a centralized exchange like Binance or Coinbase. Now your Phantom wallet is ready, and you’re ready to make a deposit on BETS.IO and start playing various casino games. Make a deposit BETS.IO 1. Go to BETS.IO and click the “Sign up” button. 2. Enter your email and password to create an account. 3. Click on the “Deposit” button in the top right corner of the screen, or choose “Buy Crypto” to purchase & deposit in Bets.io directly via Moonpay. 4. Copy your ETH address or choose a different cryptocurrency, and send your funds to this address to deposit them into BETS.IO. Alternatively, choose “Buy Crypto,” add your buy amount, and click “Buy via MoonPay” using a VISA or Mastercard debit/credit card. BC.GAME: Go to BC.GAME and click on the “Sign up” button. Enter your email and password to create an account. Click on the “Deposit” button at the top right corner of the screen to purchase and deposit in BC.GAME directly from your crypto wallet. . Copy your ETH address or choose a different cryptocurrency, and send your funds to this address to deposit them into BC.GAME. Choose the right game Once your deposit has arrived, you can choose any of your favorite games and start playing them. Crypto Casinos offer various games, including casinos, lottery, Original games, and sports betting. Of course, there is also a vast collection of classic casino table games, such as Roulette, BlackJack, and Poker. There’s also an endless range of slot games, such as Lucky X, Le Pharaoh, Sugar Rush 1000, Gates of Olympus 1000, Big Bass Vegas, Sweet Bonanza 1000, and more. After choosing a particular game, wait for it to load. You can choose between “Real Play” and “Fun Play.” In real play, you will be wagering real money or cryptocurrencies. However, in fun play, you won’t be losing anything. Hence, the fun play option is great for those who want to try new games and learn to play certain games without wagering real money. After loading a certain game (in this case, we’re playing “Gates of Olympus 1000” on BETS.IO ), all you need to do is set a wager amount and test your luck. However, we recommend playing casino games responsibly to avoid burning your portfolio. Tips for winning at crypto casinos Set a budget Determine how much money you’re willing to spend before you start playing. You should be able to afford to lose this budget. Respect your limit once you’ve established it. This keeps your gaming fun and helps avoid overspending. Make use of bonuses A lot of cryptocurrency casinos provide incentives and promotions. Make sure you utilize these offers to the fullest. Examples of bonuses are free spins, deposit matches, and cashback. They boost your chances of winning by giving you extra money to play with. Choose a licensed and legitimate casino Look for no-KYC (Know Your Customer) choices while choosing a casino. There is greater privacy because these casinos don’t require a lot of sensitive information. Make sure the casino has a license as well. A regulated, licensed casino provides a more secure and equitable gambling environment. Study the games Spend some time learning the rules and strategy of a game before you start playing. Understanding the game’s mechanics can significantly increase your chances of winning. Make use of the lessons and free game versions that many casinos provide. Don’t gamble compulsively Knowing when to quit is just as crucial to successful gambling as winning. Establish victory and loss caps for every session. If you make enough money, you should think about cashing out. In a similar vein, give up once you’ve lost too much. By practicing this practice, you may keep things under control and resist the need to chase losses.","Deep Dive - Crypto, Web3 & Market Insights|BC.GAME|Bets.IO|ETH",EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|SOL|USDT|BNB,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-12 09:24:08

At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades above $82,000, inching closer to the $85,000 range with its market capitalization now sitting above $1.6 trillion. A recent market report from CryptoQuant outlines several contributing factors to this rebound. According to the firm, crypto price volatility remained high throughout the week, fueled by trade tensions and macroeconomic developments. Prices dipped sharply earlier in the week after retaliatory tariffs were introduced by China and the European Union. However, they began recovering on April 9 following the tariff suspension. The temporary policy reduced tariffs to 10% for most countries, while China remained subject to a 125% rate. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bottom In After Trump’s Tariff Pause? Here’s What To Expect Bitcoin Technical Support and Market Sentiment CryptoQuant’s report also emphasized the importance of Bitcoin’s 365-day moving average (MA), which currently stands at $76,100. This level has previously served as a key technical support in historical market cycles, including in August 2024, July 2021, and December 2021. The recent bounce from this level is being closely monitored as a potential base for a renewed uptrend. A breach below this moving average, however, would increase the likelihood of Bitcoin entering a bearish phase. Despite this positive movement, investor sentiment remains subdued. CryptoQuant noted in the report: Nevertheless, although market sentiment has improved after the tariff pause, Bitcoin remains in one of its least bullish phases since November 2022, according to CryptoQuant’s Bull Score Index. The Index is now at 10—its lowest reading since that time—signaling continued weak investor sentiment and a low probability of a sustained rally in the near term. According to the firm, a longer-term rally is unlikely unless the score climbs above 40. Furthermore, with BTC’s price currently on the rise, CryptoQuant mentioned that the asset could find resistance at $84,000 and $96,000—zones historically linked to the Trader Realized Price, which has served as both support and resistance in different market phases. Altcoin Accumulation Signal Emerges In a separate commentary, CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost presented data that may indicate favorable conditions for altcoin accumulation. The analyst observed that the 30-day moving average of trading volume for altcoins paired with stablecoins has dropped below its annual average. This market behavior, according to Darkfost, has previously marked buying zones, with the last occurrence seen in September 2023. The analysis suggests that while Bitcoin’s near-term outlook remains uncertain, altcoins may be entering a phase conducive to dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategies. Related Reading: Ethereum Long-Term Holders Show Signs Of Capitulation – Prime Accumulation Zone? Darkfost cautioned that these windows can last for weeks or months but have historically aligned with the early stages of altcoin market recoveries. If the macroeconomic environment stabilizes and capital flows return, these conditions could lead to broader participation across the crypto sector.

Technical charts uncovered a breakdown from a key rising channel that had previously propped up prices since 2018, with analysts eyeing a potential slide towards $0.061. While, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sends sparks across the crypto’ market with its presale charging ahead, amassing $6.5 million and 8,100 holders. Now in Phase 4, tokens go for $0.025—a cost that will jump 20% to $0.03 with the start of Phase 5. Dogecoin’s Technical Breakdown Triggers Panic The path of least resistance for Dogecoin has broken a six-year trendline leading to the prospect of swift recovery. Analysts point to a bearish Fibonacci retracement level just below $0.16395 — the level DOGE was rejected at as it surged, as raising concerns of a further downturn in the price. Whale movement injected over 300 million DOGE ($41.7 million) in recent days only to swamp Binance, and sell-side continued pressure. Despite a macro downtrend, a potential bullish divergence on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests reprieves will be short-lived, with $0.135 acting as an essential efficiency level. If this level is not held, cascading sell-off ensues with the possibility of DOGE being taken down to 0.10. Market sentiment is fractured, with bulls and bears equally balanced, leaving traders to brace for April’s turbulence. Mutuum Finance Presale Gains Traction MUTM sells for just $0.025, and as Dogecoin splutters, all eyes are on the Phase 4 presale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . With over 400 million tokens secured already, early participants are looking forward to a 140% jump when it hits the exchange at $0.06. Such return is guaranteed within the project tokenomics structure, offering freedom from speculative forecasts. Careful investors face the second price jump in Phase 5, from $0.025 to $0.03, which only increases the sense of urgency, rewarding those that invest now with instant 20% gains as the presale progresses. Outside of presale gains, analysts expect a post-launch rally of between $1.50 and $4.80 on the back of Mutuum Finance’s revenue driven buy pressure, and decentralized lending utilities. Smart Mechanics Cultivate Trust Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sets itself apart with mtTokens, interest-bearing assets that represent user deposits such as ETH or DAI. These coins increase in worth with time thus producing passive income without transferring the holdings. A brand new dashboard keeps record of the top 50 holders with a bonus giveaway to those who still hold top 50 positions, encouraging long term holding! At the same time, the team is putting the finishing touches on a Certik audit to confirm that the sensible contract is secure, with findings expected to be shared on official channels. This radical transparency combined with a 2.4x ROI at launch marks a pragmatic hedge against meme coin volatility, thus making MUTM a smart play. Focusing on Sustainable Growth Dogecoin is struggling with whale-shaking uncertainty, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) relies on its overcollateralized lending model to stabilize the platform. Borrowers need to lock more assets than loan values to reduce default risks and prevent lender expectations. MUTM buy-backs from revenue Create automatic buy-backs with revenue generated from fees: This creates tokens being redistributed back to stakers and establishes a perpetual demand for MUTM. Phase 4 tokens are selling rapidly, and the opportunity to get the lowest price is closing. As investors shift away from speculative assets like DOGE, the calculated approach of Mutuum Finance — combining DeFi utility with tactical token burns — is simply too alluring. The 25% slump potential for Dogecoin (DOGE) highlights the dangers of meme-based markets, and suggests a structured counter play in Mutuum Finance (MUTM). This coupled with its presale status, received new audit developments, and predicted post-launch targets ranging between $1.50 and $4.80 makes for an enticing buy in. With the crypto market adjusting focus toward projects with real use cases, MUTM’s blend of cutting edge lending innovation and incentives for investment could drive the DeFi landscape as we head towards 2025. Prices in Phase 4 are ready to spike — get in now or be left behind the next breakout!

They’ve just scooped up a substantial amount of SEI tokens, worth a staggering $775,000! This bold acquisition, revealed by Onchain Lens on X and confirmed by Arkham data, has the crypto community buzzing. Let’s dive into the details of this intriguing development and what it could mean for both WLFI and the SEI token. What’s the Buzz Around World Liberty Financial’s SEI Token Purchase? World Liberty Financial’s recent token acquisition is generating considerable excitement and speculation within the cryptocurrency space. Here’s a breakdown of what we know: Significant Investment: WLFI invested 775,000 USDC to acquire 4.89 million SEI tokens. This is a substantial financial commitment, signaling a strong belief in the potential of SEI. Timing is Everything: The transaction reportedly occurred just a few hours ago, indicating a recent and decisive move by WLFI. Real-time data from Arkham supports this, adding credibility to the news. Growing Holdings: This purchase significantly boosts WLFI’s SEI holdings. They now possess a total of 5,983,278 SEI tokens, demonstrating a clear accumulation strategy. Market Reaction: Following the news, SEI token has experienced a positive price surge. Currently trading at $0.1611, it’s up by 6.54% over the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. This crypto investment by a project linked to the Trump family adds an extra layer of intrigue. The involvement of figures from traditional finance and politics in the crypto world often draws increased attention and can influence market sentiment. Why is Everyone Watching SEI Token After This Crypto Investment? SEI token has been steadily gaining traction in the crypto market, and World Liberty Financial’s substantial crypto investment is likely to amplify this attention. But why is SEI token specifically under the spotlight? Layer 1 Blockchain: SEI is a Layer 1 blockchain specifically designed for trading. It focuses on optimizing speed and efficiency for decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and trading applications. Growing Ecosystem: The SEI network is expanding, with a growing number of projects and decentralized applications (dApps) being built on its platform. This indicates a healthy and developing ecosystem. Technological Advantages: SEI boasts impressive transaction speeds and low latency, making it attractive for traders and developers looking for high-performance blockchain solutions. Community Support: The SEI community is active and engaged, contributing to the network’s growth and development. World Liberty Financial’s decision to invest heavily in SEI suggests a strong belief in its underlying technology and future potential. This token acquisition could be interpreted as a strategic move to capitalize on the growth of the SEI ecosystem. Trump Family and Crypto: What Does This Mean for the Market? The connection of World Liberty Financial to the Trump family injects a unique dynamic into this crypto investment story. While details about the exact nature of this connection are still emerging, the Trump name carries significant weight, particularly in financial and political circles. What are the potential implications for the broader crypto market? Increased Mainstream Attention: The involvement of figures associated with the Trump family can bring cryptocurrencies to the attention of a wider, potentially less crypto-native audience. Political Influence: Political figures’ engagement with crypto can influence regulatory discussions and policy decisions surrounding digital assets. Market Sentiment Boost: For some investors, the association with a well-known name like Trump could be seen as a positive signal, potentially boosting market confidence in the projects involved. Scrutiny and Skepticism: Conversely, such associations can also attract scrutiny and skepticism from those who are critical of the political figures involved, or who view celebrity endorsements in crypto with caution. It’s crucial to remember that crypto investment decisions should always be based on thorough research and understanding of the underlying technology and market dynamics, regardless of celebrity or political affiliations. Decoding the $775K Crypto Acquisition: Is This a Smart Move? Investing $775,000 in SEI tokens is a substantial commitment. Was this token acquisition a strategically smart move by World Liberty Financial? Let’s consider some factors: Factor Potential Positive Implications Potential Risks SEI Token Potential SEI’s focus on trading and growing ecosystem could lead to significant price appreciation. Early investment could yield substantial returns. The crypto market is volatile. SEI’s price could decline, and the project’s growth is not guaranteed. WLFI Strategy This investment could be part of a broader strategy to diversify WLFI’s portfolio and tap into the growth of the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. The specific strategy behind this investment is not fully transparent. WLFI’s overall business model and long-term plans are key considerations. Market Timing Investing during market dips or periods of consolidation can be advantageous. The current market conditions might be favorable for strategic acquisitions. Market timing is notoriously difficult. The market could experience further downturns, impacting the value of the investment. Ultimately, the success of this crypto acquisition will depend on various factors, including the continued development and adoption of the SEI network, overall market conditions, and WLFI’s strategic execution. It’s a high-stakes game with potentially high rewards, but also inherent risks. SEI Token’s Price Surge: A Sign of Things to Come in Crypto? The immediate 6.54% price surge in SEI token following the announcement of World Liberty Financial’s token acquisition is noteworthy. Is this just a short-term reaction, or could it signal a more sustained upward trend for SEI and potentially the broader crypto market? Positive Market Signal: Large investments like this can act as a positive signal to the market, indicating confidence in the asset and attracting further investment. Increased Liquidity: WLFI’s purchase increases the demand for SEI tokens, potentially contributing to increased liquidity and price stability in the long run. Broader Market Sentiment: Positive news like this can contribute to an overall optimistic sentiment in the crypto market, especially if it’s seen as a sign of institutional or more mainstream adoption. Volatility Remains: While the immediate price reaction is positive, the crypto market is known for its volatility. Sustained price increases require continued positive developments and market momentum. The SEI token’s price movement in the coming days and weeks will be crucial to watch. It will provide further insights into the market’s reaction to this intriguing crypto investment and potentially offer clues about future trends. Conclusion: A Bold Move in the Crypto Landscape World Liberty Financial’s $775,000 token acquisition of SEI tokens is undoubtedly a bold move that has captured the attention of the crypto community. The involvement of a project linked to the Trump family adds a layer of political and mainstream interest to this development. Whether this investment proves to be a strategically smart and profitable venture remains to be seen. However, it undeniably highlights the growing interest in Layer 1 blockchains like SEI and the continued influx of investment into the cryptocurrency space.

Top Trader Notes ‘Bizarre BTC Flows’ After Friday’s 5% Rally,https://coingape.com/markets/will-bitcoin-price-crash-top-trader-notes-bizarre-btc-flows-after-fridays-5-rally/,"On Friday, Bitcoin price went up 4.80%, setting up a high of $83,378. Overall, this week has been bullish with BTC setting up higher highs and higher lows, signaling strength. One top trader is suspicious of this recent uptrend and says the uptick could be an ‘exit pump’ due to ‘bizarre flows on BTC.’ Will Bitcoin Price Crash? Atlantis7, a popular orderflow trader, says the 4.80% rally in Bitcoin price was driven by passive Coinbase and Binance spot bid (limit orders) along with aggressive spot buyers on OKX. What makes this outlook ‘bizzare’ according to Atalantis7 is that while limit orders were getting executed the cumulative volume delta was dropping with a positive Coinbase premium. BTC Price vs. Flows Does this mean that there will be a Bitcoin price crash? In a reply, Atalantis7 details that this ‘bizarre flow’ could suggest quite accumulation by institutions is a short-term escape into safe haven assets amid the US and China tariff war. This outlook also explains why Gold is up 9.27% since April 9. While the flows might be bizarre, Atalantis7 posts in a subsequent tweet about ‘funny feeling’ and how this recent Bitcoin price rally could be an ‘one big exit pump.‘ “idk why i get a funny feeling that this was just one big exit pump. very coordinated 1-time framing across tickers throughout the day, trapping and liquidating shorts and now a dump of inventory. i may be wrong but price action seems very inorganic and not much participation.” Macro Outlook Hints BTC Bullish Reversal is Close The Global M2 Money Supply dictates if investors rotate into risk-on or risk-off assets. So far, Bitcoin’s top since 104K has closely followed the M2, ie., a crash in BTC’s value if M2 drops and vice versa. The reason for being bullish on the macro is the recent reversal and uptrend seen in M2, which hints that capital will find its way into Bitcoin, which is a modern day safe haven asset. Bitcoin Price vs. M2 Money Supply Bitcoin price seems bullish but investors need to be cautious of Trump-Xi trade war continues. The tariff battle between the two giants could upset the normal flow of the markets. This could catalyze massive volatility on either side, preventing a directional move. As a result, let’s take a look at Bitcoin’s technical analysis and key levels watch. Key BTC Price Levels to Watch After recovering above $80K Bitcoin price has entered a bullish phase as it reclaimed the $80.9K to $88.4K zone, which termed value area. This zone is where 70% of the volume has been transacted since February 25, 2025. Currently, BTC is grappling with the $83.1K, which is the highest traded volume level in the past six weeks. Overcoming this key resistance level could propel the price to the range high of the value area at $88.4K. In a highly bullish case, Bitcoin could overcome the ranee high and visit $90K. However, if the price rejects at $83.1K, it could flip the bias to bearish and catalyze a Bitcoin price crash. In such a case, the range low at $80.9K is a key support level. If this level fails to hold, the bearish trend will continue and potentially crash BTC price to $77K or $74K. A lot of sell-side liquidity is present below $74K. To conclude, $83.1K is a level that decides if Bitcoin price prediction will remain bullish or flip bearish. The post Will Bitcoin Price Crash?

ONDO surges in popularity following its Binance listing and strong community backing. Solana, Orca, and XCN trend upward amid bullish sentiment and increased trading activity. As the weekend kicks off, data from the market intelligence platform Santiment shows top crypto conversations range from fresh questions about Ethereum to excited talk surrounding ONDO and Orca. Why Are Crypto Watchers Questioning Ethereum’s Path Forward? While traditionally seen as the go-to platform for dApps and smart contracts, Ethereum now meets fresh doubt from parts of the crypto world. Specifically, concerns are emerging about its long-term viability. Users point to its declining market dominance and rising competition from alternative layer-1 chains like Solana and Avalanche. Notably, since this year started, the price of ETH has tanked by 52% to trade near $1,580, the same level it traded three years ago.

Despite this development, the XRP community remains disappointed, as the Inspector General’s report on Bill Hinman’s controversial speech reportedly lacks clarity. Experts like John Deaton and MetaLawMan highlight the inconsistencies in the IG’s Hinman report. Let’s analyze their statements and the report’s key implications on the XRP lawsuit. XRP Lawsuit: Experts Reveal Inconsistencies in Hinman Report Although the US SEC has released the Inspector General’s Hinman report, the XRP community raises concerns about its inconsistencies. Prominent players like John Deaton and MetaLawMan, who have been vocal throughout the XRP lawsuit, emphasized the IG’s “whitewashing” of William Hinman’s Ethereum speech. Significantly, XRP lawyer John Deaton posited that the IG’s Hinman report is flawed. He added that the IG is competent, hinting at her biased findings. Listing a few reasons for his statement, Deaton wrote, “Here’s a few points off the top of my head that proves the IG is either incompetent or something else is at play.” What Are John Deaton’s Findings? In his recent X post, John Deaton pointed out several reasons for his disappointment with the IG report of Bill Hinman’s speech . According to Deaton, the IG’s claim that owning ETH wouldn’t constitute a conflict of interest contradicts SEC policies that prohibit token ownership to prevent conflicts. The XRP lawyer highlighted multiple points to question the report’s credibility. Hinman’s Meetings with Simpson Thacher Reportedly, Bill Hinman met his partners at Simpson Thacher, despite warnings from SEC Ethics. One of the partners Hinman met with was involved in the Canaan IPO, a company that manufactured Ethereum (ETH) mining equipment. This raises questions about potential favoritism or influence. Were Hinman’s Words Personal? In the XRP lawsuit, Hinman claimed that his speech that deemed Ethereum as a non-security represented his personal opinion. In contradiction, the IG stated that it was collaborative. Previously, John Deaton urged the SEC to release the Hinman report to provide more clarity to the ongoing crypto case, including the XRP lawsuit. Though the SEC publicized the report, he remains disheartened due to the IG’s biased statements. Experts Slam IG’s Hinman Report Furthermore, lawyer MetaLawMan underscored the “narrow scope” of the IG’s investigation of Hinman’s speech. According to him, the investigation was limited to determining whether Hinman broke any criminal laws rather than thoroughly examining potential conflicts of interest or ethics violations. Moreover, highlighting its biased nature, the XRP proponent stated, “And, of course, the investigation was conducted, and the report completed, under the Gensler regime.” What’s Next for the XRP Lawsuit? In a surprising development, the US SEC dropped its appeal in the XRP lawsuit, after which Ripple withdrew its cross-appeal . Despite this development, the ultimate settlement of the case remains uncertain, sparking multiple interpretations. Many believe that an imminent settlement is likely in the XRP case. However, the Hinman report’s inconsistencies have further complicated the Ripple lawsuit, with uncertain implications for its outcome.

In 2024, the blockchain gaming sector experienced a substantial increase in daily unique active wallets (dUAW), reaching 7.4 million—a 421% growth from January 2024. The centre of this growing market is the increasing integration of AI agents in games. These agents are capable of acting autonomously on gamers’ behalf in the gaming ecosystem. As the autonomous, intelligent programs, they operate within a game’s logic—interacting with environments, users, and other agents. Further, in on-chain games, these agents are integrated into smart contracts or decentralized logic, making their actions transparent, verifiable, and trustless. According to a report by Custom Market Insights, the global blockchain gaming market was valued at $10.2 billion in 2024. It is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 67.7%, reaching approximately $304.3 billion by 2033. Top AI*Gaming Players | Source This growth is driven by the rising adoption of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) games, which increasingly incorporate AI to enhance user experiences. ​ Further, another report from the industry highlights that the AI in games market size is forecast to increase by USD 27.47 billion at a CAGR of 42.3% between 2024 and 2029. Thus, this positions Soneium’s launch of Crystal Caves as both timely and strategic, capturing two of the fastest-growing trends in the gaming world.

The SFM price could reach a high of $0.000165 in 2025. The future growth success rate for SFM is heavily dependent on the adoption rate for the VGX ecosystem. The SafeMoon (SFM) project has gradually signaled bullish momentum since the acquisition by VGX Foundation post-bankruptcy. The new Safemoon team has been working on regaining the community’s trust after the former team was charged by the Department of Justice with wire fraud and money laundering. The commitment to deflate the SFM tokens by the VGX team will play a crucial role in its price action in the next five years. Considering the fundamental aspects of the Safemoon project, Coinpedia formulated a technical SFM price prediction for the next five years.

DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” Of course, in crypto, nothing is guaranteed, but the excitement is undeniable. Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. By bringing together traditional sports fans and the fast-moving crypto space, XYZVerse is building something different—something with entertainment value and real engagement. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Solana’s Sprint: The Future of Fast Decentralized Apps In the world of blockchain platforms, Solana is making waves with its focus on speed and scalability. Unlike competitors like Ethereum and Cardano, Solana doesn’t rely on splitting tasks or adding extra layers to boost performance. Instead, it uses unique designs to handle more transactions quickly. This makes it a solid choice for developers building decentralized apps. With support for different programming languages, Solana offers flexibility for those looking to create the next big thing in blockchain. At the heart of Solana is SOL, its native cryptocurrency. SOL powers the entire ecosystem, facilitating transactions and rewarding network supporters. In the current market, where scalable and efficient blockchain solutions are in demand, SOL stands out. As developers and investors seek platforms that can handle busy services, Solana’s high-capacity network puts it in a strong position. Compared to other coins, SOL’s focus on speed and ease of development makes it an attractive option today. Cardano’s ADA: The Eco-Friendly Crypto Shaping the Future of Blockchain Cardano is making waves in the cryptocurrency world. It’s a flexible and sustainable platform built for smart contracts. This means developers can create apps for finance, new tokens, or even games. At the heart of Cardano is its native coin, ADA. Similar to Ethereum’s ETH, users can make payments, store value, or earn rewards by staking ADA on the network. What sets Cardano apart is its green approach. Instead of using lots of energy like some others, it uses a system called Ouroboros, which is much kinder to the environment. One of Cardano’s big ideas is how it’s built. It has two layers. One handles transactions, and the other runs smart contracts. This design could let it process up to a million transactions every second someday. That’s a huge deal in the crypto space. Since March 2021, Cardano has made it easier and cheaper to interact with smart contracts. This boosts its efficiency and scalability. In a market pushing for greener and faster solutions, ADA stands out. Compared to others, its focus on sustainability and speed could make it a strong player in the future of blockchain. Ethereum’s Next Chapter: A Leader in Decentralized Innovation Ethereum isn’t just another blockchain—it’s the pioneer of smart contracts and a hub for decentralized apps. Since its launch in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, it has transformed how we think about finance and technology. With Ethereum, developers can build decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, and Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon make transactions faster and cheaper. In 2022, Ethereum shifted to a Proof-of-Stake system with the Merge, making the network more energy-efficient. Looking ahead, Ethereum plans to introduce sharding to improve scalability and lower costs even more. Ether (ETH), the network’s native coin, is essential for transactions and rewards. It remains a valuable asset for trading and as collateral. Compared to other coins, Ethereum’s continuous upgrades and active community make it stand out. With the crypto market evolving and technologies advancing, ETH looks promising in the current cycle. Its strong foundation and future plans could make it an attractive option for those interested in the crypto space. Bitcoin Unveiled: The Original Cryptocurrency’s Potential Today Bitcoin is the world’s first cryptocurrency, created by someone known only as Satoshi Nakamoto. It was introduced as a new form of electronic cash. Unlike traditional money, Bitcoin doesn’t rely on banks or governments. Instead, it works through a technology called blockchain, which is like a shared record kept across many computers. People called miners check and approve transactions by solving complex puzzles, and in return, they earn new bitcoins. This system aims to make transactions secure and prevent fraud. Bitcoin’s design limits it to 21 million coins, making it scarce like gold. Every four years, the reward miners get is cut in half, in an event called “halving.” This can influence the price and the health of the network. Right now, Bitcoin remains the most well-known and valuable cryptocurrency. With increasing interest from big investors and companies, Bitcoin’s potential continues to grow. While newer coins offer different features, Bitcoin’s strong foundation and widespread acceptance make it an attractive option in today’s market. Its technology and limited supply could mean it will keep playing a key role in the future of money. Conclusion Bitcoin’s potential surge highlights cryptos like ETH, ADA, SOL, but XYZVerse (XYZ), the first all-sport memecoin, uniquely blends sports and meme culture, aiming for significant growth.

An official press release by the exchange on Saturday, April 12, revealed that the collateral ratio of 10 tokens under portfolio margin is being updated. These tokens include DENT, ENJ, NOT, DASH, CHZ, AXS, ENS, SAND, THETA, and QNT. Binance Updates Collateral Ratio For 10 Crypto Under Portfolio Margin According to a recent Binance announcement , collateral ratios for the abovementioned crypto tokens will primarily be reduced shortly ahead. The exchange revealed that the new ratios will be visible on the platform starting April 18 at 06:00 UTC. This phenomenon raises market concerns as lower collateral ratios mean reduced borrowing power. Market participants can use less of these assets’ value as collateral. This also shrinks their margin buying power, limiting their ability to open or maintain trade positions. Broadly speaking, the impact could be forced portfolio adjustments as market participants look to mitigate potential losses. Here Are The New Collateral Ratios Source: Binance official site Binance added that the update will also affect the Unified Maintenance Margin Ratio (uniMMR). “Users should monitor uniMMR closely to avoid any potential liquidation or losses that may result from the change of collateral ratio,” the leading crypto exchange notified. How Are The Crypto Performing? As mentioned above, the new update ignited cautious investor sentiments about the assets’ prices due to the downsized market and trade offerings. Nevertheless, most of the mentioned crypto tokens have traded in the green against the backdrop of the broader crypto market trend. DENT price was up by 3% and traded at $0.0006567. ENJ price also jumped over 2% and exchanged hands at $0.06690. NOT price witnessed a slight 1% increase in value, closing in at $0.001882. DASH price was also up nearly 2% to $20.69. ENS price soared nearly 3% and exchanged hands at $14.37. SAND price likewise gained nearly 0.5% to reach $0.2609. Also, QNT price surged roughly 2.5% and is currently sitting at $65.77. On the other hand, tokens like CHZ, AXS, and THETA traded in red territory. Market watchers continue to thoroughly eye the tokens for price action shifts ahead. It’s also worth mentioning that Binance has revealed plans to list ONDO, VIRTUAL, and BIGTIME tokens recently, further revolutionizing its trade offerings.

43246210,https://coingape.com/?post_type=markets&p=248364,1744452541,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Pi Network Price Bounces 12% in 24 Hours – What’s Driving the Rally?,https://coingape.com/markets/pi-network-price-bounces-12-in-24-hours-whats-driving-the-rally/,"Pi Network price is on a bullish streak today, April 12, after recording a staggering 10% gain in the last 24 hours. These gains pushed Pi Coin to an intraday high of $0.70, with its market cap also surging past $4.5 billion. This article explores whether Pi Coin can sustain this rally and what is driving the momentum. Pi Network Price Gains 12% in 24 Hours Pi Network price has outperformed the rest of the crypto market this week with a staggering 40% gain in the last seven days. Several factors are driving this uptrend including market conditions and economic factors. One of these factors is the recovery across the broader crypto market. At press time, most of the top 10 largest cryptos were trading in the green. This broader crypto market recovery could support a Pi Network price rally. Such gains may also shift the market sentiment to positive, supporting a strong uptrend for the Pi Network token. The second factor that will bolster the gains is shifting macro conditions. A recent report by the Financial Times noted that the Federal Reserve was ready to take measures to ensure normality in the financial markets. If the Fed intervenes with emergency rate cuts , it might bolster a recovery for Pi Network price. Reduced interest rates will free up capital that can be used to buy risk assets such as crypto, which will bode well for the price of Pi Coin. A previous Coingape article also reported that Pi Coin is gaining utility. This rising utility means that investor confidence in the Pi Network token is rising, which is good for the price. Pi Network Technical Analysis Pi Network price has formed a bullish structure and could extend its gains after today’s 12% rally. On the 4-hour chart, Pi Coin had formed an ascending triangle pattern, which often shows a bullish continuation. If it breaches the resistance zone at $0.65, it will support a bullish Pi Network price prediction . The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the Pi Network chart has also risen to 66, indicating growing bullish momentum. The upward trend of the RSI further shows that the buying pressure is growing strong. The MACD indicator further confirms the bullish thesis for Pi Coin price after forming a bullish crossover above the signal line to enter the positive region. The increasing histogram bars further show the onset of buyer activity. PI/USDT: 4-Hour Chart The four-hour price chart shows that Pi Network price might sustain its uptrend in the near term. If the market conditions remain the same where Bitcoin and altcoins are rallying, the token could extend its gains. Additionally, a shift in the US economic climate with a possible Fed rate cut will also bolster gains.

More importantly, it broke above the $1.9981 resistance, a pivotal level that has acted as both support and resistance since late 2024. This daily close marks a structural shift, suggesting bulls are regaining control after a prolonged downtrend. If this momentum holds, XRP could be poised for further upside in the coming sessions. Candlestick Structure Confirms Buyer Strength The candlestick pattern offers early signs of a reversal. April 7 printed a long-legged doji with a deep lower wick, reflecting indecision followed by strong buyer reaction below $1.90. April 9’s bullish engulfing candle not only closed above the previous day’s high but also reclaimed a major price level. This back-to-back formation signals a potential bottoming setup, often seen before trend shifts on the daily timeframe. MACD Suggests Early Bullish Crossover Momentum indicators are aligning with this price action. The MACD, though still below the zero line, is showing early signs of convergence. The MACD line is approaching a bullish crossover with the signal line, while the histogram has ticked into slightly positive territory. This shift indicates a weakening bearish trend and increasing bullish pressure, especially if the crossover is confirmed in the next 24–48 hours. Further confirmation comes from the Momentum (10) indicator, which has turned positive for the first time in over two weeks, currently reading +0.0335. The steady rise from late March lows points to growing bullish momentum. This is significant as it supports the breakout from both a price structure and momentum perspective—key factors in sustaining upward movement. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Rounded Bottom Pattern in Formation A broader view of the chart reveals a potential rounded bottom forming since early April. Price action has gradually shifted from aggressive selling to sideways consolidation and now shows signs of recovery. This pattern typically precedes bullish trend reversals. If XRP maintains higher lows and builds on its current breakout, the structure favors a move toward $2.30–$2.50 in the short term. Short-Term Projections and Resistance Zones Looking ahead, immediate resistance lies between $2.20 and $2.30, with $2.50 as a stretch target. The $2.30 zone is especially critical, as it aligns with the 20-day exponential moving average—a level XRP hasn’t closed above since early March. Should the price maintain its position above $2.00 today , a retest of $2.20 appears likely. However, failure to hold above $1.9981 would weaken the bullish outlook. Prediction XRP has made an impressive move, reclaiming structure and signaling a potential reversal. The combination of bullish candlestick patterns, rising momentum , and MACD improvement all point to strengthening buyer interest. For today, April 12, XRP is projected to trade between $2.00 and $2.20, with the potential to extend higher if buying volume increases. Still, bulls must follow through with continued closes above $2.05 to fully confirm the trend shift. Patience and close monitoring of today’s price action will be key for traders.

Ethereum (ETH) has seen a staggering 77% price drop against Bitcoin (BTC) since December 2021, reflecting growing anxiety among long-term holders of the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. While ETH’s performance in US dollar terms hasn’t been all that bad, investors who bought in November 2021, when ETH reached an all-time high of $4,760, have yet to see profitable exits. Despite maintaining its second-place spot by market cap, 28.2% larger than Tether (USDT), Santiment acknowledged that Ethereum is increasingly viewed as a “laugh” by critics compared to its largest-capitalization peers. Related News: Giant Whale Gave Up: Three Days of Selling This Altcoin at a Loss, Just Sold It All Out Santiment has compiled a list of key narratives and issues that could explain Ethereum’s relative decline: Layer-2 Competition: While Ethereum’s development of Layer-2 scaling solutions has increased transaction speeds, it has also diluted investment by diverting attention and capital away from ETH itself. Investor Confusion: Ethereum’s complex series of upgrades, including Merge and other protocol changes, have left many investors uncertain, especially when compared to Bitcoin’s simple “digital gold” narrative. Slow Progress and High Fees: Delays in network improvements and persistently high transaction fees have driven users to faster, cheaper alternatives. Regulatory Concerns: Ethereum’s unclear regulatory classification has left some investors hesitant, especially since Bitcoin has a relatively clearer legal status. Rising Competitors: Blockchains like Solana and Cardano have begun to gain traction, luring users and developers away from Ethereum by offering lower fees and greater efficiency. Lack of a Clear Narrative: With Bitcoin being seen as a safe store of value and new altcoins being seen as high-risk, high-reward ventures, Ethereum’s position in between the two has become difficult to present to investors. Constant Selling Pressure: The presence of staked ETH after the upgrades led to constant selling pressure, suppressing price growth. Despite the bearish sentiment, Santiment urged the community not to underestimate Ethereum’s achievements. The network remains a hub of innovation led by founder Vitalik Buterin and a committed team of developers. Ethereum still has one of the most vibrant ecosystems in crypto, with widespread adoption across DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise blockchain applications. *This is not investment advice.

According to an analysis by prominent online cryptocurrency analyst TradingShot , the maiden digital asset is replicating a technical pattern that has preceded every major bull run. This time, it’s occurring for the second time within the same cycle, a first in the asset’s history. In a TradingView post on April 11, the analyst stated that the key driver of this projected rally is the Global Liquidity Cycle Indicator, which has formed another “higher low” on the monthly chart. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView This pattern, visible before the 2015, 2019, and 2022 bull runs, has consistently marked the beginning of parabolic moves. With Bitcoin trading above $81,000, it could be on the verge of its strongest rally if the pattern holds. Similar signals triggered rallies in past cycles, from $200 to $20,000, $3,000 to $64,000, and most recently from $16,000 to its current highs. “Bitcoin can it start an insane rally on cheap money? This huge buy formation has been present on every BTC Cycle, usually at its bottom (but on the 2015 case, a little after) and signaled the huge monetary supply into the global markets, which translates into rising prices and rallies,” the expert said. Bitcoin’s short-term outlook Now, with global liquidity rising again, Bitcoin appears primed to benefit from another wave of capital inflows, likely helping the asset exit the current consolidation phase below the $85,000 resistance zone. Meanwhile, crypto trading analyst Ali Martinez noted in an X post on April 11 that, in the short term, the leading digital asset is showing strong bullish momentum after slicing through a major resistance at $82,360. Bitcoin UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) chart. Source: Glassnode This outlook is based on on-chain data from Glassnode , which indicated that this level, previously a supply wall marked by a notable concentration of transacted BTC, has now been overcome, suggesting bulls are firmly in control. At the same time, the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) shows a thinning of resistance zones above this level, signaling that a sustained breakout could propel BTC toward the next major target at $91,500. It’s worth noting that, amid this outlook, a portion of Bitcoin holders remains underwater , but the long-term bullish outlook remains intact. This projection is due to the fact that a significant number of institutional investors continue to bet on its prospects through continued accumulation. Bitcoin price analysis As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $83,492, gaining 1.45% in the past 24 hours. On the weekly chart, however, the asset is down 0.44%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart.

BTC price jumps 12% to $83,615 since early April amid rising investor confidence. Realized cap exceeds $18B; bullish confirmation depends on sustained accumulation. Bitcoin’s long-term holders (LTHs) started buying again after a long stretch of selling that started late October 2024. The LTH Net Position Change reading (30-day total) turned positive April 6, 2025—the first time in six months. This points to a change in feeling among these holders and could set the stage for a market upturn. This change follows a large price drop where Bitcoin fell almost 32% from its November highs. How LTH Selling Stopped as Bitcoin Price Climbed Back Above $80k During the earlier selling period, deep red bars on the LTH metric reflected sustained sell-offs, culminating in a historic low of -827,750 BTC in early December. The distribution was largely blamed for dragging BTC down to sub-$75K levels. However, recent price action tells a different story.

Despite tariff uncertainty limiting risk appetite among investors, research analysts remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) long-term prospects for the next decade. “When I think about where Bitcoin will be in 10 years, there are two models I admire,” Burnett said. “One is the parallel model, which suggests that Bitcoin will be about $1.8 million in 2035.” “The other is Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin 24 model, which suggests Bitcoin will be $2.1 million by 2035.” Burnett emphasized that both are “good base cases,” adding that Bitcoin’s trajectory could exceed these predictions depending on broader macroeconomic factors. 🎙Could Bitcoin really hit $10m by Q1 2035?

He added: “The gold market is an estimated $21 trillion market. If Bitcoin just hit $21 trillion and had Bitcoin-gold parity, Bitcoin would be $1 million per coin today.” Since US President Donald Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration, global markets have been under pressure due to heightened trade war fears. Hours after taking office, Trump threatened to impose sweeping import tariffs aimed at reducing the country’s trade deficit, weighing on risk sentiment across both equities and crypto. While Bitcoin’s role as a safe-haven asset may reemerge amid ongoing trade war concerns, physical gold and tokenized gold remain the current winners. Top tokenized gold assets, trading volume.

While another 80% drawdown during future bear markets is still possible, this will act as a robust acquisition period for the “strongest” holders, Burnett said, adding: “The highs bring [Bitcoin] attention, and the deep, dark bear markets move coins into the hands of the strongest, most convicted holders, as fast as possible.” Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX and chief investment officer at Maelstrom, predicted Bitcoin could climb to $250,000 by the end of 2025 if the US Federal Reserve formally enters a quantitative easing cycle. Despite the optimistic predictions, investors remain cautious and continue “rebalancing their portfolios” but are unlikely to take on significant positions in the next 90 days before markets gain more clarity on global tariff negotiations, Enmanuel Cardozo, market analyst at real-world asset tokenization platform Brickken, told Cointelegraph. “With money flowing out of Bitcoin ETFs, investors are looking for safer spots to hold their cash right now, including strong currencies.

The struggles are similar for Bitcoin, but its digital gold status, U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve discussion, and other factors are supporting the recovery. As a result, the ETHBTC pair is declining lower, hitting a 5-year low. Why is Ethereum Price Declining Against Bitcoin? Ethereum and Bitcoin are the two best cryptos in the market, and each has a different image and use case. Interestingly, ETH has been considered far better in terms of utility, but the same utility is limiting its performance. Crypto analyst and CEO & co-founder of Coin Bureau, Nic Puckrin, has brought attention to this matter. In a detailed X post , he revealed that the Ethereum price is having a rough year, declining to a 5-year low. It is currently at 0.019 BTC and has declined nearly 125% from the peak of 0.089 BTC set in 2022. This happened due to profitability divergence, Ethereum’s MVRV Slip, demand disparity, and much more. Puckrin highlighted that Bitcoin holders are carrying higher unrealized gains than the ETH ones for the unprecedented 812 days. Adding to that, Ethereum’s MRRV dipped below 1.0. Although this data is for March, it reveals that the investors are struggling. Bitcoin & Ethereum Differences are the Catalysts For ETH’s Price Decline Nic Puckrin highlighted that there are fundamental and narrative differences between these two assets, affecting the ETHBTC pair. Nic adds, Bitcoin’s story is simple and strong: digital gold, an inflation hedge, institutional darling, etc; meanwhile, Ethereum’s story is complicated (fees burn, base layer for Defi/NFTs, and more). Now, as the DeFi TVL is stagnant, the hype of NFTs has cooled off, and there’s low demand for Ethereum, hence affecting its price. Not to mention, the increasing blockchain competition from both Layer 1 and Layer 2 is behind the drop. Lastly, the decline in the ETH price against Bitcoin is due to BTC’s exchange-traded funds, as all the big money is moving towards that. However, the same did not happen with ETH ETFs Ethereum (ETHBTC) Price to Rally if this Happened The crypto market crash is still persistent, with a few digital currencies succeeding with minor recovery. Trump’s tariff battles and rising recession odds are affecting digital assets. Interestingly, Puckrin believes the global liquidity would save this but not the ETH price against Bitcoin. Global liquidity will flood into all risky assets, including Bitcoin. Indeed, if many of the above factors continue to dog Ethereum, this liquidity will still favour Bitcoin. Although Bitcoin’s price recovery would be far better, the rising liquidity would also help ETH recover, giving better ETHBTC pair performance.

In a letter to SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, OpenSea argued that NFTs usually have only one seller per token — so platforms like theirs don’t function like traditional stock exchanges or brokers. They emphasized that all NFT transactions happen on-chain via smart contracts, with OpenSea simply acting as a discovery tool—not an intermediary, custodian, or advice-giver. To avoid future confusion, OpenSea is asking the SEC to issue clear guidance, like a bulletin or interpretive release, to confirm NFT marketplaces aren’t covered by exchange rules. This push follows OpenSea’s brush with a Wells notice last year—though the SEC dropped the investigation in early 2025 after President Donald Trump told the agency to pause crypto enforcement.

Despite currently trading well below its all-time high of $2.48 reached on January 19, 2025, Fartcoin has been forming a bullish pattern that could set the stage for upward movement. Fartcoin Price Analysis Shows Potential Path To $1.29 Resistance According to Rekt Capital’s analysis , Fartcoin has been following a predictable technical pattern that could lead to higher prices if key levels hold. The analyst notes that after identifying a potential path in mid-March, “FARTCOIN has progressively followed through on that path.” The technical formation described includes the development of a “Bull Flag” pattern, with the price pulling back to the origin point of what the analyst calls “the blue path” for a successful retest via a downside wick. Following this retest, Fartcoin rallied over 140%. The key resistance level to watch is $1.29, marked as “blue highs” in the analysis. However, reaching this target depends on Fartcoin’s ability to break and hold above the “black Range High” of approximately $0.82. The analyst notes that a “past Weekly Close above the ~$0.82 level has enabled upside in the past.” This analysis comes after Fartcoin slumped amid macroeconomic uncertainties . Major Fartcoin support points to search for upward growth Rekt Capital sees important price points Fartcoin needs to hold onto to remain strong. The report says if FARTCOIN is able to get a “Weekly Close within the black-black range, inside the orange circle, then it could allow for more buying within the range.” Source: Rekt Capital More significantly, a “Weekly Close above the black Range High of ~$0.82” might unlock further upside potential. Here, the analyst indicates that price might do a “post-breakout retest” of this level. This action might turn it new support and validate a trajectory towards the $1.29 resistance level. The $0.37 is the uppermost of the current range and is the first barrier for Fartcoin to breach in order to achieve even greater prices. Breaking through this resistance would be the first sign of further positive action. In short, the analyst states that “FARTCOIN just has to remain above either of the black levels if it does pull back, and satisfying this requirement would leave the price in position to return to $1.29 (blue highs) later.” Solana Meme Coins’ Performance Mirrors Sustained High Market Interest Fartcoin price performed amazingly well on various time frames. Statistics indicate the token rising by 75.7% over the past 7 days and a whopping 205.9% over the past 30 days. The Solana meme coin also jumped 20% on April 11 amidst the market crash. Despite all this, Fartcoin is still 64.7% off its all-time high of $2.48. This means there could be a possibility of recovery if the market is still strong and technical support is upheld. While Fartcoin hasn’t shown any major spikes in 24 hours, Solana’s price is up over 5%. Following what Rekt Capital calls a “successful retest,” the token has bounced over 140% from its recent low. This validates the technical pattern pointed out by the analyst. This sudden turnaround has piqued interest in the token’s potential to return to its previous highs.

Layer-2 networks such as Coinbase’s Base blockchain, which draw transaction activity and revenue away from Ethereum’s mainnet, are a growing concern, according to the bank. Ethereum, beset by a 42% drop in value since January and a 52% dive from its December 2024 peak, now sits near $1,929 — raising doubts among analysts about its potential for a swift rebound. Standard Chartered’s digital assets head Geoff Kendrick warns that Ethereum is in an “enduring structural decline,” as its gas fees shrink and net ETH issuance swells. Tokenized real-world assets could help revive the network’s long-term prospects — but in the near term, momentum will depend on dubious upgrades such as April’s Pectra update. With Ethereum on the wane, all eyes are turning to contenders with a clearer path to stakeholder growth — and one of the strongest candidates is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance: Presale Summary And Overview Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is taking advantage of changing investor sentiment, with phase four of its 11-stage presale underway. Since the launch, over $6.65 million has been secured and the current total supply amounts to 405 million tokens being sold to over 8,200 holders. Phased at $0.025, the current stage comes ahead of a 20% rise in phase five, taking the token to $0.03. At launch, when MUTM lists at $0.06, early participants can reap a 140% return. After touching base with reality, ambitious analysts predict that an unprecedented post-launch surge will see it soar to $3 — an 11,900% leap from today’s price — buoyed by its unique lending model and tokenomics. Mutuum finance, by contrast, has real-world utility via decentralized borrowing and lending and a buyback mechanism that sustains demand instead of speculative narratives that undergird Ethereum. Built-In Demand Drivers Mutuum Finance operates on an ecosystem approach that derives organic buy pressure by using platform revenue for repurchasing lots of MUTM tokens that are subsequently redistributed to stakers. This circular economy discourages people from selling off while rewarding long-term holding. The protocol’s mtTokens—interest-bearing assets that represent deposits like ETH or DAI—also increase utility, enabling users to earn yields on all DeFi platforms. The team recently added a dashboard that tracks the 50 top holders, who earn bonus tokens for staying in the running. When combined with a $100,000 giveaway for presale participants, these features help drive urgency with phase four coming to a close. Prioritize Security and Scalability The developers are in the final stages of a Certik audit of the Mutuum Finance smart contracts, with results to be published on official channels upon completion. The audit highlights the team’s security diligence, in contrast to Ethereum’s slow upgrades and dependence on unproven layer-2 solutions. Mutuum’s overcollateralized lending model, wherein borrowers must lock assets valued above their loans, brings stability often lacking among speculative rivals. As Ethereum hangs in the balance, Mutuum Finance’s presale presents a concrete entry point into DeFi’s utility. As phase four progresses at breakneck speed, the opportunity to get in on MUTM at $0.025 is closing. The 20% price surge of the next stage will raise entry barriers, for reward in the form of instant paper profits for existing buyers. With the revenue-sharing mechanics built into the platform and its growing user base, post-launch target of $3 per token is conservative. For investors jaded by the volatility of Ethereum, Mutuum Finance provides a structured alternative that is underwritten by provable demand. Time to Act Ethereum’s reduced outlooks illustrate the dangers of being overly exposed to assets that lack near-term catalysts. In contrast, Mutuum Finance is a beacon of transparency while also taking an aggressive approach towards growth levers that leave early backers in prime position for multiple returns. With Certik verification nearing and phase five approaching, waiting could result in leaving triple-digit profits on the table.

Since both leaders support Bitcoin, could this meeting boost BTC’s price with a big announcement? U.S.–El Salvador Meeting President Bukele will be the first leader from the Western Hemisphere to visit Trump at the White House during his current term. The meeting comes at a tense time, as the U.S. is placing high tariffs on many countries, creating global economic pressure. Several nations have already spoken with Trump, leading to a 90-day pause on tariffs, except for China. While El Salvador, however, is still facing a 10% U.S. tariff, which is likely to be one of the topics during the meeting. Bukele is also gaining attention worldwide for his tough actions against crime. He has jailed nearly 2% of El Salvador’s population in a strong crackdown on gangs like MS-13 and Tren de Aragua. Could Bitcoin Be a Main Topic? Many people are also asking if Bitcoin will be part of the meeting. El Salvador became the first country to make Bitcoin legal tender. According to Bitbo, the country now holds over 6,089 Bitcoins , worth around $508 million. Trump has also shown interest in digital money and financial freedom. So it wouldn’t be a surprise if Bitcoin is mentioned during the talks. If it is, this could bring a lot of attention to Bitcoin and possibly affect its price.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $4.66 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $14.78. Tezos started strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis.

Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs – so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward.

Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications.

XTZ’s price peaked during the bullish cycle of 2021, reaching above $9.0. After 4 April 2022, XTZ’s price plummeted below $4.0; by 9 May, it had sharply fallen below the $2 mark. XTZ surged to about $1 at the beginning of December 2022, but the bears reclaimed the market by the end of the month, resulting in a drop to $0.73. The coin made some recovery in 2023, averaging a market price of $0.8. Despite the partnership milestones achieved, Tezos (XTZ) had a largely bearish 2024. The coin reached a high of $1.4 in April but lost about 60% by August. The bulls soon entered the market, and XTZ saw renewed buyer interest, which resulted in a peak price of $0.7015 in September and $1.856 in November. The surge extended into December—Tezos XTZ recorded a maximum price of $1.909. Price corrections followed thereafter, and the coin closed the year at $1.286. In January 2025, XTZ reached a maximum price of $1.49, but in February, it lost momentum, averaging $0.72 per unit. After a failed attempt at breaking above $0.80 in early March, XTZ is currently trading below $0.55.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XTZ|FORKS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-12 11:03:00

With no bank account needed, XRP lets people send money across borders in seconds at a low cost. Of the initial 100 billion coins, 80 billion were given to Ripple to enhance the network and support the ecosystem. In today’s market, XRP stands out for its speed and low fees, making it appealing for global payments. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, which can be slower and more costly, XRP offers a swift and affordable alternative. Ripple’s work with financial institutions may boost XRP’s adoption, connecting traditional finance with crypto. With 55 billion XRP in escrow to control supply, it has potential for stability and growth. As digital transactions rise, XRP’s focus on seamless, borderless payments positions it well in the evolving market. HBAR: The Eco-Friendly Crypto Revolutionizing Digital Transactions HBAR is not just another digital coin. It’s the native currency of Hedera Hashgraph, a unique network that doesn’t use traditional blockchain like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Instead, it relies on a different technology called hashgraph. This allows for faster, more secure, and more efficient transactions. Without the need for energy-hungry mining, HBAR is kinder to the environment and keeps transaction costs low. It’s built to handle a high volume of transactions, making it ideal for finance and other sectors. In today’s market, HBAR stands out for its speed and eco-friendly approach. It faces stiff competition from well-known cryptocurrencies, but its patented technology offers advantages in performance. While this might limit community engagement compared to open-source projects, HBAR has strong backing from major industry players. Its ambitious vision makes it an attractive option. As the crypto market continues to grow, HBAR’s focus on efficiency and sustainability could make it a key player. For those seeking alternatives beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, HBAR shows promise in becoming a significant platform for digital transactions.

43248774,https://timestabloid.com/?p=63817,1744456120,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction For April 12, 2025",https://timestabloid.com/bitcoin-btc-price-prediction-for-april-12-2025/,"Bitcoin (BTC) closed April 11 at $83,423 after a volatile session that saw prices dip toward the $80K level before rebounding. BTC is holding steady at $83,377, showing minimal change (-0.06%) but notable resilience. This price action reinforces the significance of the $82,000–$83,000 zone, which has acted as a structural demand region. A consistent hold above this range may act as a springboard for a stronger bullish push in the days ahead. Rounded Bottom and Double Bottom Formation Developing A critical technical observation on the daily chart is the emergence of two bullish reversal patterns: a rounded bottom and a potential double bottom. The rounded bottom has been forming since late March, with the price gradually recovering from a steep decline. At the same time, the double bottom—marked by two significant lows near the $76,000–$78,000 range—adds weight to the bullish argument. Both patterns indicate the exhaustion of the downtrend and growing buyer interest at lower levels. MACD Flashes Early Bullish Signal Momentum indicators are beginning to align with the constructive price structure. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is showing signs of a bullish crossover. The MACD line has just moved above the signal line, and the histogram is now in positive territory at 211.44. While the MACD remains below zero, this crossover suggests a shift in momentum and the possibility of a near-term uptrend continuation. If follow-through volume appears, it would likely validate the bullish scenario. Momentum Indicator Confirms Strengthening Bias The Momentum (10) indicator has also confirmed the building strength behind Bitcoin’s recent consolidation. With a current reading of 861.13, it has moved back into positive territory for the first time in several sessions. The rise from deep negative levels reflects a steady shift from bearish to bullish momentum. This trend is essential for any sustainable recovery, as previous rallies without strong momentum have often failed to break major resistance zones. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Resistance Levels to Watch Ahead For Bitcoin to confirm this potential reversal, it must clear the next key resistance at $85,000–$86,500. This zone coincides with a previous breakdown area from early March, making it a critical hurdle. A clean break above $86,500 would open the path toward the psychological $90,000 level and potentially higher. On the flip side, failure to hold the $82,000 support zone could expose BTC to another retest of $78,000, which aligns with the double bottom’s neckline support. Low Volatility May Precede High-Impact Move Interestingly, the chart reflects declining volatility, a condition that often precedes explosive breakouts. With price consolidating and indicators flipping positive, the environment is ripe for a decisive move. If BTC closes today’s candle above $84,000 with a long body and strong volume, it could serve as the confirmation trigger for pattern breakout traders. However, if BTC prints a narrow-range doji or bearish candle below $83K, short-term consolidation may continue. Prediction Bitcoin’s price action on April 12 will likely shape the market’s next impulse. The presence of a rounded bottom and double bottom pattern, coupled with bullish shifts in both the MACD and Momentum indicators, favors a bullish outlook—provided BTC can clear immediate resistance. For today, BTC is projected to trade within a range of $82,000 to $86,500. A daily close above $84,500 would strengthen the bull case, while a breakdown below $82,000 could delay upside confirmation. Traders should stay alert for volume spikes and intraday structure shifts that could signal the breakout’s rally.

CZ is both my mentor and close friend,” Sun posted on X on April 11. Sun Brushes Aside Gossip, Mentions Personal Confidence Sun solidified his good working relationship with Zhao and stated, “He has been an important role in being supportive of me in my entrepreneurial life.” His statement came after a Wall Street Journal article reported Zhao consented to cooperate with U.S. authorities by sharing information on Sun as part of his own plea deal. Zhao in April of 2024 was also jailed for four months for AML law breach. The report, the sources reported, stated that the deal “hadn’t been previously revealed.” Current SEC Case and Zhao’s Silence Sun and the SEC both submitted a joint request in February of 2025 to halt the regulator’s suit against him to pursue settlement options.

He highlighted the recent shift in the US government’s crypto stance and also noted a crucial area that still needs clarification. In the interview, Garlinghouse discussed the conclusion of the Ripple SEC case and the future of crypto regulations in the US . Ripple’s recent acquisition of Hidden Road for $2 billion was also discussed which is considered to be one of the largest acquisitions in the history of crypto.

But as the situation has drastically changed, Ripple is reclaiming most of the money along with the interest earned. Now the agency has agreed to drop the appeal and lift the permanent injunction. The SEC and the US will still be receiving $50 million each , and Ripple is currently in talks to make those payments in XRP instead of U.S. dollars.

Under an initiative led by Trump, the US government is building a crypto reserve that currently holds $16B in crypto assets like Bitcoin, Ether, USDT and BNB, although there is no XRP yet. Notably, the government will only accept crypto assets from civil or criminal forfeitures. Therefore, if Ripple pays its fine in XRP, then it could finally get a spot in the government’s growing stash of digital assets. The $50 million in SEC’s fine in XRP could amount to about 24.63 million coins at a current price of $2.03 each. However, the settlement still needs SEC approval with the commissioners set to vote in a closed-door meeting. It remains to be seen if the US will accept the fine in XRP and its broader implications on the market. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Speaking at the SEC’s April 11 Crypto Task Force roundtable titled “Between a Block and a Hard Place: Tailoring Regulation for Crypto Trading,” Uyeda suggested that conditional exemptive relief could serve as a regulatory bridge to encourage growth without sacrificing oversight. “A time-limited, conditional exemptive relief framework for registrants and non-registrants could allow for greater innovation with blockchain technology within the United States in the near term,” the SEC chair said, calling for public input on areas where such relief might make the most impact. The proposal comes at a time when crypto companies are increasingly burdened by a confusing mix of state and federal regulations. Uyeda warned against the growing fragmentation of oversight across states, noting that navigating a patchwork of licensing regimes has become a serious hurdle for firms hoping to bring tokenized securities and other digital assets to market. A unified federal framework, he argued, would ease those burdens significantly by offering a single SEC licensing path—rather than requiring compliance with dozens of individual state laws. Blockchain’s Role in Capital Efficiency Beyond just easing legal bottlenecks, Uyeda underscored blockchain’s growing relevance in modern finance. He highlighted its potential to transform capital markets, particularly in clearing, settlement, and collateral management. “Blockchains can be used to manage and mobilize collateral in tokenized form to increase capital efficiency and liquidity,” he said, pointing to faster and more reliable settlement possibilities. His comments mark a major tone shift from the Gary Gensler era, when the SEC took a far more skeptical view of blockchain’s financial value. Uyeda’s remarks were met with optimism by crypto industry figures at the roundtable, including representatives from Uniswap Labs, Cumberland DRW, and Coinbase. Uyeda Stirs Policy Waters Uyeda, who has held the acting chair role since January 20 following Gensler’s departure , will continue to lead the SEC until President Trump’s nominee, Paul Atkins, is officially sworn in. The Senate confirmed Atkins in a 52–44 vote on April 10. Before the transition, Uyeda has signaled a willingness to reconsider or even withdraw legacy proposals from the Biden administration, including stricter crypto custody rules for investment advisers. “We’re working closely with the crypto task force to explore more fitting alternatives,” he said, offering a glimpse into a potentially more open-minded SEC under his brief but impactful leadership.

43248104,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=391448,1744456961,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/43248104.jpeg,Active Crypto Developers Drop 40% in a Year — What’s Going On?,https://cryptopotato.com/active-crypto-developers-drop-40-in-a-year-whats-going-on/,"The number of active developers in the crypto space has plummeted by double digits over the past year, signaling that the industry may face deeper challenges in the long term due to a lack of significant on-chain activity. Data from the crypto metrics aggregator Artemis Terminal shows that weekly active developers have fallen 40% from 12,000 in the second week of April 2024 to 7,290 in the last week of March. This figure even fell below 5,270 in the last two weeks of December 2024 before recovering slightly in January, indicating that the past few months have witnessed low developer activity. Active Crypto Devs Decline Developer activity in the crypto ecosystem often indicates overall health and long-term sustainability. According to Artemis data, there are 1,521 ecosystems in the crypto space, with some having at least 100 sub-ecosystems. A reduction in developer activity suggests decreased innovation and a lack of maintenance across crypto protocols, raising doubts about the industry’s long-term potential. Binji Pande, a contributor to the Ethereum-based layer-2 network Optimism, said the decline in developer activity suggests that attention has shifted, incentives have “dried up,” and speculation is moving faster than utility in the crypto space. In an X post, Pande explained that the crypto industry is rife with narrative-led development when there should be more development-led narratives. He insisted that the industry needs to go back to the basics, think about and support applications that make crypto feel futuristic again, harnessing the sector’s unprecedented capital formation to invest in the future. According to Pande, the industry has come a long way; however, it appears that things have gone wrong. What is Happening? Furthermore, the Optimism developer mentioned that people who are building real applications rarely get the spotlight, and capital in the crypto space still flows to short-term “dopamine loops.” Currently, there is not much to do on-chain. Unfortunately, Pande believes the lack of significant on-chain activity means distribution starts to lose its power, and worse still, the game of chasing dopamine loops is beginning to collapse under its weight. He asserted that the market needs additional support for developers and more teams thinking about end-to-end products, not just code. He added that builders need to understand that adoption has to be earned in a hard and gritty way. The Optimism contributor said the next era of crypto will be unlocked by meaningful on-chain activity, not a bull market driven by trade winds.

New Hampshire's House passed its Bitcoin reserve bill on April 10th, in a 192–179 vote, and it will now move to the Senate. On the other hand, Florida's House Insurance and Banking Committee passed the state’s reserve bill with a unanimous vote. This development is likely to renew interest among investors looking for the best crypto to buy now. What Do These New Bills Contain and How Could They Impact the Crypto Economy? New Hampshire's House bill, HB302 , has clarified that once the state’s Senate and Governor Ayotte sign it into law, the state treasurer would gain the authority to use 10% of the state's general funds and other authorized funds to invest in precious metals as well as digital assets. The bill also outlines how the custody of these assets will be maintained. The fine print of the bill specifies that only cryptocurrencies with a market cap of over $500 billion will be eligible for investment — effectively narrowing it down to Bitcoin alone. At the time of writing, Bitcoin has the largest market cap at $1.6 trillion, far surpassing Ethereum, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, which sits at $187 billion. On the same day, Florida's House Insurance and Banking Committee also passed its Bitcoin reserve bill, HB487 . This bill didn’t face any contention, and three committees cleared it before it progressed to Florida’s House. The bill is similar to New Hampshire’s, with the Chief Financial Officer and the State Board of Administration gaining the authority to invest up to 10% of certain state funds into Bitcoin. These state funds include the General Revenue Fund, the Budget Stabilization Fund, all trust funds and agency funds of each state agency, funds of any board, association, or entity created by the state constitution, and any other state fund deemed appropriate by the legislature. Like New Hampshire’s House bill, this one also outlines how digital assets will be secured. It states that the Chief Financial Officer will hold the Bitcoin through a secure self-custody solution — either on behalf of the State of Florida by a qualified custodian or in the form of an exchange-traded product (ETP). How would these bills impact the market? The answer to that will depend on when the bills are enacted and when the Bitcoin reserves begin operating. In the short term, these announcements have done little to move BTC’s price. It seems that the community is now more focused on where regulatory action leads, rather than reacting to announcements that have been occurring almost daily. Best Crypto to Buy Now – Top Altcoin Picks to Capitalize on Rising Institutional Interest in Bitcoin While there has been little to no impact from the recent news on Bitcoin’s price for now, things could change once these bills become law. As Bitcoin enters the government domain of one country, it could spark interest in other nations still on the fence about crypto. This could trigger a chain reaction, potentially lifting the entire cryptocurrency market. For now, however, the following ICOs could be considered the top picks to invest in. BTC Bull The hope among the broader cryptocurrency community is that the regulatory interest Bitcoin has been receiving will eventually push it into a bull run. However, low-cap investors may not be able to capitalize on those gains. That’s where BTC Bull steps in with its unique approach of blending meme coin appeal with a bullish narrative around Bitcoin. The mascot headlining this project is a strong and muscular bull, creating an ambiance of bullishness around Bitcoin. However, that’s not why BTC Bull stands out from its peers. The unique factors of this meme coin emerge from its tokenomics. BTC Bull has a total supply similar to Bitcoin — but in a meme-fied format. The second factor is its milestone system. BTC Bull does not have a traditional social or technical roadmap, as it does not aim for long-term utility. Instead, it connects its fundamentals — such as token burns and Bitcoin airdrops — directly to Bitcoin’s growth. The milestone campaign will continue until Bitcoin reaches $250K. Beyond that, BTC Bull will rely on community interest to sustain itself. While some long-term perks could emerge, BTC Bull currently does not advertise any. It’s this honesty that could make BTC Bull the best crypto to buy now. While there are no long-term perks involved, in the short term, this project could grow in value drastically, given the current market conditions. SUBBD While meme coins have their place, one should not ignore what progressive crypto regulations could mean for utility-driven tokens. The emergence of better and more diverse use cases could significantly strengthen the cryptocurrency market. SUBBD has entered the space with such novel ideas and aims to create an ecosystem that supports both content creators and their fans. It is a decentralized content creation platform that addresses the current pain points of centralized platforms by introducing crypto payments as the norm, delivering AI-driven administrative tools, and offering a gamified ecosystem to redefine the standard fan–creator relationship. With an audience of over 250 million across all social platforms, SUBBD is in the process of onboarding over 2,000 top-earning creators. Referred to as ""honeys,"" these creators present their content — including images and videos — through a highly optimized UI that also includes AI tools to create influencers and fulfill custom requests. Unlike traditional platforms like Fansly and OnlyFans, SUBBD has adopted a gamified system based on XP multipliers, credits, and more. Earning these points gives fans exclusive access to never-seen-before content. SUBBD has also developed a simplified Telegram bot that enhances personalized content creation and sharing. SUBBD may be straightforward and utility-centric in its approach, but the utility it offers — combined with the popularity of its featured models (""honeys"") — has allowed it to raise over $145 million in a very short time. She’s got brains, beauty, and better onboarding than half of Web3.UX is clean, fast, and yes… I helped design it.Creator dashboards. AI chat. Fan experiences with actual taste.Darling, we don’t do MVPs here - only glow-ups.xoxo,Your SUBBD girl 💻💄 pic.twitter.com/KCTG7ryzNA — SUBBD (@SUBBDofficial) April 5, 2025 The project has already gained a strong foothold on social media, with over 125K followers on Twitter. Its posts are consistently receiving high engagement. Best Wallet Token As Bitcoin builds momentum, new use cases may emerge — and that could lead to a wave of new investors looking to buy and store Bitcoin. Best Wallet, with its multi-chain capabilities, could be considered one of the best new options to buy, sell, and store BTC. Best Wallet is a decentralized ecosystem powered by the Best Wallet Token . While it is primarily designed as a wallet, its features extend beyond basic storage. Users gain access to staking perks, early investment opportunities, portfolio management tools, and even the ability to interact with select partner casinos. Best Wallet’s security features are also one of its standout attributes, primarily due to its integration with FireBlocks. FireBlocks is a recognized heavyweight in crypto security, and it removes the typical ""passphrase"" requirement — allowing users to interact with Best Wallet using only a username and password. Best Wallet is part of a growing decentralized ecosystem, powered by its native token. As a result, the wallet is set to evolve over time, adding new features that are not yet listed. Some tools — such as portfolio management and market insights analysis — are already under development. Best Wallet also understands the importance of educating investors. That’s why it has launched its own YouTube channel, offering tutorials on topics like how to open a wallet and even explaining the basics of Bitcoin. As for the token itself, many YouTubers — including Cilinix Crypto — have highlighted its profit potential. Known for his informed skepticism toward crypto presales, Cilinix Crypto has called Best Wallet the presale he trusts the most. Summary The Bitcoin reserve bills gaining ground in Florida and New Hampshire highlight a joint effort by regulatory bodies and cryptocurrency enthusiasts to push Bitcoin beyond being just a speculative asset. This could inspire broader confidence in the cryptocurrency market and contribute to its overall growth. However, since Bitcoin is a high-cap asset, it may remain out of reach for some investors. That means those looking for the next best cryptocurrency with explosive potential should consider exploring crypto ICOs. The three options listed here show immense promise. BTC Bull rides the wave of speculation that could drive short-term gains.

43248425,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=709033,1744457400,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43248425.jpeg,Mutuum Finance (MUTM): The Altcoin Poised to Transform DeFi Lending Forever,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/mutuum-finance-mutm-the-altcoin-poised-to-transform-defi-lending-forever/,"Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is strongly emerging as a new paradigm of lending framework, captivating investors in a manner never before seen! The project has already raised $6,500,000, sold over 400 million tokens, and has 8,100 holders and is now making paves in Phase 4 of its presale. At just $0.025, this stage represents a discount before an expected rise in phase 5. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) phase 5 will see a jump of 20%, and investors are incentivized to strike before the next jump. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), built on a hybrid lending model that mixes decentralized lending, and systematic buy pressure is preparing to be a pillar of DeFi’s evolution mixing utility along with investor incentives. Mutuum Finance Presale Momentum and Immediate Gains At $0.025 in Phase 4 before the price ascends to $0.03, it’s a tight window in which to enter. Early birds can achieve a 140% return at launch, as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be priced at $0.06. It’s not speculation — it’s written into the tokenomics, and the presale structure has been set to ramp up value incrementally. In fact, analysts expect Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to trade for between $1.50 and $3.50 within months following its respective exchange debuts, propelled by its unique revenue-redistribution mechanics and increasing user base. That translates into potential returns of more than 5,900% for anyone who locks up tokens today. New Mechanics Driving Demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a unique approach where it offers mtTokens, which are dynamic assets that represent user deposits such as ETH or DAI. These tokens generate interest over time and allow holders to passively earn while remaining liquid. Also, the platform’s buy-and-distribute process will use a fraction of protocol revenue to buy back Mutuum Finance (MUTM) from the market and return tokens back to stakers. This generates sustained demand, countering sell-offs, stabilizing long-term value. Peer-to-peer lending expands utility even more, facilitating direct negotiations for assets outside of traditional pools, such as various meme coins. Incentives and Strategic Transparency A dashboard recently has been launched, featuring a leaderboard of the top 50 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) holders, who earn bonus tokens for keeping their places — a move to bring about greater transparency and competition. Speculative players can rejoice, as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is finalizing a smart contract audit with Certik, yet another milestone to be communicated through traditional channels. This move highlights the team’s focus on security, an essential factor in the growing interest of institutions in DeFi. Unlike other tokens that depend on hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has mechanisms in place for growth. The presale’s swift progression — Phase 1 sold out in days — reflects increasing demand. And current Mutuum Finance (MUTM) investors are buying much more than tokens; they’re buying a stake in a protocol that is on track to become the giant of decentralized lending. As Phase 4 comes close to its ceiling, indecision threatens to put you in the second or even the last tier of pricing. Everything Points To An Early Advantage Mutuum Finance (MUTM) rises above speculative trends by coupling financial utility with strategic tokenomics. This is by far one of the best DeFi presale performance so far, with audit progress and new distribution models. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the call to action for investors wanting assets backed by real-world use and exponential growth potential. The $0.025 entry window is closing — now is the time to act or risk watching the next rise from the sidelines. Join Mutuum Finance (MUTM) today before Phase 4 is over! Head over to the official Mutuum Finance (MUTM) website to join and keep an eye on the leaderboard for extra prizing.

43248775,https://timestabloid.com/?p=63823,1744457642,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Beyond Ondo & Celestia: Is This AI Token the Ultimate ‘Under $1’ Crypto Bet?,https://timestabloid.com/beyond-ondo-celestia-is-this-ai-token-the-ultimate-under-1/,"What occurs when traditional finance opts to embrace blockchain rather than resist it? We’re witnessing it right now, with notable examples such as Mastercard incorporating tokenized assets through Ondo Finance (ONDO, ~$0.8901). At the same time, new layer infrastructure like Celestia’s modular blockchain (TIA, ~$2.50) is gaining traction, which is indicative of healthy market sentiment. As institutions shift towards embracing tokenization and other next-generation solutions, the search for the best crypto purchases increases, particularly for those crypto assets that trade well under $1 but have enormous upside potential. With this backdrop, the FloppyPepe (FPPE, ~$0.0000002) presale stands out as an intriguing high-risk/high-reward alternative to traditional investments that require consideration immediately. FloppyPepe (FPPE): Enormous Opportunity From Minimal Cost FloppyPepe (FPPE) , currently sitting at around $0.0000002 in presale, represents the epitome of the “under $1” opportunity and aims to construct a distinctive AI-powered community ecosystem centred around engagement with users at a much higher level beyond speculation. Its proposed structure integrates advanced AI tools such as the FloppyAI chatbot and the FloppyX video framework to enable animated user interactions. In addition, community management through DAO governance alongside a simplified content creation tool strives to elevate participants’ agency and foster organic expansion. Purposeful, Unique Tokenomics It stands out even more because of its typical 3% transaction fee approach, which adds even more utility and value fractalization. One-third of the fee (1%) is set aside for wildlife conservation projects, embedding charitable undertakings into the project. Another 1% rewards holders through redistribution, creating passive income opportunities, while the last 1% is burnt, creating deflationary pressure and increasing scarcity within the 120 trillion token supply over time. Presale Opportunity & Explosive ROI The primary reasoning behind considering the FloppyPepe presale a top buy now is the reason the presale phase can be regarded as ground floor combined with staggering growth potential. The reason is 60% of its tokens are set aside for early rounds with large funding targets (20M/45M caps). Speculating 0.01 as a target would mean almost a 5 billion% increase from the presale price, meaning turning 100 dollars into 5 million. This massive upside further cements its volatile, high-reward nature profile for investors that want explosive returns from a micro-cap entry. Ondo Finance (ONDO): Bridging Traditional and Digital Finance Ondo Finance (ONDO) , which sits at a price of $0.8901, is bridging TradFi and DeFi by partnering with Mastercard to bring tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) such as U.S. government treasuries onto the blockchain. Enabling businesses and institutions to seamlessly access tokenized assets improves operational efficiency, especially in cross-border payments and treasury management. Dominating the compliant institutional-grade RWA market streams, Ondo is emerging as a leader in driving blockchain adoption in the traditional financial system. Celestia (TIA): The Modular Blockchain Powerhouse Priced close to $2.50, Celestia (TIA) is distinguished for offering a pioneering modular blockchain architecture where data availability and consensus are separated from the execution layers, making it more flexible and scalable. Developers will be able to more easily deploy custom blockchains or rollups for specific applications, whether it is for DeFi, gaming, or anything else. Recent interest from the market and resilience in price have strengthened the narrative for Celestia, making it one of the first infrastructure blockchains in the ecosystem for the future of scalable Web3. Which Crypto Holds the Most Promise? During the search for leading crypto investments as of April 11, Ondo Finance and Celestia demonstrated key milestones in TradFi integration and blockchain infrastructure, respectively. Nonetheless, for those investors targeting potentially explosive upside from a currently sub-$1 project, FloppyPepe (FPPE) offers the most radical opportunity. Its vastly community-oriented AI vision, coupled with avowedly strategic tokenomics and ROI potential stemming from its outrageous presale price, all encapsulate the best comparison of high-risk, high-reward. All the while, FloppyPepe supports Ondo and Celestia, who build vital bridges and infrastructure and speculate on what could be the next wave of crypto exponential growth.

New Hampshire becomes the fourth state to pass such legislation, joining Texas, Arizona, and Oklahoma. New Hampshire Approves Bitcoin Reserve Bill The bill will now head to the Senate for discussions before potentially returning to Governor Kelly Ayotte’s desk for approval. If passed, the bill would allow the state’s treasury to invest 10% of New Hampshire’s general fund, revenue stabilization fund, or any other legislatively approved fund towards certain digital assets and precious metals, including Gold, silver, and platinum. The bill also defines how the assets must be held. New Hampshire Representative and bill proposer Keith Ammon stated, “We’re tied to the U.S. dollar, whether we like it or not, but this would allow us to have the state invest a small portion into this uncorrelated, new asset class.” However, the bill places stringent requirements for an asset to be included in the fund, specifying that only assets and cryptocurrencies with a market capitalization of over $500 billion would be eligible for inclusion, a criteria currently met only by Bitcoin (BTC). New Hampshire’s treasury had around $3.6 billion in funds as of its most recent annual report. This would allow the state to buy $181 million worth of precious metals or BTC. If spent exclusively on BTC, New Hampshire could purchase around 2,269 BTC at current prices. The bill also states that the purchased assets must be held by a qualified custodian, by the treasurer, with a secure custody solution, or via an exchange-traded product (ETF) from a registered investment company. An Unnecessary Bill The bill faced opposition from some quarters of the house, with Democrat Representative Terry Spahr arguing the bill was not needed and could undermine the future security of the state’s digital asset stockpile. “Unbeknownst to the committee and to the sponsor the treasurer testified that they already have that authority. Cryptocurrency is “constantly shifting and changing, and it’s sort of dangerous to be kind of locked into certain types of security measures, and I think that bill does this.” However, Republican Representative Jordan Ulery countered Spahr, stating that the bill was necessary as it could “create the potential for a large amount of money being earned by the state in these investments.” New Hampshire has two other blockchain-related bills: HB310, which covers stablecoins and real-world asset tokenization, and HB639, which deals with blockchain regulation and dispute resolution. Florida House Committee Passes Bitcoin Reserve Bill Meanwhile, Florida’s House Insurance and Banking Committee unanimously passed the state’s Bitcoin reserve bill, HB487. The bill must now clear three committees before it reaches the House. The bill would allow Florida’s Chief Financial Officer and the State Board of Administration to invest up to 10% of some state funds, including the General Revenue Fund and the Budget Stabilization Fund into BTC. The bill’s sponsor, Republican Representative Webster Barnaby claimed it would “put Florida on the leading edge of this new technology.” The bill allows the state’s financial chief to invest in digital assets through qualified custodians or ETFs. It also details security and custody requirements. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The flagship cryptocurrency has gained over 5% during the week and is up almost 3% over the past 24 hours. Growing fears of stagflation are pushing investors towards assets like Bitcoin, which are viewed as immune to monetary erosion. Whales Loading Up On Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin (BTC) has registered modest gains over the past 24 hours as it climbed back above $83,000, recovering from a correction that took the price to a low of $74,393 earlier in the week. BTC’s recovery comes after President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs, giving markets a much-needed respite. However, BTC remains almost 24% lower than its all-time high, set in January. The flagship cryptocurrency’s recovery coincides with growing interest from large-scale holders. According to on-chain data shared by CryptoQuant analyst Burak Kesmeci, wallets associated with long-term investors received 48,575 BTC . The inflow, the largest since February 2022, totaled $3.6 billion in value. According to the analyst, the timing is significant because it mirrors a similar event from the past in scale and macroeconomic backdrop. Kesmeci stated that these accumulation wallets typically increase holdings during market pullbacks. The April 9 accumulation occurred when the asset was trading around $76,000, a level tested during last week’s selloff. The volume and pattern of inflows suggest a recurring strategy among institutional investors where they capitalize on corrections and accumulate during uncertainty. The total value of inflows matches a similar event that unfolded on February 1, 2022, another phase of broad macroeconomic instability. “Massive $3.6 Billion Bitcoin Inflow to Accumulation Addresses! Bitcoin accumulation addresses received 48,575 BTC — the largest single-day inflow since February 1, 2022. When accumulation addresses move this aggressively, it’s worth paying attention.” Another CryptoQuant analyst noted that whale wallets holding large BTC balances have resumed buying since March. According to the analyst, more than 100,000 BTC have been added to whale reserves since March. Crypto Needs Short-Term Solutions Acting Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Mark Uyeda believes a fast-tracked temporary crypto regulatory framework could bolster innovation within the US crypto industry while lawmakers work on permanent regulatory measures. Uyeda made the comments during a discussion at the SEC’s April 11 Crypto Task Force roundtable. “A time-limited, conditional exemptive relief framework for registrants and non-registrants could allow for greater innovation with blockchain technology within the United States in the near term.” Uyeda believes this could be the short-term answer while the SEC works on a long-term solution. He also flagged state-by-state regulation of crypto as a concern, warning it could lead to a patchwork of state licensing regimes. According to the acting SEC Chair, a favorable federal regulatory framework would ease the burden on market participants wishing to offer tokenized securities and non-security crypto assets, allowing them to operate under a single SEC license instead of a different one in each state. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) surged past $83,000 on Friday, reporting substantial gains after President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs. Investors have turned to Bitcoin as fears of stagflation grow, pushing market participants towards assets seen as immune to monetary erosion. BTC’s latest jump comes after Trump hiked tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%, sparking concerns about supply chain disruptions, rising consumer prices, and faltering growth. “China has raised their tariffs on US goods from 84% to 125% as President Trump has raised tariffs on China goods to 145%.” The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index dropped to 54 in April, its lowest level in six months, further adding to market uncertainty. Core CPI numbers also cooled to 2.8% year-over-year, underscoring persistent price stickiness despite a cooling economy. Meanwhile, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned shareholders that current trade tensions between the US and China risk raising inflation and increasing the possibility of a recession. Bitcoin registered a marginal increase last Friday but was back in the red over the weekend, dropping 0.48% on Saturday to $83,423. Bearish sentiment intensified on Sunday as BTC plunged over 6%, slipping below $80,000 and settling at $78,301. The price faced volatility on Monday thanks to uncertainty fueled by rumors of a tariff pause. As a result, BTC fell to a low of $74,393 before surging past $80,000 and then dropping to settle at $79,164, ultimately registering an increase of 1.10%. However, BTC was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping almost 4% and settling at $76,283. Source: TradingView Markets surged on Wednesday after President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause in tariffs. As a result, BTC surged over 8% to reclaim $80,000 and settle at $82,593. However, the flagship cryptocurrency lost momentum on Thursday, dropping almost 4%, slipping below $80,000 and settling at $79,592. The price recovered on Friday, rising almost 5% to reclaim $80,000, move past $83,000 and settle at $83,370. The current session sees BTC marginally up as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. Buyers will look to maintain control and push BTC past $85,000.

Funds reportedly routed through FTX and used for high-risk trades and staff payments. Prosecutors link Steaker’s operations to violations of Taiwan’s Banking Act. Taiwanese authorities have charged four senior executives of digital asset management platform Steaker for allegedly raising NT$1.48 billion ($45.8 million) through unauthorized cryptocurrency investment schemes. The Taipei Prosecutors’ Office confirmed the charges Thursday, pointing to Banking Act rules about taking deposits without a license. Steaker founder Huang Weixuan, Chief Technology Officer Xiu Minjie, Chief Marketing Officer Lu Tianxin, and Chief Operations Officer Pan Yiting face charges over the operation. The prosecution has requested the court to penalize the company under the Banking Act.

Hayes tells his 679,700 followers on the social media platform X that the sudden selling-off of US treasuries and rising 10-year bond yields is likely to result in the printing of more money, which has ignited massive Bitcoin rallies in the past. “It’s on like Donkey Kong. We will be getting more policy responses this weekend if this keeps up. We are about to enter UP ONLY mode for BTC.” Source: Arthur Hayes/X Hayes also believes that the weakening of China’s yuan due to central bank money printing may cause investors to move their wealth into Bitcoin as a hedge. “No deal. PBOC (People’s Bank of China) continues a very gradual yuan weakening. Sh*t ’bout to get spicy. Luckily, BTC loves money printing and associated CNY (Chinese yuan) weakness.” Lastly, Hayes says that banks will likely be granted a Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) exemption being advocated for by JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. The exemption would allow banks to hold more Treasuries without increasing required capital reserves, giving banks more liquidity to lend. “What Jamie Dimon wants, Jamie Dimon gets. SLR exemption is what we need to send BTC orbital.” Bitcoin is trading for $83,343 at time of writing, up 4.9% in the last 24 hours.

According to reports, the court mandated that all unlawful cryptocurrency trading across the country must be eliminated, giving a two-month deadline to achieve the goal. According to reports , the court wants Pakistan to first formulate a strategy to curb the issue across the country, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. It has also ordered the government to submit a comprehensive report to this effect. The ruling was delivered by a bench comprising Justice Syed Arshad and Justice Dr Khurshid Iqbal. The case was brought about by a petition submitted by Barrister Huzaifa Ahmad, who represented himself in court. According to the petitioner, the term digital currency has evolved greatly in this technological era. He added that it means money can now be moved digitally, with no legal structure or legislation in place to govern such currencies. The federal government of Pakistan was represented by the Deputy Attorney General, Bilal Durrani, in the case. Pakistani lawyer submits petition to regulate crypto trading According to the petitioner, the State Bank of Pakistan had already ruled such internet commercial transactions as unlawful in a notification released by the bank in 2018. In the circular shared by the bank, digital assets were said to be unauthorized for the purchase or exchange of goods. “Virtual Currencies (VCs) like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Pakcoin, OneCoin, DasCoin, Pay Diamond, etc., or Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) tokens are not legal tender, issued or guaranteed by the Government of Pakistan. SBP has not authorized or licensed any individual or entity for the issuance, sale, purchase, exchange or investment in any such Virtual Currencies/Coins/Tokens in Pakistan,” the statement said. It also ordered all payment service providers and operators to refrain from providing any services to any individual or venture dealing in such services. “In view of the foregoing, all Banks/ DFIs/ Microfinance Banks and Payment System Operators (PSOs)/Payment Service Providers (PSPs) are advised to refrain from processing, using, trading, holding, transferring value, promoting, and investing in Virtual Currencies/Tokens,” it added. However, according to the petitioner, individuals and firms are still using these various internet channels to carry out transactions. He mentioned that coaching centers and training academies in the K-P not only provide Bitcoin and Forex trading services, they also market these services on social media platforms, including TikTok, Facebook, and YouTube. Peshawar High Court orders probe into illegal crypto trading In his claims, the petitioner mentioned that operators and traders have been carrying out these activities online for a while, noting that they collect, withdraw, and freeze cash online. He also added that the right authorities have taken no actions against these activities despite knowing about them. He added that he has written to the relevant authorities over the last few years, but they have yet to respond to his letters or carry out the needed actions. According to the laws of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), firms that want to carry out activities like that need to first register under the securities exchange laws. However, those companies and training academies are not registered, even though they may be a source of income in terms of tax for the federal government. He also cautioned about the dangers of using digital assets for money laundering and terrorist financing. The petitioner mentioned that these types of trade could severely undermine the national security of the country. “Therefore, it is the responsibility of the federal and provincial governments to ban such illegal businesses and to shut down the institutions and academies involved in crypto and forex trading avenues to carry out terrorism, gambling, and other anti-state activities,” he said. He requested that the court order the government to pass legislation to prohibit such illegal companies and force the Federal Investigation Agency and other relevant agencies to act. The deputy attorney general, representing the federal government, told the court that the government is in the process of formulating legislation and needs about a month to complete it. In response, the bench gave the government two months, with the court later postponing the hearing, while directing the federal government to provide a policy within the period.

Titled “Approaching the Tokenisation Tipping Point,” the report forecasts that the tokenisation of real-world assets could explode into an $18.9 trillion market by 2033. That’s a massive shift, and it’s already having an impact on XRP, which has just crossed the crucial $2 mark. But here’s the burning question—could $2.25 be the next milestone? Stick with us as we break down the key insights from this report and explore what’s driving XRP’s rise. Ripple and BCG Predict Explosive Tokenisation Growth The Ripple-BCG report predicts that the tokenisation of real-world assets will grow from $0.6 trillion in 2025 to $18.9 trillion by 2033. The report asserts that tokenisation will revamp the entire financial system of the world. It explains how it will work miracles in the areas of fractional ownership, instant transfer and regulatory compliance. The report also highlights XRP’s potential to become a major player in this new tokenised financial environment. As one of the top cryptocurrencies by market value, XRP is already showing strong market performance. Over the past year, XRP has risen by an impressive 238.2%. XRP Price Analysis At the beginning of 2025, XRP was trading at $2.08. On January 16, it reached an all-time high of $3.399. Between January 1 and 17, the price grew by about 57.94%. However, since January 18, XRP has been in decline, falling by around 37.36%. The market has been moving within a descending trendline since mid-January, holding back further upward movement. April Volatility: Highs, Lows, and Rebounds On April 1, XRP was priced near $2.09. It jumped to $2.2322 on April 2 but dropped by the end of the day to $2.0229. Between April 3 and 5, it managed a 5.92% rebound, but this was followed by a 16.16% correction from April 6 to 8. There was strong buying pressure on April 9, but it wasn’t enough to recover fully from the earlier dip. Currently, XRP stands at $2.06, holding just above the important $2 support level. Over the past 24 hours, the price has climbed 1.7%. So, Is Momentum Building? XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart has risen to 46.12, after hitting a low of 32.12 on April 8. This suggests that buying interest is growing and momentum may be shifting in favor of the bulls. The 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), currently at $1.9506, is acting as a strong support level. Still, for a lasting upward trend to begin, XRP needs to break above the descending trendline that has capped its rallies since January. XRP Liquidation and Derivatives Data Analysis Market data shows that short liquidations, worth $336,810, are significantly higher than long liquidations at $241,800. This indicates that traders betting against XRP are being forced out of their positions. Source : Coinglass At the same time, open interest in XRP derivatives has increased by 1.4% to $3.08 billion, suggesting that more capital is entering the market. Crypto-Friendly Policies Under Trump Since Donald Trump began his second term as President of the United States, the political climate has become more favorable for crypto . His administration has taken several steps to support the industry: A dedicated crypto task force has been set up to create a clear regulatory framework New laws have been introduced to block the IRS from collecting certain crypto-related tax data The long-running legal battle between the SEC and Ripple has finally been resolved The Trump administration has also placed pro-crypto leaders in important roles, many of whom are directly or indirectly connected to the cryptocurrency sector. Global Risks Remain Despite Local Optimism Even with strong domestic support, the crypto market isn’t immune to global economic challenges. Trump’s aggressive tariff strategy has caused disruptions across asset markets, including crypto. While the administration recently paused the full rollout of these tariffs for 90 da ys , tensions with China have increased. New, tougher tariffs have been imposed on Chinese imports, and the long-term effects of this trade conflict remain uncertain. What’s Next: Can XRP Break Through? In summary, XRP’s push toward $2.25 depends on whether it can break above the descending trendline that has limited its recent gains. A strong daily close above this resistance level, along with support from the rising RSI and the 200-day EMA, could mark the beginning of a sustained uptrend. However, traders should remain cautious. Macroeconomic uncertainty and technical resistance near past highs could still pose short-term challenges. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

With institutional support, ecosystem expansion, and NFT traction, SOL continues to show resilience — but it’s not the fastest climber this week. That title belongs to a new entrant grabbing headlines and dominating social sentiment: MAGACOIN FINANCE . SOLANA’S CONSOLIDATION VS. VIRAL MOMENTUM While Solana’s price action reflects healthy consolidation and long-term investor confidence, its weekly gains have started to flatten. The Q2 2025 market is shifting from established narratives to new, high-upside plays — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is seizing the spotlight. Across X, Reddit, and Telegram, the chatter is growing. Crypto influencers are calling it a “sleeper meme coin with 2,900% potential,” and watchlist activity is spiking fast. MAGACOIN FINANCE OUTPERFORMS — WITHOUT EVEN LISTING PRESALE SELLING OUT – CLICK HERE TO SECURE A SPOT NOW Unlike SOL, which benefits from exchange volume and institutional inflow, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in its prelaunch phase — and yet it’s already outpacing majors in weekly percentage growth. According to several tracking dashboards and community updates, the coin is nearing new milestones in early support, all while its presale stages continue to fill. That’s without a CEX listing, DEX trading, or major marketing spend — just pure viral buzz. It’s reminiscent of how PEPE and SHIBA built momentum before their blow-ups — only now, the meme coin crowd is more seasoned, more aggressive, and moving faster on new opportunities. WHY TRADERS ARE SHIFTING FOCUS JOIN OVER 12,500+ INVESTORS – SECURE YOUR SPOT NOW Solana isn’t going anywhere — it’s a staple of the smart contract space. But short-term traders aren’t chasing 10% gains . They’re after asymmetric bets, coins that can still deliver 30x–70x upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE checks the boxes: Meme energy with structured economics Explosive presale momentum Early-stage price discovery still in play with its current price of $0.0002908 A community-first approach that mirrors early DOGE and SHIBA moves With major influencers and YouTubers already discussing the project — before it even hits the big platforms — the runway looks wide open. Q2 2025 COULD FLIP THE SCRIPT GET 50% EXTRA TOKENS INSTANTLY — USE PROMO CODE: MAGA50X BEFORE IT EXPIRES If this momentum holds, MAGACOIN FINANCE could become one of Q2 2025’s most talked-about launches. While Solana stabilizes, meme coin traders are eyeing this as the next 2,900% runner. It’s not just about weekly gains — it’s about where the market attention is shifting.

In less than one month, the Fartcoin price has risen by more than 230%, placing it at the top of the leaderboard for cryptocurrencies that have recovered in the last month. Now, as its popularity spread, the question remains, is it still a good time to get in on this AI play? Fartcoin Price Headed For Major Resistance Fartcoin is currently one of the trending cryptocurrencies on the Internet after staging a rapid rally in April. Its daily trading volume has risen to more than $350 million at the time of this writing and it continues to garner attention from investors. It has risen to $0.88 after touching a low of $0.23 back in March. Now, it looks like it is on its way to trying another all-time high above its previous $2.61 peak from January. Related Reading: Trump’s Tariff Pause Could Push Bitcoin Price Above $100,000, Pundit Reveals Exit Point Crypto analyst MyCryptoParadise has chimed in on Fartcoin’s recovery, mapping out where it could be headed next. While the analyst does see the price rising higher from here, it is not all good news, especially as Fartcoin seems to be headed toward a major resistance. They explain that the altcoin is currently completely the third wave of a classic Elliot Wave impulse, which is a bullish wave. With the price having risen so much, it means that the end of the bullish third wave could be ending and about to usher in the more bearish fourth wave. Not only is the bearish fourth wave on the horizon, the analyst says that Fartcoin could probably enter a corrective ABC wave during this time. What this means is that the altcoin could be headed for major resistance, where the power of the current uptrend would be tested. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Rebound: Breakout To $1,800 With These Two Supply Zones There is very strong resistance for Fartcoin at $1.05, which is still around 15% away from where the price currently is at the time of this writing. However, if the price were to successfully close above the extended resistance zone of $1.1361, then the uptrend could continue from here. “This is the point where the weak hands get shaken out and smart money reloads,” the crypto analyst explains. “If you’re aiming for long-term success, wait for high-probability setups and protect your capital.” Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",Altcoin|altcoin|altcoin news|crypto|crypto news|Fartcoin|Fartcoin news|Fartcoin prediction|Fartcoin price,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-04-12 12:00:27

SEC Released a Statement,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/will-mcdonalds-add-bitcoin-to-its-treasury-sec-released-a-statement/,"A group of conservative McDonald's shareholders has urged the fast-food giant to adopt Bitcoin as part of its corporate treasury strategy, but the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said the company could reject the proposal without facing any repercussions. The initiative was spearheaded by the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank that also owns shares in McDonald's. In a formal letter to the company, the group argued that Bitcoin offers superior liquidity and growth potential compared to traditional assets such as cash, bonds and even real estate. “McDonald’s is widely viewed, including by former CFO and Chairman Harry Sonneborn, as a real estate company that sells hamburgers,” the group wrote, adding: “Real estate has been a more reliable store of value than cash and bonds, but it will not appreciate as much over time as Bitcoin and is not as liquid.” Related News: Following the US PPI Data, Two Senior FED Officials Made Important Statements The proposal likened McDonald’s potential Bitcoin investment to corporate moves by companies like MicroStrategy, which is run by Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor and has invested heavily in BTC. More recently, GameStop announced plans to invest $1.5 billion in Bitcoin. But not all companies are on board: Microsoft shareholders rejected a similar proposal last December. Following this filing, McDonald’s legal team reached out to the SEC to request confirmation that the company could exempt the Bitcoin proposal from being discussed at its annual shareholder meeting in May. The SEC agreed in a letter. “There appears to be some basis for your view that the company could have excluded the proposal,” the SEC said. “In our view, the proposal relates to the company’s ordinary business activities. Accordingly, we would not recommend to the Commission that it impose sanctions if the company were to remove the proposal from its voting documents.” The SEC's response clears the way for McDonald's to put the Bitcoin debate aside, at least for now, signaling that companies are wary of diving into the volatile world of cryptocurrencies despite pressure from some investors. *This is not investment advice.

Notably absent from the list was XRP, a token with one of the longest-standing use cases in crypto history. For some, this omission might signal concern. But as Arthur pointed out in a detailed analysis , the real takeaway may be quite the opposite—it’s an opening rather than a rejection. New York just passed a bill allowing crypto payments. BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH are mentioned. No XRP in sight. Some might see this as a snub. But in reality? It’s an opportunity. Let’s break it down pic.twitter.com/hxW32TMZkQ — Arthur (@XrpArthur) April 12, 2025 What the Law Says At the heart of the confusion lies the language of the bill itself. While BTC, ETH, LTC, and BCH are specifically named, the legislation also contains a critical phrase: “including but not limited to.” This wording is legally significant. It means the list is illustrative, not exhaustive. In practical terms, any digital asset that satisfies the bill’s technical definitions and standards could potentially be utilized, including XRP and any tokens issued on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). So, while XRP may not be explicitly mentioned, it is far from excluded. Arthur makes the argument that this legislative approach allows for the broader inclusion of crypto networks that prioritize utility and performance, and XRPL fits squarely into that category. XRPL: The Infrastructure That Powers Payments The debate isn’t just about XRP, the token . As Arthur rightly underscores, the real conversation should center on the XRPL—the XRP Ledger—which is the foundational infrastructure Ripple and other developers have built upon since 2012. XRPL is not just an engine for XRP; it’s a scalable, interoperable blockchain designed specifically for payments and asset transfers. The XRPL boasts built-in functionality that many networks are only beginning to implement—a decentralized exchange (DEX), sub-second finality, low transaction fees, and a multi-asset framework. These are not theoretical concepts or whitepaper promises; they are battle-tested capabilities that have been running in production for over a decade. In contrast, networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum, while dominant in brand and market cap, continue to face real-world challenges such as high transaction fees, slower confirmation times, and scalability bottlenecks. These issues often hamper their suitability for everyday payments and retail-level adoption. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Let the Market Choose Utility What this New York bill may ultimately catalyze is not a popularity contest, but a market-driven experiment in performance-based adoption. Arthur captures this sentiment succinctly: “This bill doesn’t choose winners. It opens the door for the market to decide based on efficiency, not just brand recognition.” This subtle but powerful shift from named inclusion to functional eligibility is where XRPL has the chance to shine. As more businesses, governments, and institutions look for payment networks that are fast, low-cost, and scalable, XRPL’s architecture positions it to stand out naturally—even without the spotlight of legislative name-dropping. Beyond Speculation: Into the Utility Era The passage of this bill may mark the beginning of a new phase in crypto: one that favors infrastructure over hype and proven performance over marketing buzz. XRP holders and XRPL developers are no strangers to being underestimated. But with every piece of legislation that favors open-ended inclusion and technical merit, the XRPL stands to benefit—quietly and profoundly. Arthur’s final thought says it best: “The future of crypto payments isn’t about who got named in a bill. It’s about who shows up when it matters.” XRP and XRPL might not have been mentioned this time, but their readiness, efficiency, and long-term vision mean they’re poised to lead in the moments that truly count.

The move positions the school at the forefront of digital currency adoption in education and signals a broader commitment to teaching students about financial innovation. The school announced that the initiative aligns with its efforts to incorporate “sound money principles” derived from the Austrian School of Economics into its curriculum. School Says Bitcoin Tuition Aims to Prepare Students for Uncertain Financial Future The aim, according to the announcement, is to better equip students for an increasingly uncertain financial future. “Bitcoin is available to anyone willing to learn — making it more democratic and inclusive, particularly for people in developing nations who lack access to traditional banking,” the statement said. “Lomond sees Bitcoin as a perfect real-world case study in economics, computing, ethics, and innovation.” While the school currently plans to convert Bitcoin payments to fiat immediately, it has not ruled out the possibility of creating a BTC treasury fund in the future, depending on feedback from the school community. The announcement also made it clear that other cryptocurrencies will not be accepted at this time. Lomond’s move adds to a growing trend of educational institutions adopting Bitcoin both operationally and academically.

In the U.S., the University of Cincinnati began offering crypto-focused courses in 2022. In El Salvador, Bitcoin education was integrated into the national curriculum through a partnership with Mi Primer Bitcoin in 2023. More recently, the University of Wyoming launched a Bitcoin Research Institute in 2024, and in early 2025, the University of Austin allocated $5 million of its $200 million endowment to BTC investments. 41 Bitcoin Reserve Bills Emerge Across 26 States The adoption of Bitcoin has also found momentum statewide in the U.S. According to data from Bitcoin Law, 47 Bitcoin reserve bills have been introduced across 26 states, with 41 currently active. Just recently, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear officially signed House Bill 701 , known as the “Bitcoin Rights” bill, into law—making the state one of the latest to enact legislation protecting digital asset users and operations. Other states are making similar moves. Oklahoma’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act (HB 1203), introduced by Representative Cody Maynard, recently passed the House with a 77-15 vote and is awaiting a Senate decision. According to Bitcoin Laws, Oklahoma now ranks alongside Texas in second place in the race to establish state-level Bitcoin reserves. Missouri is also in the mix , with its Special Committee on Intergovernmental Affairs reviewing its own Bitcoin reserve proposal. Likewise, two key Bitcoin bills in Arizona cleared the House Rules Committee on March 24.

The Lundin dynasty spent about $16 million on April 3rd to increase their stake in Lundin Mining. Meanwhile, Slim purchased $2.3 million in PBF Energy shares on the same day, as energy prices slumped. The buying spree followed a market tumble triggered by Trump’s April 2nd tariff announcements, with PBF Energy dropping over 26% by April 8th. The crash reportedly hit billionaires with a historic $536 billion loss of wealth in the two days following the tariff announcements – the largest two-day decline recorded by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

The USD/CHF exchange rate tumbled to 0.8100 on Friday, 12% below its highest point in 2024. This performance has made the Swiss franc one of the best-performing currencies this year. The Swiss franc’s performance was the polar opposite of the U.S. dollar’s , which tumbled to 2018 lows. Its performance is primarily due to Switzerland’s neutrality and banking secrecy laws, which have always made it a haven. The Swiss National Bank (SNB) is a major investor in U.S. markets and holds substantial positions in many top American companies — including household names like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet. It is also the tenth-biggest holder of US Treasury bonds. Gold has also become a top haven, with its price soaring to a record high of $3,240. It has jumped by 125% from its pandemic lows and 24% this year alone. In contrast, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indices have retreated by double digits.

Bitcoin, often seen as the digital version of gold, has slipped from the year-to-date high of $109,300 to $83,000. Gold vs USD/CHF vs Bitcoin | Chart by TradingView Bitcoin is often regarded as a haven because of its limited supply of 21 million coins and the elevated demand from Wall Street investors. They have also done better than U.S. bonds , which have come under pressure in the past few weeks. On Friday, the benchmark ten-year yield rose to 4.50%, while the 30-year and 2-year yields rose to 4.85% and 3.97%, respectively. Global risks have continued rising this week, with analysts predicting a recession will happen this year. Polymarket data places the odds of a recession this year at 60%, while BlackRock’s Larry Fink believes that the U.S. is already in one. Mark Zandi, Moody’s chief economist, has boosted his recession odds to 60% , citing the hefty tariffs between the U.S. and China. He also noted the base US tariff of 10% on all imported goods and the 25% levy on steel, aluminum, and vehicles. Similarly, economists at companies like Morgan Stanley, BNP Paribas, and UBS have warned that the US GDP will drop this year, and the jobless rate will rise to 5%.

The markets were able to hold ground and return back to fairly normal levels after Trump’s une x pected 90 day pause on tariffs globally except China. Bitcoin was resilient enough and is currently trading at $83,469, up over 1% in the past 24 hours. On April 11, Bitcoin spot ETFs witnessed a net outflow of $1.0271 million marking the seventh consecutive day of negative inflows as per data from SoSovalue . ARKB recorded a positive inflow of $11.28 million, while BITB saw a net outflow of $12.31 million. The rest of the ETFs, including IBIT, FBTC, BTCO, BTCW, BRRR, EZBC, HODL, GBTC, DEFI, and BTC, recorded no change with zero net inflows or outflows. Notably, Ether spot ETFs saw a significantly larger net outflow of over $29 million continuing its four-day streak of losses. This trend highlights the sentiment around investors amid fluctuating markets and regulatory uncertainty. Bitcoin’s April Outflows Surpass March’s Total In just under two weeks of April, Bitcoin fund outflows have already crossed March’s total indicating that more outflows could be on the way. On April 10th, Bitcoin ETFs saw $149.66 in net outflows as it continued a six-day streak of withdrawals. Since the start of this month, a total of $813.89 million have been pulled out of Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin has been showing strength this week with higher highs and lows, but a top analyst Atlantis7 is suspicious of this trend. He claims that the 4.80% price increase is due to passive bids on Coinbase and Binance along with active buyers on OKX. This could indicate that institutions are using Bitcoin as a short-term safe-haven asset amid the US-China tariff tensions similar to gold’s recent rise. He warns that this rally might just be an “exit pump”. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto News Today: XRP News, Cardano Price, Orca Crypto News, and Bitcoin Price Today , Bitcoin Surges Over Fed’s Comments Bitcoin jumped 5% today trading under $84,000 after Fed President hinted that the Fed could intervene with various tools if needed to keep the markets steady. Besides, Arthur Hayes notes that the rising bond yields could push the government to take action. He believes that this might pressure the Fed to pump more money into the system which could boost crypto assets. He claims that this could fuel a strong and lasting rally in the broader markets.

His bullish forecast comes after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dismissed a lawsuit against Helium, a protocol that runs on the SOL blockchain. At press time, Solana price trades at $124 with a 5% gain in 24 hours. SEC Drops Charges Against Top SOL Protocol The SEC has dropped charges against Helium , which has sparked a Solana price rally. Helium is a protocol that migrated to the SOL blockchain in 2023. The lawsuit in question alleged that Nova Labs violated US securities laws by issuing the HNT token. The lawsuit was filed in January 2025 just before the resignation of the former SEC Chair Gary Gensler. The current pro-crypto SEC has now dismissed the case with prejudice, which means that the regulator cannot file a similar cause against Helium in the future. The move comes shortly after the SEC outlined a new approach to regulating the crypto industry. Helium’s founder also hailed the company’s victory saying that the dismissal would bode well for the HNT token and the entire ecosystem. He opined, “Putting this SEC matter behind us is a huge win for the entire Helium community, as well as other crypto projects which use hardware to build their networks.” The dismissal has also stirred gains for Solana price, which is the blockchain atop which Helium is built. Top Trader Forecasts 45% Solana Price Rally to $180 One of the top traders in the crypto space, Ansem has shared a bullish Solana price forecast and predicted that the altcoin may be on the verge of a massive 45% rally towards $180. The analyst shared a Solana daily timeframe chart showing that the SOL price was hovering between a multi-year support zone of between $121 and $121. Flipping this zone could spark the start of a bullish reversal. Ansem added that if Solana can close above $120 decisively on the weekly chart, it will kickstart a 45% rally to $180 within weeks. Once it hits $180, it may lead to fresh all-time highs. SOL/USDT: 1-day Chart Another analyst, CryptoCurb, supported this bullish outlook saying that Solana price will rally not only because of a bullish technical outlook but also robust fundamentals. “People are grossly underestimating how high Solana will go. Solana is the first blockchain that is being globally adopted at scale.” This bullish view comes amid speculation that Solana will outperform Ethereum and possibly attain half of ETH’s market capitalization. With catalysts like a crypto-friendly SEC, buying activity that has helped SOL defend critical support and positive sentiment, Solana price may post a 45% gain.

Will ICP reach $1000? Let’s get into the current price analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Internet Computer Token ICP Price $6.34 Market Cap $3,058,897,470.93 Trading Volume $69,260,079.36 Circulating Supply 482,042,497.24 ICP All-time High $750.73 May 10, 2021 24-h High $6.36 24-h Low $6.08 Internet Computer technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 9.41% 50-Day SMA $5.84 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 43 (Fear) Green Days 15/30 (50%) 200-Day SMA $8.64 Internet Computer price analysis: ICP sees a strong uptrend TL;DR Breakdown ICP’s price analysis shows some gains. Resistance levels to watch are $6.11 and $7.22. ICP 1-day price analysis: ICP attempts bullish correction The ICP/USDT chart for April 12 shows ICP in a consolidation phase after testing the support levels around $4.54. However, the price still faces resistance at the 6.11 level, as shown by the recent rejection. ICP shows signs of recovery, but volatility remains low The MACD supports the bullish reversal, with green histograms solidifying. The William Alligator indicator shows declining volatility. This divergence suggests the bullish price action may lack the necessary support to sustain upward momentum. ICP price analysis for 4-hour: ICP approaches overbought conditions The 4-hour ICP/USDT chart shows the price closing in on the upper RSI limit at 70. The RSI is at 63.11, suggesting that the market is approaching overbought conditions. ICP approaches overbought conditions ICP’s positive CMF reflects buying pressure in the market, and the current bullish movement is supported by relatively strong accumulation. A break above the $6.11 resistance will confirm further upside. If this attempt fails, traders can expect a short-term pullback.

However, a pullback might be imminent. A breakout above $6.11 could lead to further gains, while a rejection may bring a pullback to recent support levels. Is Internet Computer a good investment? The Internet Computer (ICP) has shown significant potential and volatility since its launch, which is common for relatively new and ambitious blockchain projects. Its technology aims to decentralize the internet and bring smart contract functionality to the web, which could have wide-ranging implications for the future of web speed. However, the market performance of ICP has been highly volatile, and its success depends heavily on the adoption of its technology and the broader market environment for cryptocurrencies.

Will ICP reach $1000? Although its ATH sits at $750.73, attaining $1000 in the foreseeable future might be impossible.

In Latin America, this isn’t about chasing the next meme coin—it’s about survival, freedom, and financial power. And now, new tokens are stepping in with utility, power, and scalability that the old giants failed to deliver. Among them, one name is breaking charts, flipping expectations, and offering real ROI with serious street credibility. Enter Qubetics ($TICS)—the world’s first web3 aggregator built to streamline blockchain and tokenization finance. Where past projects hit walls—lack of real-world usability, outdated APIs, and clunky on-chain logistics—Qubetics is unlocking seamless use cases through its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace. From real estate tokenization in Argentina to shipping documentation across Brazil’s coast, the platform is proving it’s ready for the future. It’s time to break down why Qubetics and three other powerful altcoins are ranking high on the best crypto to join now list for 2025. 1. Qubetics ($TICS) Qubetics isn’t playing by yesterday’s rules. This platform is rewriting how digital assets move, interact, and fuel global commerce. As the world’s first web3 aggregator, it enables seamless integration between multiple chains, allowing assets and data to be tokenized, moved, and managed with zero friction. Its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace is where the magic happens. Picture freight documents in a Chilean port instantly tokenized and validated across customs via smart contracts—or a small business in El Salvador listing fractionalized commercial property shares on-chain for instant liquidity. From government records to utility billing platforms, this marketplace could become the back-end engine powering thousands of decentralized services. Qubetics isn’t chasing trends; it’s setting infrastructure for the next decade. And now the numbers: Stage 29 of the presale is already live, and $TICS is priced at just $0.1573. With over 507 million tokens sold, 24,600+ holders, and $16 million+ raised, the presale momentum is explosive. If $TICS hits $1, early backers could pocket a 536% ROI. At $10? We’re talking a 6,256% return. And if projections hit $15, that’s a 9,435% return—from a token still under 20 cents. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because Qubetics is answering real-world problems with blockchain-backed solutions, and the numbers prove the world is watching. It’s hands-down the best crypto presale and one of the best crypto to join now without blinking. 2. Immutable X (IMX) Immutable X is raising the bar for gaming and NFT scalability on Ethereum. Built as a layer-2 solution, it delivers zero gas fees for minting and trading, making it a godsend for platforms tired of ETH’s insane transaction costs. While many platforms talk big about sustainability, IMX walks the walk—its carbon-neutral operations are winning hearts across conscious communities in regions like Patagonia and the Amazon. Beyond its eco-friendly tag, it’s got serious partnerships. Projects like Gods Unchained and Illuvium are already leveraging Immutable’s SDKs to launch responsive, scalable, and cost-effective NFT ecosystems. With web3 gaming booming in Colombia and Brazil, IMX’s low-fee infrastructure is becoming the new go-to. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because Immutable X isn’t just innovating—it’s enabling creators and game devs to scale fast without barriers. If you’re eyeing the best crypto to join now, this one deserves your radar. 3. Celestia (TIA) Forget monolithic chains—Celestia is leading the charge with modular blockchain architecture. This isn’t just a tech buzzword; it’s a whole new way to build blockchains. By separating consensus from execution, Celestia makes it easier than ever to launch your chain, plug into existing modules, or scale without duplicating the entire stack. In countries like Argentina and Peru, where local startups are experimenting with localized DeFi and microloans, Celestia is emerging as a game-changer. Instead of launching a full chain from scratch, developers can deploy purpose-built chains that sync easily across borders. That’s real innovation, serving real needs.

Kenya’s National Treasury has submitted a bill to the National Assembly to regulate the activities of Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) in the country. While other African countries, such as Mauritius and South Africa, have advanced the regulation and adoption of cryptocurrencies, Kenya still lags. Virtual Asset Service Providers Bill 2025 Lands Before the National Assembly Kenya announced it will regulate digital assets by introducing the Virtual Asset Service Providers Bill 2025 (VASP) . The Virtual Asset Service Providers Bill is Kenya’s first comprehensive legislation regulating the overall cryptocurrency section. The Bill marks a vital step in Kenya’s journey to embrace cryptocurrency and the government’s first genuine efforts to bring clarity and control to this fast-growing and unregulated part of the country’s financial system. Kenya’s National Treasury will spearhead the VASP Bill and aims to introduce a structured regulatory framework. The VASP Bill requires all VASPs to be licensed by designated regulators, including the Central Bank of Kenya and the Capital Markets Authority. In addition to its licensing requirements, the VASP Bill 2025 dictates that licensed exchanges must open physical offices or a branch in Kenya while introducing anti-money laundering and counterterrorism (AML/CTF) measures in place. Under the Bill’s AML/CTF requirements, crypto firms will likely collect information from customers transacting on their platform and disclose it with relevant government agencies. Under the VASP Bill 2025, only licensed platforms and entities may issue initial coin offerings (ICOs) and can only do so after they have secured regulatory approval. Kenya’s Crypto Regulation Over the Years Kenya appears to be reversing its former opposition to crypto and digital assets. In 2015, the country introduced a “soft ban” on crypto and warned financial institutions to refrain from engaging in the sector. The Central Bank of Kenya cited known risks associated with crypto, including money laundering, loss due to lack of regulation, and concerns over the underlying assets of digital assets. In 2022, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) underscored its views on Bitcoin and digital assets with the CBK governor, Patrick Njoroge, describing the calls to convert the country’s reserves into crypto as outright “ craziness .” Njoroge reiterated that he believes that digital assets are volatile, but apart from that, they simply do not solve any real-life issues. Despite the government’s views on crypto, many Kenyans rely on it. Speaking of its popularity, the CBK governor continues questioning the benefit of cryptocurrencies for the Kenyan economy. In a video posted to YouTube, the Governor said: “In our economy what problem are they resolving? Are they better vehicles for let’s say payments, transactions? And the answer is no. Are they better in terms of …. security more than a bank account? And the answer is no.” Njoroge added; “I do know you are under a lot of pressure from some of these people that are pushing these things. Because for them it is good. I can assure you I have a lot of people that are pushing to put our reserves in bitcoin.” Parliamentary Committee Passes Crypto Tax Bill At the time, while crypto adoption increased in large parts of the world, Njoroge maintained he had no plans to implement Bitcoin in Kenya. The Kenyan government did, however, change its position. In 2023, the National Assembly Committee approved Kenya’s Capital Markets (Amendment) Bill aimed at regulating and taxing the burgeoning industry in the country. The Kenyan government also introduced a contentious 3% digital asset tax (DAT) as part of its amended Finance Act 2023. At a glance, the regulation imposes a 3% tax on income earned through the transfer or exchange of digital assets. The DAT again appeared in the VASP 2025 Bill, sparking heated public debate. According to CNBC Africa reporting, regulators argue the Bill will provide necessary clarity for the industry, while stakeholders warn the tax could stifle innovation and investment.

The price could hit a high of $3.99 in 2025. XRP Price Today: XRP value has surged 2.84% in 24 hours to $2.06. In the latest update on the Ripple vs SEC case, Attorney Fred Rispoli has provided an updated timeline for the SEC v. Ripple case. He stated that the necessary documentation had already been produced following Alderoty’s declaration, and they are now awaiting a vote by the SEC Commission, which is expected in 30 days. Following this, the SEC will file a motion to lift the injunction, which Ripple will not contest. Once the judge signs off, the case will be finalized, most likely within 60 days. Coming to the expenses, which Ripple will be bearing, the case will be settled with a $50 Million payout to the SEC. That being said, we can expect the process to expedite, as Paul Atkins has given a positive statement in a recent speech about cryptocurrencies. Talking about the XRP price it is up by 2.84% to $2.06. If the bullish momentum kick starts, XRP could aim at its resistance level of $2.10. On the flip side, if it loses out on steam, the XRP price could take a plunge to $1.99. Our XRP price prediction will explore the potential answers to questions such as “Will XRP reach $10 in 2025?” by providing short-term and long-term Ripple (XRP) price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $ 2.16136869 8.04% Market cap $ 126,090,233,113.66 Circulating Supply 58,338,141,684.00 Trading Volume $ 3,281,764,713.9969 All-time high $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 XRP Price Prediction 2025 The SEC believes that XRP can help release funds stuck in the U.S. Nostro accounts, which can then be used to buy more Bitcoins. There is more positive news for Ripple, as they have integrated their stablecoin RLUSD into their cross-border payments network: Ripple Payments . Moreover, Ripple has received approval from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) to offer regulated crypto payments in the Dubai International Finance Centre (DIFC). If things go in favor of Ripple, the XRP price could surge to a maximum of $5.81 by the end of 2025. In contrast, if the lawsuit continues, XRP could remain in a narrow range with a potential low of $2.3. That being said, we can expect an average price of $4.89. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2026 5.6 6.25 8.64 2027 7.15 8.89 12.25 2028 11.3 14.11 16.53 2029 13.98 16.48 21.12 2030 16.92 19.87 26.97 XRP Price Prediction 2026 XRP price will likely witness strong growth in 2026. There is a possibility that XRP can break through the $8.64 level and hold the price by the end of 2026. The minimum XRP price will be around $5.6, with an average trading price of $6.25. This could be a result of Ripple’s role in CBDC development and XRP’s rising institutional demand. XRP Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP’s price will range between $7.15 to $12.25. XRP price might record an average level of $8.89. The reason behind this surge could be due to Ripple’s increasing domination in the payment sector, accelerating XRP’s buying demand and utility. XRP Price Prediction 2028 In 2028, Ripple could increase its use cases, including new dApps and announcements regarding XRP. This might boost the dominance of XRP as the second-largest altcoin by market cap. We expect the XRP price to range between $11.3 to $16.53. The average trading price could be around $14.11. XRP Price Prediction 2029 Partnerships with multiple governments and wider adoption might strengthen XRP’s price in 2029. The altcoin might record a trading range between $13.98 to $21.12, with an average price of $16.48. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The long-term XRP price prediction depends on Ripple’s ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market. If everything remains positive, the XRP price could scale between $16.92 to $26.97. With that price range, the average tag could be $19.87.

Although the ongoing crypto market conditions are quite turbulent, resulting in investors losing major holdings, this case is different as the loss happened in a Non-Fungible Token (NFT). How? Let’s discuss this crypto news. Crypto News: Trader Lost $9.73M With CryptoPunk 3100 In contrast to the rising demand for cryptocurrencies, the hype of NFTs is on the decline. Interestingly, some of the best ones were sold for as high as a million in their prime. An anonymous crypto trader also bought a CryptoPunk 3100 NFT a year ago. At that time, this was valued at $15.79M or 4500 ETH per Lookonchain X post . However, the same’s worth declined over time, resulting in the trader bearing a significant loss as they sold for 500 ETH. The straight calculation put the trader in a loss of $774k. However, the calculation is slightly different, as Ethereum price has declined in this interval due to the weeks-long crypto market downtrend . At the time of buying, one ETH was equivalent to $3,509. However, the same had dropped more than half (57%) when selling, bringing the trade’s loss to $9.73M. Not the Only Crypto Trader Affected by Ethereum Price Crash Ethereum has lost nearly 55% of its value in a year. More importantly, it has declined 68% from its prime, set nearly three years ago. Due to this crypto news, the ETH holders are struggling significantly, A recent X post by Coin Bureau CEO and founder revealed that a majority of the Ethereum investors are underwater due to profitability divergence, Ethereum’s MVRV Slip, demand disparity, and a few other reasons. Ethereum’s MVRV dipped below 1.0 in March. This means the average ETH investor is now underwater, unlike their BTC counterparts. Although he highlighted that the rising global liquidity could tackle these issues, the investors will likely face further losses amid the worsening US-China trade war.

For decades, portfolio construction and risk management were simple: 60% equities, 40% bonds and when markets panicked, capital typically flowed into gold and government bonds. These assets were slow, steady, and predictable, making them an ideal safe haven for investors looking for protection against volatility. But in today’s world of 24/7 markets, geopolitical instability, and rising distrust in sovereign systems, have turned that logic on its head, asking the question: does the definition of a safe haven need a refresh? Enter the new kid in the block: bitcoin. It is highly volatile, widely misunderstood, and often dismissed as a speculative asset by many corners of Wall Street and Main Street. Yet, it has staged an extraordinary run since the COVID-19 market lows. It’s up over 1,000% since the COVID-19 market crash in March 2020. During that same period, long-duration bonds—measured via iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT)—are down 50% from their 2020 highs. Even gold, the true and tried safe haven asset—up 90% over five years—looks less impressive when adjusted for monetary debasement, which saw, in 2020 alone, over 40% of the total USD money supply being printed. Still, bitcoin’s safe haven credential remains contested by investors. In several recent risk-off events, it acted less like a hedge and more like a high-beta risk asset against the Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 ETF. Covid-19 (March 2020): BTC fell 40% vs QQQ’s 27% Bank crisis (March 2023): BTC -14%, QQQ -7% Yen carry trade unwind (Aug 2024): BTC -20%, QQQ -6% Tariff-led selloff (April 2025): BTC -11%, QQQ -16% The first three examples show bitcoin as a kind of leveraged tech trade. But the most recent tariff shock broke the pattern — bitcoin dropped less than the Nasdaq, showing relative strength in an otherwise weak macro environment spurred by President Trump’s tariffs. While these data points may not make a trend, this evolving behavior highlights a broader phenomenon: the global financial backdrop has changed. “Non-sovereign stores of value, like bitcoin, should do well,"" said NYDIG Research in a note. ""Politically neutral assets should be exempt from the global machinations at play right now.” Bitcoin is volatile, yes, but it is also globally liquid, decentralized, censorship-resistant, and immune to tariffs or central bank policy. In an era of geopolitical tension and financial repression, those attributes start to make the asset look more enduring than other safe havens. Meanwhile, traditional safe havens aren’t looking so safe. Gold’s gains look less impressive when weighed against the scale of monetary expansion. Long-duration bonds aren't faring much better either as the 30-year treasury yield approaches 5%, making them painful for duration-heavy portfolios. Since the sell-off began last Thursday, the Nasdaq has dropped nearly 10%, bitcoin is down 6%, TLT has fallen over 4%, and gold has slipped more than 3%. Meanwhile, the DXY index — which tracks the U.S. dollar against a basket of foreign currencies — remains relatively flat, while the all-important U.S. 10-year Treasury yield has surged nearly 8%. On a risk-adjusted basis, bitcoin is holding its ground—performing no worse than traditional safe-haven assets like gold or TLT. Looking at these four major crisis events, a pattern emerges: : each sell-off in bitcoin has marked a significant long-term bottom. During the COVID crash, BTC dropped to ~$4,000 — a level never seen again. In the March 2023 banking crisis, it briefly fell below $20,000 before resuming its climb. The August 2024 yen carry trade unwind brought it down to $49,000 — again, a level that hasn’t returned. If history is any guide, wherever this current low takes us, it may well establish the next long-term floor. So, is Bitcoin a safe haven? If the old framing — low volatility and downside protection during a panic — still holds, then BTC falls short. But in a financial world dominated by sovereign risk, inflation, and constant policy uncertainty, bitcoin starts to look more like an asset that investors might need to consider for durability, neutrality and liquidity. In this evolving landscape, maybe bitcoin isn’t failing the safe haven test. Maybe the old playbook of what safe haven is, needs to change.",Markets|Bitcoin|Gold|Bonds|market analysis,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-12 13:00:00

As we head into 2025, several projects stand out as having the potential to deliver 1000x returns for those who invest early. These presales offer not only innovative technology but also real-world applications that address emerging market needs. If you’re looking to capitalize on the next big opportunity in crypto, here’s a look at the top crypto presales of 2025 that could bring substantial rewards. 1. HexyDog (HEXY) HexyDog (HEXY) is a blockchain-powered solution that focuses on transforming the pet care industry by offering secure and cost-effective cryptocurrency payment systems. At its core is HexyPay, a payment system designed for pet businesses like pet stores, grooming services, and veterinary clinics to seamlessly accept cryptocurrency payments. This innovative solution addresses a major issue in the pet care sector: the reliance on outdated payment systems that are often slow, costly, and insecure. With HexyDog, pet businesses can benefit from faster, more affordable, and secure transactions. What sets HexyDog apart is its real-world application. While many crypto projects focus on theoretical use cases, HexyDog is addressing an actual market need. As the pet care industry continues to grow, the demand for blockchain-powered solutions will only increase. HexyDog’s presale provides early investors with an opportunity to secure tokens before the project gains broader adoption. With the growing adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology in industries like pet care, HexyDog has the potential for significant growth, making it one of the best crypto presales to watch in 2025. 2. BlockDAG BlockDAG is a next-generation blockchain technology that offers increased scalability, security, and efficiency. Unlike traditional blockchains that rely on a linear structure, BlockDAG uses a directed acyclic graph (DAG), which allows for faster and more scalable transactions. This innovative approach to blockchain technology has the potential to solve many of the scalability issues faced by traditional blockchain networks. BlockDAG is a promising project with significant potential, particularly for use cases that require high throughput and low latency. 3. Qubetics Qubetics is focused on blockchain-based quantum security solutions. With the rise of quantum computing, traditional cryptographic methods are at risk of becoming obsolete. Qubetics aims to solve this issue by offering quantum-resistant blockchain technology. This presale project is particularly attractive to investors looking for cutting-edge security solutions that could protect blockchain networks against the threats posed by quantum computing. Qubetics combines security and innovation, making it a standout presale for those looking to invest in the future of blockchain technology. 4. Solaxy Solaxy is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that aims to revolutionize the way users interact with digital assets. The project focuses on offering innovative solutions for yield farming, staking, and liquidity provision. With the increasing popularity of DeFi, Solaxy has the potential to capture a large share of the DeFi market by offering a more user-friendly and secure platform for investors. This project is gaining attention in the DeFi space and could offer significant returns for those looking to enter the DeFi market early. 5. Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance is a DeFi lending and borrowing platform that provides users with the ability to borrow and lend cryptocurrencies without intermediaries. The platform is designed to optimize interest rates and loan collateralization using advanced algorithmic models. As the DeFi lending space continues to expand, Mutuum Finance could become a leading player by offering a more efficient and decentralized approach to crypto lending. Early investment in this presale could result in significant gains as the platform grows in adoption. Why HexyDog Stands Out and Growth Potential What makes HexyDog truly exceptional in the crowded world of crypto presales is its unique combination of blockchain technology and real-world utility. Unlike many projects that focus on abstract concepts, HexyDog is addressing a pressing need within the pet care industry. By offering a blockchain-powered payment solution, HexyDog is tapping into an industry that has seen exponential growth and yet remains underserved by modern payment systems. This real-world use case, coupled with the growing adoption of cryptocurrency, positions HexyDog as one of the most promising crypto presales to invest in for 2025. With its strong team, social responsibility initiatives, and solid roadmap, HexyDog is poised for significant growth in the coming years. The 5% donation to animal welfare and the project’s focus on animal shelters makes it not just a financial opportunity, but also a socially responsible investment. As the crypto market and blockchain adoption continue to rise, HexyDog’s presale presents a great opportunity to get in early on a project with 1000x potential. Conclusion As the world of cryptocurrency continues to expand, the opportunities to invest in high-potential projects are increasing. HexyDog (HEXY) leads the pack as one of the best crypto presales to watch in 2025, with its innovative blockchain solution and real-world use case.

On the other hand, if the market is hit again by external forces like regulations or negative statements by influencers. Hence, the meme coin might trade at a potential low of $ 0.62 . We expect the DOGE price to reach a new swing high of $1.07 by the end of 2025. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $0.62 $0.84 $1.07 Can DOGE Break the $1 Barrier? Given DOGE’s success, largely driven by hype with some technical progress, crossing $1 by 2025 remains a realistic possibility. A sustained media frenzy and growing endorsement deals could maintain bullish momentum. Expanded merchant adoption would also strengthen confidence in its long-term viability. Dogecoin’s Tokenomics and Long-Term Outlook The future of Dogecoin hinges on its utility. Meme popularity alone may not sustain it indefinitely, but advancements in transaction fees, speed, and business collaborations could help it thrive as a mainstream digital currency. Its large and passionate community will likely continue to drive positive evolution. Conclusion Given Dogecoin’s past price behavior, driven largely by online hype and media coverage, it has the potential to reach over $1 in 2025. DOGE has shown remarkable resilience, and key factors like expanded merchant adoption, community growth, and protocol upgrades could enhance its viability.

In just one week, it has jumped over 50% , with a 24% gain in the last 24 hours alone, making it one of the top-performing coins of the week. So, what driving the Pi coin price up, lets find this out? Why Pi Coin Price Pumped Pi Network coin, known for its “tap to earn” mining system, has finally broken out of its long bearish trend. The token is now trading near $0.75, with trading volume surging to $474 million, up 194% in just 24 hours. That’s a huge jump and a sign that investors are showing interest again. One of the biggest reasons for the price spike is the Pi Network’s latest tech rollout — Satellite Mode. This new feature allows users to access the Pi Network, mine coins, and use apps without needing the internet. Yes, that’s right, no Wi-Fi, no 4G, just satellite support. Another reason Pi Coin’s price is going up is that the Fed recently lowered interest rates to 2.4% to help control inflation. When rates are low, people often look for better ways to grow their money, and that’s where crypto like Pi Coin can gain more attention. Key System Upgrades On top of that, Pi Network has launched two important user-friendly updates: Fast KYC Process: Now, users can complete identity verification in under 5 minutes. One-Tap Wallet Access: New users can activate their wallets instantly and start using the Pi ecosystem right away. Pi Coin Analysis Aim $1 Looking at the Pi Coin’s 4-hour price chart, it shows the formation of a strong bullish pattern. Meanwhile, technical indicators suggest that the RSI has jumped to 75, showing strong buying pressure. Also, the MACD has formed a positive signal, backing the idea that Pi may rise further. Right now, Pi is holding strong above the $0.70 support level. If it keeps moving up and breaks past $0.82, the next target could be $1.",News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-12 13:16:30

According to analysts, XRP is showing signs of short-term strength after holding a key Fibonacci support zone between $1.89 and $1.99. Following this bounce, the price is now moving towards a resistance area between $2.15 and $2.17. This upward movement appears to be part of a corrective ABC structure, with the current leg — the C-wave — expected to complete a five-wave pattern. If this pattern plays out, XRP could reach the 100% Fibonacci extension level, aligning with historical swing highs and the 61.8% retracement level from previous moves. This resistance zone is important. If XRP is still in a broader wave 4 correction, the price should not break decisively above $2.16–$2.17. While a temporary move above is possible, any sustained rally beyond $2.59 would challenge the current corrective outlook. As long as the move remains a three-wave structure, it is likely a temporary rally within a larger corrective pattern. Traders should watch for reactions around the $2.15–$2.17 zone for clues about the next move. The $1.89–$1.99 area remains key support in the short term.

You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions. Who's left? The narrative We heard about two more Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) cases this week. The first, Binance and the SEC, was last paused in February, though late Friday attorneys asked for another extension to continue discussing matters. Separately, Nova Labs settled allegations with the regulator. Why it matters As we continue to watch the SEC develop its new views on digital asset issues, how it treats its active litigation remains a key signal. Breaking it down On Friday, attorneys with the SEC and Binance (as well as Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, Binance.US and other parties) filed a joint motion asking the federal judge overseeing the case to extend a pause originally set to expire Monday by another 60 days. Originally, the SEC said it was requesting the pause to see how the agency's new crypto task force might address digital assets and the application of securities laws. Friday's filing echoed this argument, saying the task force's work ""may impact"" its claims in the ongoing litigation. The original pause was set to end on April 14. The SEC also filed a motion for a consent judgement after apparently coming to a settlement agreement with Nova Labs, the company behind Helium. According to the proposal , Nova Labs would pay $200,000 but would not admit to or deny the allegations. The SEC first sued Nova Labs in January 2025 — specifically, Jan. 17, 2025 , three days before Donald Trump was sworn into office as the 47th U.S. President.

The rally coincides with Ripple ( XRP ) agreeing to pay $50 million to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as part of a settlement. Recall how the SEC sued Ripple in December 2020, claiming it sold XRP as an unregistered security. The legal battle became one of the crypto industry’s most closely watched cases. In a key 2023 ruling, the court gave Ripple a partial win: institutional sales were legal, but XRP sales on public exchanges did violate securities laws. Ripple originally set aside $125 million in escrow for potential penalties. “We’re actually taking most of that back, including the interest that had been earned along the way,” Garlinghouse said in a Fox Business interview . “I think it’s just evidence that the former [Gary] Gensler SEC was on the wrong side of the law. And thanks to the new leadership at the SEC and in the White House.” Like other crypto companies (i.e., Coinbase , Gemini , Uniswap ), Ripple benefited from supporting President Donald Trump. Last year, the company reportedly donated millions to his presidential campaign and at least $5 million in XRP tokens to the inauguration on Jan. 20. The Trump administration’s SEC promptly dropped numerous lawsuits and investigations against crypto companies as a thank-you. While Trump allies say this underscores a willingness to create a more transparent regulatory framework, critics argue it’s a form of crypto-crony capitalism.

Hyperliquid, Curve DAO, Fartcoin are the hottest picks Ripple expands as regulations ease With the regulatory cloud lifting, Ripple plans to expand its business. The company recently completed its largest acquisition to date, purchasing prime broker Hidden Road for $1.25 billion. Garlinghouse emphasized that such a move “would have made no sense a year ago” under what he perceived to be a hostile regulatory environment under former SEC chair Gary Gensler. “This allows even larger institutions like BlackRock, like the biggest Wall Street financial institutions, to come into this market in a way they understand with a safer prime broker to help clear transactions and a bigger balance sheet to do that,” he explained. The Hidden Road acquisition brings Ripple’s employee count to approximately 1,100 people, with Garlinghouse noting that for years, the company was forced to focus on hiring outside the United States due to regulatory uncertainty. “As a U.S. citizen, I grew up in Kansas. I’d like to hire people here. We have some of the best talent in the world here. But it made no sense to invest in a market where we couldn’t sign customers,” he said. Ripple has recently increased its product offerings by launching a stablecoin with a New York trust license from the New York Department of Financial Services. Looking ahead, Garlinghouse expects regulatory clarity to continue improving in two key areas: stablecoin legislation and market structure bills. He expressed confidence that federal stablecoin legislation would move forward “sooner rather than later.” When asked about Bitcoin ( BTC ) price predictions, Garlinghouse suggested that $200,000 by year-end was “not unreasonable.” He mentioned that it is slightly higher than his previous forecast of $175,000. He attributed his bullish outlook to the shift in the U.S. regulatory approach: “People underestimate how the largest economy in the world, the U.S., went from headwinds, hostility to tailwinds.” XRP has been on an upward trajectory over the past year. A rally occurred following Donald Trump’s re-election in Novemeber. See below.

The massive movement occurred today and was first spotted by cryptocurrency tracking service Whale Alert. Related Reading: Bitcoin Maxi Takes Aim: Ethereum’s True Value? Lower Than You Think Tracking The Money Trail The transaction initially appeared to be heading to an unknown destination when Whale Alert reported the funds moving to an unidentified address ‘rP4X2…sKxv3’. But blockchain analytics platform Bithomp later clarified that both the sending and receiving wallets belong to Ripple. The receiving wallet was created by Ripple on October 2, 2023, with an initial funding of 70 million XRP. Since its creation, this wallet has only interacted with other Ripple-linked addresses, strengthening the evidence that this was an internal transfer rather than funds moving to an outside entity or exchange. 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 200,000,000 #XRP (402,739,474 USD) transferred from #Ripple to unknown wallethttps://t.co/cZz7k5fum8 — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) April 11, 2025 Why The Big Money Move According to crypto community figure XRP_Liquidity, who tracks Ripple’s token movements, the transaction represents standard treasury management – Ripple simply shifting money between its own accounts. The 200 million XRP tokens remain untouched at the receiving address, suggesting no immediate plans for their use. The receiving wallet now holds around 290 million XRP tokens, valued at about $577 million as of the current XRP price of $2.04 per token, based on figures by Coingecko. According to historical trends, the funds can be used for various purposes in Ripple’s business operations. They can be used to finance On-Demand Liquidity (recently renamed Ripple Payments), finance exchange-traded products that mirror XRP’s value, or give liquidity to cryptocurrency exchanges where XRP is listed. The Bigger Financial Picture The sending wallet didn’t empty its cash register with this transfer. It still contains 200 million XRP tokens. That wallet had received 300 million XRP on April 2 from another Ripple-linked address, which itself had received 500 million XRP from Ripple’s monthly escrow release. Ripple maintains most of its XRP holdings in escrow accounts, with programmed releases occurring monthly. The April release showed unusual timing compared to Ripple’s standard practice. Related Reading: XRP ETF Launch Impresses Even In Bear Market, Says Analyst Breaking From Routine Ripple broke from its traditional first-of-month schedule for its April token release. Instead of unlocking the funds on April 1, the company first returned 700 million XRP to escrow, then released 1 billion XRP on April 3. This shift in schedule runs counter to Ripple’s established tradition of releasing tokens on the first day of each month, although the company has not commented publicly on its reasoning for this timing change. The wallet transactions are significant, as XRP trades at over $2 per token, giving the cryptocurrency such a high valuation that even normal transfers are worth several hundreds of millions of dollars. These huge transfers are usually followed closely by crypto market watchers, as they can on occasion be indicative of any potential future market move or strategic decision taken by the company.

Experts Say $200K Is Long Overdue,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoins-next-breakout-experts-say-200k-is-long-overdue/,"The post Bitcoin’s Next Breakout? Experts Say $200K Is Long Overdue appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Despite global economic uncertainty and a series of market shocks, several leading voices in the cryptocurrency space say Bitcoin is on the verge of a massive breakout—one that could take most investors by surprise. Samson Mow, CEO of Jan3 and a longtime Bitcoin advocate, recently expressed astonishment that Bitcoin is still trading under $100,000. “We should have hit $200,000 already, and it shocks me every day that we’re not there yet,” Mow said in a recent interview with Milkroad. Short-Term Fear, Long-Term Accumulation Many in the industry attribute Bitcoin’s suppressed price action to fear-driven market sentiment and a temporary liquidity crunch. Approximately 2 million coins remain active on exchanges, contributing to short-term volatility. However, long-term holders—or “hodlers”—continue to accumulate, reducing overall circulating supply and tightening what Mow calls the “spring” behind Bitcoin’s eventual surge. Historical precedent supports the possibility of a sudden upward move. In 2017, Bitcoin rose nearly 17x in less than a year, during a period of relatively calm global conditions. Now, with economic instability, rising geopolitical tensions, trade wars, and currency devaluation in play, many believe the conditions are even more favorable for another explosive rally. Bitcoin’s History Suggests Explosive Moves Are Possible Other indicators also point to an impending structural shift. Bitcoin’s hash rate—considered a leading signal of network strength and miner confidence—continues to climb, reaching all-time highs. Mow suggests that sovereign entities may now be involved in mining, driving this surge in computational power with little regard for profitability, thanks to access to free or excess energy resources. This same price-insensitive mindset appears to be influencing Bitcoin buyers as well. Corporations like MicroStrategy continue to accumulate Bitcoin regardless of short-term price fluctuations, reflecting a long-term belief in its store-of-value potential. The big question now is whether this trend will spread to other companies—and even nation-states. “Once it becomes a race to print money to buy Bitcoin,” Mow warned, “then all the gloves are off.” With structural changes in mining, corporate accumulation, and growing sovereign interest, many analysts believe Bitcoin is on the edge of another major run—possibly beyond $200,000—sooner than most expect.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-12 13:32:13

The agreement includes an accordion facility provided by private credit investment firm Cypress Hills. The accordion facility is designed to expand an existing credit line without renegotiating the entire deal. This is aimed at providing APX with the flexibility to scale operations rapidly and comes soon after it become the first Crypto-Backed Loan Provider in Canada to receive Exemptive Relief by the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA). APX Lending Cypto-Backed Loans : How it Functions ​ APX Lending, established in early 2023, is a Toronto-based crypto-backed lending platform. It is founded by the team behind Coinberry, one of Canada’s prominent licensed crypto exchanges. The platform enables crypto holders to borrow stablecoins and other digital assets using major tokens like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as collateral. The platform stores client funds in segregated cold-storage wallets with BitGo, a leading crypto custodian offering over $250 million of insurance. Additionally, all crypto funds are moved using Fireblocks, which offers a further $35 million of insurance coverage. While APX Lending offers complete visibility of loan collateral on the blockchain throughout the tenure of loans, it operates within the Centralized Finance (CeFi) domain. This means that, unlike decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, APX Lending does not operate entirely on-chain with automated smart contracts managing loan issuance and liquidation. Crypto Lending on APX Lending The timing of this funding round is telling. Analysts suggest that a resurgence in BTC and crypto prices, particularly Bitcoin’s climb past $70,000 in early 2025, has reignited demand for crypto-backed borrowing. Notably, long-term holders (HODLers) are once again exploring loan options to unlock liquidity without liquidating their positions. Further, Canadian lending market is also set for growth with projections estimating USD 3.42 billion by 2030, indicating a CAGR of 26.5%. According to the Ontario Securities Commission’s 2023 survey, 10% of Canadians aged 18–34 reported borrowing through crypto trading platforms or firms. A Sector on the Rebound? Crypto lending has had a tumultuous history. The space saw major disruptions in 2022 when prominent platforms like Celsius and BlockFi collapsed during the crypto winter, causing investor confidence to plummet. This came after a series of devastating events including the fall of LUNA/UST, the insolvency of Three Arrows Capital, and the FTX bankruptcy. But now that phase may be giving way to a period of cautious resurgence. This APX Lending funding particularly signals renewed optimism in the digital asset lending market, especially in light of shifting regulatory landscapes and increasing institutional appetite for alternative collateralized finance. Recently, Mauricio Di Bartolomeo , co-founder and CSO of another leading Toronto-based digital asset loan protocol, Ledn, also hinted at possible bullish sentiment in the space. “You’re going to see a Cambrian explosion of bitcoin-backed loans, because the rates are going to drop to a point that is going to make them competitive with home equity or personal lines of credit, or other types of instruments,” Di Bartolomeo said in a recent interview to a prominent media publication. According to DeFiLlama, the total value locked (TVL) in crypto lending protocols has steadily climbed past $15 billion as of April 2025—up from $9.8 billion in Q4 2024. Source Further, leading protocols such as Aave, MakerDAO, and newer entrants like APX Lending are seeing a slow but steady uptick in lending volumes – highlighting near-term bullish sentiment.

(Opinion),https://cryptopotato.com/should-investors-buy-this-massive-bitcoin-price-dip-opinion/,"The Wall Street spot ETF craze for Bitcoin, followed by President Donald Trump’s historic overtures to the Web3 industry and reelection with a mandate in November, pushed its price to all-time highs. BTC entered Q4 last year at $60,800 and by Jan. 20th, shot up to a record of over $109,000. But soon after, the asset began a steep correction back to $85,000 to start off Q2. Bitcoin’s Price Dip in Q1 Traders who bought at the Oct. 1 price last year were up by 79% the day of Trump’s inauguration. If they held through Mar. 31, they would still be up by 40%. By most historical benchmarks, that’s very fast growth for the average American individual investor’s dollar. Some might say it is too fast and too risky, pointing to the volatility of Bitcoin markets, with such dramatic price swings in both directions. But interestingly, Bitcoin’s price isn’t the only global economic benchmark that traced a dramatic upward swing through 2024 with a steep correction starting in Q1 of this year. US stocks in the benchmark S&P 500 Index and Nasdaq Composite charted the exact same pattern. The 30-day BTC Pearson Correlation to US stocks has remained positive since last August. Moreover, the Bitcoin/stocks correlation accelerated into the financial melt up in Q4 and again during the course correction in Q1. So these trends indicated the macro forces in the economy for these price movements. Bitcoin’s Price and Orange Prices Locked in Weird Correlation Why orange juice is so expensive https://t.co/mF1WQn6LXi — CNBC (@CNBC) April 3, 2025 Here’s where it gets even more interesting. Bitcoin’s rally in 2024, bull run in Q4, and correction in Q1 also traced the same path through exchange markets that global orange prices followed over the same time periods. Although the average global price of an orange was $3.21 in Jan. 2024, by last December it had risen sharply to $5.09. But by last month, it had fallen to $2.71, according to IMF data at the Federal Reserve. It’s more economic data on the side of the theory that BTC’s price growth is mostly a function of the dollar’s expansion over GDP. Rising consumer prices are the same as Bitcoin’s rising prices in the same dollar tide. Curiously enough, this correlation between Bitcoin and the dollar has continued a trend ongoing since the 2023 and 2020 cryptocurrency markets.

US Fed “absolutely” ready to step in if liquidity dries up — Voting member The US Federal Reserve is prepared to use its vast arsenal of monetary policy tools to prevent financial and economic conditions from deteriorating rapidly but will do so only if liquidity dries up or markets become disorderly, a top central banker said. In an interview with the Financial Times , Boston Fed President Susan Collins said the central bank “would absolutely be prepared” to backstop markets if needed. While it is generally understood that the Fed is always prepared to act quickly to stave off market chaos, Collins’ remarks come on the heels of asset selloffs across stocks and bonds, which have raised concerns about the health of the US financial system. Overall, however, the Fed is “not seeing liquidity concerns,” said Collins. If that were to change, policymakers would have “tools to address concerns about markets functioning or liquidity,” she said. The Fed’s Collins pictured in a December interview with Bloomberg.

The WSJ claims that CZ's cooperation with the DOJ included providing evidence related to financial crimes involving Sun, who is already under investigation by the DOJ and the SEC.

Market sees 21% chance of a modest 25 bps rate cut, but no major changes. Odds of a 50 bps cut or rate hike remain near zero, reflecting stability. With the U.S. economy sending mixed signals, expectations surrounding the Federal Reserve’s next interest rate action seem set. According to crowd-sourced predictions from Polymarket , there’s a 76% chance the Fed will keep its benchmark rate unchanged at the May 7 meeting. Among those pushing for an easing of monetary policy are President Donald Trump and investor Arthur Hayes, both arguing that lower rates could stimulate a slowing economy. However, the Fed appears committed to caution, prioritizing stability over reactionary moves. What Prediction Markets Show: 76% Odds Fed Holds Rates Steady The Polymarket data, drawn from over $20 million in traded volume, reveals a strong consensus among traders. Most believe the Federal Reserve will maintain current interest rate levels. The price for a “Yes” bet on no change currently trades at 76¢, reflecting strong market confidence in that scenario.

The country’s efforts are backed by new legal amendments approved by its cabinet. Thailand has had enough unregulated foreign crypto services, introducing laws to deter and prevent such services from operating there. Thai SEC Announces Updates to Key Emergency Decrees Thailand is ramping up its efforts to combat online financial crime. The Thai Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that the cabinet approved amendments to its Emergency Decree on Digital Asset Businesses B.E. 2561 (2018) (Digital Asset Business Law) and the Emergency Decree on Measures for the Prevention and Suppression of Cybercrime B.E. 2566 (2023) (“Cybercrime Law”) which introduce new measures to regulate digital asset businesses and prevent cybercrime. The SEC detailed: “These amendments aim to strengthen measures against cybercrime and mule accounts, enhancing the security of public financial transactions and improving the effectiveness of combating online scams.” In its statement, the SEC said, “…amendments to the Digital Asset Business Law and the Cybercrime Law will enhance the effectiveness of measures blocking digital asset mule accounts.” The amendments clarify the mechanisms for information exchange with agencies and improve the measures for preventing the use of foreign exchanges as a channel for money laundering. The SEC said the measures allow websites and applications of foreign platforms that solicit or advertise services to investors in Thailand to be blocked more quickly and easily. Measures aim to improve law enforcement efficiency and cooperation in addressing cybercrime between the banking sector, digital asset businesses, and other relevant agencies. According to the SEC’s statement, the newly introduced laws will be used for “deterring and preventing” foreign peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms, which are “qualified as digital asset exchanges under the Digital Asset Business Law,” from operating in the country. SEC Secretary-General Pornanong Budsaratragoon added: “The SEC will collaborate with the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society and relevant agencies, including the TDO and digital asset business operators, to implement the aforementioned laws to enhance the efficiency in preventing the use of digital assets as a means for money laundering, and to reduce public damage from online crimes.” USDC and USDT Join the List of Approved Cryptocurrencies in Thailand The Southeast Asian nation has long embraced cryptocurrencies and continually introduces new measures to improve the operation of digital assets in the country. Its most recent move included revising the criteria for its list of approved cryptocurrencies “to be used for investment in digital tokens through ICOs process, for ICO portals to receive from investors or issuers for transactions, and for digital asset exchanges to use[d] as base trading pairs,” adding Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) . The SEC previously only approved Bitcoin (BTC) , Ethereum (ETH) , Ripple (XRP) , Stellar (XLM), and certain tokens used in the Bank of Thailand’s settlement system.

US banks’ commercial and industrial loan delinquencies jumped in Q4 of 2024 while the total value of the loans dipped, reports S&P Global. Delinquent C&I loans rose by approximately 6.4% from the previous quarter and 19.8% year over year, reaching $31.04 billion – with a delinquency ratio of 1.31%. This marks a significant uptick in sour loans, with major players like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs now collectively saddled with $11.8582 billion in delinquent C&I loans. The overall C&I loan balance across US banks fell 5.2% quarter over quarter and 4.3% year over year to $2.371 trillion, partially due to a classification change excluding margin loans from the C&I category. Despite the decline in total loans, the rise in delinquencies signals growing stress in the commercial sector, and bank executives have noted muted lending demand and cautious borrower behavior. JPMorgan Chase COO Jennifer Piepszak says much of the recent activity has been refinancing rather than new loan growth, attributing it to a “wait-and-see” approach among businesses. Meanwhile, U.S. Bancorp CFO John Stern points to “pockets of growth” in corporate and middle-market lending but emphasized that growth remains inconsistent, with the potential for more economic clarity in the second half of the year.

The WSJ article published on Friday alleged that Zhao, who was sentenced to four months in prison for anti-money laundering violations, presented evidence implicating Sun, who is currently under investigation by both the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ). Citing unnamed sources, the report positioned the deal as part of Binance’s broader effort to reduce regulatory pressure in the United States, particularly when partnering with World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency firm with ties to President Donald Trump’s family. Both Zhao and Sun vehemently denied the allegations. Related News: Following the US PPI Data, Two Senior FED Officials Made Important Statements “Multiple people told me that WSJ wrote another baseless attack article about me,” Zhao wrote on social media platform X. Sun, who was allegedly the target of the alleged collaboration deal, responded: “I have no knowledge of the rumors circulating. CZ is both my mentor and a close friend. They always try to use rumors to separate us. Only by standing together can we change everything.” The report also noted that Sun invested $75 million in World Liberty’s stablecoin USD1 around the same time that the SEC suspended its fraud case against him. Binance insiders saw the investment as a strategic move to strengthen ties with a potential second Trump administration, according to the WSJ. The publication also cited another report last month that suggested members of the Trump family were exploring taking a stake in Binance’s US subsidiary. Zhao categorically denied the allegations. “I have not had any discussions with anyone about a Binance US deal,” she said. As Binance tries to mend its stance following a $4.3 billion settlement with U.S. authorities, internal discussions reportedly include seeking a potential presidential pardon for Zhao, though neither the Justice Department nor the White House have commented on the matter. *This is not investment advice.

However, the recent tariff war has managed to vanish all the gains registered by XRP since it finally ended its legal battle with the commission. Ripple CEO wants to pay the SEC fine in XRP In an interview with Fox Business, Brad Garlinghouse stated that the US government is going to end up with $50 million. He also mentioned talking about making that payment in XRP. This statement comes after US President Donald Trump announced that XRP, along with Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) would be included in a newly formed crypto strategic reserve . Ripple seems to be really enjoying freedom from the legal complications. One year ago, the crypto firm would not have dreamed about dropping $2 billion on a company like Hidden Road. Its recent buyout isn’t just a flex but a signal that the era of crypto companies going global while dodging US regulators may be ending. Garlinghouse thinks the industry is entering a “build, don’t battle” phase in America. The SEC has already decided to drop its appeal without any conditions while Ripple agreed to put down its cross-appeal. The commission will be keeping $50 million of the $125 million fine and the balance will be returned to the defendants. US regulators are finally softening up, institutions are no longer frozen out, and crypto has gone from villain to hedge fund’s favorite. “We’ve gone from headwinds to tailwinds,” Garlinghouse said. Garlinghouse thinks Bitcoin will hit $200K Brad Garlinghouse also took his shot at predicting Bitcoin’s price, saying he thinks that $200,000 is not unreasonable. However, he didn’t hype up XRP, saying that it’s “too close to home.” XRP has been the best-performing major crypto in the last 90 days. “I’m very optimistic,” the CEO added. Bitcoin price has fluctuated between highs of $83k and lows of $74k over the last 7 days. BTC is trading at an average price of $83,784 as of press time, down by 15% in the past 60 days. On the other hand, XRP has seen a major slump at the same time. XRP price slid by more than 16% over the last 60 days. XRP is trading at an average price of $2.11 as of press time.

""The US imports over $60 BILLION of smartphones per year. These exemptions cover some of the most crucial imports in another sign of the U.S. conceding in the trade war.

Market participants see this as a positive amid the ongoing trade war between the US and China. Crypto Market Rebounds As Donald Trump Exempts Tech Products From Tariffs The crypto market has surged following Donald Trump’s move to exempt tech products from reciprocal tariffs imposed on China and other countries. According to a CNBC report , the US president has exempted phones, computers, and chips from the new tariffs. The Bitcoin price surged past the $85,000 market following this report, with other altcoins also recording significant gains. This development is undoubtedly bullish for the market as it reduces the severity of the tariffs that Trump imposed on almost all countries earlier this month. Moreover, this represents a big win for the stock market, with companies like Apple the biggest beneficiaries of this exemption. As such, it is normal for the crypto market to rebound alongside, given Bitcoin’s correlation with stocks. Meanwhile, this move could also mark the beginning of the end of the ongoing trade war between the US and China. As CoinGape reported, China yesterday announced a 125% tariff on US imports following the latter’s decision to impose 145% tariffs on Chinese goods. Trump already mentioned that he is looking forward to making a deal with China, which is also positive for the market. Bitcoin and altcoins could witness another massive rally once that happens. Correctional Phase Could Soon Be Over In a recent X post, crypto analyst Kevin Capital suggested that the correctional phase could soon be over for the crypto market. He noted that this phase has so far gone according to plan. However, he warned that there is still a lot of work to be done. The analyst believes it is important for the Bitcoin price to clear the $89,000 level before market participants start feeling good. He added that the macro side also needs to line up for things to start looking really good for the market. The macro side looks to be progressing well as the Federal Reserve recently revealed plans to provide liquidity if necessary. Meanwhile, the latest CPI and PPI inflation data came in lower than expectations, which could also motivate the Fed to start easing monetary policies. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital warned that Bitcoin isn’t there yet. He stated that it would be momentous to weekly close above $86,000, as this would potentially set BTC up for a repeat of a mid-2021 breakout. However, the flagship crypto is still away from the bullish weekly close of $86,811.

The new feature will come into effect for the Autumn 2025 session. The headmaster announced the news at a crypto event, saying that other schools could follow suit and that parents could pay their fees using crypto rather than traditional bank transfers. Parents requested to pay tuition fees with crypto because many were living overseas and didn’t want to pay the currency exchange fees, which can often be expensive and cumbersome. The headmaster also considered that overseas students, especially tech-savvy and familiar with digital assets, may be interested in the option. “For generations”, wrote Claire Chisholm, Lomond headmaster, “this school has nurtured inquirers, thinkers, communicators, and open-minded risk-takers. We were the first boarding school in Scotland to house boys and girls under the same roof. We recently moved away from the Scottish Government’s SQA curriculum and introduced the International Baccalaureate, a globally-renowned qualification favoured by universities and employers worldwide”. Lomond School plans to implement the Bitcoin strategy in phases because it wishes to do more with crypto in future projects. But for starters, it will allow parents to pay with Bitcoin, only to convert the crypto to Great Britain Pounds (GBP) to avoid price volatility. This will ensure that their first crypto project will be stable and can handle payments by patents with minimal fuss. Two exchanges, CoinCorner and Musquet, will handle Bitcoin transfers, both of which have been approved by the FCA. The coins will be converted directly into GBP, which avoids crypto volatility and abides by UK standards requiring an authorized platform to handle payments. For instance, handling the transactions themselves may incur further regulation for the private school because the UK has been strengthening rules concerning online payments to protect consumers from fraud. Chisholm has chosen the Cheatcode Bitcoin conference, held at Bedford, to announce the news. Former Prime Minister Liz Truss will give a speech shortly after on ‘saving the West,’ and the Winklevoss twins will give a speech about the Premier League. Lomond School says they prepare students for the future by instilling sound money principles. They teach the children about economic theories and the principles of free markets and liberty. Bitcoin is a great teaching tool for the school because it encompasses, in a very modern way, the economic principles they teach daily. According to the school, Bitcoin is more inclusive because people from less developed nations can use digital money and transact across the globe. Overall, Bitcoin is a fairer form of money than traditional money, giving people better access to banking. Instead of using a bank, a person can use Bitcoin to pay for private school tuition fees and can do so with just an internet connection.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|United Kingdom,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-12 14:53:27

A fundamental inefficiency remains: the disconnect between US capital markets and Asia’s liquidity hubs. The United States dominates capital formation, and its recent embrace of tokenized treasuries and real-world assets signals a significant step toward blockchain-based finance. Meanwhile, Asia has historically been a global crypto trading and liquidity hub despite evolving regulatory shifts. These two economies operate, however, in silos, limiting how capital can move seamlessly into digital assets. This isn’t just an inconvenience — it’s a structural weakness preventing crypto from becoming a true institutional asset class. Solving it will cause a new era of structured liquidity, making digital assets more efficient and attractive to institutional investors. The capital bottleneck holding crypto back Inefficiency between US capital markets and Asian crypto hubs stems from regulatory fragmentation and a lack of institutional-grade financial instruments. US firms hesitate to bring tokenized treasuries onchain because of evolving regulations and compliance burdens. Meanwhile, Asian trading platforms operate in a different regulatory paradigm, with fewer barriers to trading but limited access to US-based capital. Without a unified framework, cross-border capital flow remains inefficient. Stablecoins bridge traditional finance and crypto by providing a blockchain-based alternative to fiat. They are not enough. Markets require more than just fiat equivalents. To function efficiently, they need yield-bearing, institutionally trusted assets like US Treasurys and bonds. Without these, institutional capital remains largely absent from crypto markets. Crypto needs a universal collateral standard Crypto must evolve beyond simple tokenized dollars and develop structured, yield-bearing instruments that institutions can trust. Crypto needs a global collateral standard that links traditional finance with digital assets. This standard must meet three core criteria. First, it must offer stability. Institutions will not allocate meaningful capital to an asset class that lacks a robust foundation. Therefore, collateral must be backed by real-world financial instruments that provide consistent yield and security. Recent: Hong Kong crypto payment firm RedotPay wraps $40M Series A funding round Second, it must be widely adopted. Just as Tether’s USDt ( USDT ) and USDC ( USDC ) became de facto standards for fiat-backed stablecoins, widely accepted yield-bearing assets are necessary for institutional liquidity. Market fragmentation will persist without standardization, limiting crypto’s ability to integrate with broader financial systems. Third, it must be DeFi-native. These assets must be composable and interoperable across blockchains and exchanges, allowing capital to move freely. Digital assets will remain locked in separate liquidity pools without onchain integration, preventing efficient market growth. Without this infrastructure, crypto will continue to operate as a fragmented financial system. To ensure that both US and Asian investors can access tokenized financial instruments under the same security and governance standard, institutions require a seamless, compliant pathway for capital deployment. Establishing a structured framework that aligns crypto liquidity with institutional financial principles will determine whether digital assets can truly scale beyond their current limitations. The rise of institutional-grade crypto liquidity A new generation of financial products is beginning to solve this issue. Tokenized treasuries, like BUIDL and USYC , function as stable-value, yield-generating assets, offering investors an onchain version of traditional fixed-income products. These instruments provide an alternative to traditional stablecoins, enabling a more capital-efficient system that mimics traditional money markets. Asian exchanges are beginning to incorporate these tokens, providing users access to yields from US capital markets. Beyond mere access, however, a more significant opportunity lies in packaging crypto exposure alongside tokenized US capital market assets in a way that meets institutional standards while remaining accessible in Asia. This will allow for a more robust, compliant and scalable system that connects traditional and digital finance. Bitcoin is also evolving beyond its role as a passive store of value. Bitcoin-backed financial instruments enable Bitcoin ( BTC ) to be restaked as collateral, unlocking liquidity while generating rewards. For Bitcoin to function effectively within institutional markets, however, it must be integrated into a structured financial system that aligns with regulatory standards, making it accessible and compliant for investors across regions. Centralized decentralized finance (DeFi), or “CeDeFi,” is the hybrid model that integrates centralized liquidity with DeFi’s transparency and composability, and is another key piece of this transition. For this to be widely adopted by institutional players, it must offer standardized risk management, clear regulatory compliance and deep integration with traditional financial markets. Ensuring that CeDeFi-based instruments — e.g., tokenized treasuries, BTC restaking or structured lending — operate within recognized institutional frameworks will be critical for unlocking large-scale liquidity. The key shift is not just about tokenizing assets. It’s about creating a system where digital assets can serve as effective financial instruments that institutions recognize and trust. Why this matters now The next phase of crypto’s evolution depends on its ability to attract institutional capital. The industry is at a turning point: Unless crypto establishes a foundation for seamless capital movement between traditional markets and digital assets, it will struggle to gain long-term institutional adoption. Bridging US capital with Asian liquidity is not just an opportunity — it is a necessity. The winners in this next phase of digital asset growth will be the projects that solve the fundamental flaws in liquidity and collateral efficiency, laying the groundwork for a truly global, interoperable financial system. Crypto was designed to be borderless. Now, it’s time to make its liquidity borderless, too. Opinion by: Jack Lu, CEO of BounceBit.

Back in the early days of Ethereum (ETH), traders who saw its potential at under $1 reaped life-changing returns. Now in 2025, with ETH trading at $1,470 and facing increasing pressure from newer, more utility-driven platforms, many analysts believe the real gem is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a rising DeFi protocol priced at just $0.025 during its presale. The Phase 4 presale of MUTM tokens costs $0.025 token price per token and takes place during the current period. The price of MUTM tokens will escalate to 0.03 dollars when phase 4 transitions into phase 5. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gathered $6.5 million by attracting 8100 holders since its inception. Mutuum Finance could hit $3 in coming months. In addition, the team has just introduced a new dashboard featuring a leaderboard that highlights the top 50 holders, who will earn bonus tokens for maintaining their position in the top 50. Mutuum Finance: Pioneering the Future of DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance has succeeded in attracting many investors through its attractive opportunity structure. Mutuum Finance introduces innovative financial services through its next-generation dual-lending approach which combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) smart contracts operate lending pools through the process of receiving USDT stablecoins to issue ETH asset-backed loans. Users maintain exclusive ownership of their confidential loan arrangements through the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) system because it operates without requiring any intermediaries. Users can access maximum security and adaptive operations together with profit generation through current APY rates that reach up to 10% during liquidity provision. The platform prioritizes both security and transparency by having third-party examine all procedures and implementing open-source smart contracts to build user trust. The platform will stabilize its operations through introducing a stablecoin which backs USD value together with fee-supported token buyback procedures to maintain price stability over the duration. Stakeholders who can obtain staking rewards gain financial incentives for keeping their liquidity on the platform thus building stronger confidence throughout the system. The platform registers growing popularity because it has gained over 8100 investors. $100,000 Giveaway and Community Rewards Mutuum Finance is set to achieve wider adoption through its prize giveaway of $100,000 for donating ten $10,000 MUTM tokens to users. The site adds more value to users who are capable of attracting new investors as it drives user engagement and community growth rates higher. Limited-Time Early Investment Opportunity Throughout the Phase 4 presale event people may purchase MUTM tokens at their initial value of $0.025. Throughout its 11-staged sale period the MUTM token price growth will expand from $0.025 to $0.06 to create up to 140% investor gains before trading commencement. Market experts predict that MUTM tokens will achieve a price of $3 after the launch becoming a leading DeFi token in 2025. Investors who are participating in the first phase and purchase MUTM tokens at the $0.025 price point the current MUTM capital now exceeds $6.5 million. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is poised to offer traders an incredible opportunity, one that may surpass the gains seen by early Ethereum (ETH) investors. With a strong track record of $6.5 million raised and over 8,100 holders already on board, MUTM is setting the stage for massive growth. The innovative dual-lending system, which combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) services, ensures that investors can access secure, profitable, and transparent financial services. As the Phase 4 presale continues, now is the time to buy MUTM tokens at just $0.025 before the price climbs. With predictions that MUTM could reach $3 in the near future, there is no better time to get involved. Don’t miss out on the chance to be part of the next DeFi revolution and invest in MUTM today and watch your investment grow.

The two-year investigation led to the arrest of six individuals across Spain, according to a statement from the Spanish National Police . Crypto Scam Probe Launched After Granada Man Loses €624K in Fraud The investigation began when a man from Granada reported losing €624,000 ($700,000) in a suspected crypto investment fraud. From there, authorities uncovered a wider scheme that used AI-generated videos of well-known public figures to convince unsuspecting individuals to invest in what appeared to be a high-return crypto venture. To sustain the illusion, the perpetrators told victims that additional payments were required to unlock their original investments, thereby perpetuating the fraud. Police did not specify which cryptocurrencies were involved but warned citizens to exercise caution with high-return digital asset schemes. The alleged leader of the criminal operation was arrested while attempting to flee to Dubai. The suspects, aged between 34 and 57, are now facing charges of fraud, money laundering, and falsifying documents. Police have not yet confirmed whether any of the stolen funds have been recovered, and the investigation remains ongoing. The case highlights a growing trend in crypto-related scams, where AI-generated deepfake videos and hijacked celebrity identities are increasingly used to promote fraudulent investments. Similar scams have been on the rise, with criminals exploiting public trust in recognizable figures to push meme coins or pump-and-dump schemes.

The incident came amid a broader trend of crypto-focused social media hacks, many of which are used to pump newly launched meme coins. In February, Dior’s Instagram account was hijacked to promote a fake Solana-based token, which briefly reached a $280,000 market cap before plummeting 90%. Last week, Kaito AI, an artificial intelligence-driven platform providing crypto market analysis, and its founder, Yu Hu, were also targeted in a social media hack on X .

The latest on-chain data shows that a specific class of investors might be behind the relative stability experienced by the premier cryptocurrency amidst the recent macroeconomic chaos. Seasoned Investors Are Loading Their Bags Again In an April 11 post on X, crypto analyst Burak Kesmeci revealed that the Bitcoin long-term holders (LTHs) might be getting more active in the market over the past few weeks. This on-chain observation is based on changes in the Long-Term Holder Net Position Change (30-day sum), a metric that tracks the net change in the BTC supply held by LTHs over a 30-day period. Related Reading: Ethereum Nears ‘Critical Zone’ Historically Linked To Market Bottoms – Is A Rebound Incoming? This metric basically tracks the aggregated behavior of an important investor cohort, providing an insight into the overall sentiment in the market. When this metric is positive, it implies that the long-term holders are in the accumulation phase. On the flip side, when the net position change is negative, it means that Bitcoin LTHs are trimming their holdings and selling their BTC. According to Kesmeci, the long-term investors have been offloading their Bitcoin in the past six months, as the LTH Net Position Change has remained in the negative zone since the last week of October 2024. The metric reached a negative peak level of 827,750 BTC on December 5, 2025, accompanied by a 32% decline in the Bitcoin price. The chart above shows that the Long-Term Holder Net Position Change shifted to the positive territory on April 6, 2024, and appears to be on the rise at the moment. This positive change signals fresh buying amongst the seasoned investors over the past few weeks. Kesmeci noted that the positive shift of the Long-Term Holder Net Position Change has coincided with a recent 12% jump in the Bitcoin price. The Bitcoin price returned above $81,000 after United States President Donald Trump paused trade tariffs on imports from all countries except China. Kesmeci added in the post: Time will tell whether this is just a reactionary bounce or the early stages of a longer bullish phase. However, the metric continuing to remain in the positive region with acceleration could be an important “trend change signal” for us. Nevertheless, the on-chain analyst urged investors to approach the market with caution, as the current momentum is not sufficient. Hence, further conviction is needed from the long-term investors to sustain a major rally in the current market state. Bitcoin Price Overview As of this writing, the premier cryptocurrency is valued at around $83,400, reflecting an almost 5% increase in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, BTC has barely changed in the past seven days. However, this record doesn’t quite tell the full story, as the Bitcoin price had fallen to around $74,000 at the beginning of the week.

In 2031, the target price for XRP is between $15.09 and $16.35, with an average price of $15.72. XRP has a strong community of supporters and developers and continues to see tremendous potential in Ripple’s technology and products. Despite short-term price fluctuations and a bear market, many analysts believe XRP has a bright future. Whether it will reach new highs or continue to grow steadily remains to be seen, but this crypto asset will undoubtedly play an important role in global financial institutions.

XRP, a cryptocurrency specifically tailored for rapid and cost-effective cross-border transactions, holds promise in global finance. The extent of adoption and Ripple’s strides in forging strategic partnerships are pivotal in shaping XRP’s value trajectory. As with any investment, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious approach and thorough due diligence. Why is XRP up? The XRP/USD crypto pair price has increased as the buying influx was abruptly taken, recovering the price to $2.094 during the day. The RSI increased up to 47.95 at the same time but remains in neutral territory. How much will XRP cost in 2025? XRP is expected to trade at an average price of $3.14 by the end of 2025. Will XRP reach $5? For XRP to reach $5, its value would need to double. Considering the current bullish trend and XRP’s price action, a surge to $5 by the middle of next year is not entirely out of the question, particularly if demand for XRP tokens continues to rise and its growth trajectory remains consistent. However, it’s crucial to remember that XRP’s all-time high stands at $3.84, achieved on January 7, 2018. Can XRP reach $20? According to Ripple’s price prediction, XRP has a lesser chance of reaching $20 by 2031. However, it is expected to reach this level if the XRP ecosystem adoption by major financial institutions continues, making it a good option to buy XRP. Will XRP reach $100 dollars? Though there are rumors of XRP reaching $100 in the market, and some pro-XRP analysts are also promoting it, many are raising questions about this possibility. XRP may not reach $100 in the near future, at least. Will XRP reach $1000? If one XRP coin is worth $1000, its market cap must be more than $100 trillion. Comparatively, the total global stock market cap is about $110 trillion. Therefore, it is unlikely that XRP will reach $1000, based on current market dynamics. Does XRP have a good long-term future? XRP is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years, giving good yields to XRP holders and institutional investors. The coin is trading at five times its value from last year, and it is expected to reach the highest price of $16.69 by 2031. This makes it a valuable asset for multiple gains after significant market capitalization with continuous efforts by Ripple Labs. However, regulatory uncertainties still linger with the Ripple lawsuit. Considering these factors, investors must carry out their own research. Recent news/opinions on the Ripple Network Ripple’s USD-pegged stablecoin, RLUSD, has hit a record high market cap of $170 million, according to the firm’s attestation report for February by Ripple’s Senior Vice President, Jack McDonald. According to analysts, the stablecoin is eyeing a top five spot in the industry. Read more about it here . Pro-XRP attorney John Deaton has called on the SEC to release the Inspector General (IG) report on William Hinman’s speech in 2018. The lawyer has urged SEC officials Paul Atkins, Mark Uyeda, and Hester Peirce to push for the release, as he called out the SEC for holding on to the report for too long. Have a detailed look at the news here . XRP price prediction April 2025 According to XRP price prediction, in April 2025, XRP could reach a maximum price of $2.82. The average trading price is expected to be $2.24 for the month, while the lowest it can go as per XRP cost estimation is $1.70, considering the current XRP sentiment.

It is important to consider that predictions are not investment advice. Professional consultation is suggested, or you can carry out your research. XRP historic price sentiment Before 2017, the asset’s value hovered around $0.01; in April 2017, it rose to $0.05; the gradual climb soon continued as it reached $0.25 in May, showing a positive price action as Ripple continued to excel. XRP price history Towards the end of 2019, XRP price stabilized at around $0.30 and did not cross the $0.5 mark throughout the year. However, the bullish run of 2020 pushed the coin’s value to a peak price of $0.8, gaining investor interest before finishing the year at $0.66. Early 2021 was supposed to be bullish for XRP, but the SEC announced a lawsuit that derailed investors. Nonetheless, XRP beat the odds and surged above $1.5 during the year, but by 2022, it plummeted significantly to as low as $0.31. XRP started 2023 at $0.335, and on July 13, it almost doubled its value in a steep spike. It shot from $0.470 to $0.814 while swinging towards $0.9 for a few hours. A partial victory against the SEC triggered the price jump, surging the trading volume. XRP closed 2023 at about $0.62. In 2024, XRP has so far ridden the market wave. The bears earlier on and then a bullish price movement by mid-March resulted in a market price of $0.72, according to data from the cryptocurrency market. In July, XRP traded between $0.418 and $0.658, showing a good recovery. However, the coin went under bearish pressure at the start of August, falling back down to the $0.550 range as per crypto market records showing high volatility. In September 2024, XRP recovered up to the $0.642 level, but the price went down to the $0.500 range in October. A tremendous bullish impulse was observed in November when XRP touched the $1.96 mark, and it reached $2.72 on December 2, 2024. In January 2025, XRP reached a peak price of $3.19 and traded near the $2.90 level in February. It stepped down to $2.1 in March. At the start of April, XRP is trading near the $2.1 range.",Crypto Price Predictions|Ripple|XRP,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|XRP|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-12 15:04:17

However, he also made it clear that this kind of growth takes time. He explained that many people want success to happen instantly, but the crypto market is still young. Big things, he said, often take years to grow. “We’re still in the early stages. Good things don’t happen overnight.” Countries Will Race to Buy Bitcoin Further into the interview, CZ also predicted a future where countries compete to stock up on Bitcoin. Since the U.S. has already treated Bitcoin as a reserve asset, other countries might follow soon. He believes that the richest countries will be the first to invest in large amounts of Bitcoin. That move could send Bitcoin’s price soaring, leaving slower adopters struggling to catch up. Other Experts Predict The Same CZ isn’t the only one who sees a bright future for Bitcoin. Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Block and former CEO of Twitter, thinks Bitcoin’s market value could cross $20 trillion by 2030. That would push the price to at least $1 million. Samson Mow, CEO of JAN3, believes Bitcoin might hit that number by 2025, though many think that timeline is a bit too hopeful.

43253879,https://finbold.com/?p=243430,1744470370,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,Top crypto asset manager sets Bitcoin’s price target for summer 2025,https://finbold.com/top-crypto-asset-manager-sets-bitcoins-price-target-for-summer-2025/,"Bill Barhydt, founder and CEO of Abra Global, a crypto asset manager, is projecting that Bitcoin ( BTC ) will likely rally by nearly 70% by summer 2025. Barhydt’s prediction that Bitcoin will trade between $130,000 and $140,000 by mid-summary is rooted in macroeconomic analysis and rising global liquidity, which he views as a major catalyst for the next leg up in crypto markets. In an X post on April 10, Barhydt stated that Bitcoin’s price is closely tied to the broader tech sector and, more importantly, to the global money supply. As central banks inject liquidity into the system, risk assets like Bitcoin and tech stocks tend to rise. Barhydt sees altcoins as leveraged plays on Bitcoin, which mirrors tech equities in liquidity-driven bull cycles. Generally, as money supply grows, investors flock to Bitcoin as a store of value and high-yield opportunity. “Altcoins are going to be a levered bet on Bitcoin. Bitcoin is is a levered bet on tech stocks, and all of it is going up into the right. We’re seeing a very significant increase in global money supply back to where we were end of December and beyond. And that tells me that we should be at new highs for Bitcoin. New highs by midsummer at the latest, probably something in the $130,000 to $140,000 range,” he said. Alongside Bitcoin, the expert is particularly bullish on layer-1 blockchain platforms like Solana ( SOL ), Sui ( SUI ), and Aptos ( APT ). In his view, these assets offer high-beta opportunities that may surpass Bitcoin’s performance in the next rally. Conversely, Barhydt expressed skepticism of meme coins, warning investors to approach them cautiously. He maintained that such assets are likely to trend toward zero over time and should be treated solely as speculative plays. Impact of M2 money supply on Bitcoin’s price According to data from CounterFlow , the M2 money supply across the top 21 central banks currently sits at $108 trillion, growing at a year-over-year rate of 3.79%, its fastest pace since 2022. M2 global supply growth and Bitcoin price chart. Source: CounterFlow Historically, Bitcoin’s price has strongly correlated with expansions in global money supply. During periods of aggressive monetary easing, such as in 2020 to 2021, BTC posted massive gains. Conversely, major drawdowns have often occurred during contractions or stagnation in M2 growth. Aligning with Barhydt’s prediction, Finbold reported that prominent crypto trading expert TradingShot expects the influx of liquidity to push Bitcoin as high as $150,000 by late 2025. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency analyst Lofty noted in an April 11 X post that the “Golden Bull Run” begins April 14, as the Global Liquidity Index turns bullish for the first time since 2021. He forecasts that Bitcoin could eventually hit $350,000. Global liquidity index chart.

While he diplomatically refrained from speculating on the future price of Ripple’s native token, he did offer a bold forecast for Bitcoin, predicting the top cryptocurrency could reach $200,000. Although the comment was centered on Bitcoin, Garlinghouse’s optimism hints at his expectations for the entire digital asset market. That naturally leads to a pressing question: if Bitcoin reaches $200,000, what could XRP be worth? To answer this, we must examine the current market figures and apply logical, data-driven analysis. IF You OWN $XRP You are prob gonna love this – Ripple CEO has MASSIVE News for You – Fox Business wants an XRP Prediction – Brad Gives a Bitcoin Prediction – The game is set, #XRP will SOAR in 2025 – You need more XRP ASAP – Crypto will make Millionaires pic.twitter.com/0zXvlSTbbq — Oscar Ramos (@realOscarRamos1) April 12, 2025 The Current Landscape: Bitcoin vs. XRP At present, Bitcoin is trading at $83,953.40, with a circulating supply of approximately 19.85 million BTC. This brings Bitcoin’s current market capitalization to about $1.67 trillion. On the other hand, XRP is currently priced at $2.08, with a circulating supply of 58.33 billion tokens, giving it a market capitalization of $121.62 billion. With these figures in mind, if Bitcoin were to climb to $200,000 , it would represent a 138.3% increase from its current price. A similar proportional increase applied to XRP’s market capitalization would give us a foundational projection for its potential price. XRP Price Projection If Bitcoin Hits $200,000 Assuming XRP’s market cap grows at the same pace as Bitcoin’s in this scenario, we would see its capitalization expand from $121.62 billion to roughly $289.6 billion. With the supply of XRP remaining constant at 58.33 billion tokens, the projected price of XRP under these conditions would be approximately $4.96. This projection is not a prediction based on hype but a simple extrapolation assuming XRP maintains its relative position in the crypto market. It’s important to emphasize that this is a conservative estimate based on market cap parity and does not factor in XRP-specific developments or market dynamics that could amplify or suppress growth. Can XRP Outperform This Projection? While a projected price of $4.96 already reflects a significant upside from current levels, there are compelling reasons to believe XRP could exceed this valuation in a full-blown bull market. One major factor is regulatory clarity. Ripple has made significant legal progress in its longstanding battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission . A favorable or conclusive outcome could boost investor confidence and trigger institutional capital inflows into XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Moreover, XRP is gaining momentum in real-world utility. RippleNet, the infrastructure that facilitates cross-border payments using XRP, is seeing increasing adoption in financial corridors across Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. This positions XRP not merely as a speculative asset but as a currency with genuine utility and long-term demand drivers. Another key factor is market cycle behavior. Historically, altcoins tend to lag slightly behind Bitcoin in the early stages of a bull market, only to outperform dramatically once investor sentiment peaks and capital rotates from Bitcoin into altcoins. This period, often referred to as “altcoin season,” has historically seen XRP produce outsized gains. In 2018, XRP reached a high of $3.84 despite having less adoption and facing unresolved regulatory scrutiny. In today’s environment, with a maturing ecosystem and more favorable legal standing, a move beyond $5.00 becomes increasingly realistic. Final Thoughts: Reading Between the (Garling)Lines Brad Garlinghouse may have avoided giving a direct price target for XRP, but his confidence in Bitcoin’s potential surge to $200,000 speaks volumes. It suggests a belief in the broader acceleration of the digital asset market. If Bitcoin does reach that milestone, and XRP follows suit in growth, a price of $4.96 is a strong foundational estimate. But if market dynamics, utility demand, and regulatory clarity align in XRP’s favor, the token could potentially climb even higher. Ultimately, while price predictions are always speculative, using current data and market relationships provides a reasonable framework for expectations. Garlinghouse may have been cautious with his words, but his bullish tone gives the XRP community reason to believe that brighter days could very well lie ahead.

43254251,https://zycrypto.com/?p=104883,1744470944,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,"Vitalik Buterin Publishes Privacy Roadmap for Ethereum, Pushes for L1 Anonymity Structures",https://zycrypto.com/vitalik-buterin-publishes-privacy-roadmap-for-ethereum-pushes-for-l1-anonymity-structures/,"Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum co-founder, published a privacy roadmap to increase security for the Ethereum ecosystem. Responding to calls from community members to address privacy concerns involving crypto mixers, transparency, and regulation, Buterin outlined a brief plan to tackle the problem of balancing privacy with decentralization. Tornado Cash, the Ethereum mixing service, was sanctioned by the U.S. government in 2022. Tornado mixes different transactions together to disguise a token’s history. The U.S. government contended that the mixer facilitated money laundering and stamped down on anyone connected to the network. For that matter, many Ethereum developers steered clear of Tornado to protect themselves from the government. Moreover, ethereum validators and block builders limited their use of Tornado, making the blockchain slower. In his roadmap, Buterin relied heavily on zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) to solve the privacy problem. ZKP uses cryptographic algorithms to verify transactions without uncovering the underlying data. Algorithms that enhance privacy, especially at the lower layers (e.g., L1), are being sought after, providing security for both customers and businesses. Buterin’s roadmap includes four main areas of privacy: on-chain privacy, partial anonymization of applications, safeguarding privacy of ‘reads’ to the blockchain, and network-level anonymity. He suggests this could be achieved by introducing privacy functions to wallets, including a user-friendly interface and security features activated by default. He further indicates that modularity could be used to enhance privacy, such as with the ‘one address per application model’, where an address links to itself rather than to other addresses in the network. The roadmap includes a plan to simplify operations, with FOCIL and EIP-7701 standards, so that unnecessary metadata is reduced to a bare minimum, disallowing censors from filtering out content. Eavesdropping will be reduced by incorporating the short term TEE based Remote Protocol Calls (RPC), until Private Information Retrieval becomes more viable. Eavesdropping will be reduced by using multiple RPC, so that sensitive data is not exposed on the network. By lowering the attack space, Buterin aims to increase the security of blockchain users. Private transactions, moreover, will be made more secure and cost-effective by using proof aggregation protocols. Private wallets should have added features to keep private keys safe and should keep user data private to avoid data leakage. And links between applications should remain concealed so that RPC nodes, by accident or on purpose, cannot access metadata. Pascal Caversaccio, an Ethereum security researcher, pointed out that trustless technology opens the door to surveillance and a lack of privacy. A graph could be mined from the Ethereum metadata to detect the flow of money through the blockchain and view an individual’s balance. EIP-7701 simplifies security protocols by increasing their modularity, restructuring them so they don’t need relays or public broadcasters. RPC nodes could be used to eavesdrop on a user’s transaction. Security, therefore, can be enhanced by using programming techniques such as modularity to decrease the amount of data roaming around on the blockchain. Buterin seems to propose a programming approach to improving anonymity, with the added benefit of improving speed and efficiency. Ethereum has a very modular structure, and this strategy could fit in with the overall direction and expertise of the Ethereum community. Blockchain transactions have had increased scrutiny regarding privacy concerns. Ethereum has always stressed the importance of transparency, being an open-source project. But now, transparency is proving to be a double-edged sword, with increased accountability on one side and the dangers of censorship on the other side. Many enterprises prefer Ethereum because it has a strong development team. But various sectors like healthcare and finance require more secure transactions to preserve the privacy of their customers.",Ethereum|News|Ethereum News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-12 15:15:44

If it happens, what are the implications for Bitcoin? It is not clear if the Fed will use its tools to add liquidity to the market. Agency officials continue to reinforce the idea that they are not in a hurry to take any action regarding the ongoing tariff chaos.

Many experts agree that Trump wants to weaken the dollar to boost exports and offset the trade deficit. Kashkari doesn’t see the trade deficit as something extraordinary for the U.S. The disagreement on the interest rate led to a slow-burning conflict between Trump and the Fed Chair, Jerome Powell. Reportedly, Trump seeks to terminate Powell through the Supreme Court before his term ends. The U.S. president can’t fire the Federal Reserve Chair without cause. Read more: Trump seeks to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell via the Supreme Court. Good news for the crypto market? Will the Fed add liquidity to the markets? The short answer is “not yet.” Kashkari said the Fed has the tools to provide liquidity, but he noted that the agency won’t intervene until it is clear that the market cannot correct itself. And the 90-day pause on tariffs doesn’t add clarity to the situation. Considering that the fear index is high and a recession is likely, the Fed could have been more proactive and cut rates to encourage people to enter the markets and inject the economy with liquidity. Rising bond yields signal a weakening economy, and Kashkari admitted that the Fed is paying close attention to this market. However, the policymakers keep waiting. To prevent the premature increase of liquidity that might have boosted inflation and saved the markets from total collapse, they need to act accurately, which is not easy in the conditions of the tariff policy that makes little sense to many people. Kashkari notes that the decline of the U.S. dollar during turbulent times is unusual. He sees it as the shift in investors’ preferences. The Fed finds itself in a no-win situation. The inflation rate is still above the preferred 2% level, while keeping the interest rates high leads to higher mortgage interest and problems in refinancing the national debt. How does inflation affect the crypto market? If the Fed decides to draw liquidity to the markets, it is not clear which method the agency will use. The crypto X community reacted to Kashakari’s interview pretty unambiguously, suggesting the Fed is going to print money. Kashkari mentioned a different tool to add liquidity. https://t.co/qnG48iVi4o pic.twitter.com/ntqz4uwQi6 — The ₿itcoin Therapist (@TheBTCTherapist) April 11, 2025 He said Standing Repo Facilities, or domestic standing repurchase agreement facilities, are a backstop measure that keeps overnight interest rates in check and provides liquidity in the form of Fed funds against US Treasury debt and mortgage-backed securities. But the short-term inflation influx is probable, and the Fed’s task is not to let it spiral into long-term inflation. In recent years, inflation spikes have stimulated the growth of cryptocurrencies as people start to look for alternative ways to save and invest money. So, in general, times of economic turbulence are seen as an opportunity for the crypto market. A vivid example is the rise of the crypto market following the grandiose sell-off triggered by the announcement that COVID-19 gets a pandemic status. Bitcoin is powered by Chaos. — Michael Saylor (@saylor) April 10, 2025 Bitcoin’s supply keeps on increasing. Thus, we can speak about Bitcoin’s own inflation, but the new BTC units hit the market with ever-declining speed and will eventually stop at the 21 million mark. It makes Bitcoin different from fiat money printed by central banks. As a top crypto with a fixed supply, Bitcoin may be seen as a hedge against inflation. Its inclusivity, global accessibility, and independence from the government leverage trust in Bitcoin, while traditional institutions and governments lose people’s trust during inflation sprints. While Bitcoin is deflationary, the supply and demand mechanism makes its value volatile in the short term. Many point to Bitcoin’s long-term ability to accumulate value, which makes it a store-of-value asset. While the Bitcoin-stocks correlation exists, it can be called defining, so Bitcoin can still be an alternative to traditional investments.

According to police sources, the four officers attached to the Bengaluru Central Crime Branch (CCB) are now being investigated by the police after the Karnataka government granted the sanction. According to reports , the evidence the former Indian police officers tampered with were proceeds of criminal activities seized from international hacker, Srikrishna Ramesh alias Sriki, after he was arrested in 2020. According to the sources, A Special Investigation Team (SIT) from the Karnataka Police Criminal Investigation Department was appointed to look into the Bitcoin scam tied to the hacker. The sanction was approved under Section 17A of the Prevention of Corruption Act, with the group arresting Sridhar Pujar, a current deputy superintendent of police, and police inspectors Prashanth Babu, Chandradhar S R, and Lakshmikanthaiah, in connection to the crime in 2024. The sources mentioned that the SIT had gathered evidence that police officers tampered with the devices seized from Sriki and his associate, Robin Khandelwal, by employing the services of private cyber experts. The group was also looking into corruption in the case. Indian police officers under scrutiny for evidence tampering According to the police source, there has been a movement of Bitcoin, which has caused suspicion and a need for investigation. “There has been a transfer of Bitcoin from one of the accused to a technical expert. There is also the question of the claim of the disappearance of cryptocurrency held by the hacker after he was arrested and taken into police custody (in 2020). These are being investigated as acts of corruption by the police officials,” the source said. The police source highlighted that once the investigation is complete, the SIT will need additional sanctions under Section 19 of the Prevention of Corruption Act to file a charge sheet against the officers. They will also need one under the Karnataka Police Act and Section 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code to proceed. According to the SIT, their probe found that a cyber expert brought in to assist with the investigations by the Bengaluru Central Crime Branch (CCB) into the illegal activities of Sriki in 2020 illegally accessed a crypto wallet of the hacker’s accountant, moving Bitcoin worth over $2,000 into his crypto wallet. During the investigation, the SIT fingered five people, including cyber expert K S Santhosh Kumar who owns a private firm called Group Cyber ID Technology Pvt Ltd in Bengaluru, and the four Indian police officers, in its FIR, alleging illegal concealment, breach of trust by a public servant, and destruction of evidence filed in the Cyber Crime Police station of the CID in January 2024. SIT’s investigations unravel illegalities The details of the investigation revealed there were numerous procedural lapses by the Indian police, including illegal detention, and lack of documentation of the logins, passwords, and data for computer usage by the accused. The Indian police officers were also accused of providing a laptop worth Rs. 60,000 (about $700) to the accused to facilitate hacking. In the statements documented by the Indian police in earlier charge sheets filed by the CCB, Sriki mentioned that he had about 400 to 500 Bitcoins in his possession when he was apprehended by the authorities. The CCB is yet to recover any of the Bitcoin allegedly acquired illegally by the hacker. According to investigations conducted by SIT, in January 2021, under the instructions of Babu, the cyber expert Kumar gained access to the crypto wallets, email accounts, and bank accounts of Sriki and Khandelwal and changed their logins and passwords in the absence of court orders or witnesses. In its FIR, the SIT also mentioned that Babu provided a laptop worth $690 to Sriki, where the hacker accessed his account on Amazon Web Services, but none of the data he accessed was collected for evidence by the officers. The same police officers who were part of the CCB Bengaluru police from 2020 to 2021 were also accused in September 2023, with the FIR showing that they tampered with two laptops in evidence after they were seized by Sriki.

Yes, we’re still big on crypto but industry-agnostic by design. If it’s unconventional and world-shifting — we’re in.” He wrote.

This would provide intermittent relief to crypto firms. While a ‘long-term solution’ is still under work and may take a few months to come to fruition, an ‘exemptive relief’ may just be the way forward. Read on as we discuss the implications of this positive legislative move and how the best crypto to buy now can help you benefit from it. A State-Wise Crypto Regulation Not Ideal In the same round table discussion, which included representatives from firms like Uniswap, Coinbase, and Cumberland DRW, Uyeda said that state-wise crypto regulations can be regressive for the industry. It may lead to a ‘patchwork of state licensing regimes.’ Ideally, market participants should operate under a single central SEC license instead of complying with 50 different crypto regulations in the same country. This hints that the crypto regulations may be framed at a federal level, with minimum state participation. This is great news for crypto service providers, as they will be able to operate with minimum legal compliance. $BTC Holds $82K Amidst Positive Inflation Numbers Besides positive crypto regulations, the overall macro US economy is also showing signs of reversal. The US Producer Price Index (PPI) stood at 2.7% as against the expected 3.3% mark. This is the first month-over-month PPI decline since March 2024. $BTC held its highs of $82K amidst this positive news. It’s currently trading at over $85K . Another $BTC positive is the US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the performance of the dollar against a basket of partner currencies. For the first time, DXY has fallen below the 100 mark since 2022. Traditionally, a lower DXY is bullish for $BTC. The last time DXY fell this low, it led to a parabolic $BTC bull run that lasted 12 months. Now, the divergence on the DXY chart suggests it can fall to 90 as well, which is, again, positive for $BTC. With both factors – charts and regulations looking bullish – there may not be a better time to invest in crypto markets. Here are some top altcoins you should be looking at now. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Crypto to Buy Right Now Crypto is indeed finding momentum again. Just take a look at Bitcoin. It’s bouncing almost perfectly off of the 50 EMA on the weekly chart. On the short-term 4-hourly chart, too, $BTC is positive. It’s now trading above the 10, 20, and 50 EMAs, signifying a change in trend. If you’re backing Bitcoin to rise higher and want to make the most of its climb, consider becoming an early investor in BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . It’s a new cryptocurrency that stands apart due to its unique reward system. Unlike other cryptos, BTC Bull Token will give free $BTC to its token holders. Holders of $BTCBULL who store their tokens in Best Wallet will automatically receive real $BTC every time the King Crypto reaches a new landmark, such as $150K, $200K, $250K, and beyond. Furthermore, it’s also slated to follow a deflationary model. By shaving off a portion of the total $BTCBULL supply every time Bitcoin’s price rises by $25K, the developers plan to boost the token’s demand and price. BTC Bull Token is currently in presale, which is why you can grab each token for just $0.00246. Speaking of the project, it has gotten off to an impressive start. It has already raised over $4.5M at the time of writing and is likely to continue attracting investors. Here’s how to buy $BTCBULL . 2. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) – Brand-New Altcoin with a Fresh Prospect for the Creator Industry SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is easily among the best cryptos to invest in right now, seeing as it’s a revolutionary AI-crypto project aiming to streamline the $85B online content creator industry. SUBBD is coming out with a new AI-powered crypto subscription platform that will offer a bunch of AI tools to online creators to help them streamline content creation, management, and distribution. Next, by allowing the fans of these creators to use their $SUBBD tokens to subscribe to exclusive content, SUBBD aims to strengthen the relationship between the creators and their audiences. Moreover, $SUBBD , which is the primary mode of payment on the SUBBD platform, can be used to chat directly with the creators, get subscription discounts, vote on which features are prioritized and which creators get onboarded, etc. What’s more, early buyers of $SUBBD can also stake their tokens and earn a decent 20% APY for the first year. You can buy $SUBBD for just $0.05515 if you get in now. The project, though new, has attracted substantial investor interest. It has already raised over $150K so far. 3. Broccoli ($BROCCOLI) – Trending Meme Coin Based on the Pet Dog of Binance’s Ex CEO $BROCCOLI is one of the very few meme coins that managed to surge in the recently downward-sloping crypto market. Inspired by the pet dog of Binance’s Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao, Broccoli is proof that crypto degens’ capacity to back a coin to the hilt shouldn’t be underestimated. The token has gained over 1,150% since its launch in February, and after a long-drawn slump, it’s now back among the top trending cryptos . Having climbed more than 100% in just the last seven days, $BROCCOLI has broken out of the $0.23 resistance level. It’s currently trading at $0.27 and looks more than likely to be the next crypto to explode …again! Bottom Line Even though the US government is clearly in love with crypto, as it’s pushing for favorable regulations, it’s worth remembering that it doesn’t guarantee any returns, especially in the short term. Any amount of analysis is at the mercy of the market’s volatility. This is why it’s important to only get into crypto with an amount that’s small enough for you. Also, we always urge our readers to do their own research before investing.

Top markets reported heavy losses with the S&P 500 falling close to 5%, Dow Jones 4%, and Nasdaq suffering a 6% decline. However, premier cryptocurrency Bitcoin has resisted the recent downward price pressure and has remained steadfast above $81k. Trump styled the aggressive April 3 move as “Liberation Day” for the USA, but it could result in a massive trade war worldwide, leading to another major economic recession. Affected entities, including America’s allies like Canada, the European Union, and others, have already announced retaliatory measures, and adversaries like China have followed suit. Bitcoin remains the only major asset that has held onto its price levels going into the weekend. The top cryptocurrency by market capitalization initially fell 5% to nearly $81k. Still, it has since recovered some of these losses and is sitting relatively comfortably at $84k, reversing the downward trend entirely. Bitcoin’s Strategic Buying Opportunity Bitcoin’s recent price stability in the face of a major American-initiated trade war offers insight into the future of global economics. The primary reason Bitcoin is showing incredible resilience is the US Dollar’s threatened status as the global reserve currency. The US’s financial burden is breaking new records at a rapid pace. The national debt has crossed $33 trillion, and for the first time in the country’s history, interest payments on this gigantic figure will exceed the national defense budget of $950 billion. Within the next six years, the interest on debt will likely surpass all US government tax collections and other sources of revenue. According to Larry Fink, the CEO of major investment bank BlackRock : “If the U.S. doesn’t get its debt under control… America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin,” Previously, Bitcoin promoters used the same logic, but here, we have the CEO of the largest bank in the world actually using it in his communique with the investors. This shows that BTC has come a long way in recent years. The stable performance of the top digital coin has resulted in investors looking at the cryptocurrency with renewed enthusiasm, not as a speculative asset but a long-term store of value similar to Gold. According to leading financial author and commentator Morgen Rochard: “Bitcoin isn’t a stock pick. It’s an opt-out button.” As Bitcoin continues to offer a much more stable alternative to the uneasiness of the global markets under the cusp of a trade war, it will continue to prove its worth as a serious investment tool.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-12 15:54:46

Analysts Predict That This $0,01 Token Can Surpass Its Performance by 1200%",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/missed-ethereums-eth-presale-analysts-predict-that-this-001-token-can-surpass-its-performance-by-1200/,"Ethereum’s presale in 2014 was an unforgettable moment in crypto history. Early adopters who invested when ETH was $0.30 per token watched their holdings skyrocket to life changing amounts as Ethereum went to over $4,000. Ethereum was one of the most successful investments in crypto. But if you missed that boat, don’t worry. The crypto world is buzzing with a new contender that could rival Ethereum’s early success. Enter Ruvi AI (RUVI) , a game changing project that combines AI and blockchain in a way the market has never seen before. Ruvi AI’s presale is your chance to get in early on what’s shaping up to be a revolutionary ecosystem. With its unique presale structure, cutting edge tech and unparalleled ROI potential Ruvi AI could be the next big thing for those who are ready to act now. Ethereum’s Legendary Story You can’t talk about crypto presales without mentioning Ethereum. Back in 2014 those who believed in Ethereum were rewarded beyond their wildest dreams. ETH’s presale at $0.30 per token was a beacon for the ambitious and its meteoric rise turned many into crypto millionaires. It wasn’t luck, Ethereum’s success was due to its smart contract technology which set the foundation for decentralized applications and changed the blockchain industry. Fast forward to today and Ethereum’s legacy is clear. But with tokens now trading at much higher prices the opportunity for massive ROI has shifted to emerging projects with similar disruption potential. That’s where Ruvi AI comes in as a front runner. Why Ruvi AI is the Next Ethereum Most projects trying to replicate Ethereum’s success without offering anything new, Ruvi AI takes blockchain to the next level. At its core Ruvi combines blockchain and artificial intelligence to create an ecosystem where users can generate AI powered content, contribute to decentralized innovation and earn rewards through $RUVI tokens. This isn’t just a tech gimmick, it’s a full blown platform designed to deliver utility and unparalleled profits to its participants. Ruvi AI’s presale is inspired by Ethereum’s legendary model but with its own unique and lucrative features. By offering investors a clearly structured presale with bonus tiers and long term growth strategy Ruvi presents a rare opportunity to get in early on an innovative project before it takes off. The Revolutionary Presale Structure The presale got investors attention fast and reached its first milestone in just a few days, raising over 100,000$ with more than 10M tokens sold. To illustrate Ruvi AI’s potential for explosive returns let’s look at the VIP 5 presale tier. With a minimum entry of 500,000 $RUVI tokens at 0.01$ each investors can get in for just 5,000$. But what makes this even more attractive is the 100% bonus in the VIP 5 tier, doubling your token count to 1,000,000. When $RUVI lists at 0.07$ your investment will be worth 70,000$. That’s a 1400% ROI in a short period of time, similar to Ethereum’s early days. Some industry analysts say RUVI could go even higher after listing. They say 0.50$ is easily within reach. If that’s true and that prediction holds, the initial investment of 5,000$ will turn into 500,000$. But more than the numbers Ruvi AI delivers value through its ecosystem. By continuously generating demand for its tokens through AI powered tools and community adoption Ruvi ensures its trajectory remains upwards. Ruvi AI’s Unique Selling Point Ruvi AI’s ability to replicate or even surpass Ethereum’s early success comes down to its focus on innovation and community involvement. While Ethereum revolutionized smart contracts Ruvi AI combines artificial intelligence with blockchain, putting tools of creation and analytics in the hands of its users. This breaks down barriers and democratizes access to revolutionary technology. Also Ruvi’s tokenomics model prioritizes investor confidence. The presale’s transparency combined with robust governance features allows participants to shape Ruvi’s direction. Unlike many crypto projects Ruvi fosters a sense of community and trust, showing it’s built for both short term profits and long term sustainability. Don’t Miss the Opportunity of a Lifetime Ethereum’s presale generated some of the biggest returns in crypto history but the ship has long since sailed for new investors. Ruvi AI wants to create similar success stories for those brave enough to act now.Ruvi AI isn’t just a token, it’s a whole new ecosystem that redefines what blockchain and AI can do together. With its presale bonuses, cutting edge tech and 1400% ROI potential Ruvi could be the next Ethereum but this time you won’t want to miss the bus. The window is open but won’t stay open for long. Get in today and be part of the decentralized revolution.

Analysts such as Michaël van de Poppe have issued warnings of further declines, forecasting a fall to $70,000 as macroeconomic uncertainties and trade-policy fears shake investors. As Bitcoin’s hash rate soars to unprecedented levels — 1 zeta hash per second, to be exact — so too does its network security, even while prices stumble. Amid this turbulent backdrop, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is making waves, its presale enjoying a strong run as Phase 4 hits full-swing. With 8,100 holders and 396 million tokens sold, more than $6.50 million has been raised — a clear sign of growing confidence in its decentralized lending model. Bearish Triggers For Bitcoin Grows Stronger Bitcoin’s daily chart shows a seller-dominated market, with price action trading below key moving averages. Renown analyst Van de Poppe said the slump can be attributed to more classical market turbulence, including potential Fed intervention and geopolitical trade tensions. Key immediate support can be found around $75,566, although a break of that level could spark cascading liquidations down to $70,000. Even with a currently oversold read, bullish reversals remain questionable. Traders are now looking for signs of recovery around the $80,541 resistance level, although analysts warn that macroeconomic headwinds could push Bitcoin’s correction much longer into April. The Excitement Is Gaining For Mutuum Finance Presale MUTM is still receiving capital with its current Phase 4 opening tokens at $0.025. Now, Investors that invest here gain a 20% profit in phase 5, which raises the price to $0.03. The tokenomics behind the project assure a 140% return at its $0.06 exchange listing, with post-launch price predictions ranging from $0.30 to as high as $1.50 —601% to +5,900% from the current presale cost. While speculative assets chase volatility, Mutuum Finance introduces real utility via decentralized lending pools, mtTokens, and buy-back systems that create consistent demand. With its structured rewards and overcollateralized borrowing framework, over 8,000 holders have already taken up positions. Demand Created by Strategic Incentives New features have recently been added, including a live leaderboard for the top 50 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) holders, who receive extra tokens for holding in those spots. This special government encourages player competitiveness and on-chain holding. At the same time, the team is also completing a Certik audit of its smart contracts which will be publically announced on social media once finalized. Their commitment to security and transparency aligns with our mission of establishing mutuum finance as a staple in DeFi lending. A Measured Approach To High-Yield DeFi Through design choices like dynamic interest rates, peer-to-peer lending options and support for assets like meme coins that would not get listed on a centralized exchange, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating a competitive advantage against existing lending protocols. With this revenue-driven buy-and-distribute model, platform fees are redirected to MUTM purchases, yielding perpetual buy pressure and rewarding the stakers. Aside from getting tokens at the lowest price, early presale participants also set themselves up for exponential gains when adoption improves. Phase 4 approaches rapidly, and indecision will lead to missing the final opportunity before the price increase. Act Before Phase 4 Closes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Phase 4 will be phased into Phase 5 in the upcoming days — activating an instantaneous 20% price hike. Tokens are also being sold quickly, and there is limited time for $0.025 tokens with $6.55 million already raised. If post-launch targets reach $1.50, early buyers could see returns of over 5,900%. While Bitcoin’s slump is dominating the headlines, savvy investors are diversifying into MUTM — a project that is built for stability and growth irrespective of the wider market swings.

Traders are holding firm, institutions are staying active, and dips are being bought quickly. But while blue-chip cryptos weather the storm, a lesser-known contender— MAGACOINFINANCE —is quietly emerging as one of the most aggressive early-stage plays analysts are watching this quarter. Meanwhile, broader ecosystem coins like Solana (SOL) , TON , SUI , and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) are keeping momentum with developer activity, ecosystem growth, and Layer 1 efficiency plays. MAGACOINFINANCE UNDER $0.0004 — 100x COMING! MAGACOINFINANCE Could Be Q2’s Best Risk-Weighted Entry As a market analyst tracking early-stage altcoin velocity, I’ve seen dozens of projects launch with high ambition but little structure. MAGACOINFINANCE is not one of them. With Stage 6 now sold out and Stage 7 live at $0.0002908 , what stands out isn’t just the 25x ROI to its confirmed listing price of $0.007 —it’s the precision of execution. This is a token built without insider favoritism: no early unlocks, no seed allocations, and no backroom deals. Just one price, one supply ( 100 billion tokens ), and a rapidly growing base of retail holders already over 12,500 strong. If you’re looking for a high-upside move with structural clarity and accelerating wallet growth, this may be your best shot in Q2. MAGA50X Bonus – 50% Token Boost Still Available The MAGA50X promo gives contributors a 50% token bonus —but only for Stage 7 participants. The moment this round fills, it’s over for good. This is the bonus that early whales are already leveraging. SOL, TON, SUI, and BCH Continue Expanding Use Cases Solana (SOL) leads with speed and ecosystem strength TON scales integrations into mainstream messaging platforms SUI builds efficient tools for developers and Web3 scaling Bitcoin Cash (BCH) remains a top-tier asset for fast, affordable transactions 50% BONUS TOKEN OFFER — ENDS SOON! USE MAGA50X Conclusion As Bitcoin (BTC) , XRP , and Ethereum hold their ground, Layer 1 names like SOL , TON , SUI , and BCH continue building. But for those seeking an early-stage opportunity with analyst-level risk-to-reward alignment, MAGACOINFINANCE distinguishes itself with its innovative approach and attractive pre-sale incentives. Investors are encouraged to conduct thorough research, stay informed about market trends, and consider diversifying their portfolios to navigate this dynamic landscape effectively.

This project is pushing back on insider-controlled crypto and replacing it with something cleaner, more accessible, and built to last.

Amid the chaos, one of the most improbable winners emerged from the strange depth of the crypto market: Fartcoin (FART). The Solana-based memecoin, has rallied nearly 90% in the past week and roughly 300% over the past month, leaving traditional assets — and much of the crypto market— far behind. By comparison, bitcoin (BTC)—the largest and most established cryptocurrency—has been roughly flat over the past week and month, while riskier altcoins like ether (ETH), Solana (SOL) and XRP are in the red. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index has slid around 2% over the past week and is down nearly 5% over the month as rising bond yields and geopolitical tensions weigh on risk assets. It has even outperformed gold, which recently hit an all-time high driven by safe-haven demand, gaining 6.5% in a week and up 12% in a month. “Fartcoin’s absurd outperformance is the perfect metaphor for this market,"" said Kirill Kretov, trading automation expert at CoinPanel, in a message on Telegram. ""A joke wrapped in volatility, where escalating U.S.-China tariffs make 'rational' trading a fantasy."" What FARTCOIN's rise mean for cryptos By design, memcoins are cryptocurrencies that occupy an extreme corner of the crypto market. Unlike more established digital currencies, they have no utility or scarcity. These tokens, like Fartcoin, are unapologetically speculative, driven largely by social media hype, online communities and the momentum of short-term traders. Read more: Crypto for Advisors: Memecoins Launched in October, Fartcoin quickly gained prominence as one of the tokens propagated by Truth Terminal, an autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agent created by Andy Ayrey , and became a viral hit amid the crypto-AI speculative wave driven by launchpad Pump.fun. Popularized with joke community slogans like ""hot air rises"" and ""billions must fart,"" the token's market cap swelled from zero to just shy of $2.5 billion by mid-January. Then, it all came crashing down with the crypto market as Donald Trump's inauguration, and the TRUMP token launch marked the peak of speculative froth. FART, similarly to other small and risky cryptocurrencies, tumbled over 90% to a $200 million market value by March. But, since then, it bottomed out and has staged a staggering comeback, becoming one of the best tokens in the digital assets sector. What makes fartcoin's rally dumbfounding is that it completely decouples from other speculative memecoins. Since Fartcoin has already quadrupled in price, other prominent meme tokens like dogecoin (DOGE), pepecoin (PEPE), dogwifhat (WIF) and TRUMP languished near their lows. ""I have never seen such relative strength during macro uncertainty and no signs of animal spirits for altcoins,"" said pseudonymous crypto trader Smiley Capital, who has gained a substantial following for his blunt commentary. ""It takes a special kind of retardation paired with conviction to simply size up into an asset named Fartcoin whilst the global economy is imploding."" The token's outperformance could also be an early signal of risk-on sentiment returning to markets—at least amid crypto traders—after past week's extreme fear, Smiley Capital speculated. ""It's also a barometer and frontrunner for broader risk assets,"" he pointed out. ""That's a statement most of you are not ready to hear yet, or even grasp."" Whether the unpredictable and absurd nature of the new financial order is highlighted by Fartcoin's rise or simply another chapter in the memecoin market remains to be seen. But Fartcoin's stunning rally, outperforming most of the asset classes, serves as a reminder that virality often trumps fundamentals in the current market, regardless of how absurd it may sound.

Here are five factors backing O’Leary’s bet. 1. SUI Price Chart Traces Bullish Reversal Pattern At $2.12 in April, SUI’s price was down over 60% from its record high at the beginning of January. But it still notches a solid gain for investors who bought it for $1.40 as it debuted to crypto exchanges in May 2023. Popular crypto market analyst CryptoBullet wrote in an Apr. 7 update on X that they noticed a bullish technical indicator for SUI. Its price formed a chart pattern that preceded an aggressive multi-month rally for NEAR token, another layer-1 blockchain currency. $SUI 2025 vs $NEAR 2021 This long & aggressive correction with 3 consecutive lower lows reminded me of May-July 2021. And the #NEAR pattern just fits #SUI perfectly here! $NEAR had an aggressive multi-month rally with distribution at the top followed by a -80% correction… pic.twitter.com/6J5zxLB5QU — CryptoBullet (@CryptoBullet1) April 7, 2025 “No way I’m selling my $SUI here,” CryptoBullet concluded. “I still believe we can see a double digit $SUI this year.” On the macro tailwind side, they added, “We’ll have a good mid term bounce this year no matter what. Sui will shine during that period.” Meanwhile, Dutch crypto asset manager Michaël van de Poppe wrote on Apr. 9: “Once the markets start to reverse, I assume that SUI will be one of the strongest assets to jump back.” $SUI is one of the best performing assets within the crypto industry. Recently, @WalrusProtocol has launched, a big player within the DePIN and Storage vertical. Once the markets start to reverse, I assume that SUI will be one of the strongest assets to jump back. Investors… pic.twitter.com/XdZPw1L7H1 — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) April 9, 2025 “Investors tend to move back to the asset that used to do well prior to anything macroeconomic related as these assets yield the highest confidence,” van de Poppe added. 2. Mysten Labs Leadership Team Elaborating on his SUI tip, O’Leary commended the founder and team behind the May 2023 Web3 project with a currency ranked #18 out of all cryptocurrencies by market capitalization this April: “This is a guy that came out of Facebook. All he’s focused on is speed… This guy has sped the whole thing up… You want to do a million transactions a minute? You gotta use this. So that’s a bet I’m making.” He’s not the only one with faith in the team developing Sui. Even with its price taking a rough tumble along with other cryptos in Q1, the positive bias in SUI’s social sentiment hit a new high. Mysten Labs, the venture-backed company behind SUI, is led by former Facebook engineer Evan Cheng. Mysten’s CTO, CPO, Chief Scientist, and Chief Cryptographer are also former Meta employees. 3. SUI Clocked in 3,700% Faster Than Ethereum Sui’s network speed is no joke. A CoinGecko speed check found the Layer-1 blockchain was among Web3’s fastest, clocking transactions per second behind none other than Solana. While Ethereum clocked 22.70 transactions in a second, the Sui Network did 854.05. Only Solana’s was higher at 1,053.65. Mysten co-founder Adeniyi Abiodun says the focus on speed is part of a competitive strategy to develop Sui into a “coordination layer” for the entire Internet. In an interview at Token 2049 in Hong Kong, Abiodun said: “Sui isn’t just a blockchain, Sui is a global coordination layer for the internet. So our target addressable market is way bigger than Solana, Taun, and all these other platforms.” 4. Blockchain-Powered MMO Gaming O’Leary said Sui is “going to own gaming” because of its speed: “You know gaming latency is your killer. If you want to start passing tokens around in the middle of gameplay, you gotta be fast. Ethereum’s too slow. Sui can do it.” Speeds on Sui are fast enough for the mobile gaming platform Gamisodes to introduce Sui blockchain-powered mobile gaming in Q4 last year and lock in player rewards to the network. Multiple other blockchain-powered game titles have also launched on Sui. In an interview for an issue of Blockchain Gamer, Abiodun said: “Gamers will help drive not only mass usage of chains in the form of active wallets, transactions, and asset value creation, but they will also lead the charge of DeFi onboarding for web3 newcomers.” The network’s gaming business is such a big part of its competitive strategy that Mysten Labs has developed the first blockchain handheld gaming console, the SuiPlay0X1. Pre-orders started last September. 5. Canary Capital Files For Sui ETF on Apr. 8 Meanwhile, Nashville-based Web3 hedge fund Canary Capital filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Apr. 8 to issue an Sui ETF on Wall Street. That would make the currency available for institutional investors to trade in a regulated financial product. CoinMarketCap reported: “The ETF would be the first to track SUI, and it might also involve staking portions of its holdings through trusted providers, with the ETF possibly earning staking rewards.” As Bitcoin got its spot ETF, crypto exchange markets went wild with approval. Reiterating comments he made last month in an interview about Bitcoin, O’Leary said he thinks blockchain is about to become essential to the economy: “It’s going to be the 12th sector of the economy in five years.” The post Shark Tank Judge Says This Is ‘The Hottest’ Cryptocurrency in April appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Kevin O'Leary|Sui,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|SUI,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-04-12 16:10:08

Speaking in an exclusive interview on Fox Business’s The Claman Countdown, Garlinghouse confirmed that Ripple and SEC staff have reached an agreement to end the case, with the commission set to vote on a final dismissal. As part of the agreement, Ripple will pay the SEC $50 million, less than half of the $125 million the company initially put in escrow for potential penalties. Ripple will get back the rest, including any interest earned. “This is a big step forward,” Garlinghouse said. “Gensler’s SEC was on the wrong side of the law. With new leadership at the SEC and the White House, we are seeing a much more constructive and pro-innovation stance.” The broader backdrop for the Ripple-SEC deal is the changing regulatory climate in Washington. Garlinghouse praised the Trump administration’s approach to digital assets, calling out figures like David Sacks and Paul Atkins as key allies in promoting a crypto-friendly environment. “President Trump is absolutely delivering on his promises,” Garlinghouse said. “These are people who are focused on how we can ensure that this industry thrives at home with sensible, common-sense regulations.” Related News: JUST IN: Binance Lists Three Altcoins in Futures The Ripple CEO cited stablecoin legislation and a market structure bill as the two most important regulatory pieces gaining momentum in Congress. Ripple recently launched a stablecoin under a New York trust license, and Garlinghouse suggested that federal clarity would benefit both companies and consumers. Garlinghouse also touted Ripple's latest major acquisition, which is one of the largest crypto acquisitions to date and reflects the company's confidence in the US market. “We could not have made this purchase a year ago,” Garlinghouse said, citing what he described as a “coordinated attack” on crypto from multiple agencies during the Biden administration. “That administration was not listening to consumers. It was not listening to voters. What we are seeing now is a complete shift.” Garlinghouse remained optimistic despite recent market volatility, including price drops following new tariff announcements. With XRP down nearly 5% from recent highs and Bitcoin still trading 2% below pre-tariff levels, Garlinghouse noted that it’s important to take a long-term view: “XRP has been the best performing major cryptocurrency over the last 90 days. We are investing in where the world will be in three years, not what will happen in the next six months.” *This is not investment advice.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. SHIB and DOGE jump as MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the chat with viral buzz and a structured presale plan. The memecoin market is heating up again. Over the past week, Shiba Inu (SHIB) and DOGE have both posted impressive 10% gains as retail investors pour back into the sector. Fueled by renewed interest, viral tweets, and speculative sentiment, memecoins are once again proving they have serious staying power. At the time of writing, DOGE has climbed back toward $0.17, driven by chatter around Elon Musk’s continued support and new payment integrations. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu spiked following the announcement of a major Layer-2 upgrade, reigniting hopes of a new alt season fueled by the community-driven tokens that kicked off the last one. But while the OG memecoins are reclaiming ground, another token is quietly preparing for what some analysts are calling a 10,000% run by the end of 2025 — and it’s one people may not have heard of yet. You might also like: Dogecoin price prediction: Memecoin rally or downward dog? Introducing MAGACOIN FINANCE: More than a meme? Enter MAGACOIN FINANCE, a politically charged meme-token with serious infrastructure behind it. What started as a clever concept is now building massive momentum across Telegram, Twitter, and YouTube — and it’s not slowing down. Unlike many memecoins that rely solely on hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as a structured, stage-based presale with long-term vision and built-in virality. That mix is what’s drawing in smart money and crypto influencers alike. And while specific numbers are under wraps, it’s confirmed that the presale has already crossed a significant mark — a milestone that has historically indicated major upside potential. Analysts see 100x–1000x upside: A true 10,000% ROI play? According to multiple altcoin analysts, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the next SHIB, but with more structure and strategy. With the current price of $0.0002908, momentum and community engagement, some are projecting gains as high as 10,000%, or a 100x to 1000x return for early entrants. Imagine turning a $100 allocation into $10,000 — or even $100,000 — in under a year. That’s the kind of ROI that made SHIB and DOGE legends in the last cycle, and it’s the same potential driving investors to accumulate MAGACOIN FINANCE before the next stage pricing increase hits. What’s more, the timing couldn’t be better. As we move deeper into Q2 2025, the market is itching for breakout narratives. MAGACOIN FINANCE could be perfectly positioned to capture the next wave of meme-fueled FOMO. SHIB and DOGE are safe, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is the wild card Make no mistake, Shiba Inu and DOGE still have a place in any meme portfolio. However, the window for 2,900% or 10,000% gains with those tokens has mostly passed. What remains is incremental growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE, on the other hand, offers an asymmetric bet with massive upside. Its branding, its roadmap, and its virality all point toward a project that could dominate headlines as the next “surprise winner” of 2025. FINAL thoughts: This coin could define the next meme cycle As memecoins regain momentum, the smart play isn’t just chasing past performers — it’s spotting the next trend before it explodes. Shiba Inu and DOGE may be rising 10% today, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting up for a potential 10,000% story that could make early believers very wealthy by the end of 2025.

Coutts says that even though Bitcoin has traditionally been more volatile than stocks, it has recently witnessed a relatively lower level of correction than would be expected based on its historical levels of price swings. “Folks don’t understand what is happening with Bitcoin during this risk-asset panic. BTC with 2.5x the volatility of the S&P 500 experienced a drawdown of 28% vs. the S&P 500’s 19%. That is a massive OUTPERFORMANCE. Perhaps it’s not just BTC’s strength, but a reflection of the increasing fragility of the fiat system and its asset markets – complex systems inherently trend toward entropy/chaos. Bitcoin is mirroring this unraveling.” Source: Jamie Coutts/X Going forward, Coutts says that Bitcoin will grow in importance as two of its use cases gain prominence across the globe. “What is happening right now is epic. Things are breaking. The fiat fractional reserve credit-based system’s fragility is on full display, yet again. Look through the next couple of days and understand Bitcoin’s ascendancy as a global settlement layer and collateral asset is accelerating. Fast. Before it was the plebs who understood this, this time it will be nation states.” Bitcoin is trading at $83,227 at time of writing.

According to crypto analyst Brett, who reported the development via X, over 30 million XRP—valued at approximately $30 million—was traded in just one minute, raising strong speculation about an imminent price breakout. JUST IN: Whale Unleashes $30 Million $XRP Trades in Just 1 Minute! Breakout Could be anytime soon pic.twitter.com/l4IDhvZcay — Brett (@Brett_Crypto_X) April 12, 2025 Whale Activity Sends Strong Signal Whales—large holders or institutional entities known for influencing markets—are often viewed as smart money. Their actions tend to precede major market movements, and this particular trade volume spike has reignited interest in XRP’s short-term trajectory. While the price hasn’t yet exploded, the sudden burst in trading volume indicates that whales could be positioning themselves for a significant market shift. This burst of activity is not just a blip on the radar. It suggests coordinated interest from high-net-worth participants or entities anticipating a catalyst for XRP’s next leg up. Whale tracking platforms have also noted an increase in wallet activity involving millions of tokens, further corroborating this pattern. Market Poised for Breakout? The timing of these whale trades is critical. XRP has been coiling within a narrowing price range over the past few weeks. Historically, such consolidation phases are followed by sharp breakouts, either upward or downward. But with the influx of large-scale buys, the sentiment now leans strongly in favor of a bullish resolution. In the broader context, XRP’s fundamentals have remained firm. Ripple’s expanding partnerships, its increasing presence in emerging markets, and ongoing developments with the XRP Ledger (XRPL) continue to lay a solid foundation for long-term value. These technical and fundamental alignments further support the idea that a breakout is not only likely—it may be imminent. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 What Traders Should Watch Traders are now closely watching for confirmation in the form of higher highs and strong volume surges that follow whale accumulation. If momentum picks up in tandem with broader market tailwinds, XRP could soon break through established resistance levels and embark on a new bullish leg. Moreover, the crypto community has seen this kind of pre-breakout whale behavior in previous cycles. Each time, large transactions have preceded sharp upward movements—especially in assets that have strong utility and institutional interest, like XRP. The explosive $30 million XRP trade reported by Brett could be a sign of what’s to come. With whales showing clear interest and XRP hovering near breakout territory, the coming days may be crucial. For now, the message from the deep pockets is clear: they’re getting ready—and they may know something big is on the horizon .

According to reports, the number of young investors still active in the domestic stock markets is seriously plummeting, a development that has caused mixed reactions across the stock market in the country. According to data from the Korean Securities Depository, investors in their 20s and 30s still active in the domestic market have reduced drastically, dropping from 14.9% and 20.9% to 11% and 19.4%, respectively. In a recent interview with a 20-year-old South Korean worker, he mentioned that he has never invested in Kospi, noting that it doesn’t look profitable. This same reaction is shared by most people, with that major reason why they are shifting their investments to United States stocks and digital assets. According to another worker in his 30s, Heo In-sung, he noted that he is “gradually building a portfolio of US stocks.” Heo added that he is gradually shifting away from Korean companies like Samsung Electronics and Kakao. South Korean investors shift towards US stocks and crypto According to reports , local investments by South Korean investors in their 20s and 30s dropped, hitting an all-time low of 9.8% and 18.8%. Ownership levels also showed the same trend, with people in their 30s holding about 9.9% of the listed stock in the Korean market in 2020, but that number has dropped to 7% in 2024. For those in their 20s, it was a drop from 2.2% to 1.6% in the same duration. Investors in their 40s are not left out, showing how concerning the trend has become. This group represents the largest demographic in the Korean investor market, and they are dropping out of the market seriously. According to latest market data, they made up about 23% in 2021 but fell to 22.1% in 2024. Those aged 50 and above have now used the opportunity to climb up, owning a big 70.9% of all domestic stocks. While the trend also reflects that investors in South Korea are aging, it also shows that most of them do not see the usefulness of being in the country’s stock markets. According to a senior researcher at the Korea Capital Market Institute, Hwang Se-Yoon, the trend is worrying. “If the younger generation continues pulling back, trading activity could shrink, reducing market liquidity,” she said. Digital assets booming among the youths While South Korean investors in their 20s and 30s have been reluctant towards the domestic stock market, there has been an attraction in the crypto market. According to the Financial Services Commission, about 48.7% of investors in the crypto industry were in the age category as of last year. The commission also mentioned that their total trading volume on the top five exchanges surpassed 2.52 quadrillion won, about 79% of the 34 quadrillion won traded by investors in the Kospi. “It’s now common knowledge in the industry that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are siphoning off retail investment funds from the stock market,” a brokerage inside said. According to sources, over 700,000 overseas investors own a stake in NHS Investment & Securities and 56% of them are in their 30s and 40s. In contrast, only about 13% of Kospi 200 investors were in their 30s, while 57% were 50 and older. The volume of foreign stock transactions carried out by South Koreans nearly doubled in 2023, moving from 59.3 billion shares in 2022 to 112.4 billion shares the next year. The number saw an uptick in 2024, rising by 39% to hit 156 billion shares, according to the data shared by the Financial Supervisory Services (FSS) and nine securities firms obtained by Democratic Party Rep. Kim Hyun-Jung. The move has continued into this year, with the first quarter seeing South Korean investors transact $10.9 billion, despite the drop in the US stock market. The trend has now adopted the term “eoljookmi”, which means an unconditional attitude that shows a willingness to invest in the US market no matter the condition. However, young people are concerned about maximizing their income, which has driven them to US stock markets and digital assets, with the South Korean market in some sort of stagnation since the COVID-19 pandemic.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As DOGE and ADA face pressure, Lightchain AI gains quiet momentum with $18.9m raised and a growing buzz around its $0.007 token. As Dogecoin and Cardano encounter renewed selling pressure, a lesser-known contender is quietly building momentum under the radar. Lightchain AI , currently priced at just $0.007, has emerged as a fresh topic of conversation among savvy investors and early crypto adopters. With $18.9 million raised during its ongoing presale at a token price of $0.00712, Lightchain AI is increasingly seen as a project with significant upside potential. While major players like DOGE and ADA navigate market fatigue and slowed development progress, this new AI-powered blockchain is gathering attention for its forward-thinking infrastructure and growing community interest. As sentiment shifts and capital rotates toward innovative projects, Lightchain AI’s climb toward the $1 mark is becoming a key narrative. The crypto spotlight may soon pivot from the old giants to this fast-emerging alternative. This article will explore Lightchain AI’s background, key features, and potential for growth. You might also like: From panic to opportunity: Why Lightchain AI is thriving as the crypto market implodes How is Lightchain AI gaining momentum amid Dogecoin and Cardano’s market challenges Dogecoin and Cardano have recently encountered challenges ranging from slowed development to reduced investor engagement, creating space for new entrants to capture attention. Lightchain AI is capitalising on this shift by offering a distinct value proposition focused on decentralised intelligence. Its ability to attract interest despite a saturated altcoin landscape reflects growing dissatisfaction with legacy tokens that have failed to innovate. Investors looking for utility beyond hype are beginning to notice Lightchain AI’s potential to reshape blockchain infrastructure. The project’s appeal lies in its forward-leaning direction, supported by transparent governance and an ecosystem that rewards meaningful contributions. As confidence in traditional memecoins wavers, Lightchain AI’s consistent presale performance and growing community engagement highlight its emergence as a serious alternative, not just another speculative trend. Factors contributing to Lightchain AI’s steady rise toward the $1 milestone Lightchain AI’s remarkable trajectory is being spearheaded by a few key components. The company’s roadmap depicts a clearly defined passage from the prototype to the global adoption, with steps such as ecosystem growth, open-source development, and cross-chain integration. This transparent vision is one of the factors that prolongs the interest of investors looking for the executable and objective nature in this vision. Additionally, the token economics of Lightchain AI, with its deflationary and equalizing distribution, is modeled for sustainability, which, in turn, supports the long-term rise in the value of the token. Adding to the aforementioned, the solid trust of the governance model and a high level of inclusivity stemming from the developers’ loyalty are equally the foundation of this trust. The synergy of these factors with an elastic economic model and continuous presale traction builds trust in the long-term improvement of the project. The methodical progress of Lightchain AI is debunking the superficial expectations as the market players begin to comprehend that a $1 valuation is achievable if the momentum sustains. Could Lightchain AI’s growth signal a shift in confidence within the crypto market Investor sentiment across the crypto landscape is evolving. As speculative trading loses dominance, there’s a noticeable shift toward projects that offer practical utility, sustainable design, and transparent development. Lightchain AI’s consistent growth amid broader market fluctuations may signal this transition. With its community-driven governance and emphasis on ethical, decentralised infrastructure, Lightchain AI represents a departure from meme-driven speculation. Investors are increasingly drawn to ecosystems that align with long-term innovation rather than short-term virality. Lightchain AI’s ability to attract capital during a cautious market environment speaks volumes about changing priorities. This trend could indicate a broader reallocation of interest toward platforms that balance vision with execution. If this pattern continues, Lightchain AI may not just be a rising altcoin — it could mark the beginning of a more utility-focused investment era in crypto.

It has been almost two years since the NYAG sued DCG, Silbert, DCG’s now-bankrupt lending arm Genesis Global Capital, Moro, and crypto exchange Gemini, alleging they worked together to cover a $1 billion hole in Genesis’ balance sheet. This financial crisis was allegedly caused by the wipeout of Singapore-based crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) in 2022. She later expanded the lawsuit against the three companies and their affiliates about a year ago. According to James, both Digital Currency Group and Genesis falsely assured their users on social media that DCG had absorbed Genesis’ losses from 3AC’s implosion. DCG And Genesis Fails to Fulfil Promissory Note Contract DCG and Genesis were lying to investors and defrauding them out of billions. The truth of the matter was that they only covered up the hole with a promissory note. They pleaded to pay Genesis $1.1 billion over 10 years at a 1% interest rate. During all this time, DCG has “never made a single payment under the Note.” Still, it didn’t stop claiming that the promissory note was legitimate. On the other hand, Gemini and Genesis settled with the OAG while the company, Silbert and Moro, continued to contend with them. SEC Sues Digital Currency Group and Moro In January 2025, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged DCG and Moro with misleading investors about Genesis Trading’s financial health status in the aftermath of the 3AC collapse. Consequently, they were asked to pay up to $38.5 million in civil penalties, with DCG responsible for a larger percentage of this fine. Both Digital Currency Group and Moro settled with the agency without admitting to or denying the violations of the Securities Act of 1933. This marked a critical chapter in unraveling the 3AC saga that shook the crypto world to its core.

Going forward, Lucky says the Ethereum price could rise to $4,000. Another analyst called Javon Marks also predicted the value of Ripple might soar to $16.5. Amid these positive predictions, an AI coin called IntelMarkets (INTL) is showing potential for more gains. Compared to ETH and XRP, it has a low market cap which gives it room for massive price growth. The value of INTL could rise as high as 20x before the year ends. Ethereum (ETH) Could Pump To $4,000, Says Analyst In a recent tweet, a crypto analyst, Lucky, explained that the Ethereum price could record a breakout soon because it successfully held a key support level. Currently, the analyst noted that there is a falling wedge pattern forming on the Ethereum price chart. So, Lucky expects a market rebound to happen soon. If ETH breaks out of this bearish pattern, Lucky forecasts the Ethereum price to soar to $4,000. Lastly, the analyst noted that the current Ethereum price is a good buying opportunity. Meanwhile, another analyst called NihilusBTC forecasts the Ethereum price might pump to $8,000. Presently, the Ethereum price is trading above the $1,500 mark. However, CoinMarketCap data indicates the Ethereum price has plummeted by 12.6% in the weekly timeframe. Nevertheless, the recent uptrend could push the Ethereum price to a new yearly peak in the next few weeks if buying pressure increases. Ripple (XRP) Eyes Potential 8x Surge Based On History Since the beginning of April, the Ripple price has been consolidating between $1.60 and $2.20. The altcoin price recently soared past $2.00 following the Trump administration’s decision to halt the 10% tariff for 90 days. The uptrend was short-lived, with the Ripple price quickly dropping below the $2.00 level. Still, the Ripple price has shown prospects for more upward movement if buying pressure rises. Javon Marks in a recent tweet predicted the Ripple price could surge to $16.5 based on historical data. This is an increase of over 8x from its current price level. Another expert, Rose Premium Signals says the Ripple price is trading in a descending channel. They added that a rounded bottom pattern was forming inside the channel which hints at a short-term accumulation before the Ripple price breaks out. Rose Premium Signals forecasts the Ripple price could jump to a peak of $3.30 if it surpasses the resistance around $2.00–$2.20. IntelMarkets (INTL): The AI Trading Gem Set To Soar By 20x This Year While the Ethereum price has struggled below the $2,000 resistance, IntelMarkets (INTL) has been gaining ground, and is preparing for the big next move.

By 2028, the EOS price value can reach a maximum of $3.26. The EOS price in 2031 could reach a maximum possible level of $5.30 and an average forecast price of $5.10. EOS , a completely decentralized network, favors the evolution and expansion stages of other bigger decentralized applications (dApps). It offers multitudes of benefits in terms of efficiency, user empowerment, and the ability to provide various services. The network has experienced a long series of developments since its initial launch in the cryptocurrency market in 2017. Since then, it has reached new highs, featuring the monumental $4 billion Initial Coin Offering (ICO) as its best. However, it still falls behind in its claim of establishing itself as an “Ethereum Killer”, as its stability has remained questionable. Can EOS reach $10 soon?

EOS price analysis gives out a highly bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market trends. Coin value has depreciated to $0.6010 amidst the growing bearish momentum. From an overall perspective, the cryptocurrency lost up to 3.81% of its worth today. Technical indicators as well as the price charts continue to give out a bearish verdict with respect to the market scenario. Is EOS a good investment? EOS has seen more green days in the last month. The coin’s price decreased by 35% over the last year. However, the circumstances can change, and a recovery cannot be ruled out. A bullish rally may be expected in the latter part of this year (2025), potentially pushing the EOS above $1. Why is EOS down? EOS is in descent with bearish pressure. The coin decreased to $0.6010 in the past 24 hours. EOS price will decrease further if further pressure from the sellers is experienced. Will EOS reach $2? The highest price that EOS observed was $1.34 in December; EOS is sweating to break this level. Suppose the broader cryptocurrency market moves in a bullish direction. In that case, EOS may also follow the trend and is expected to reach near the $2 level by the end of 2027 if everything remains favorable. Will EOS reach $5? EOS was last seen above the $5 level in November 2021. Since then, the EOS value has plummeted significantly; however, the coin is expected to surpass $5 again by the end of 2031. Will EOS reach $10? According to the EOS price prediction, EOS may not achieve the $10 level in the next five years. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $10, possibly after 2035. How high could EOS go? EOS is expected to reach a high price of $5.30 by the end of 2031. Is EOS a dead coin? No, EOS is not a dead coin because it still has an active community. EOS has good brand recognition and is the 63rd ranked cryptocurrency. It also observed good bullish sentiment in November last year when the entire crypto market turned green. Is EOS a buy or sell? Considering its active community and ongoing development with potential future breakthroughs, EOS looks like a good buy option, despite the fact that it observed some price stagnation in the past. (Remember, this is not investment advice.) Does EOS have a good long-term Future? According to The Motley Fool, a private financial and investing advice company based in Virginia, EOS is a “very risky choice.” The publication says EOS’s future is uncertain, given the scandals and problems surrounding the EOS Foundation and Block—One blockchain company. However, the market speculates that EOS will reach above $5.30 by 2031, but the speculations can change at any time.

EOS historic price sentiment EOS price history In 2018, the EOS ICO made history by raising a staggering $4 billion, the largest initial coin offering ever. After this success, EOS’s cryptocurrency quickly climbed into the top 5 by market cap. However, by late 2021, the price of the EOS token had fallen from $10 in June 2018 to $4.40 due to a declining user base. In 2022, EOS experienced significant price swings. It peaked at around $3.27 and dropped to a low of about $0.81. On average, EOS traded at approximately $1.59. In 2023, EOS saw even lower prices, reaching a maximum price of $1.33. The token dipped to as low as $0.53 between August and September due to less buying of EOS tokens. On average, EOS traded at roughly $0.84 and closed the year at $0.8450. In Q1 2024, EOS’s price fluctuated between $0.65 and $1.30, with the lowest prices in January. By February and March, prices began to stabilize, averaging around $1.02​. EOS reached $1.15 on April 12, 2024, but soon declined below $1, maintaining an average price of about $0.8 throughout May. In June, EOS fell from $0.8142 to $0.5772, while July saw further loss with the token’s value decreasing to $0.4808. However, by mid-July 2024, EOS recovered back to $0.6100, and on August 23, EOS closed at $0.5566. In September 2024, EOS further dipped near the $0.4600 range, while October also observed the same pattern with prices mostly trending near the $0.450 range. Market sentiment changed in November, and a strong bullish trend was observed throughout the month, and the coin peaked at $1.36 on December 6. Following the late December correction, EOS then recovered into 2025 above the $0.766 mark in January but came down to $0.593 in February. In March, EOS dipped down to the $0.456 level, but it recovered back to the $0.67 level at the start of April.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-12 16:30:00

Solana ( SOL ) rose to $125 on Saturday, up by over 30% from its lowest level this year, bringing its market cap to over $64 billion. The ongoing recovery is partially because of the recent performance of some tokens in its ecosystem. Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ) price has soared by over 81% in the last seven days, while Popcat ( POPCAT ) is up by 57%. Other top-performing Solana tokens were Gigachat, Goatseus Maximus, Fartboy, and Vine. Their rebound helped to push the total market cap of all Solana meme coins to over $7.02 billion.

Most of this volume was in Orca, Raydium, and Pump. Nansen data shows that Solana handled over 350 million transactions in the last seven days, making it one of the most active chains in crypto. This is a 4.8% increase from the previous week. Also, active addresses jumped by 15% to over 28.13 million. Solana price technical analysis SOL price chart | Source: crypto.news Technicals point to an eventual SOL price rebound after it formed a falling wedge pattern. This pattern comprises two down trending and converging trendlines and is a popular bullish reversal sign. The two lines converged at a crucial support level, which it has avoided moving below several times since last year. Also, the Relative Strength Index and the MACD indicators have continued rising this week. Therefore, the coin will likely have a strong bullish breakout. The next key point to watch is $150, up by 20% above the current level. A drop below the key support at $110 will invalidate the bullish outlook.

Following a steep drawdown, SOL has finally shown signs of buyer interest, sparking renewed optimism among traders. Despite the recent bounce, Solana remains over 47% down from its early March highs, reflecting the broader bearish sentiment that has gripped altcoins in the face of macroeconomic uncertainty and global tensions. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Show Conviction: 63% Of Supply Hasn’t Moved In A Year The price action is approaching a make-or-break point, and traders are watching closely. Top analyst Big Cheds shared insights on X, suggesting that a move “over $125 could trigger long on 2-level filter,” signaling the potential start of a momentum-based breakout if SOL can clear this threshold with strength. This level now acts as a key pivot in the short-term outlook for Solana. A breakout above $125 could reignite bullish momentum and attract sidelined capital back into the altcoin market. However, rejection at this resistance could fuel further consolidation or downside. With market conditions still fragile, all eyes are on SOL’s reaction to this crucial zone as traders weigh the risk and reward of a potential breakout scenario. Solana Rebounds 25% As Bulls Eye Breakout After weeks of relentless selling pressure, Solana is showing renewed signs of strength. Following a dramatic correction that took SOL from over $200 to a low of $95, the asset has finally found relief. Since Monday, Solana has bounced more than 25%, fueled by improved sentiment and positive macroeconomic developments. The rally began shortly after US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for all countries except China, which now faces an increased 145% tariff. This temporary easing of trade tensions injected optimism back into the market, sparking strong upside across high-beta crypto assets like SOL. Top crypto analyst Big Cheds shared a bullish outlook, noting that “SOL Over $125 could trigger long on 2-level filter.” This level now serves as a key technical threshold—breaking above it could confirm the end of Solana’s local downtrend and potentially initiate a sustained bullish phase. Cheds’ system highlights this setup as an optimal long trigger, assuming volume and momentum follow through. If bulls manage to push SOL past $125 with conviction, a breakout rally could follow, supported by improving on-chain metrics and recovering market sentiment. However, failure to reclaim this resistance could result in renewed selling pressure or extended consolidation. For now, $125 is the line in the sand. Related Reading: Solana Approaches Make-or-Break Level As Technicals And Fundamentals Align – Analyst SOL Price Faces A Technical Barrier At $128 Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $122 after a week of volatile recovery attempts, yet it continues to face key technical resistance. For weeks, SOL has struggled to push above the 4-hour 200 Moving Average (MA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which are now converging around the $128 level. These indicators have acted as strong resistance during previous rallies, and bulls must reclaim them to signal short-term strength and validate the potential for a broader recovery phase. If buyers manage to push SOL above $128 and hold it as support, momentum could build quickly, with a possible run toward higher resistance levels. However, failure to break above these technical thresholds could weaken bullish sentiment and encourage renewed selling pressure. Related Reading: Ethereum Long-Term Holders Show Signs Of Capitulation – Prime Accumulation Zone? Additionally, the $120 level is now a crucial zone of immediate support. Losing this level would undermine the recent bounce and open the door to a deeper pullback. If $120 fails to hold, SOL could drop quickly toward the $100 level or even lower, revisiting areas of previous consolidation. Traders are watching this range closely, as the next move will likely dictate whether SOL enters a sustained recovery or resumes its broader downtrend.

Here’s the Next Resistance If This Demand Zone Holds,https://timestabloid.com/ethereum-reclaims-key-support-heres-the-next-resistance-if-this-demand-zone-holds/,"Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is showing renewed signs of strength after reclaiming a significant support level at $1,574. According to market analyst Ali, who shared the insight via a post on X , this zone is crucial for Ethereum’s short-term price stability. If the bulls succeed in defending this level, the next major resistance lies around $1,810. #Ethereum $ETH has reclaimed key support at $1,574. If this demand zone holds, the next major resistance stands at $1,810! pic.twitter.com/WNzQV6xTPH — Ali (@ali_charts) April 12, 2025 The Importance of the $1,574 Support The $1,574 level has acted as a critical demand zone in previous trading sessions, where buyer interest typically outweighs selling pressure. Reclaiming it signals a potential shift in momentum back in favor of the bulls, especially after recent market volatility that threatened to push ETH below psychologically and technically significant thresholds. In technical analysis , support levels like this are essential because they often determine whether a rally can resume or if further decline is inevitable. By bouncing from this zone, Ethereum demonstrates resilience, hinting at renewed accumulation by traders and investors expecting an upward move. Eyes on the $1,810 Resistance If this support zone remains intact, Ethereum’s next hurdle lies near the $1,810 resistance, a level that has historically served as both support and resistance in past market cycles. A breakout above this resistance could pave the way for further upside potential, possibly pushing ETH back into the $2,000 range if volume supports the move. This resistance zone also coincides with structural highs that have previously capped Ethereum’s momentum . For the market to confidently flip bullish, Ethereum must not only test this level but also close decisively above it with strong buying volume, signaling confirmation of a bullish reversal. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Sentiment and On-Chain Activity While technical levels offer crucial insight, broader market sentiment and on-chain metrics further shape Ethereum’s outlook. Recent upticks in active addresses, transaction volumes, and network participation suggest that interest in Ethereum remains strong, even amidst macro uncertainty and regulatory noise. Additionally, with Ethereum’s role in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and layer-2 scaling solutions expanding steadily, the asset continues to be a central pillar in the digital economy. These fundamentals offer long-term bullish prospects, further strengthening the case for price recovery once resistance levels are overcome. Ethereum’s recovery above the $1,574 support has been a welcome sign for traders eyeing a reversal. As Ali points out, holding this zone is pivotal to challenging the next key resistance at $1,810. While market participants should remain cautious of potential short-term fluctuations, the setup points toward a potentially stronger ETH in the days ahead, provided this support structure remains intact and broader market conditions remain favorable.

But here’s the reality: The market today is far more competitive than it was during Bitcoin’s glory days, making high-potential projects harder to find. This article aims to save traders time and help them kickstart their profits by highlighting four of the best altcoins to buy now—BlockDAG, Ripple, Solana, and Cardano. This in-depth analysis of their features and future potential explains why these coins could be traders’ key to success in today’s market. 1. BlockDAG: The Blockchain Breakthrough You Can’t Ignore—800x ROI Potential! BlockDAG (BDAG) has firmly established itself as one of the best altcoins to buy now, thanks to its strong market performance—with over 19.1 billion coins sold and $213.5 million raised during its presale. Plus, the network’s innovative X1 Miner App has just hit a whopping 1 million users, highlighting its soaring demand and adoption! The key factor behind this success is BlockDAG’s future-ready DAG-based technology, which enables high speed and scalability. The network’s recent Keynote 3 presentation revealed that the planned mainnet will handle up to 15,000 transactions per second, far exceeding traditional blockchain capabilities. BlockDAG is also set to introduce 1,000 decentralized apps (dApps) by 2026, further boosting its utility. In addition to its technological advantage, the network is expanding its global presence with strategic partnerships, such as the one with renowned Italian football club Inter Milan, attracting thousands of new holders daily. With 10 major CEX listings on the horizon, analysts predict massive growth for BDAG. Long-term forecasts suggest that BDAG, currently priced at $0.0248 in batch 27, could reach $20 by 2027—offering over 800x returns! 2. Solana: The Ultra-Fast Blockchain Powering the Future Solana (SOL) has made its mark in the crypto space due to its high-speed blockchain, capable of processing thousands of transactions per second with minimal fees. Priced at around $115.28 and with a market cap of $59.18 billion, Solana’s unique combination of proof-of-history and proof-of-stake ensures fast transaction finality. This makes it a go-to choice for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and non-fungible token (NFT) platforms. Its scalability and low transaction costs make it a standout option for anyone looking to invest in an efficient, high-performance blockchain. 3. Cardano: The Blueprint for Sustainable Blockchain Cardano (ADA) stands out as one of the best altcoins to buy now due to its research-driven approach, prioritizing security and sustainability. ADA’s peer-reviewed protocols and formal verification methods ensure a reliable foundation for decentralized applications, especially in critical sectors like finance and healthcare. This focus on high assurance makes Cardano an attractive option for those seeking a blockchain platform with long-term potential. With a market cap of around $22.37 billion and a current price of $0.625994, ADA continues to demonstrate strong value in the crypto market. 4. Ripple: The Future of Financial Transfers Wrapping up this roundup of the best altcoins to buy now is Ripple (XRP), which stands out due to its focus on revolutionizing cross-border payments. By providing faster, cheaper, and more efficient international transfers, Ripple has gained strong traction with banks and financial institutions. Despite regulatory hurdles, the growing number of partnerships shows the demand for its solution. With XRP priced at around $2.067 and a market cap of $121.61 billion, it holds solid potential for investors seeking exposure to a promising, real-world use case in the global payments sector. The Final Verdict Each of these coins has strong potential, earning them a spot among the best altcoins to buy now . Solana’s fast blockchain makes it a leading choice for DeFi, while Cardano’s research-driven approach makes it a reliable platform for long-term growth. Meanwhile, Ripple’s cross-border payment solutions keep it a major player in the global payments space. But when it comes to the perfect mix of utility and profit potential, BlockDAG stands out. With analysts predicting over 800x returns in just two years, BlockDAG offers one of the highest ROI crypto opportunities on the market today. Plus, at its current price of just $0.0248 in batch 27, buyers have the chance to acquire a bulk amount at a low cost and potentially see explosive returns in the coming years!

Rebecca Dobbs says someone posing as a Chase employee called her and claimed there was a fraudulent transaction on her account, reports Arkansas Business. The scammer tricked Dobbs by manipulating caller ID to display Chase’s number and after gaining her trust, managed to tap into Dobbs’ account. Over 36 hours, the scammer initiated eleven unauthorized wire transfers, draining $476,000 from her account. Although Dobbs promptly reported the fraud in November of 2023, Chase has recovered only $35,000 and refuses to reimburse the rest, leaving her with a loss of about $440,000. In a letter, Chase stated the wire transfers were sent as she instructed. “While we regret you were a victim of a scam, the wires in question were sent as you instructed. After we approve a wire and release it, we send the funds to the recipient’s bank, and we cannot cancel the wire.” Dobbs’ lawyer Todd Turner insists she didn’t authorize the transfers. “People expect that when they have money in a bank account, that the bank will keep it safe and use reasonable care to make sure that some criminal is not taking action to take money away. And when they find out it happens, they ought to do everything they can to help their customer recover that money.” Chase has requested the case be sent to arbitration, and the bank says it won’t comment on ongoing litigation.

Bill A7788 , introduced by Assemblyman Clyde Vanel, proposes to amend state financial laws to allow New York state agencies to accept cryptocurrencies as a form of payment. According to the text of the document, state agencies would be allowed to accept payments in Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Wide range of applications Under the bill, government agencies would be able to accept crypto payments for a variety of purposes: ”fines, civil penalties, rent, taxes, fees, charges, tolls, revenues, financial obligations, or other amounts,” as well as special fees and interest. Cryptocurrency legislation is becoming a key focus in New York - bill A7788 is the state's second cryptocurrency-focused piece of legislation in just over a month. In March, New York introduced A06515 , a bill aimed at criminalizing cryptocurrency fraud and protecting investors from so-called ”rag pools” (a fraudulent scheme where project developers suddenly disappear with investors' money). Cryptocurrency legislative initiatives have received a significant boost since President Donald Trump took office on January 20. Even during his campaign, Trump indicated that his administration intends to make cryptocurrency policy a national priority, as well as turn the U.S. into a global center of blockchain innovation. Possible service fee on crypto payments If passed, the bill would mark a significant shift in New York's approach to digital assets. It would allow government organizations to integrate cryptocurrencies into the payment infrastructure used to collect public funds. The proposal also includes a clause allowing the state to charge a service fee to those who choose to pay with cryptocurrency. According to the text, a state could require ”a service charge not to exceed the costs incurred by the state in connection with a transaction to pay with cryptocurrency.” This could include transaction costs or fees owed to cryptocurrency issuers. Bill A7788 has been referred to an Assembly Committee for consideration and may advance to the State Senate as the next step. Passage of this bill could become an important precedent for other states and catalyze wider adoption of cryptocurrencies in the U.S. public sector. At the same time, the authorities will have to develop clear mechanisms for conversion and accounting of volatile digital assets.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BCH|BUSINESS|ETH|LTC|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-12 16:51:42

Bankless confounder David Hoffman says a change in network culture will have the biggest impact on the Ethereum price performance. David Hoffman Wants Ethereum Community To Stop Policing Behaviour Bankless cofounder David Hoffman has revealed suggestions to improve Ethereum price performance, pointing to a culture and leadership shift in the network. According to an X post , Hoffman says mainstream Ethereum critics are sidestepping the real reason for ETH’s lackluster price performance in recent months. Hoffman notes that Ethereum’s leadership and its culture of alienating users and builders is to blame for its underwhelming performance. The cryptocurrency executive cited the public exorcism of ETH staking platform Lido Finance and criticism against degenerate traders. At the time, Lido Finance came under fire from the Ethereum community for regulatory, centralization, and security concerns while degens took flak for spiking gas fees and lack of long-term projects. He argues that the broad hostility against a class of users plays a big role in the Ethereum price decline. Hoffman notes that the network’s attempt to police behavior on a permissionless chain is the straw that broke the camel’s back. Ethereum price is hanging onto the $1,500 mark after sinking to lows of $1,415 over the last week. To remedy the situation, David Hoffman is advocating for the Ethereum Foundation (EF) to attract users and builders to the network, demonstrating the spirit of true decentralization. “If we want ETH to group, the EF and broader community need to start attracting users and builders, not pushing them away with a holier-than-thou culture,” said Hoffman. Ethereum Price Is Staging A Strong Recovery Hoffman’s comments come amid a fresh market resurgence for Ethereum price with ETH grabbing a 6% spike over the last day. While ETH price has declined to a 5-year low against Bitcoin , momentum is rising for prices to reclaim $2,000. One side, backed by community members like Leo Glisic sees a potential upside for Ethereum, driven by a simple investment narrative. “The play is infrastructure for the future global financial system,” said Glisic. “Ethereum will serve as the settlement and interoperability layer, which is a winner-take-all market.” However, CryptoCurb is comparing Ethereum to Nokia’s downfall, noting that Solana will displace ETH like Apple to become the largest altcoin. Critics like CryptoCurb and Peter Schiff say the rally is unsustainable and an ETH decline below $1,000 is a possibility.

New York State Assemblyman Clyde Vanel (D-Queens) introduced Assembly Bill A7788 on Thursday, and the potential legislation was referred to the Standing Committee on Governmental Operations. If passed, the bill would enable all state agencies to enter into agreements with individuals to receive crypto payments for fines, civil penalties, rent, rates, taxes, fees, charges, revenue and/or financial obligations. Other states have also taken similar steps. In 2022, Colorado became the first state to accept crypto for tax payments , and last September, Louisiana enabled its residents to pay for state services with digital assets. Similar bills have also bubbled up in California and Florida . Vanel introduced similar bills in 2017, 2019, 2021 and 2023. The lawmaker, who has a long history of supporting crypto-related legislation, also recently introduced Assembly Bill 7716, which would direct the New York State Board of Elections to study and evaluate the use of blockchain technology to protect voter records and election results. If passed, the bill would require the State Board of Elections to submit a report about blockchain technology to the governor and the legislature within a year of the legislation taking effect.

The article accused both men of working behind the scenes with Trump allies and U.S. officials to reduce government pressure and boost their crypto businesses. But both men went public, calling the story complete BS. CZ posted on X: “WSJ is really TRYING here. They seem to have forgotten who went to prison and who didn’t. People who become gov witnesses don’t go to prison. They are protected. I heard someone paid WSJ employees to smear me.” Justin Sun and CZ display solidarity CZ served four months last year after pleading guilty in a major U.S. case, but he’s still running Binance’s empire from the shadows. Now he’s accusing someone of paying journalists to go after him, though without naming names. He is a pretty classy guy after all. Justin Sun posted first though, calling CZ his “mentor, friend, and benefactor” and denying he knew anything about the rumors. “He has given me attention, guidance, and direction during my entrepreneurial process,” Justin Sun wrote. He said he fully trusts CZ and claimed his own company, T3FCU, has always worked closely with the U.S. Department of Justice. “Together, we have handled a large number of important cases aimed at protecting global users and punishing illegal criminal groups around the world,” said Justin. WSJ says Binance met Treasury officials to push for lighter rules According to the Wall Street Journal , Binance executives went to Washington last month and met with officials from the U.S. Treasury Department. During the meeting, they asked for the removal of a government-appointed monitor who currently oversees the exchange’s compliance with anti-money-laundering laws. The monitor was put in place after Binance pleaded guilty in 2023 and agreed to pay $4.3 billion in penalties. The Journal said this push to end oversight is part of a larger strategy to get Binance back into the U.S. crypto market. The company has been shut out for more than a year, and removing the monitor would be a first step toward reentering American territory. The article also said Binance was negotiating a deal with World Liberty Financial, the crypto firm owned by Trump’s family. The connection between Binance and the Trump team reportedly started at a private crypto conference held in Abu Dhabi in December. The Journal said CZ was spotted in a VIP-only room—nicknamed “Whale Only”—where guests had to pay $10,000 just to enter. Justin isn’t just a side character in the Journal’s report. He’s listed as World Liberty’s biggest outside investor and currently serves as an advisor to the company. The article said he put $75 million into the stablecoin project in February. Just weeks later, the Securities and Exchange Commission asked a court to pause a fraud lawsuit against him. The lawsuit, originally filed under the Biden administration, accused him of financial crimes. People quoted in the Journal allegedly said the Justice Department had been investigating Justin for months. That was when the paper also claimed that CZ agreed to give evidence against Justin as part of his own plea deal with the government. Justin Sun’s camp issued a direct email response, saying, “It is false to suggest that Tron enables criminal activity.” They also rejected all the claims in the Journal article. A spokesperson said, “We decline to comment on baseless allegations about legal matters.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Indeed, according to data shared by on-chain cryptocurrency analytics platform Glassnode on April 11, Dogecoin whales accumulated 80 million DOGE in just 24 hours. Historically, such transactions have often hinted at imminent price growth, as whale purchases tend to signal confidence in the asset. These transactions could boost Dogecoin, which has recently struggled with massive volatility. As of press time, DOGE was trading at $0.17, having rallied over 6% in the past 24 hours. On the weekly chart, the meme coin is up 13%. DOGE seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold At the current price, Dogecoin is still trading well below its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages ( SMA ), indicating a bearish trend in both the short and long term. The 14-day relative strength index ( RSI ) stands at 45.53, suggesting neutral momentum, with neither overbought nor oversold conditions. AI predicts DOGE’s price Despite the subdued market sentiment, insights from OpenAI’s AI platform ChatGPT predict that DOGE has the potential to rally almost 195% and trade at $0.50 by the end of 2025. The AI model outlined three possible scenarios for the token: The meme coin could rally significantly in a bullish scenario fueled by Bitcoin ( BTC ) hitting new highs, continued whale accumulation, or renewed enthusiasm for meme coins. Under this setup, ChatGPT noted that DOGE may reach between $0.35 and $0.50. DOGE could still see moderate gains in a neutral case where the meme coin simply tracks the general market without regaining significant hype. The expected range in this scenario would be $0.22 to $0.28 by year-end 2025. Should market conditions turn negative or investor interest wane, the AI tool sees DOGE declining and trading between $0.10 and $0.14.

SoSoValue data shows that spot Ethereum ( ETH ) ETFs shed assets in the last seven consecutive weeks. They had net outflows of $82.4 million last week, bringing the cumulative inflows to $2.2 billion. All ETH ETFs now have just $5.25 billion in assets, with BlackRock’s ETHA and Grayscale’s ETHE leading with $1.85 billion each. Grayscale’s mini fund ETH follows with $711 million, while Fidelity’s FETH has $580 million. In contrast, spot Bitcoin ETFs are doing better, with their cumulative outflows at over $35 billion and total assets at $93 billion. Ethereum ETFs have shed assets because of its performance.

Worse, $1000 invested in Ethereum on the same day in 2022 would now be worth $745, while a similar amount allocated to Bitcoin would be $1,400. Ethereum has faced several challenges in the past. The most important one is that it has faced substantial competition from layer-1 and layer-2 networks. Some of the most notable competition is from Solana ( SOL ), Base, Tron ( TRX ), and Arbitrum ( ARB ). This competition means that Ethereum is no longer the most profitable chain in the crypto industry. Data shows that other popular chains and apps like Uniswap, Jito, and Solana have passed it this year. Ethereum price technical analysis ETH/BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news While the ETH price in USD terms looks bad, the ETH/BTC one is worse. The weekly chart above shows that the ETH/BTC pair has been in a strong downtrend, moving from 0.088 in 2021 to 0.0188 today. It has crashed to the lowest point in five years as Ethereum’s dominance has faded. The pair remains much lower than all moving averages, while the Average Directional Index has surged to 44. The ADX is a popular indicator used to measure the strength of a trend. Therefore, the pair will likely continue plunging as sellers target the key support at 0.016, its lowest level in September 2019, down by 92% from the current level.

The sell-off in equities began on April 3, spurred by President Donald Trump's tariff-led uncertainties. Each day since then has been marked by sharp moves in both directions. The panic has hit both the equities and bond markets, while gold has surged to new all-time highs, and the DXY Index has broken below 100 for the first time since July 2023. In response, the S&P Volatility Index (VIX)—often called Wall Street's ""fear gauge"" —has surged to its highest level since last August and this is where things get interesting for bitcoin. The ratio of bitcoin to VIX has hit 1,903 currently, touching a long-term trendline that last time coincided with market volatility around the unwinding of the yen carry trade . At the time, bitcoin had reached a bottom of around $49,000. In fact, this is the fourth time this ratio has hit the trendline and then found the bottom. Previously, it touched the line in March 2020 during the peak COVID-19 crisis and initially in August 2015, both times followed by a rally in prices. If this trendline continues to serve as reliable support, it could suggest that bitcoin might have once again found a long-term bottom.

Moving past the trend of fleeting hypes and repetitive ideas, this year’s significant players exhibit solid performance, supported by measurable growth, modern tools, and a dedicated user base. BlockDAG, Aptos, OKB, and Ondo stand out as the four major movers in the crypto space this year, each paving its unique path, yet all securing their place among the top crypto projects of 2025. Whether you’re an active participant in the market or observing from afar, these projects maintain their relevance and influence. Here’s why they’re worth your attention in 2025. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Enhancing Speed with Concurrent Block Processing BlockDAG (BDAG) is making substantial strides in the crypto world this year, driven by its interesting integration of DAG architecture with Proof-of-Work, enabling the simultaneous confirmation of multiple blocks and thus, eliminating the common delays found in traditional blockchains. The project’s Beta Testnet V1 has launched, achieving twice the processing speed of its previous version. Moreover, it offers practical tools such as no-code token and NFT creation, along with an active dApp ecosystem, demonstrating its application in real-world scenarios. In terms of growth, BlockDAG has outperformed many with its crypto presale figures, raising over $213.5 million, selling more than 19.1 billion BDAG coins, and witnessing a price surge of 2,380% prior to its debut on major trading platforms. The user engagement is robust, with over 170,000 unique BDAG holders and increasing. Additionally, the X1 Miner App supports 800,000+ users, facilitating the straightforward mining of BDAG coins via smartphones. Market analysts are optimistic about BlockDAG’s potential, predicting a possible value of $1 by 2025. Should it reach even half of this estimation, early participants could see substantial returns. The combination of technical innovation, user adoption, and market performance solidly positions BlockDAG among the top crypto projects for 2025 and potentially beyond. 2. Aptos (APT): Enhancing Blockchain with Security and Scalability Aptos (APT) is a Layer-1 blockchain that emphasizes security and scalability, employing the Move programming language to provide a strong foundation for decentralized applications (dApps). As of early April 2025, APT’s trading price stands at about $4.25, with a market capitalization nearing $2.57 billion. Analysts suggest that by the year’s end, APT could see its price range from $5.36 to $25.20, potentially marking a growth of up to 413%. Such projections highlight Aptos as a significant player among the top crypto projects of 2025. 3. OKB (OKB): Enhancing User Experience on OKEx Exchange OKB (OKB) serves as the backbone of the OKEx exchange, providing users with reduced trading fees, governance rights, and access to special features, which collectively enhance user engagement and platform utility. With a current price of approximately $48.97 and a market cap of about $2.94 billion, OKB remains a resilient figure in the competitive market. As OKEx broadens its scope into DeFi and introduces additional offerings, the value of OKB is anticipated to rise, reinforcing its position as a strong contender among the top crypto projects of 2025. 4. Ondo (ONDO): Bridging Traditional Finance with Crypto Ondo Finance is advancing in the decentralized finance arena by tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs), thereby merging traditional financial mechanisms with blockchain technology. Its collaborations with major networks like Solana and Polygon boost its functionality and market impact. Presently, ONDO is priced at around $0.71 with a market capitalization of approximately $1.14 billion. Analysts’ predictions for ONDO by the end of 2025 show a variety of possible outcomes, reflecting the fluid nature of the crypto market. These advancements make Ondo a notable name among the top crypto projects of 2025. Assessing the Pioneers of Crypto in 2025 From Aptos delivering a secure and scalable platform for dApps, to OKB enhancing user benefits on its exchange, and Ondo integrating crypto with tangible assets—each project is solidifying its presence in the market. Yet, BlockDAG stands out distinctly. It’s not merely growing; it’s surging ahead—achieving rapid processing speeds, active dApp integration, practical tools, and an expanding community even before its mainnet launch. With over $213.5 million raised in presale and a value surge of 2380%, BlockDAG’s impact is undeniable. Hence, it leads the lineup of the top crypto projects of 2025 , not just keeping pace but defining it.

XRP accelerates cross-border payments, and SUI expands capabilities for DeFi and NFTs. In contrast, BlockDAG rewards real user engagement during its Beta Testnet phase. BlockDAG (BDAG) connects rewards to essential activities like transactions and mining, showing a commitment to tangible results over mere promises. Having raised $213.5 million and sold 19.1 billion coins, resulting in a 2,380% ROI since its first batch, BlockDAG’s Beta Testnet is demonstrating how active participation can solidify a network’s base. XRP: Analysis of Mechanism and Growth XRP, the native currency of the XRP Ledger, supports swift and economical cross-border payments. This decentralized blockchain does not use proof-of-work but rather a unique consensus process involving trusted validators, settling transactions in just 3–5 seconds. Initially, 100 billion XRP were created in advance, with 80 billion given to Ripple Labs to support growth and operations, and 55 billion later secured in escrow to manage market release. As of March 28, 2025, XRP’s value hit $2.22 with a trading volume of $3 billion, marking a notable rise from $0.63 in April 2024 and showing a price increase of about 252%. By December 2024, the circulating supply reached around 57 billion XRP tokens. SUI: Overview of Functionality and Performance SUI, a robust Layer 1 blockchain, enhances scalability and user experience in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized apps. Created using Move language from Meta’s Diem project, SUI aims to offer a secure and effective platform for both developers and users. It employs a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) consensus, enabling token holders to partake in network security and governance. In 2024, SUI’s price soared by over 500%, peaking near $5. However, by March 2025, it normalized, with prices on March 27 ranging between $2.26 and $2.38—a week-over-week increase of about 6.29%. Despite fluctuations, SUI’s increasing integration in DeFi and its scalability focus continue to position it as a formidable player among Layer 1 blockchains. BlockDAG Testnet: Rewarding Genuine Interaction BlockDAG’s Beta Testnet uniquely rewards those who actively engage with its network. From March 28 to May 31, 2025, users who transact frequently, mine effectively, and maintain high wallet balances can each win $2,000 in BDAG. This initiative, distributing $6,000 in actual BDAG prizes, focuses on rewarding meaningful contributions rather than mere participation. The rewards are designated for the top 10 wallets in three categories: most transactions, most tokens mined, and largest wallet balances, with each category winner receiving $2,000 in BDAG, valued at $0.05 per crypto at the mainnet launch. These rewards are tangible, tradable BDAG, not mere testnet tokens, encouraging serious testing and engagement. This incentive structure aims to test the network’s decentralization, scalability, and security under practical conditions. BlockDAG emphasizes quality participation that predicts the network’s utility on the mainnet, rewarding users for their genuine use and interaction. Economically, BlockDAG’s approach is supported by impressive crypto presale results: $213.5 million raised and 19.1 billion BDAG coins sold. With the current batch priced at $0.0248, the ROI has reached 2,380% since the first batch. BlockDAG’s strategy focuses on purposeful building and reasoned rewarding. Prioritizing Real-World Utility XRP, SUI, and BlockDAG each offer unique benefits—speed in transactions, enhanced scalability, and practical usability, respectively. While XRP improves payment processes and SUI enhances options for developers, BlockDAG zeroes in on real-world interaction within its network. Its Beta Testnet is more than a superficial test; it’s a practical evaluation where genuine actions are rewarded, reflecting the network’s future real-world utility. By linking rewards to active participation and aligning Testnet objectives with actual user behavior, BlockDAG establishes a clear principle: real value comes from practical use, not just theoretical capabilities. For both users and developers, this represents a meaningful gauge of value.

Concurrently, the Binance Coin (BNB) displays signs of steadiness, with bulls ready to navigate past the $610 threshold. Yet, the spotlight is turning towards BlockDAG’s impending 2025 mainnet release. This event promises a significant disruption of conventional blockchains with its high-speed DeFi capabilities, starting at 2,000 transactions per second and potentially scaling up to 15,000. With plans for listing on 10 new exchanges and a projected price leap to $20, BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out as today’s top performing cryptocurrency. Dogecoin (DOGE) Value: Holding on or Heading Down? The price of Dogecoin (DOGE) is presently battling around the $0.165 mark, consistently facing off against both weakening support and firm resistance. The cryptocurrency repeatedly failed to stay above $0.180 and now sits in a constrained range, with $0.166 as a pivotal resistance point. The short-term indicators hint at minimal momentum, signaling a possible pause or slight pullback. If the $0.155 support breaks, the Dogecoin (DOGE) price might descend towards the $0.150 or even $0.120 level. Conversely, a climb over $0.168 could temporarily tilt the scales, though sustained buyer interest is crucial for any significant comeback. Binance Coin Price Outlook: Is $610 Within Reach? The price forecast for Binance Coin (BNB) remains optimistic as it maintains above its fundamental support level, despite the broader market’s fluctuating sentiments. After a quick dip to $578.45, BNB has recovered, aiming again for the $610.59 resistance. The trading patterns exhibit a tug-of-war between bullish and bearish forces, with indicators of overbought and oversold conditions surfacing intermittently. Despite these swings, a growing trading volume and heightened activity on the BNB Chain suggest a guarded but hopeful perspective. Mainnet Launch Sets Stage for BlockDAG’s Market Breakthrough BlockDAG is gearing up for a monumental 2025 with its upcoming mainnet launch, destined to make a significant mark in the cryptocurrency realm. The platform will initially support 2,000 transactions per second, with ambitions to increase this to 15,000 TPS. This breakthrough is achieved through BlockDAG’s innovative blend of a Directed Acyclic Graph and Proof-of-Work, ensuring robust throughput even during peak usage, a challenge many networks struggle to overcome. From the get-go, BlockDAG will incorporate essential DeFi functionalities such as staking, lending, asset bridging, and low-cost swaps. Governance features will also be activated, enabling coin holders to influence decisions through proposals and voting. The project has successfully passed audits by Halborn and is undergoing another by Certik. It employs Multi-Party Computation to safeguard both treasury and user assets, promising a more polished product than typical initial mainnet offerings. These innovations position BlockDAG to launch on over 10 centralized exchanges, which is likely to enhance its market presence and trading volume significantly. Given its robust fundamentals, BlockDAG could soon be among the top-tier cryptocurrencies. Currently, BlockDAG has amassed over $213.5 million in presale funding. The BDAG coin, now in Batch 27, is valued at $0.0248, up from an initial $0.001, marking a 2380% surge. This price remains appealingly low, but as the clock ticks down, this emerging top performer in the cryptocurrency space presents a unique early opportunity, especially with a predicted value of $20 by 2027. Snapshot Overview: DOGE, BNB, and BlockDAG The price of Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to face challenges, and if buying momentum doesn’t pick up soon, we might see it testing lower support levels. Meanwhile, the Binance Coin (BNB) price outlook seems more stable, with good fundamentals possibly driving it past the $610 mark. As DOGE and BNB experience their respective fluctuations, BlockDAG is steadily climbing the crypto rankings, with forecasts pointing to a dramatic surge upon its 2025 mainnet launch. Currently boasting a 2380% increase in its presale phase and still priced at just $0.0248, BlockDAG is rapidly gaining recognition as one of the top-performing cryptos today. With 10 upcoming exchange listings, delaying involvement could mean missing out on significant gains.

Qubetics Offers 9434% ROI While Ondo and Chainlink Dominate Real Utility,https://thecoinrise.com/most-potential-crypto-right-now-qubetics-offers-9434-roi-while-ondo-and-chainlink-dominate-real-utility/,"Crypto adoption isn’t slowing down—it’s picking up speed, and fast. From Wall Street firms getting token-curious to everyday folks in Buenos Aires or Bogotá looking to escape currency chaos, blockchain is becoming a gateway to financial freedom. But in the middle of all this noise, some projects have managed to cut through the fluff. These are the protocols with real applications, serious backing, and growing communities. Not just tokens with a logo—but infrastructure with vision. When narrowing down the most potential crypto contenders for 2025, three names demand attention for different but powerful reasons: Qubetics (TICS) , Ondo , and Chainlink . Qubetics is still in its presale phase—an early-stage shot loaded with massive upside and packed with real-world use cases. Ondo is bridging traditional finance with blockchain by tokenizing assets that people actually understand, like Treasuries and bonds. Chainlink, the godfather of on-chain data, powers everything from DeFi to real-time pricing in hundreds of apps worldwide. Each of these has carved out a unique lane, but one is giving early adopters the rare kind of upside that’s hard to ignore. Qubetics (TICS): Real World Asset Power + ROI Explosion There’s a new heavyweight stepping into the crypto ring—and it’s not here to play games. Qubetics (TICS) is positioning itself as one of the most potential crypto projects out there thanks to a laser focus on real-world asset tokenization, DeFi accessibility, and decentralized infrastructure that actually works in the wild. Its core engine? A Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace that takes things like real estate deeds, stock shares, invoices, or physical commodities—and turns them into programmable, tradable on-chain assets. Imagine a logistics company in Santiago needing to tokenize their cargo invoices for liquidity. Or a solo landowner in rural Peru who wants to digitize their property to access financing from global lenders. Even art collectors in Medellín can tokenize rare physical assets, mint proof of ownership on-chain, and open new doors for liquidity. Qubetics gives power back to individuals and businesses—cutting out middlemen and breaking down barriers that centralized systems have kept up for decades. Its platform is also built with compliance in mind. Legal frameworks, KYC tools, and audit-readiness come baked into the system. For professionals dealing with contracts, registries, or client assets, Qubetics provides an enterprise-grade solution that’s both decentralized and legally sound. All powered by the $TICS token, which runs everything from transaction fees to governance and staking. Qubetics isn’t another one-trick altcoin. It’s an ecosystem that enables global value exchange with clarity, speed, and transparency. Which is why crypto analysts are keeping it high on the list when ranking the most potential crypto tokens entering 2025. Qubetics Presale Momentum: Entry Point & Analyst Projections Here’s where things get interesting. Qubetics is currently in Stage 29 of its live crypto presale . Over 507 million tokens have already been sold, with a strong base of more than 24,600 holders . Total capital raised has crossed $16 million , and the price per $TICS is now set at $0.1573 . Backers who got in at Stage 1 scooped tokens at just $0.01—locking in a jaw-dropping 1473% return already. But the window’s not closed. Even at the current stage, the upside is stacked. If $TICS hits $1 after presale , that’s a 535% ROI . Analysts placing $TICS at $5 post-launch are looking at 3078% returns , while more aggressive forecasts peg it at $10 or $15 , translating to 6256% to 9434% ROI . Qubetics isn’t just being noticed for its numbers. Its team is shipping actual features. From the decentralized VPN to its no-code dApp builder and multi-chain wallet, the project’s full-stack utility is what sets it apart. It’s rare to see a presale with this kind of traction and infrastructure—and even rarer to see one still open. The presale’s still live, and entry at this stage could be one of the most compelling moves for anyone tracking the most potential crypto this year. Ondo: Bringing Traditional Finance On-Chain Ondo is one of those projects that quietly flipped the narrative around crypto and traditional finance. Instead of trying to disrupt Wall Street from the outside, it invited Wall Street in. Built around the tokenization of real-world assets like U.S. Treasuries, corporate bonds, and institutional-grade financial instruments, Ondo’s infrastructure allows users to tap into regulated financial products without leaving the blockchain. This is huge for those looking for stable, yield-generating alternatives in crypto. While DeFi can be volatile, tokenized Treasuries and bonds bring the security of traditional instruments with the accessibility of Web3. Community members from Latin America and beyond, where inflation and unstable banking conditions are daily concerns, now have the chance to park assets in something that mirrors a fixed-income investment—without needing a traditional brokerage account or a financial advisor. Ondo also stands out thanks to its partnerships. Backed by power players like Coinbase and connected to heavyweights like BlackRock, the project has the kind of institutional muscle that gives it legitimacy in both crypto-native and TradFi spaces. Its products are offered through fully compliant structures, which is a game-changer for those who need peace of mind when bridging traditional and digital assets. For people exploring the most potential crypto picks with a longer-term lens—especially those seeking passive yield or dollar-backed exposure—Ondo has carved out a sweet spot. It’s not chasing wild price swings. Instead, it’s bringing real-world money onto the chain and making it work harder, smarter, and more transparently. And that, especially in volatile regions, is something worth watching closely. Chainlink (LINK): The Oracle Standard of Web3 Chainlink is what happens when data meets decentralization—securely, reliably, and without the fluff. While many coins make noise, LINK is the silent backbone of an entire layer of blockchain infrastructure. It’s the leading oracle network in crypto, and that matters more than most beginners realize. Without reliable oracles, DeFi protocols, NFT platforms, prediction markets, and most smart contracts would crumble. Chainlink connects blockchains to real-world data. Need to pull stock prices, weather updates, flight data, or off-chain event info into a smart contract? That’s where Chainlink steps in. It’s trusted by projects across Ethereum, BNB Chain, Avalanche, Polygon, and more. DeFi titans like Aave, Synthetix, and Compound all depend on Chainlink to stay accurate and secure. The crypto community sees Chainlink as a gold standard. Its tech works, its uptime is unbeatable, and its team continues to push the limits of what’s possible in oracle design. The rollout of Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is another major milestone—allowing not just data but also messages and tokens to be transferred between chains seamlessly. This elevates Chainlink from just an oracle provider to a key player in the multi-chain future. For beginners trying to understand why LINK keeps showing up on lists of the most potential crypto , it’s simple: Chainlink makes the blockchain world more functional, secure, and connected. It may not grab headlines with viral trends, but it powers the platforms that do. From securing billions in DeFi to integrating with legacy systems, Chainlink has earned its place as a long-term foundational asset in any serious crypto portfolio. Final Thoughts There’s no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to picking the most potential crypto project. It depends on what a person values—innovation, reliability, returns, or real-world utility. But this lineup of Qubetics, Ondo, and Chainlink checks all the boxes from multiple angles. Qubetics is showing up strong for community members looking for early-stage entry with massive upside and a real-world use case. Its tokenization tools, cross-border value system, and advanced infrastructure set it apart. And with the presale still open, the timing couldn’t be more aligned. Ondo delivers a bridge between old and new, giving blockchain users access to financial instruments they know and trust. Its role in bringing stability and credibility to DeFi can’t be overstated. Chainlink, on the other hand, isn’t trying to reinvent the wheel—it’s greasing the gears of all major Web3 infrastructure. Its data feeds, interoperability protocols, and reliability make it indispensable. All three projects deserve serious attention. But for those chasing both functionality and high reward at the entry level, Qubetics could be the breakout play of 2025 .

According to reports, authorities charged the founder, Huang Weixuan, alongside other executives for their part in the investment scheme. According to the authorities, the quartet were involved in allegedly using the Steaker platform to raise about $45.8 billion through unauthorized crypto investment schemes. The Taipei Prosecutors’ Office confirmed the charges on Thursday, noting that their acts are against the Banking Act rules which frowned upon taking deposits without a license. According to the report , aside from the founder Huang Weixuan, the platform’s Chief Technology Officer Xiu Minje, Chief Marketing Officer Lu Tianxin, and Chief Operations Officer Pan Yiting are billed to face charges in connection with those allegations. The prosecution also urged the court to move forward and penalize the company under the Banking Act, but it remains to be seen what will happen as the case still remains in court. Taiwan authorities drag Steaker platform to court According to filings, Huang is a blockchain legend in Taiwan, with the Steaker founder trading Bitcoin while he was at the National Taiwan University. He developed a crypto wallet before going to work as a software engineer at Yahoo. After he left Yahoo, he founded Steaker in 2019, noting that he had amassed about $55 million in assets under management in two years. He is also regarded as one of the leaders in the blockchain space in the country. According to Taiwanese prosecutors, Steaker operated multiple digital asset investment plans since its inception. The company began operations in 2019 and sold investors the promise of huge returns ranging from 3.5% to 88% annually. The company raised funds in several digital assets, including USDT, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. The platform also claimed that assets deposited by its users were protected by a security fund, noting that it was in partnership with CYBAVO. According to the charge sheet, the prosecutors allege that Steaker assured its investors of protecting their principal and interests, a move that regulators have called taking deposits without licenses. Over the next three years, the company, through its various plans, attracted hundreds of millions of dollars in Taiwan. FTX’s collapse in 2022 caused problems for Steaker Investigators also mentioned that once investor funds reached a certain amount, there were specific instructions to move them to a wallet under the control of Huang on the collapsed cryptocurrency exchange, FTX. According to the prosecutors, Huang and his team used the money for profit trading, and high-return lending to capture price differences. Problems started for Steaker and its executive after the collapse of FTX in 2022. The platform filed for bankruptcy in 2022, leading to funds belonging to individuals and firms being locked on the platform. With the funds locked on FTX, Steaker could not meet investor withdrawal obligations, which in turn led to its collapse. Prosecutors also mentioned that some of the digital assets collected were moved from the FTX wallet held by Huang to wallets belonging to private currency traders and sometimes used to cover salaries. Huang has responded to the charges, noting that Steaker uses a multi-chain asset flow and operations and by that, the prosecutors can not classify it as money laundering. The company also objected to the way the prosecutors were choosing to interpret the Banking Act, especially with the way they decided to equate digital assets and legal tender under the law.

Therefore, the crypto community is curious if this meme coin can be the next big success story, outperforming established meme coins like DOGE or Shiba Inu. Can $XYZ achieve 30x increase? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. XYZVerse stands out in the current market Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships is one of XYZVerse’s key strengths. Another is deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure. Moreover, it will have a 15% liquidity allocation after the launch .$XYZ also consists of community incentives of 10% fostering engagement and holding. Early investors can make more profits. Price Prediction for $XYZ $XYZ was sold at $0.003333 price in its presale. The project is targeting an increase up to $0.10.The price can potentially reach the ATH between $0.15 and $0.25 in the first 2 weeks of its launch. Furthermore in 6 to 12 Months, a price between $0.20- $0.40 is expected if it announces major partnerships and listings. If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. It could also drive massive social media engagement. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships.If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Dogecoin began in 2013 as a playful twist on cryptocurrency. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it featured the Shiba Inu meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply, Dogecoin was made to be abundant. Every minute, 10,000 new coins are mined, and there’s no cap on how many can exist. At first, it was seen as a “memecoin,” but in 2021, its value soared. Social media buzz, especially tweets from Elon Musk, helped push Dogecoin into the top ten cryptocurrencies. Its market cap exceeded $50 billion, showing how online communities can influence financial markets. Today, Dogecoin continues to draw attention. Its technology is based on Litecoin, which means transactions are fast and fees are low. This makes it practical for everyday use, like tipping or small payments. In the current market, some investors see potential in Dogecoin due to its strong community and widespread recognition. Others are cautious because its supply is unlimited, which can affect long-term value. Compared to Bitcoin’s scarcity and Ethereum’s smart contracts, Dogecoin is simple and accessible. As the crypto market evolves, Dogecoin remains a symbol of the fun and unpredictable nature of cryptocurrencies. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency inspired by Dogecoin, but it has its own twist. Running on the Ethereum blockchain, SHIB can interact with many Ethereum-based projects. It was launched in August 2020 by an anonymous creator called Ryoshi. SHIB began with a huge supply of one quadrillion tokens. Half were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.He donated a large portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply. These actions drew a lot of attention to SHIB. Because it’s built on Ethereum, SHIB can do more than just be a meme coin. Projects like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, have been created. There are plans for an NFT platform and a system where holders can vote on decisions. This adds utility to SHIB beyond just being a token. In today’s market, where technology and usefulness matter, SHIB’s development could be significant. Compared to other meme coins, SHIB’s link to Ethereum might give it an advantage as the crypto world changes. Conclusion Although DOGE and SHIB are strong players, XYZ’s unique sports-meme blend may propel it to surpass them by 2025.

In April, the spotlight has shifted dramatically toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM), an emerging DeFi protocol that’s quickly climbing the ranks thanks to its real-world lending utility and robust community engagement. The fourth phase of Mutuum Finance presale continues while this high-growth altcoin sells for $0.025 and has collected $6.5 million. The next stage of the presale will boost MUTM’s price to $0.03 while attracting more than 8100 investors. The initial investors during this phase will receive a 140% payback when the launch price reaches $0.06. Unlike SHIB, which still rides primarily on social sentiment, MUTM has introduced tangible features, including a new dashboard leaderboard that tracks its top 50 holders, who will be rewarded with bonus tokens for maintaining their rank. As investors grow more utility-focused, MUTM’s rise signals what could be the next win in crypto, substance over spectacle. A DeFi Giant on the Rise Mutuum Finance pushes forward decentralized lending through dual lending while promoting mass adoption because of its transformative structure. More than 8100 investors joined the presale funding to support the project which received $6.5 million in total. Mutuum Finance’s price currently reaches $0.025 in Phase 4 even though investors anticipate a 20% price increase in Phase 5 which will generate considerable profit potential. The analysts forecast MUTM to surge beyond $5 in upcoming months when it launches at $0.06 because its distinctive lending approach meets rising market requirements thus making it an underappreciated yet promising DeFi resource. Mutuum Finance transforms DeFi lending through the combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending systems. Through the P2C model users can achieve passive income by lending their USDT through liquidity pools that operate automatically through smart contracts. The P2P model provides transactions which operate without intermediaries allowing users to personally manage their assets through direct deals. Mutuum Finance unites P2C and P2P lending methods to secure and streamline its decentralized operation thus creating profitable opportunities for investors looking to maximize yield in DeFi. Friendly Tokenomics for Lasting Expansion Tokenomics in the project follows a strategy designed for both limited token circulation management and continuous appreciation of value. The presale limitation combined with anti-inflationary procedures enables Mutuum Finance to establish scarcity which creates possible upward token value potential. Staking rewards users for token involvement by delivering valuable incentives that strengthen the ecosystem sustainability of its native token. To attract more community members Mutuum Finance implements profitable incentive programs at an aggressive pace. The program will use $100,000 to give ten investors $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens and the referral system gives rewards to users who bring in new investors to the platform. The platform gives early supporters exclusive benefits including staking pools and governance rights and VIP-exclusive updates to enhance their connection with the platform. A Reliable and Secure Financial Network Mutuum Finance creates a launch plan for its new collateralized USD-backed stablecoin developed for Ethereum blockchain usage. Insolvency risks that threaten algorithmic stablecoins will not affect this over-collateralized asset because it will maintain long-term reliability. A complete audit system of smart contracts together with transparent financial mechanisms establishes trust with investors as it fixes numerous security problems observed with past decentralized finance projects. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly surpassing meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) due to its practical DeFi utility. The project has raised $6.5 million and attracted over 8,100 investors, positioning it as a strong contender in the crypto market. Mutuum Finance’s focus on sustainable growth and community rewards makes it an appealing long-term investment. Don’t miss out and invest in MUTM today.

Popcat ( POPCAT ) rose for four consecutive days, reaching a high of $0.25, its highest level since March 25. It has jumped by almos 100% from its lowest level this month. The jump happened as crypto investors bought the dip in some specific Solana ( SOL ) meme coins like Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ), Goatseus Maximus, Fartboy, and Vine. Nansen data shows that more investors are moving their Popcat tokens from exchanges to self-custody. Exchange balances have dropped by almost 10% in the last seven days to 239.5 million, down from 262 million the same day last week. Most of these outflows were from Bybit, Raydium, and Coinbase.

The exemptions cover a wide range of technology-related products, including integrated circuits (HS 8542), smartphones (HS 8517.13.00), flat panel display modules (HS 8524), computers and components (HS 8471, 8473.30), and semiconductor manufacturing equipment (HS 8486). Other electronic products, including solar cells, flat panel TV displays, flash drives, and memory cards, are also exempt. The guidance comes after Trump announced earlier this month that he would impose sweeping 145% tariffs on Chinese imports, a decision that sent shockwaves through the tech sector and posed significant risks for companies that rely heavily on Chinese manufacturing, such as Apple. Related News: HOT MOMENTS: Trump Meets Top CEOs at the White House - Here's the Latest on the Tariff Deadlock and Insider Leaks Industry analysts are calling the exemptions a big win for the tech sector. According to Evercore ISI, 80% of Apple’s iPads and more than half of its Mac computers are made in China. The new exemptions effectively shield Apple and other tech giants from the full brunt of the tariff hikes. “This is a dream scenario for tech investors,” Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, told CNBC. “The exclusion of smartphones and chips is a game-changer when it comes to China tariffs.” Ives said the tariffs were a “dark cloud” hanging over the tech sector: “No sector was going to be hurt more than big tech. I think the bottom line is that big tech CEOs spoke up and the White House had to listen. If they were implemented, it would be apocalypse for big tech.” While the current exemptions provide temporary relief, the guidance notes that these products may still face duties in the future, but any additional duties are expected to be significantly lower than the initial 145% rate. *This is not investment advice.

According to the chart posted and data from analytics firm Glassnode, active addresses on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) have risen by over 490% since 2022, a staggering jump that beats Bitcoin’s 10% growth in the same period. BREAKING: #XRP Active Addresses Surge 490% Since 2022, Outpacing Bitcoin Hugely! pic.twitter.com/4IPAYBwLxk — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) April 11, 2025 Increasing Retail Momentum in the XRP Market Glassnode confirmed that XRP has become a standout among retail-driven cryptocurrencies this cycle. The near fivefold increase in active addresses since the 2022 low indicates strong engagement from individual investors, many of whom entered the market during the asset’s explosive rally that began in late 2024. Unlike Bitcoin, which saw more consistent gains throughout the cycle, XRP remained relatively flat. It experienced quick surges like the rise to $0.93 following the pivotal court ruling in July 2023 but quickly retraced those gains. However, its trajectory changed in November 2024 and swiftly climbed by more than 400%. This rapid growth was matched by a spike in speculative activity, signaling a flood of short-term capital into the asset. Glassnode’s data suggests that a significant portion of XRP’s market participants entered during the recent upswing, raising concerns about their vulnerability to downside volatility. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Capital Inflows and Realized Cap Growth Glassnode’s report reveals that since its 2022 bottom, XRP’s Realized Cap, which tracks the aggregate value of coins based on their last movement, has climbed from $30.1 billion to $64.2 billion. Notably, around $30 billion of this increase has occurred over the past six months alone, suggesting that much of the buying activity was concentrated shortly. This pattern further reinforces the idea of heightened retail speculation dominating the current phase of XRP’s growth. However, momentum has begun to slow. On-chain data indicates a deceleration in capital inflows since February 2025, accompanied by increasing signs of profit-taking and underperformance despite positive developments . Glassnode flagged this shift as a potential warning, especially given the number of new holders who entered the market at elevated price levels. What’s Next for XRP? Meanwhile, Ripple’s ecosystem has seen added momentum from the rollout of RLUSD, Ripple’s stablecoin, as it has outperformed the company’s initial expectations. XRP has also shown some strength, recently recovering from a notable downturn. The digital asset remains popular among investors. It recently surpassed Bitcoin and Ethereum to become the most traded cryptocurrency on Upbit , South Korea’s largest exchange. As attention and adoption increase, XRP could experience a price increase, potentially reclaiming its January peak of $3.39 and heading toward its all-time high.

Here’s What Happens If It Mimics 2017 And 2021 Rallies,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-to-hit-45/,"XRP has staged an impressive recovery to reclaim the $2 price level after plunging to a weekly low of $1.657 in a steep midweek correction. The rebound comes at a crucial time for the cryptocurrency, with analysts paying closer attention to historical price behaviors and bullish technical patterns. Among them is EGRAG CRYPTO, a popular XRP analyst on X, who believes that the cryptocurrency could be on the cusp of a monumental surge reminiscent of its previous bull cycles in 2017 and 2021. The Power Of Time Cycles And Exponential Moving Averages EGRAG’s technical analysis focuses on a recurring structure seen in XRP’s past cycles, using the 21-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and 33-period Moving Average (MA) on the biweekly timeframe. According to his analysis, which was revealed on social media platform X, both the 2017 and 2021 rallies were preceded by similar technical setups: a sustained bottoming process lasting around 770 days followed by a bullish reversal. Related Reading: This Analyst Correctly Called The XRP Price Crash, Here Are The Next Targets These phases were marked by what he described as “blow-off tops,” where XRP posted parabolic gains after bouncing off the 21 and 33 exponential moving averages. The current market structure, EGRAG noted, aligns closely with those previous cycles. After a prolonged bearish trend and a second recorded “bearish cross” in 2022, XRP has once again moved above both the 21 EMA and 33 MA. In his view, this sets the stage for a similar breakout scenario, one that could play out before the end of 2025. EGRAG uses this pattern to suggest a timeline of roughly 770 days from the last major crossover in early 2022, placing the projected breakout target around September 29, 2025. XRP Can Surge To $45 Interestingly, EGRAG’s price prediction based on the premise of how a similar 2017 or 2021 movement can play out for XRP. In 2017, XRP posted a rally of approximately 2,700%, and in 2021, a slightly lower surge of about 1,050%. By mapping those gains onto the current price structure, EGRAG predicted two potential targets: a more conservative $19 level and a bold $45 level. Between these two targets is a mid-range target of $27 which he has previously favored.

In his own words, “Will it rhyme exactly? No, because if it were that easy, everyone would be a multimillionaire.” Still, the emotional patterns of market participants, human reactions and behaviors, tend to repeat to create opportunities where a previous price action might play out again, even if not 100%. The analyst ended his analysis with a strategic note to long-term holders and short-term traders alike, consider a Dollar-Sell-Average (DSA) approach when the XRP price starts to climb. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.04, up by 2.6% in the past 24 hours.

The price soared past $0.75 and is now sitting at $0.72, making it the top-performing major altcoin today. In the past 24 hours alone, Pi is up nearly 30%, with a 52% gain over the last 90 days. The market is showing strong signs of optimism, with analysts pointing to a possible rise to $1 if this momentum continues. Technical indicators also look positive — the 10-day SMA (simple moving average) just crossed over, and the RSI (relative strength index) suggests a bullish trend. Pi Coin also hit a weekly high of $0.78, pushing its market cap beyond $5 billion. Adding to the excitement, the Pi Network recently launched the Pi Ad Network, giving developers a new way to make money from their apps and boosting Pi’s real-world use. This is seen as a big move toward building a stronger, more useful ecosystem. However, not everything is smooth sailing. A major unlock of 188 million PI tokens is expected in the next 30 days, according to PiScan. This could create selling pressure on the market. Also, while 87% of the community supports a Binance listing, the exchange has not yet taken action. Even with the recent launch of the Pi Network’s mainnet, trading volume has dropped by 44%, signaling mixed investor interest. What’s next? All eyes are on the upcoming token unlock and whether Binance and other major exchanges will list Pi.

While major projects like Polkadot (DOT) still hold potential, newer entrants like Ozak AI (OZ) are quickly capturing attention for their explosive upside. DOT may offer a steady 3x return, but Ozak AI’s potential to surge 300x from its presale price of $0.003 is generating serious buzz. The next generation of crypto gains might not come from legacy chains but from innovative projects that tap into hot sectors like artificial intelligence—and that’s exactly where Ozak AI shines. Polkadot’s Realistic Ceiling: 3x by 2025 Polkadot has been a respected name in the blockchain space, known for its interoperability focus and solid developer ecosystem. After reaching a low of $3.25 in April 2025, DOT is now attempting a slow recovery. With technical indicators such as RSI and MACD still showing bearish signals, DOT’s path to recovery may take time. While a rebound to the $10–12 range by the end of the bull cycle is possible, this only equates to a 3x return at best. For long-term holders, that may be acceptable, but those looking for life-changing gains may want to look elsewhere. Why Ozak AI Is Turning Heads Ozak AI is a rising star in the crypto market, merging the power of blockchain with cutting-edge AI to create a new class of utility-focused tokens. Currently in its third presale stage and priced at just $0.005, OZ is being touted as one of the few tokens with a real shot at 300x gains. If it reaches its $1 target—something many analysts believe is possible given the growing demand for AI-integrated platforms—early investors could see returns that rival or even surpass those of early Shiba Inu or Solana adopters. AI + Blockchain = The Future of Crypto Artificial intelligence is the hottest trend in tech, and its fusion with blockchain is creating entirely new market categories. Ozak AI leverages machine learning to drive smarter decentralized solutions, offering everything from predictive analytics to automated DeFi tools. This kind of real-world application is exactly what the next wave of crypto investors are hunting for—projects with utility, vision, and long-term growth potential. Unlike meme coins or speculative layer-1s, Ozak AI has fundamentals that justify its hype. Investor Sentiment Shifting Toward High-Upside Projects With Bitcoin and Ethereum delivering diminishing returns as they mature, and altcoins like Polkadot offering only modest upside, retail and institutional investors alike are diversifying into newer projects with massive growth curves. Ozak AI fits that profile perfectly—still under the radar, early in development, but rapidly gaining traction across social media and investor forums. As more eyes turn to presale opportunities in Q2 2025, OZ is becoming a standout. While Polkadot may offer a safe and steady 3x return in 2025, it’s the meteoric potential of tokens like Ozak AI that’s capturing the attention of investors chasing great wealth. With a presale price of just $0.005 and a clear roadmap toward AI integration, Ozak AI offers a realistic path to 300x gains. In a market driven by innovation and narrative, OZ isn’t just another altcoin—it’s a movement smart investors are already backing before it goes mainstream. About Ozak AI Ozak AI is a blockchain-based project that provides a technology platform that specializes in predictive AI and advanced data analytics for financial markets. Ozak AI helps crypto investors and businesses in decision-making by providing real-time, accurate, and actionable insights through machine learning algorithms and decentralized network technologies.

Crypto investor Daan Crypto Trades dropped a spicy warning, noting that the number one cryptocurrency has formed weekend gaps for six weeks in a row, with its price retracing hard by midweek every single time. Weekend Mirage Strikes Again? The market watcher pointed out that Bitcoin’s weekend pumps, often fueled by low liquidity and hype, tend to reverse within days. “Whenever a move is made during the weekend, it almost always retraces that move within the same following week,” he cautioned his 403,000 followers on X. “So the saying usually is to not always trust the weekend move, even if it extends a little further early in the week,” he added, sharing a chart of BTC’s recent “gap-and-trap” pattern. But not everyone is buying the dip doom narrative. In his usual provocative fashion, former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes declared, “It’s on like Donkey Kong,” pointing to signs that the U.S. Federal Reserve may unleash more liquidity to stabilize the bond market. “Buy everything,” he posted after reports emerged that a top Fed official had admitted the central bank is ready to intervene. The perma-bull is betting that such a move could be the catalyst that rockets BTC into what he calls “UP ONLY” mode. 75% Say New ATH Coming Hayes isn’t alone in his optimism. A poll by crypto commentators Altcoin Daily shows 75.5% of crypto enthusiasts believe Bitcoin will smash a new all-time high (ATH) before the end of 2025. Hayes himself has predicted $250,000 by year’s end as long as macro tailwinds hold. The weekend pump pushed BTC to over $85,000, up from a low of $81,500, per CoinGecko data. A slight 0.5% reversal across seven days means that BTC is only marginally outperforming the broader crypto market, which is down 0.9% over the same period. Still, its dominance stands at 60.5%, with $31.3 billion in daily volume and a $1.65 trillion market cap. However, the king cryptocurrency is down 23% from its all-time high of $108,786, recorded earlier in the year. And with liquidity thin over the weekend, one wrong headline could send prices spiraling into the new week.

Data from CryptoSlam suggests that a downward trend took the volume of NFT sales from $102.8 million the previous week to $94.7 million. Massive Shortfall in NFT Sales and Other Transaction The current value represents a 4.7% fall from the previous value. The recent dip in digital collectible sales is likely due to the broader cryptocurrency market plunge. Notably, the global financial market has been rattled by the ongoing tariff among the most advanced economies in the world. While there’s a 90-day pause in US tariffs for 75 countries, the concerns around China still lingers. Interestingly, this drop extends past sales volume to the number of NFT buyers, who fell by 77.9% to 128,244. Similarly, NFT sellers plummeted by 75.2% to 85,792. The volume of NFT transactions in the marketplace has also reduced by 6.3% to 1,441,009. NFT Market Remains Far From Expectations These details are clear pointers to the continued struggles of the NFT market. Several major platforms have already closed down their NFT platforms. A few weeks ago, LG closed its LG Art Lab, which launched just a few years earlier during the peak of the NFT frenzy. Since it is an NFT marketplace with about $5.6 billion in trade volume, X2Y2 has also shut down its operations. Also, the major crypto exchange, Bybit, has directed its focus to other blockchain projects while closing its NFT platform . With all of these closures, there is no assurance that the NFT niche will be worth anything in a few years, not to mention the $264 billion predicted by experts for 2032. Crypto Market Sees Significant Rebound The broader crypto ecosystem has registered some slight improvement compared to earlier in the week when Bitcoin (BTC) went below $77,000. The flagship cryptocurrency and other digital assets have gained back some of the profits that were shed. At the time of this writing, BTC traded at $84,931.49 , marking a 3.77% increase from its price level 24 hours ago. Ethereum (ETH) is still below $2,000, trading at $1,652.98 , but it has recovered by 6.33% in the last 24 hours. Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and XRP have also recorded an increase of 9.09%, 4.99%, and 8.18%, respectively.

Known for its related commentary in the market, Teng shared five key elements of success that are often masked to the public. This comment comes as the broader digital currency ecosystem enters a consolidation phase. Richard Teng Success Tip and Binance Reflection Richard Teng revealed in a post on X that behind every picture of success, there are unseen factors. He named these factors as the risks taken, patience tested, hard work invested, discipline maintained, and consistency upheld. While the market has not recorded a major crypto winter since Richard Teng became Binance CEO in 2024, it has witnessed intense volatility. Despite the relative stability that the industry has experienced, putting the elements of success as Teng showcase was necessary. The exchange has taken defined risks in the industry with bets on new tokens for listing and investments in new startups. As reported earlier by CoinGape, Binance announced the listing of ONDO , VIRTUAL, and BIGTIME due to its decentralized voting. The trading platform shunned the risks associated with these tokens, underscoring how it practices the principles outlined by its CEO. To wrap up his latest X post, Richard Tend advocated for continuous product development to serve users. Right Message for the Crypto Market Binance Exchange controls a significant share of the spot and derivatives crypto market. With Teng’s update, the exchange’s users might look beyond temporary losses brought on by the market for better days. Meanwhile, there has been a bullish shift in the market, with most altcoins now in consolidation mode. Bitcoin price changed hands for $84,698.26, up 1.81% in 24 hours. After months of fluctuations owing to the US-China trade war , the coin finally formed support at $84,000. The breakout in the price of BTC from a low of $74,436.67 in the past week has helped fuel the broader crypto market recovery. Other altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP are up by 3.44%, 6.78%, and 5.4%, respectively. Notably, Richard Teng’s new insight complements his earlier role in the market. Earlier in the week, he revealed how current trade tensions could strengthen Bitcoin . According to him, BTC’s role as a non-sovereign store of value makes it immune from general monetary policies amid global finance uncertainty.

Terraform Labs has extended the deadline for victims to file their claims for crypto losses through its official portal. With the new deadline set for May 16, 2025, thousands of affected users now have extra time to gather documents and submit proof to claim their losses. Here’s everything you need to know. Portal Open Until May 16, 2025 Terraform Labs, the company behind the fallen Terra USD token and Luna coin, is currently winding down operations after filing for bankruptcy. As part of this process, it has launched an online Crypto Loss Claims Portal to let affected users file claims for their crypto losses. Earlier, the deadline to submit claims was set for April 30 . However, the company has now extended the deadline to May 16, 2025, at 11:59 p.m. ET, giving creditors more time to file their claims and upload the required documents. Meanwhile, the fastest and most trusted way to verify your holdings is through Preferred Evidence, such as read-only API keys from major exchanges or wallet verifications. Submitting Manual Evidence, like screenshots or transaction logs is allowed, but this method could result in delays or even disqualification if Preferred Evidence is available and not used. Who’s Eligible? To be eligible, claimants must have suffered losses from cryptocurrencies listed under “ Eligible Loss Cryptocurrencies .” These include tokens that were part of the Terra ecosystem but exclude some holdings like Luna 2.0 on Terra 2.0 or coins with very low on-chain liquidity (below $100). However, a full list of eligible tokens is available on the official Kroll portal . How and Where to File Your Claim? Users can visit claims.terra.money to submit their claims. It’s important to complete and submit the Crypto Loss Claim Form along with all necessary documentation before the final deadline of May 16, 2025, at 11:59 p.m. ET. Any claims submitted after this time will not be accepted. What If You Miss The Deadline? If you’re a victim of the Terra collapse, this may be your best shot at recovering losses. However, failing to file a claim before May 16 means you’ll likely lose your chance to recover any losses. Be sure to visit the portal, read the claim procedures carefully, and submit your evidence as soon as possible.",News,EN,0,0,LUNA,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-12 18:19:34

The rapid decline has reignited a critical debate in crypto and meme coins are not likely to sustain long term value. This is why many are now eyeing Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a rising DeFi project with real-world utility, as their potential ticket to redemption. Phase 4 of the presale has already launched giving investors optimism. Over $6.5 million has been accumulated and 8100 holders attracted. New investors purchase MUTM at its current price of $0.025 because the value will reach $0.03 as part of Phase 5. Current investors have the opportunity to achieve a 140% return on investment before the project launch occurs at $0.06. MUTM could hit $5 after launch. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Grows Mutuum Finance leads the decentralized lending market through its innovative dual-lending system and it has established itself as a quick-growing collaborative system. The project maintains increasing popularity as 8100 investors put $6.5 million into the presale. During Phase 4 which presents the current trading value of $0.025 investors can expect a 20% price increase in Phase 5 to secure substantial profit potential. Research data indicates that MUTM stands among the most underpriced yet promising DeFi projects set to exceed $5 after its release on the market. MUTM is fast positioning itself as the serious alternative to high-volatility meme coins, with its innovative lending features and newly launched top 50 leaderboard dashboard that rewards loyal holders. DeFi Experiences Revolutionary Change Mutuum Finance stands apart for its ability to unite the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models in one system. The P2C model combines USDT liquidity pools that produce passive income for users who benefit from automatic smart contracts used for lending operations. Both P2P and P2C models deliver fundamental DeFi functions to users through their different mechanisms for transacting directly between parties without third-party involvement. Through the blending of these two models, Mutuum Finance enhances security, efficiency, and decentralization, making it a good fit for DeFi investors seeking high-yielding alternatives. The Development of a Stable Secure Environment To demonstrate its focus on stability Mutuum Finance releases a fully secured Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by USD. The stablecoin token stands distinct from algorithmic stablecoins because Mutuum Finance bases it on over-collateralization to provide both risk reduction and long-term trustworthiness. Open financial architectures paired with audited smart contracts alongside this architecture strengthen investor trust by covering all the vulnerabilities found in past DeFi projects. Mutuum Finance implements incentive plans as a method to increase its community reach. By offering a $100,000 giveaway the program will give out 10 thousand dollars worth of MUTM tokens to winners among 10 participants in addition to its innovative referral system that pays users for successful new investor acquisitions. Early adopters of Mutuum Finance obtain both special staking pools and governance rights and VIP access to platform updates which keeps them committed to the platform over the long term. Sustainable Tokenomics for Long-Term Growth Mutuum Finance implements controlled token supply restrictions and deflationary mechanics throughout presales to build scarcity in its framework thus boosting the token’s potential value growth. The staking program gives crypto users attractive incentives to remain engaged while ensuring token sustainability during long-term development of the platform. Pepe (PEPE) investors have faced losses as the coin drops to $0.000007. Many are now turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a potential path to recovery. MUTM is quickly gaining momentum, with over $6.5 million raised in its presale and 8,100 investors on board. Don’t miss the opportunity to invest in MUTM today for a promising future in DeFi.

According to anonymous sources who spoke with WIRED , the government agency will no longer issue its customary letters and press releases to communicate changes to the public, instead relying on X as its primary form of public-facing communication. The shift comes as the SSA downsizes its workforce from 57,000 employees to roughly 50,000 to reduce costs and improve operational efficiency. The agency issued this statement in February 2025: “SSA has operated with a regional structure consisting of 10 offices, which is no longer sustainable. The agency will reduce the regional structure in all agency components down to four regions. The organizational structure at Headquarters also is outdated and inefficient.” Elon Musk, the head of DOGE , has accused the Social Security system of distributing billions of dollars in wrongful payments, a claim echoed by the White House. Musk's comments sparked intense debate about the future of the retirement program and sustainable government spending. Source: Elon Musk Related: Musk says he found ‘magic money computers’ printing money ‘out of thin air’ DOGE targets US government agencies in efficiency push The Department of Government Efficiency is an unofficial government agency tasked with identifying and curbing allegedly wasteful public spending through budget and personnel cuts. In March, DOGE began probing the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and gained access to its internal systems , including data repositories. SEC officials signaled their cooperation with DOGE and said the regulatory agency would work closely with it to provide any relevant information requested. Musk and Trump discuss curbing public spending and eliminating government waste. Source: The White house DOGE also proposed slashing the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) workforce by 20%. The workforce reduction could impact up to 6,800 IRS employees and be implemented by May 15 — exactly one month after 2024 federal taxes are due. Musk’s and the DOGE's proposals for sweeping spending cuts are not limited to slashing budgets and reducing the size of the federal workforce. DOGE is reportedly exploring blockchain to curb public spending by placing the entire government budget onchain to promote accountability and transparency.

An In-Depth Analysis,https://cryptopotato.com/how-did-bybits-1-5b-hack-affect-the-crypto-market-an-in-depth-analysis/,"Less than two months ago, the crypto exchange Bybit fell victim to one of the largest attacks in the crypto sector’s history, losing about $1.5 billion in ether (ETH) to cyber criminals. While the leading trading platform has recovered significantly from the effects of the attack, market experts have analyzed data that showed how it navigated the incident. A postmortem report obtained by the crypto institutional-grade research firm BlockScholes reveals how deeply the hack affected the broader crypto market, bid-ask spreads, and the role of Bybit’s new Retail Price Improvement (RPI) orders in the platform’s recovery. How Bybit’s Hack Affected the Market Recall that the attack targeted one of Bybit’s Ethereum cold wallets. BlockScholes disclosed that the sell-off that followed the incident was not unique to crypto because the market was already witnessing a significant de-risking across crypto assets due to several macro events, including tariff tensions and the launch of DeepSeek’s artificial intelligence (AI) model. Analyzing the hack’s impact on spot trading volumes, analysts noted a short-lived spike in the hourly trade volume of all Tether (USDT) pairs away from the mean. After the spike, there was a significant drop in bitcoin (BTC) and altcoin trading volumes within the following days. Bybit’s share in the spot trading volume market dropped from 11% to 4%, and the proportion of BTC traded fell from 50% to below 20%, while ETH volumes remained relatively stable. Although these volumes are yet to return to the high levels seen at the beginning of the year, there has been a significant recovery. The overall spot trading share has risen by a few points to 6-7%. Despite the plunge in trading volumes, bid-ask spreads remained tight. This metric measures the difference between the lowest ask price and the highest bid price. A tighter spread indicates higher liquidity and lower execution risk. Swift Recovery After the hack on February 21, only Pepe (PEPE) and Official Trump (TRUMP) witnessed a significant change in order book depth; BTC and even ETH, the asset stolen during the attack, saw the lowest spreads, recording negligible changes after the incident. However, the order book depth of Bitcoin and Ethereum swiftly recovered within a week, a development attributed to Bybit’s RPI orders. RPI orders aim to enhance liquidity exclusively for retail traders. The feature is a unique subset of orders placed by market makers or institutional participants that is open to only retail traders who manually interact with Bybit’s user interface. Bybit introduced RPI orders on February 17, a few days before the hack. So, while the market tried to recover from the incident, there was a good depth of order books, deep liquidity pools, and tighter bid-ask spreads for retailers on Bybit.

In a speech at the SEC Crypto Task Force’s second roundtable event, Mark T. Uyeda argues that blockchain technology could potentially increase the efficiency of securities transactions. “For example, blockchains can be used to manage and mobilize collateral in tokenized form to increase capital efficiency and liquidity. Additionally, decentralized finance software protocols allow users to transact on a 24/7 basis via smart contracts.” The acting SEC chairman also says federal crypto regulation could be more efficient than “a patchwork of state licensing regimes.” “While the Commission works to develop a long-term solution to address these issues, a time-limited, conditional exemptive relief framework for registrants and non-registrants could allow for greater innovation with blockchain technology within the United States in the near term. I encourage market participants that are developing new ways to trade securities using blockchain technology to provide input on where exemptive relief may be appropriate.” Exemptive relief allows financial firms to offer products to investors that might typically be banned by SEC legislation but have been exempted by the regulator, according to the asset manager Dimensional .

According to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, betting on the decline of ETH remains the best strategy in 2025. To implement this, two exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can be used, which short the digital asset with leverage to increase potential earnings. Why Ethereum is becoming cheaper Two ETFs offering an alternative to shorting Ethereum with a 2x leverage have taken the first and second places in the ranking of the most profitable funds of the year according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Balchunas reported this on his Twitter page. Here is a relevant quote from Cointelegraph: ”The best ETFs this year are two exchange-traded funds, ETHD and ETQ. Their returns since the beginning of the year have been 247.3% and 219.19%, respectively.” According to Balchunas, investors who still believe in Ethereum's growth are facing ”tough” consequences of their bet on the altcoin's price increase. It has decreased by 52% since the beginning of 2025 and by 35% over the past six months. Consequently, buying ETH over the past year has not been the most profitable idea. Both ETFs use financial derivatives to track the inverse dynamics of Ethereum's price with double volatility relative to the base asset. However, such exchange-traded funds do not always accurately replicate the behavior of the asset they are based on. Despite this, Ethereum remains the most popular blockchain network with a total locked value (TVL) of $46 billion. However, the long-term yield of ETH began to decline as early as March 2024. At that time, the Dencun update was activated in the altcoin network to reduce user costs, but it reduced validator revenue from transaction fees by about 95%. Validator network revenues have remained low primarily due to difficulties in monetizing second-level (L2) solutions, which process an increasing share of transactions in the Eth ecosystem. For example, over the last week of March, the network earned only 3.18 ETH in transaction fees from its L2 blockchains Arbitrum and Base, according to analysts. To restore commission revenues to pre-Dencun levels, transaction volumes on L2 blockchains would need to increase by more than 22,000 times. This was stated by Michael Nadeau, founder of The DeFi Report. Smart contract platforms, including Ethereum and Solana, have shown a general decline in activity in the first quarter of 2025. The decline in indicators reflects the cooling of investor sentiment following the introduction of massive tariffs by U.S. President Donald Trump. How Bitcoin is used in life Meanwhile, the fundamental adoption of Bitcoin makes digital assets a useful tool in the real world. For example, the Lomond school in Scotland will start accepting Bitcoin payments for tuition from the fall semester of 2025. It became the first school in the UK to implement this practice. The adoption of cryptocurrency is part of the school's plan to integrate the principles of ”healthy money” from the Austrian School of Economics into its curriculum. This way, students are prepared for an uncertain future, according to the institution's representatives. Bitcoin is accessible to anyone willing to learn, making it more democratic and inclusive, especially for people in developing countries without access to traditional banking services. Lomond considers Bitcoin an excellent real-life example for studying economics, computer science, ethics, and innovation. The school does not plan to accept other cryptocurrencies and will immediately convert BTC into regular currency. However, in the future, it may create its own cryptocurrency reserve, the prospects of which will depend on the results of the experiment. According to sources, Bitcoin has already become part of the curriculum in several schools and universities. Some of them have also implemented a strategy for forming national cryptocurrency reserves to protect assets from inflation's impact on purchasing power. For example, in 2022, the University of Cincinnati added cryptocurrency courses to its curriculum to teach students how to interact with Bitcoin and emerging Web3 technologies. Bitcoin was also integrated into El Salvador's school education system as part of the Mi Primer Bitcoin program in 2023. Recall that the country's government made BTC a legal payment method in September 2021. In July 2024, the University of Wyoming launched the Bitcoin Research Institute to conduct peer-reviewed research on cryptocurrency. In February 2025, the University of Austin announced that its endowment fund allocated $5 million to invest in BTC. The fund manages assets worth around $200 million. The bottom line Despite Ethereum's decline and the growing popularity of ETFs for shorting the digital asset, interest in the real-world application of cryptocurrencies continues to grow. This is confirmed by initiatives from educational institutions betting on Bitcoin as a tool for the future. Therefore, the development of the cryptocurrency sector will clearly continue.",News|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-12 18:47:38

This comes after China announced new tariffs on U.S. imports in response to President Donald Trump’s 145% tariff on Chinese products. Additionally, this week’s CPI and PPI data came below expectation, boosting the prices of Bitcoin and altcoin markets. This has left room for a significant recovery rally in the coming week as buying demand rises exponentially. Bitcoin Price Analysis Bitcoin has surged above the crucial $85K level and is now aiming to maintain its recovery rally toward upcoming resistance channels. As of writing, BTC price trades at $84,864, surging over 3.2% in the last 24 hours. The 20-day average price ($82,246) is starting to rise, but the RSI (which measures buying and selling strength) is hovering within the buying region at level 64, suggesting that the downward pressure is easing up a bit. As Bitcoin hovers around strong resistance channels, it’s likely to face downward correction. However, if buyers hold the momentum above $85K, the price might climb to $89,000 and possibly even $95,000 next week. Also read: Bitcoin’s Next Breakout? Experts Say $200K Is Long Overdue On the flip side, sellers will likely try to block that move and push the price back down below the $78K support. If they succeed, Bitcoin could fall again to retest the crucial $74.5K support level. Ethereum Price Analysis Ether bounced off critical $1,500 as sellers are having a hard time keeping the price down. As of writing, ETH price trades at $1,645, surging over 5% in the last 24 hours. The moving averages are trending up, and the RSI is in positive territory, which means buyers are having an advantage. They’ll likely try to hold the price above the descending resistance line. If this happens, we might see ETH price skyrocketing toward the crucial resistance around $2,000 next week. Also read: Will Ethereum Price crash More Next week?? To avoid that, sellers need to quickly push the price below the EMA20 trend line. If they manage that, Ether could decline toward $1,386. That level is important because if the price goes below it, it could signal a short-term change in momentum away from the bulls. XRP Price Analysis XRP climbed back above the $2 level and is aiming to maintain a trend above the EMA200 trend line on the 4-hour chart. As of writing, XRP price trades at $2.13, surging over 5.51% in the last 24 hours. If XRP manages to rise above the 200-day moving average, it would suggest that the recent drop toward $2 heavily attracted buying demand. In that case, the price could continue to climb toward the resistance line at $2.25, where sellers are likely to step in again. A surge above this level might send the price toward $2.6. If the price drops from the $2.25 level, sellers might try to push XRP/USDT down to the key support at $2. Buyers will likely defend that level strongly, because if it breaks, the price could fall further to around $1.6.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Ethereum|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-12 18:48:08

The synergy between AI and blockchain is built on addressing the risk of centralized ownership and access to data that powers AI. The theory goes that decentralization can mitigate against the entire AI economy being powered by the data owned by a few tech behemoths like Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Alibaba (9988) and Tencent (0700). It is unclear as yet whether or not this will prove to be a significant problem at all, much less whether the blockchain industry will be able to solve it. What is clear, however, is that crypto venture capitalists (VCs) are willing to spend millions of dollars finding out. Decentralized AI has thus far attracted $917 million in VC and private equity money, according to startup deal platform Tracxn . The question remains whether the trend of investing in blockchain-based AI is still built on hype or has now transcended to being the real deal. Blockchain investment company Theta Capital described AI x crypto as ""the inevitable backbone of AI,"" in a recent ""Satellite View"" report , which explored insights and outlooks from the sector's prominent investors. AI agents ""No trend stands out more than the intersection of AI and crypto,"" the report said, using the examples of AI agents trading on blockchains and even launching tokens. This may appear to be a more sophisticated form of speculation for degens, but Theta argues it's a route to tackling some of AI's problems that only crypto can solve. ""Crypto wallets enable the participation of autonomous agents in financial markets,"" according to the report. ""Decentralized token networks are bootstrapping the supply side of key AI infrastructure for compute, data and energy."" The report's conclusion is far from being hype and speculation; AI x crypto is ""the new meta."" Meta is short for ""metagame,"" a term borrowed from gaming referring to the dominant way of playing with regard to characters, strategies or moves based on the competitive landscape. Decentralized AI Alex Pack, managing partner of blockchain venture capital firm Hack VC, described Web3 AI as ""the biggest source of alpha in investing today,"" in the ""Satellite View"" report. Hack VC has dedicated 41% of its latest fund to Web3 AI, according to the report, in which it sees the main challenge as building a decentralized alternative to the AI economy. ""AI's rapid evolution is creating massive efficiencies, but also increasing centralization,"" Pack said. ""The intersection of crypto and AI is by far the biggest investment opportunity in the space, offering an open, decentralized alternative."" One of Hack VC's most prominent portfolio companies is Grass, which encourages users to participate in AI networks by offering up their unused internet bandwidth in return for tokens. This is designed as an alternative to large firms installing software code into apps in order to scrape their users' data. ""Users unwittingly donate their bandwidth without compensation,"" Grass founder Andrej Radonjic said in Theta's report. ""Grass provides an alternative [by] forming a massive opt-in, peer-to-peer network able to produce high-quality data at the scale of Google and Microsoft."" The dreaded AI ""takeover"" Decentralized AI presents risks for investors, Theta concedes. It could lead to the proliferation of all the least desirable facets of the internet as it already exists: putrid online discourse, spam emails or vapid social media content in the form of blogs, videos or memes. In the crypto world, an example of this may be the creation of meme tokens. The questionable endorsements, the wash trading and the pump and dumps can all be handled by AI engines even more efficiently than humans. Some VCs see blockchain as the basis for mitigation. Olaf Carlson-Wee, CEO and founder of Polychain, provided the examples of proof-of-humanity mechanisms to verify that users are human and disincentivizing spam through micropayments or spam. ""If sending an email costs $0.01, it would destroy the economics of spam while remaining affordable for average users,"" he said in the report. With blockchain possibly providing some of these safeguards, Carlson-Wee believes AI will underpin digital and financial systems, as they could outperform humans in markets. This reality, he claims, would be gladly accepted, as opposed to dreaded as some sort of bleak dystopia. ""Over time, AI systems will evolve into long-term capital allocators, predicting trends and opportunities years into the future, [which] humans will entrust their funds to, because of the superior ability to make data-driven decisions,"" Carlson-Wee said. ""The AI takeover won't be a war we lose - it will be a suggestion we agree to,"" he concluded.",Finance|Artificial Intelligence,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-12 18:53:55

However, Ethereum on-chain data reveals the altcoin has stumbled in a range-bound market hinting at a potentially prolonged sideways movement. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Show Conviction: 63% Of Supply Hasn’t Moved In A Year Ethereum Trapped In $1,548 – $1,599 Range – Glassnode In a recent post on X, prominent blockchain analytics firm Glassnode reports that Ethereum is trading in a tight range between $1,548 and $1,599. This development is revealed by the asset’s cost basis distribution (CBD), which shows the various price levels at which current ETH holders bought their coins. CBD is an important on-chain metric used to identify potential support or resistance levels based on the accumulation levels seen at price zones. According to Glassnode, a combined 1.53 million ETH, valued at $2.4 billion, was acquired between $1,548 and $1,599 indicating a high level of investor interest at these price regions. In particular, 793,900 ETH currently in circulation was purchased at $1,548, ultimately transforming this price floor into a major support zone for the current Ethereum price. Meanwhile, 732,400 ETH is held by investors at $1,599 representing a significant price barrier to any upward price movement. Interestingly, Ethereum has tested both price zones over the past day failing to produce either a price breakout or breakdown. Considering the accumulation level at both prices, the altcoin might maintain a range-bound movement barring the introduction of a market catalyst. Interestingly, such price behavior would align with the broader market uncertainty amidst unstable macroeconomic factors and tightening liquidity conditions. Related Reading: XRP Price Flashes Symmetrical Triangle From 2017, A Repeat Could Send It as Flying To $30 Important Ethereum Support Forms At $1,461 In other developments, Glassnode also notes that Ethereum bulls are building a critical support zone at $1,461 at which 380,000 ETH, valued at $595.8 million have been acquired. In the case of any breakdown from the current consolidation zone, this price level is expected to act as the next major support preventing any further downside. However, a daily price close below $1,461 could cause ETH to trade as low as $1,400 or $1,200. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $1,562 reflecting a 3.35% gain in the past 24 hours. However, the ETH market remains in a deep corrective phase with 14.56% and 18.45% losses in the last seven and thirty days, respectively. Meanwhile, the asset’s daily trading volume has declined by 34.06%, indicating a fall in market participation and a potential reversal of the recent rally, which would allow Ethereum to maintain a range-bound movement.

It’s Not Regulation — It’s UX,https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/04/12/crypto-s-biggest-barrier-to-adoption-it-s-not-regulation-it-s-ux,"As the crypto industry matures, much of the focus remains on regulation, custody, and scalability. But in 2025, the biggest barrier to adoption isn’t policy — it’s user experience. Crypto’s interfaces are still too complex for everyday users. From managing seed phrases to deciphering blockchain transactions, onboarding feels more like navigating a maze than joining a financial revolution. Wallets remain fragmented, unintuitive, and risky. To reach mainstream adoption, the industry must prioritize usability — making wallets and financial tools more accessible — without compromising the core principles of decentralization. Until then, poor UX will continue to hold crypto back. Vitalik Buterin’s Call for Account Abstraction Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has been one of the most vocal proponents for improving the usability of crypto wallets. His critique centers on the fact that wallets are designed with developers, not end-users, in mind. While technical innovations in blockchain security are advancing, wallets often remain rooted in outdated models that prioritize control over ease of use, leaving the average user overwhelmed and vulnerable to mistakes. Buterin’s proposed solution (EIP-7702), account abstraction, is a breakthrough concept that could reshape how we interact with crypto assets. Account abstraction allows smart contract functionality to be applied to externally owned accounts (EOAs), the most common type of wallet used in crypto. This would enable more intuitive and flexible security mechanisms, such as social recovery, multi-signature support, and customizable authentication methods, without compromising decentralization or self-custody. At its core, account abstraction decouples the traditional reliance on a single private key for securing assets, creating the potential for much more user-friendly experiences. Rather than expecting users to memorize long and complex seed phrases or manage multi-step transactions, account abstraction can allow for recovery options, automatic transaction approvals, and even the option to delegate certain actions to trusted contacts — without ever losing ownership of the private keys. A Call for Human-Centered Design in Crypto Crypto’s UX problem isn’t just about cleaner interfaces — it’s about rethinking design to prioritize human needs. Historically, tools have been built for power users comfortable with seed phrases and command-line interfaces. But for mass adoption, crypto must serve people who’ve never held a private key. This is where human-centered design becomes essential. Developers must build wallets and tools that are intuitive, context-aware, and focused on user safety. The shift must move from catering to the technically inclined to empowering everyday users who are new to crypto. To succeed, wallets need to embrace the following core design principles: Smart Defaults and Progressive Onboarding: Users should not need to dive into settings or security configurations to get started. Newcomers should be able to start using a wallet with minimal friction, but with built-in guidance and the option to unlock more advanced features as they become more familiar with the space. By providing clear default security settings — such as social recovery options and automatic transaction limits — wallets can offer both ease of use and security from the outset. Clear, Intuitive Signing Processes: Transaction signing should be straightforward, with clear explanations of what users are agreeing to. If a user is about to approve a transaction that could drain their wallet, this should be prominently displayed in plain language, not buried under hexadecimal codes or complex jargon. Reducing ambiguity in these interactions will help mitigate the risks of scams and human error. Social and Multi-party Recovery Systems: Relying solely on seed phrases as a recovery method is an outdated and risky practice. Instead, wallets should adopt social recovery systems, where users can designate trusted parties to help restore access to their wallet in case of lost keys. This approach not only makes wallets more resilient but also adds a layer of user trust and security. Built-In Education and Contextual Help: To truly empower users, crypto wallets need to include educational tools directly within the interface. Contextual prompts, tooltips, and interactive tutorials can help users understand the significance of each action they take, without overwhelming them with dense technical documentation. Automation with Control: Features like auto-payment for transaction fees or the ability to batch transactions can make using crypto wallets much more intuitive, especially for newcomers. But these features must be balanced with user control. Users should have the final say over transactions, but automation can help reduce some of the cognitive load that crypto novices experience. The Future of Crypto Is Usability and Security—Without Compromise As crypto moves forward, the real challenge will be to reconcile usability with the core tenets of decentralization and security. Innovations like account abstraction are promising, but the industry must continue to prioritize human-centered design. The goal should be to design tools that make crypto accessible, secure, and simple — without sacrificing self-custody or decentralization. The future of crypto will not be determined by how fast blockchains can scale or how complex DeFi protocols can get; it will be defined by whether the average person can use crypto with confidence. Until then, crypto will remain an exclusive tool for developers and enthusiasts, rather than a technology that empowers the masses. The question is simple: Can crypto be both intuitive and secure, or will it continue to be a space designed only for the technically proficient? The answer will determine whether crypto achieves its promise of financial freedom for all.",Opinion,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-12 19:31:27

After years of investigation and public debate, Bill Hinman, former Director of Corporation Finance at the SEC, is now cleared of wrongdoing. The investigation came after a group called Empower Oversight accused Hinman of helping his old law firm and Ethereum while working at the SEC. However, the SEC’s report found no evidence of misconduct. Still, critics argue that important questions remain unanswered. How It All Started Hinman had worked at a law firm, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett (STB), for 16 years before joining the SEC in 2017. This law firm was a part of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. 2018 Hinman made headlines with a speech stating that Ethereum is not a security . This statement became controversial as it contradicted the SEC’s later actions against other crypto companies, like Ripple. Empower Oversight later raised concerns that Hinman’s speech was influenced by his ties to STB and that it might have benefited Ethereum. In 2021, the group filed a request to access communication records between Hinman and his former firm. The SEC Report Clears Hinman On April 10, the SEC’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) released its findings, which cleared Hinman of any wrongdoing. The report stated that Hinman did not break any laws or ethics rules. According to the SEC, Hinman had no crypto investments, as revealed in his 2021 financial disclosure. Also, his retirement plan with STB was locked in at a fixed rate before he joined the agency. The SEC also said Hinman did not write the Ethereum speech alone. A group of SEC staff helped prepare it, and others at the agency reviewed it. So, it was not just his personal opinion. The report emphasized that Hinman followed SEC ethics rules and did not personally profit from Ethereum’s growth. EMPOWER Questions the Report’s Findings Despite the SEC’s conclusions, EMPOWER criticized the investigation for not addressing key issues. Jason Foster, founder of EMPOWER, argued that the report did not fully look into whether Hinman had any inappropriate contact with his old law firm while working at the SEC. Foster also pointed out the issue of selective enforcement. He questioned why Ethereum was classified as non-secure while other cryptocurrencies, like Ripple’s XRP, were targeted by lawsuits. This issue has caused an uproar in the crypto community. Even though the SEC-Ripple class action is officially over , Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, said the company will continue to push for fair regulations. The XRP community believes the SEC acted unfairly. They say Ethereum was given special treatment while XRP was targeted. Some even clashed with Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson over the issue.

This TRUMP price increase comes ahead of a scheduled token unlock event that will draw attention across the cryptocurrency market. Despite the market’s broader weakness, the TRUMP token is showing signs of stabilization. Analysts are closely watching the token’s next moves as more supply is set to enter circulation. Large TRUMP Token Unlock Set for April 18 The TRUMP token will unlock 40 million new tokens on April 18. These will be distributed to the project’s team members. Based on the current trading price, the value of this unlocks is around $320 million. According to crypto analytics platform Tokenomist , this unlock will increase the circulating supply, raising it to around 240 million TRUMP. The total supply of the token is capped at 1 billion. These tokens represent over 60% of all scheduled insider unlocks for the week, totaling $519 million. Fast Token and Arbitrum will also unlock $80.6 million and $27.2 million worth of tokens, respectively. Token unlocks can add supply without increasing demand. If many of these tokens are sold, this can cause price declines. Investors have been watching the token closely ahead of this release, especially after large losses earlier this year. Market Sentiment and Holder Data The TRUMP token price saw a high of $73.43 on January 19. Since then, TRUMP has fallen by nearly 89%, reaching around $8.03. Despite this drop, some technical indicators suggest buying pressure may be returning. Data from Dune shows that the number of unique TRUMP token holders has decreased from 817,000 at launch to about 637,000. Wallets holding over $1,000 in TRUMP have dropped from 143,000 in January to only 12,000. This has been prompted by recent whale sell-offs with major losses, as reported by CoinGape. Though interest in the token has slowed, recent price action shows a possible change. The price has moved from a low of $7.50 to $8.03, showing signs of a short-term rebound. Technical Indicators Suggest Possible Breakout The TRUMP token price technical analysis points to a possible upward movement. Since April 8, the token has been trading between $7.65 and $8.30. This range may act as a base before a breakout. Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) is around -0.03, slightly below zero. A move above zero could signal growing buying activity. The Money Flow Index (MFI) is at 42.87, within a neutral range but rising steadily. This shows that the buying volume is slowly building, a precursor of a TRUMP price bullish breakout . The chart suggests the TRUMP token price may dip to the $7.65 zone before a strong rally. If buying momentum continues, the price could break resistance at $8.30 and move toward the $9.50 level. Analyst Charts Key Levels For TRUMP Price According to crypto analyst CryptoBheem, the TRUMP token has been consolidating in a tight range, forming a base after weeks of decline. As per CryptoBheem, multiple touches of the $8.30 resistance level raise the breakout chance. If the TRUMP token price maintains upward momentum , it could push toward the $10.50–$11.00 zone. However, if the token fails to hold above $8.00, a drop to $7.50 may follow.

According to the Wall Street Journal, executives from Binance met with U.S. Treasury officials last month to request the removal or reduction of a federal monitorship that has overseen the exchange’s compliance with anti-money-laundering laws since it pled guilty in 2023 and paid a record $4.3 billion fine. Canada also fined Binance, but the penalty was much lower at $4.3 million. At the same time, Binance has been exploring a business deal with World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a DeFi venture that claims to be “inspired” by President Donald Trump and has plans to launch a dollar-pegged stablecoin called USD1. Listing the token on Binance could generate billions for the Trumps, who are currently losing millions on the WLFI venture. Trump and his family control more than 60% of the WLFI project.

Binance founder Changpeng Zhao met with Eric Trump and Steve Witkoff, who helped co-found World Liberty. Fast-forward to now: The quid pro quo for the Trump administration offers a chance to roll back strict oversight; for the Trumps, Binance’s massive global reach — 250 million users and $65 billion in daily volume— could bolster the family’s crypto ambitions. Crypto.news reached out to WLFI, but a spokesperson did not respond immediately with a comment. The Trump administration has already made favorable moves toward the exchange, including disbanding a Department of Justice crypto enforcement unit. Internally, Binance also seeks a presidential pardon for Zhao, who served four months in prison for violating U.S. anti-money laundering and sanctions regulations. A Binance spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. Meanwhile, Trump representatives have reportedly discussed buying a stake in Binance.US, the exchange’s struggling American arm, and using Zhao’s connections to deepen the partnership. The situation spotlights the unusual overlap between past enforcement targets and a White House now open to alliances with crypto bigwigs. With Trump — himself a convicted felon — already pardoning figures like BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, the new crypto era in Washington, D.C., seems poised to reward the very “ bad actors ” the sector’s leaders complain about.

That’s why the firm has rolled out a panoply of products (mining pools, hashrate derivatives, data analytics, ASIC brokerage) to help bitcoin miners, large and small, develop their operations. Aaron Forster, the company’s director of business development, joined in October 2021, and has seen the team grow from roughly 15 to 85 people in the span of three and a half years. Forster worked a decade in the Canadian energy sector before coming to bitcoin mining, which is one of the reasons why he’ll be speaking about the future of mining in Canada and the U.S. at the BTC & Mining Summit at Consensus this year. Follow full coverage of Consensus 2025 in Toronto May 14-16. In the leadup to the event, Forster shared with CoinDesk his thoughts on bitcoin miners turning to artificial intelligence, the growing sophistication of the mining industry, and how Luxor’s products enable miners to hedge various forms of risk. This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity. CoinDesk: Mining pools allow miners to combine their computational resources to have higher chances of receiving bitcoin block rewards. Can you explain to us how Luxor’s mining pools work? Aaron Forster: Mining pools are basically aggregators that reduce the variance of solo mining. When you look at solo mining, it's very lottery-esque, meaning that you could be plugging your machines in and you might hit block rewards tomorrow — or you might hit it 100 years from now. But you're still paying for energy during that time. At a small scale, it’s not a big deal, as you scale that up and create a business around it. The most common kind of mining pool is PPLNS, which means Pay-Per-Last-N-Shares. Basically, that means the miner does not get paid unless that mining pool hits the block. That's also due to luck variance, so it’s no different from that solo miner’s situation. However, that creates revenue volatility for those large industrial miners. So we’re seeing the emergence of what we call Full-Pay-Per-Share, or FPPS, and that's Luxor is operating for our bitcoin pool. With FPPS, regardless of whether we find a block or not, we're still paying our miners their revenue based on the number of shares they've submitted to the pool. That gives revenue certainty to miners, assuming hashprice stays the same. We've effectively become an insurance provider. The problem is that you need a very deep and strong balance sheet to support that model, because while we've reduced the variance for miners, that risk is now put on us. So we need to plan for that. But it can be calculated over a long enough period of time. We have different partners in that regard, so that we don't bear the full risk from our balance sheet. Tell me about your ASIC brokerage business. We’ve become one of the leading hardware suppliers on the secondary market. Primarily within North America, but we've shipped to 35+ countries. We deal with everybody from public companies to private companies, institutions to retail. We're primarily a broker, meaning we match buyer and seller, mostly on the secondary market. Sometimes we do interact with ASIC manufacturers, and in certain cases we do take principal positions, meaning we use money from our balance sheet to purchase ASICs and then resell them on the secondary market. But the majority of our volume comes from matching buyers and sellers. Luxor also launched the first hashrate futures contracts. We’re trying to push the Bitcoin mining space forward. We’re a hashrate marketplace, depending on how you look at our mining pools, and we wanted to take a big leap and take hashrate to the TradFi world. We wanted to create a tool that allows investors to take a position on hashprice without effectively owning mining equipment. Hashprice is, you know, the hourly or daily revenue that miners get, and that fluctuates a lot. For some people it’s about hedging, for others it’s speculation. We’re creating a tool for miners to sell their hashrate forward and use it as a basic collateral or a way to finance growth. We said, ‘Let's allow miners to basically sell forward hashrate, receive bitcoin upfront, and then they can take that and do whatever they need to do with it, whether it's purchase ASICs or expand their mining operations.’ It’s basically the collateralization of hashrate. So they're obligated to send us X amount of hashrate per month for the length of the contract. Before that, they'll receive a certain amount of bitcoin upfront. There’s a market imbalance between buyers and sellers. We have a lot of buyers, meaning people and institutions wanting to earn yield on their bitcoin. What you’re lending your bitcoin at is effectively your interest rate. However, you could also look at it like you're purchasing that hashrate at a discount. That's important for institutions or folks that don't want physical exposure to bitcoin mining, but want exposure to hash price or hashrate. They can do that synthetically through purchasing bitcoin and putting it into our market, effectively lending that out, earning a yield, and purchasing that hashrate at a discount. What do you find most exciting about bitcoin mining at the moment? The acceptance and natural progression of our industry into other markets. We can't ignore the AI HPC transition. Instead of building these mega mines that are just massive buildings with power-dense bitcoin mining operations, you're starting to see large miners turning into power infrastructure providers for artificial intelligence. Using bitcoin mining as a stepping stone to a larger, more capital intensive industry like AI is exciting to me, because it kind of gives us a bit more acceptance, because we’re coming at it from a completely different angle. I think the biggest example is the Core Scientific / CoreWeave deal structure , how they've kind of merged those two businesses together. They're complimentary to each other. And that's really exciting. When you look at our own product roadmap, we have no choice but to follow a similar roadmap to bitcoin miners. A lot of the products that we built for the mining industry are analogous to what is needed at a different level for AI. Mind you, it's a lot simpler in our industry than in AI. We’re our first step into the HPC space, and it’s still very early days there.",Finance|Luxor technologies|Bitcoin Mining|Consensus|Hashrate,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-12 19:52:58

Experts Predict Ruvi AI’s (RUVI) 14x ROI Will Eclipse the Market Giants Soon,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-btc-and-ethereum-eth-fall-behind-experts-predict-ruvi-ais-ruvi-14x-roi-will-eclipse-the-market-giants-soon/,"Last weeks brought to light a harsh reality for Bitcoin and Ethereum investors. Despite being the biggest players in the crypto space, both are showing signs of saturation and limited growth . Bitcoin at $83,000 is struggling to overcome macro headwinds caused by global tariffs sparked by political chaos. Ethereum is plateauing with a projected ROI far below investor expectations, while benefiting from its established network and smart contract dominance. Experts say it’s getting harder for these market leaders to deliver the kind of exponential growth early adopters experienced. This slow performance has left many wondering if it’s time to pivot to emerging projects that promise better returns and innovative utility . One such project is Ruvi AI (RUVI) , a blockchain project that’s shaking things up with growth forecasts and cutting edge tech integration. RUVI’s Ecosystem Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum that rely on legacy market dominance, RUVI delivers tangible value through its AI driven ecosystem . This ecosystem is built to solve real world problems, with the $RUVI token having practical use cases from premium AI tools to governance and staking rewards.

That’s a 14x ROI . Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum where growth has slowed down due to their market dominance, RUVI is giving early participants a chance for exponential returns. Top Holder Rewards Solidifies RUVI’s Community RUVI goes beyond just bonus tokens. It builds a loyal and growth oriented community through its Top Holder Rewards program . This recognizes and rewards big contributors and strengthens RUVI’s ecosystem and encourages long term participation. This ensures Ruvi AI is more than just a cryptocurrency, it’s a network of engaged supporters working together for collective success.

Dogecoin (DOGE), once the darling of retail traders and meme-loving investors, is now flashing red signals as it hovers near $0.15. Analysts warn that without a sharp rebound, DOGE could tumble toward the dreaded $0.05 mark, a level not seen since early 2023. But here’s where it gets interesting, while panic spreads among casual holders, major DOGE whales appear unfazed. In fact, many are quietly rotating into a rising DeFi performer, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is gaining traction for its real-world lending utility and viral presale performance. MUTM has already raised over $6.5 million and has attracted more than 8100 holders within days. This could be your second chance at life-changing gains. Phase 5 prices will spike with 20% to $0.03 and holders joining at this stage stand a 140% ROI when it launches at $0.06. The Mutuum Finance team has unveiled a new dashboard with a leaderboard that ranks the top 50 holders, who will be rewarded with bonus tokens for staying in the top 50 positions. Mutuum Finance Presale Gains Traction Investors flock to Mutuum Finance due to its revolutionary decentralized finance model for crypto loans while decentralization funds its innovative financial services. The project maintains a rising momentum since it has raised over $6.5 million in investments and now attracts more than 8100 investors. The Phase 4 token price at $0.025 presents investors with a limited opportunity as an upcoming 20% price boost charts the completion of early investment entry. Potential investors who join during the presale period could earn 140% ROI since the token has defined a listing price at $0.06. As the decentralized market grows, Mutuum Finance is leading the charge with its groundbreaking lending model and solid market positioning. The Mutuum Finance team is currently having its smart contract audited by CertiK, a crucial step in ensuring security and trust. Once finalized, the official audit report will be shared on their social media platforms. Transforming Crypto Lending with a Dual-Model System Mutuum Finance offers a modern lending platform that joins Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer models for better access to assets as well as transparency and user empowerment. Through the Peer-to-Contract model users can add stablecoins to smart contract pools to earn passive income as they instantly allow borrowing access to platform users. Smart contracts manage automatic interest rate adjustments that provide enhanced earnings for lenders at reduced borrowing expenses. When people utilize the P2P model they create immediate lending relationships free of intermediaries that fulfill decentralization goals and let users exercise complete negotiation capabilities. Borrowers together with lenders operate in a system which offers complete transparency and efficiency to form custom agreements for loan transactions creating enhanced user-centric borrowing situations. The Mutuum Finance stablecoin functions on Ethereum by keeping stable prices through USD fund reservations. Financial transactions rely on this stablecoin system because it uses a resistant structure which prevents algorithmic stability problems. The combination of next-generation financial lending approaches with robust infrastructure elements enables Mutuum Finance to create the path for decentralized finance development. The MUTM Giveaway Mutuum Finance continues to grow its community base through the provision of attractive monetary benefits. The giveaway campaign provides $10,000 MUTM tokens to 10 randomly selected winners throughout the program which has $100,000 in prizes. In addition the new investor referral program exists to reward users for new investor acquisitions. Demographic participants gain access to unique staking pools in addition to governance privileges and update services which fosters extended commitment to the platform. Dogecoin (DOGE) faces growing uncertainty, with risks of dropping to $0.05. Meanwhile, major DOGE whales are shifting their focus to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a rising DeFi project with real utility. Having raised over $6.5 million, MUTM offers early investors a 140% ROI, with its Phase 4 presale price set to increase. Don’t miss out to invest in MUTM today.

Bitcoin, the long-standing giant of the digital asset world, has taken a noticeable dip in price and market cap over the past three months. Ethereum, despite its role as the go-to for DeFi and smart contracts, has stumbled even harder. As these giants correct, one question rises: where’s the next big momentum? That’s where BlockDAG comes into focus. Unlike many coins still stuck in whitepapers, BlockDAG is rolling out real products—its live Beta Testnet, the mobile-friendly X1 Miner App, and a record-smashing presale with over 19.1 billion coins sold. With $213.5 million raised, this is no ordinary altcoin—it’s shaping up as the breakout of 2025. Bitcoin: A Titan Under Temporary Pressure As of April 4, 2025, Bitcoin (BTC) trades near $83,844, with a market cap of $1.66 trillion. Just three months ago, BTC was valued at $98,236, sitting on a $1.95 trillion cap. That’s a 14.7% price dip and a 14.5% drop in total market value over the quarter. Still, don’t count Bitcoin out. On a yearly scale, it’s up nearly 28%—a sign of resilience and ongoing belief in its value. As the original cryptocurrency, it continues to dominate the space with the largest market cap globally, even amid temporary pullbacks. Ethereum Drops 50%—But Core Utility Remains Strong Ethereum (ETH), the second-biggest player in crypto, currently trades at around $1,805 with a market cap of $218.4 billion. Just 90 days ago, ETH stood at $3,658 and $440.7 billion respectively. That’s a steep fall—down 50.6% in price and 50.4% in market cap in just one quarter. The dip follows a bullish 2024 and suggests heavy profit-taking. However, Ethereum remains the backbone of DeFi, NFTs, and smart contracts. Its Layer-2 scaling continues gaining ground, and despite a 45% year-on-year decline in market cap, its ecosystem and dev activity suggest long-term potential is intact. BlockDAG Skyrockets After Keynote 3—Presale Hits $213.5M BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 wasn’t just hype—it was a presale rocket launch. The moment it revealed its Beta Testnet and 10,000 ASIC miners, plus actual gameplay from Tap Miner and massive user growth on the X1 App, everything changed. More than 750,000 people are already mining via the X1 App. Over 400,000 are actively playing the gamified Tap Miner. The presale? It’s exploded. Since the keynote, it’s surpassed $213.5 million with more than 19.1 billion BDAG coins sold. At $0.0248 in Batch 27, that’s a jaw-dropping 2,380% gain from the $0.001 launch price. And this isn’t projection—it’s real-time performance. The Beta “Primordial” Testnet is up and running, confirming transactions using a hybrid DAG + PoW model. Buyers aren’t just betting on potential—they’re reacting to proof of progress. BlockDAG’s presale frenzy isn’t built on speculation—it’s rooted in results. With the Testnet live and X1 App onboarding users in the hundreds of thousands, the roadmap is now execution—not aspiration. Every new batch means a higher entry price. For those watching from the sidelines, Keynote 3 was the line in the sand—get in now or pay more later. From tech delivery to community scale, BlockDAG is running laps while others are resetting. Summing Up! Bitcoin and Ethereum still matter. But their Q1 corrections have opened the door for fresh contenders. With legacy coins stabilizing, eyes are shifting to projects that are actively building—and BlockDAG fits the bill. With $213.5 million raised, over 19.1 billion coins sold, and real tech milestones already met, BlockDAG isn’t just keeping pace—it’s accelerating. In a space hungry for tangible innovation, this is where momentum lives in 2025.

The decision follows requests from parents and reflects a growing interest in cryptocurrency within educational institutions. The school plans to build a Bitcoin reserve, although it currently has no intentions to accept other cryptocurrencies or convert Bitcoin into fiat currency immediately. This initiative aligns with the school’s new curriculum focus on Austrian Economics and principles of sound money, aiming to enhance educational inclusivity.

Trader Ali Martinez tells his 135,100 followers on the social media platform X that ETH’s Entity-Adjusted Dormancy Flow just dropped below one million, suggesting that Ethereum may be in the midst of carving a major cycle bottom. “This historically indicates a macro bottom zone, meaning ETH might be undervalued and long-term holders are less inclined to sell. It also suggests: • Sentiment is low • Capitulation may have occurred • Smart money might be accumulating” Source: Ali Martinez/X Entity-Adjusted Dormancy Flow is used “to time market lows and assess whether the bull market remains in relatively normal conditions,” according to the crypto analytics firm Glassnode . The metric, which Glassnode says helps clarify whether an asset is in a bullish or bearish primary trend, measures the ratio of a coin’s market cap and its annualized dormancy value tracked in US dollars. Martinez also notes that 453,000 Ethereum have been withdrawn from crypto exchanges in the past five days. Source: Ali Martinez/X Large amounts of ETH flowing out from exchanges can serve as a bullish indicator as deep-pocketed investors accumulate the asset. ETH is trading at $1,558 at time of writing, up over 2% in the last 24 hours.

The USD1 stablecoin has recorded a daily trading volume of nearly $44 million following a soft listing on BSC and Ethereum. USD1 Stablecoin Records $44 Million In Daily Trading Volume According to data from Coingecko , USD1 stablecoin has recorded frenetic activity levels over the last 24 hours. Data from the crypto data aggregator, USD1 stablecoin has garnered a daily trading volume of $44.8 million over the last day. The surge in daily transaction activity comes in the absence of an official exchange listing announcement of USD1 stablecoin. However, USD1 tokens are raking up impressive numbers following the soft launch on decentralized exchanges like PancakeSwap V3 on BSC. On-chain data reveals that the most active trading pair on PancakeSwap V3 is the USD1/WBNB with volumes of nearly $22 million. Despite the 43,714% spike in daily transaction activity, total supply sits at just over the $7 million mark. WLFI cofounder ZachWitkoff reposted a tweet alluding to the soft launch of the USD1 stablecoin on Ethereum and BNB Chain. “The stablecoin USD1, created by the WLFI ecosystem, has recorded $45 million in volume within its first 24 hours live,” wrote the pseudonymous Notaz.Sol on X. “Now available on BNB Chain and Ethereum, the strong debut signals growing interest and demand for USD1.” USD1’s daily trading volume spike follows an airdrop proposal for WLFI holders early in the week in an attempt to drive adoption metrics. When Will WLFI Announce An Official Exchange Listing? Weeks after WLFI percolated the ecosystem with the announcement of USD1, the stablecoin is yet to make its debut on centralized exchanges. The delay in listing continues to stump investors but recent on-chain transaction volume indicates a major listing announcement is imminent. A previous listing date prediction for USD1 fell through but enthusiasm is still running high for community members. Since the April 1 prediction did not pan out, eyes are fixed for a listing announcement before the end of April. However, pseudonymous crypto analyst xHuai.eth opines that the listing will likely coincide with the passing of a new stablecoin bill in the US. Flowing from the official announcement for the USD1 stablecoin, the technical aspect for the listing is covered with Ethereum and BNB Chain tapped for launch, hinting at a potential listing. USD1 is racing against other industry firstmovers like USDC and USDT and an early listing will give it an edge to snag a slice of the market share.

Burnett introduced two forecast models during the program. The first, called the Parallel Model, pegs Bitcoin’s price at $1.8 million by 2035. The second, Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin 24 Model, is even more optimistic, predicting a price of $2.1 million over the same time frame. “Both are good baseline scenarios,” Burnett said, adding that actual outcomes could exceed those estimates as macroeconomic changes accelerate. Burnett noted that if Bitcoin were to reach a market cap on par with gold, which is currently valued at around $21 trillion, it could reach $1 million per coin. However, he argued that Bitcoin’s technological advantages give it the advantage of eventually surpassing gold’s market cap. Related News: Donald Trump's Cryptocurrency Project Buys a New Altcoin: Doping Effect on Price “Bitcoin is the only absolutely rare asset in the world, no matter how much energy, capital or intelligence is put into it. There will only be 21 million coins,” he said. Burnett outlined a radical vision for the next decade, driven by exponential advances in artificial intelligence and robotics: “In 10 years or less, AI will do any white-collar job for $100 a year. Robotics will do any blue-collar job for the same price,” he said. This, he argued, would lead to a glut of gold, housing and consumer goods, crashing traditional markets and driving down the value of the US dollar. He argued that even dominant stocks would lose their competitiveness in a world where AI could rapidly develop and implement superior alternatives. While AI and robotics are potentially disrupting nearly every industry and store of value, from stocks like Nvidia and Apple to commodities like gold, Burnett argued that Bitcoin’s absolute scarcity gives it a unique and unshakable position in the global financial system. *This is not investment advice.

On April 12, the exchange revealed it would change the collateral ratios for 10 crypto assets, including popular tokens like DENT, ENJ, and AXS. This adjustment, which will take effect on April 18, could impact how much traders can borrow against these assets. This news comes a few days after investors poured over $1.8 billion worth of Bitcoin into the exchange as the market braces for economic signals and political turbulence. What is Happening with the Binance Collateral Ratios? Binance is lowering the collateral ratios for 10 cryptocurrencies. The tokens affected by this change are DENT, ENJ, NOT, DASH, CHZ, AXS, ENS, SAND, THETA, and QNT. The collateral ratio is important because it determines how much of a cryptocurrency can be used as collateral for borrowing. When the ratio is lowered, traders can borrow less against their assets, which limits their ability to make larger trades or open new positions. As a result, many market participants may have to adjust their portfolios. If traders cannot use their assets as collateral as much as before, they may need to sell some or shift their holdings to avoid potential losses. Binance also mentioned that the change will affect the Unified Maintenance Margin Ratio (uniMMR), which helps traders monitor the health of their positions. Even though the collateral ratios will be reduced, some of the affected tokens on Binance have seen their prices rise. DENT increased by 3%, ENJ by over 2%, and DASH by nearly 2%. Other tokens, like ENS, also saw a price jump. On the other hand, some tokens, including CHZ, AXS, and THETA, experienced price drops. How Traders Can Prepare for Upcoming Changes With the new collateral ratios set to take effect, traders must be prepared. Binance has recommended that users monitor their uniMMR carefully to avoid unexpected liquidations. The exchange also advised traders holding the affected token to reassess their trading position. This ensures that users do not depend too much on these assets for margin trading. Additionally, Binance has recently announced plans to list new tokens, including ONDO, VIRTUAL, and BIGTIME. This move could offer fresh opportunities for traders seeking to diversify their portfolios. These changes from Binance could lead to some shifts in the market, and traders need to stay informed.

These market leaders are steady, reliable, and widely followed.

For those looking to ride out the storm and potentially profit, certain digital currencies stand out. This article covers which coins show the most promise for growth by 2025. Get insights on the key cryptocurrencies that could be essential for a balanced and thriving portfolio in unpredictable times. Ethereum Faces Bearish Pressure While Testing Key Support and Resistance Past month figures show Ethereum down nearly 17% with a six-month drop close to 36%. Prices have steadily declined, reflecting a trend of diminishing buying interest and offering lower highs compared to historic resistance levels. Weekly performance indicates ongoing weakness as the market struggles to regain traction. Current price levels are trapped within a range of about $1539 to $2326. A primary support exists near $1256 while bulls face heavy resistance around $2829, with further resistance at $3616. Bears control momentum and the trend remains downward. Traders might watch for a bounce from support before attempting positions near resistance levels. Solana's Price Play: Recent Drops and Key Levels SOL recorded a modest one-month dip of 2.30% while experiencing a sharper 16.28% decline over the past six months. Price has wavered within a range from approximately $97.94 to $165.67, reflecting recent downward pressure and cautious market sentiment. Historical lows near support and intermittent rallies reveal a market testing its boundaries without establishing a firm upward trend. Current price action sits between strong support at $71.30 and immediate resistance at $206.76, with the next hurdle at $274.49. Bears dominate for now as oscillators and momentum suggest hesitance. Traders may consider short-term plays testing the range limits and watching for breakout shifts within these defined levels. XRP's 6-Month Rally and Recent Pullback Past month performance shows a notable pullback with an 8.29% decline, but over the last six months, XRP surged by an impressive 286.22%, marking a significant gain in long-term momentum. The market has witnessed extreme fluctuations during this period, reflecting the coin's volatile trading behavior, with bullish forces having powered the recent rally before encountering short-term corrections. Currently, XRP trades within a $1.66 to $2.77 range, testing immediate resistance near $3.45 and finding support around $1.23. The indicators such as an RSI of 46.17 and a slightly negative Awesome Oscillator at -0.24 point to a neutral stance with a hint of bearish pressure. With little evidence of a clear trend, traders might explore positions between these key support and resistance areas, monitoring for signs of renewed bullish activity. Conclusion Including ETH , SOL , and XRP in one's portfolio is vital for facing the expected changes in the 2025 market. ETH stands as a robust option, known for its wide use and development potential. SOL offers speed and efficiency, making it attractive for many transactions. XRP provides a reliable choice, often chosen for its ability to facilitate quick and low-cost international payments. Balancing these coins can provide a well-rounded approach to managing investments and navigating the coming market shifts efficiently.

The chairman also noted the Senate Banking Committee's advancement of the GENIUS Act , a comprehensive stablecoin regulatory bill, in March 2025, as evidence that the committee prioritizes crypto policy. In a statement to Fox News, Scott said: ""We must innovate before we regulate — allowing innovation in the digital asset space to happen here at home is critical to American economic dominance across the globe."" Scott's timeline for a crypto market structure bill lines up with expectations from Kristin Smith, CEO of the crypto industry advocacy group Blockchain Association, of market structure and stablecoin legislation being passed into law by August . The Trump administration has emphasized that comprehensive crypto regulations are central to its plans for protecting the value of the US dollar and establishing the country as a global leader in digital assets by attracting investment into US-based crypto firms.

The broader market correction, fueled by fears of a global recession and escalating trade disputes, hit meme coins especially hard—Dogecoin among them. After setting fresh local lows, DOGE now appears to be mounting a recovery attempt. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Show Conviction: 63% Of Supply Hasn’t Moved In A Year In a potential shift of sentiment, Dogecoin is beginning to move to the upside, testing key resistance levels that could determine the next phase of its trend. The return of bullish momentum comes as fresh on-chain data from Santiment reveals a noteworthy development: whales have bought over 80 million DOGE in the last 24 hours. This aggressive accumulation by large holders has sparked renewed optimism, signaling growing confidence among major players despite the broader market’s uncertainty. With volatility still elevated and DOGE sitting at a technical inflection point, the coming days will be critical. Whether this whale activity marks the start of a broader uptrend or just a temporary bounce remains to be seen—but for now, the data points to a shift in momentum that investors will be watching closely. Dogecoin Struggles To Recover As Global Tensions Weigh On Markets Dogecoin has been one of the hardest-hit cryptocurrencies during the recent market downturn, shedding over 70% of its value since its December highs. Once viewed as a symbol of retail enthusiasm and viral momentum, DOGE is now leading the meme coin segment into a deeper drawdown. Investors who had high hopes for a continuation of last year’s uptrend are now facing a reality check, as macroeconomic instability and geopolitical risk continue to pressure high-volatility assets. US President Donald Trump’s recent escalation of tariff measures—coupled with retaliatory actions from China—has heightened fears of a prolonged trade war, adding uncertainty to already fragile markets. Equities, commodities, and crypto have all experienced extreme volatility, but meme coins like Dogecoin have suffered the most. Without a strong use case or fundamental backing, sentiment-driven assets like DOGE tend to face the heaviest selling when risk aversion spikes. Despite the broader negativity, there are hints of accumulation that could offer hope for a turnaround. According to data shared by top crypto analyst Ali Martinez, whales bought over 80 million DOGE in the last 24 hours. This buying activity suggests that some large players are viewing the current levels as attractive entry points—even if a full recovery has yet to materialize. For now, Dogecoin remains in a vulnerable position, but rising whale interest could be a signal worth monitoring.

The meme coin, which had been one of the worst performers during the recent market downturn, is now testing a critical resistance zone that could determine its next move. Bulls are now eyeing the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA) and exponential moving average (EMA), both positioned around the $0.17 mark. Reclaiming this level is essential to confirm short-term strength and spark a sustainable recovery rally. So far, price action suggests growing interest, but macroeconomic headwinds and market-wide caution continue to limit upside potential. Related Reading: Solana Eyes $200 Target As It Gains Momentum – Recovery Could Mirror 3-Month Downtrend On the flip side, if Dogecoin fails to break through $0.17 and slips below current levels, the risk of a deeper correction remains in play. Such a move could push the price back toward the $0.14–$0.13 support zone, erasing recent gains. As volatility remains elevated across the crypto market, DOGE traders will be closely watching this resistance level for signs of confirmation—or rejection.

43263992,https://timestabloid.com/?p=63877,1744492297,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,$3 Billion XRP In 24 hours. Here’s What Happened,https://timestabloid.com/3-billion-xrp-in-24-hours-heres-what-happened/,"XRP is once again in the spotlight, recording over $3 billion in daily trading volume as it stages a notable recovery from recent downward pressure, according to CoinMarketCap data . The renewed momentum comes as investors respond to both market dynamics and a major development in Ripple’s longstanding legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). XRP Climbs Back Above $2, Gains Market Strength After dipping to a session low of $1.94 on Friday, XRP bounced back sharply, reclaiming critical price support. By Saturday, the token had climbed to $2.15, representing a 5.52% gain over the previous 24 hours. The rebound followed a sizable on-chain movement involving Ripple, with 200 million XRP — valued at more than $402 million — transferred to an unidentified wallet, sparking curiosity among analysts and market watchers. Market Metrics Reflect Shifting Investor Behavior On-chain analytics firm Glassnode revealed that XRP’s last major price spike in February was driven largely by a wave of new capital. During that period, XRP’s realized market capitalization soared from $30.1 billion to $64.2 billion — a nearly $34 billion jump fueled mainly by fresh investor entries. However, that retail-led surge has since cooled, with inflows slowing down in recent weeks. Yet, a notable transformation in ownership patterns remains: older holdings now account for roughly 63% of XRP’s realized cap, a sharp increase from just 23%. This shift indicates that while retail enthusiasm drove the rally, many of these newer investors now hold XRP at relatively high entry prices, making the asset more vulnerable to market corrections. XRP Eyes Next Move as Volume and Inflows Remain Key With trading volume surging and XRP attempting to reclaim higher ground, all eyes are now on whether the digital asset can sustain its upward trajectory. Analysts suggest that continued capital inflow and elevated volume could trigger another run at key resistance zones. Conversely, a slowdown in momentum might see XRP enter a sideways trading phase until a new catalyst emerges. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Legal Momentum Builds Toward Resolution Providing one such potential catalyst is the latest legal update: Ripple and the SEC have taken a decisive step toward ending their years-long courtroom clash. The two parties have filed a joint motion with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, requesting a pause on their respective appeals while they finalize a settlement agreement. Attorney James K. Filan shared the news on social platform X, revealing that both Ripple and the SEC have reached an agreement in principle. The motion states that no further legal briefs will be submitted, and the case will remain on hold pending approval from the SEC’s commissioners. This filing confirms what Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse hinted at last month — that the SEC is preparing to withdraw its appeal originally filed in October. Ripple, for its part, is also expected to pull back its cross-appeal. A Turning Point? As XRP regains traction on both the market and legal fronts, the asset may be entering a pivotal phase. The resolution of the SEC lawsuit — a long-standing overhang — could clear the path for broader institutional engagement and renewed investor confidence. Should current trends continue, XRP could be poised for a sustained rally, especially if legal clarity and market momentum align in the coming days.

An article that appeared on CNBC reprised an old Munger quote that investors who can’t handle bear markets “deserve the mediocre result” they are likely to get. Bitcoin Investors See Opportunity Ahead The article related another bit of sage wisdom from Warren Buffett’s long-time business partner: “Real opportunities that come to you are few… Most people just get a few times when they can make a huge difference by seizing a huge activity.” Many individual investors today believe that for them that opportunity is Bitcoin. ₿uy the Future pic.twitter.com/tIcwWe0leX — Michael Saylor (@saylor) April 10, 2025 Although Munger himself was very skeptical of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, BTC investors can apply his principled and disciplined thinking to crypto markets. With Bitcoin’s price down by 27% in April since its Jan. 20 all-time high above $109,000, these selected quotes from Mr. Munger may be as timely as ever. 1. Sorting Out Market ‘FOMO’ and ‘FUD’ During times of rapid adjustments to market prices, social media can fill investors with FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) and FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt). While Crypto X is a source of timely information and sentiment about market prices for Bitcoin and other volume currencies, it can be an environment with a high noise-to-signal ratio. Charlie Munger said: “I try to get rid of people who always confidently answer questions about which they don’t have any real knowledge.” Crypto market posts that make extreme claims without evidence, arguments that contradict common sense, and that stoke feelings without providing additional information add to the noise. “I don’t trust bitcoin because it’s too vOlaTiLe” Meanwhile, the stock market in the span of 24h: pic.twitter.com/D2QkBZZEWr — Carla (@HodlingCarla) April 9, 2025 What set Berkshire Hathaway’s profits so far ahead of the stock market’s average gains was Buffett and Munger viewed Wall Street as a social media platform full of noise. Instead of setting up shop in Manhattan to bask in the echo chamber, these two spent their time far away from that noise reading the news and financial reports: “In my whole life, I have known no wise people… who didn’t read all the time… You’d be amazed at how much Warren reads, at how much I read.” Rather than let their emotions bounce up and down with the crowd, these two extraordinary investors worked to stay informed and make investing decisions scientifically based on the correct math over the relevant factors in their investments. 2. Bitcoin’s Price in This Bear Market Some market participants panicked as Bitcoin’s price fell by a third from its historic record high price level in January. “The market sentiment is full of uncertainty at the moment,” wrote Australian crypto exchange GroveX in a note on Apr. 8. Individual investors using Internet cryptocurrency exchanges and Wall Street investors using ETF funds dumped Bitcoin as well as stocks in a selling frenzy as Trump got to work measuring out tariffs on foreign imports. But Munger contends that following the crowd can lead to average results instead of outstanding performance: “Mimicking the herd invites regression to the mean (merely average performance)… Bull markets go to people’s heads. If you’re a duck on a pond, and it’s rising due to a downpour, you start going up in the world. But you think it’s you, not the pond.” Instead of following the crowd, Munger recommends investors do their own research, run the math, and follow the graph: “Mankind invented a system to cope with the fact that we are so intrinsically lousy at manipulating numbers.

Bitcoin Macro Hedge Fundamentals In addition to Bitcoin’s current and recent price data, as well as its overall trend, there is the fundamental analysis of its network activity in relation to its price to consider. Charlie Munger and his partner, Warren Buffett, both liked to say: “I didn’t get to where I am by going after mediocre opportunities.” For over a decade now, in the world of currency investing, Bitcoin has been the most outstanding opportunity in terms of its novel design and function and its market returns. Bitcoin continues to signal its growing fundamental value with the ongoing massive expansion of the BTC mining network that secures all of its accounts and transactions.

It’s coming. $BTC #Crypto #Altcoins pic.twitter.com/ajavbsIKL6 — @CryptoELlTES (@CryptooELITES) April 10, 2025 Because of the rapid pace of Bitcoin’s mass global adoption, MicroStrategy’s founder, Michael Saylor, has found outsized success in buying and holding BTC without selling during peaks or bear markets. Even if he never messed around with cryptocurrency, that investing strategy itself is right out of Charlie Munger’s playbook: “The big money is not in the buying and the selling but in the waiting.” Munger’s two largest positions that he bought and sat on patiently to build magnificent wealth were both in finance businesses like Bitcoin: Wells Fargo and Bank of America. 4. Altseason and Picking Altcoin ‘Gems’ During bear markets is when some of the altcoins with the most potential really shine. But it’s not necessary for the beginning crypto investor to bite off more than they can chew. Bitcoin is simple enough that Saylor built a market-leading strategy around aggressively buying and holding it. That’s in line with how Munger thought about his investments in stocks: “It never ceases to amaze me to see how much territory can be grasped if one merely masters and consistently uses all the obvious and easily learned principles.” But for those intermediate and advanced Bitcoin investors seeking opportunities with a higher risk-reward profile, long-term valuations for the top ten or so cryptocurrencies by market capitalization have plenty of factors worth investigating. Munger says: “Our job is to find a few intelligent things to do, not to keep up with every damn thing in the world.” PS: These 8 Warren Buffett quotes are rocket fuel for Bitcoin’s price today.

Investors searching for top choices in the crypto market should take note. By evaluating the unique strengths and growth prospects of these coins, insights are provided to help identify which ones may thrive by 2025. Ondo Altcoin Shows Mixed Past Performance with Promising Half-Year Growth Ondo experienced a modest 0.58% increase in the last month and a notable 21.36% rise over the past six months, along with a short-term gain of 7.52% observed over the past week. Price movements indicate mild adjustments that coincide with overall upward growth over time. The coin’s progression reflects steady investor confidence and consistent market engagement. The current trading range sits between $0.60 and $1.10, with the nearest resistance at $1.42 and support at $0.41. No clear trend is dominating, as market forces appear balanced. Buyers might target resistance levels at $1.42 and $1.92 while watching for potential downturns if prices dip below $0.41. Arbitrum's Recent Downturn Offers Tactical Entry Levels ARB recorded a steady decline over the past month with a 13.72% price drop and even sharper losses of 43.18% over the past six months. A weekly dip of 3.79% further underlines the downward movement, reflecting persistent selling pressure. Currently, ARB trades in a narrow range between $0.26 and $0.43. Buyers find support around $0.19 while sellers face resistance near $0.53, with a second resistance at $0.71. The market shows mild bearish pressure with an RSI near 41.87 and a negative momentum indicator. This environment points to cautious trading between these key levels, making entries at support and exits near resistance worth watching closely. Jupiter’s Steep Decline Amid Bearish Momentum Jupiter dropped by roughly 24.77% in the last month and lost over half its value, with a 51.39% decline in the past six months. Price movement has been sharply downward, reflecting significant pressure on climbs. Sustained slipbacks indicate a prolonged bearish period as the coin continues to lose value over these timeframes. Current trading prices lie between $0.27 and $0.72, below a key resistance at $1.01 and supported by a firm level at $0.13. Data points lean toward bear control, showing a lack of clear trend direction. Traders might consider buying near support while monitoring resistance levels for potential breakouts. Conclusion ONDO , ARB , and JUP each have distinct advantages for long-term holding until 2025. ONDO offers innovative financial solutions that appeal to conservative investors. ARB shows potential due to its strong network and active developer community. JUP distinguishes itself with fast and low-cost transactions, making it an attractive option for frequent users. Assessing each coin's strengths, ONDO appeals to those seeking stability, ARB for those looking for growth in technological development, and JUP for those interested in practical use. The choice among ONDO, ARB, and JUP depends on personal investment goals and risk tolerance. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

33767162,[object Object],1744493455,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Price Volatility Far Lower Than During COVID-19 Crash — What This Means,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-volatility-is-far-lower-than-covid-19/,"Over the past few weeks, the cryptocurrency market has been overwhelmed by a high degree of uncertainty and volatility triggered by the constantly shifting global macroeconomics. This unsettled market condition saw the Bitcoin price dance between $74,000 and $83,000 in the space of a few days. The price of BTC sank toward $74,000 at the start of the past week as crypto investors panicked after United States President Donald Trump announced new trade tariffs. On Thursday, April 10, the premier cryptocurrency reclaimed the $83,000 level after President Trump paused trade tariffs on all countries except China. Is Bitcoin Now A ‘Mature Asset’? The Bitcoin price has been quite reactive to virtually every piece of news in the global trade, demonstrating the highly volatile state of the cryptocurrency market. However, an on-chain analytics expert has explained that the volatility of the current Bitcoin market pales in comparison to past episodes. In a new post on the social media platform X, CryptoQuant’s head of research, Julio Moreno, revealed that the Bitcoin price volatility in the ongoing global trade drama has been “so far lower” than that from other past events, such as the COVID-19 crash, Terra-Luna collapse, FTX downfall, and the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) bank run. The relevant indicator here is the Price Intraweek Range metric, which estimates the percentage change in the average weekly price of Bitcoin. According to data from CryptoQuant , the Bitcoin Price Intraweek Range climbed to an all-time high of 72% during the COVID-19 market downturn in April 2020. The chart above shows that the BTC Intraweek Range metric surged to 49% after the crash of the Terra Luna ecosystem in May 2022. Meanwhile, the indicator reached 31% following the collapse of the Sam-Bankman-Fried-led FTX exchange in late 2022 and the SVB bank run in early 2023. With the escalating trade tensions between the United States and China, the Bitcoin Price Intraweek Range metric stands between 8% – 21%. This reduced volatility suggests that the premier cryptocurrency has matured as an asset, with deeper liquidity and a better market structure. The relatively stable price action can be connected to the growing base of long-term holders and steady corporate adoption, as institutional players are beginning to view the world’s largest cryptocurrency less as a high-risk asset and more as a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainties. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $83,700, reflecting a 5% increase in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin price|btc|btc price|BTCUSDT|Julio Moreno,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|RUNE|FET|SEI|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CAKE|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-04-12 21:30:55

While Cardano is a well known brand in blockchain, Ruvi AI’s presale model, VIP bonuses and leaderboard rewards are attracting early investors looking to get in and maximize their gains in the short term. Cardano’s Slow and Steady Growth Cardano has always been known for its academic rigor and scalability features. Currently trading at $0.63, ADA is expected to go to $0.84 by year end. That’s 33% ROI. Not bad but not life changing for early crypto investors. Even with Cardano’s progress in building dApps and improving smart contracts, its growth is minimal for risk takers looking for big gains. That’s where Ruvi AI comes in. Ruvi AI’s $0.01 Presale and the VIP 5 Advantage The presale got investors attention fast and reached its first milestone in just a few days after launch, raising over 100,000$ with more than 10M tokens sold. Ruvi AI is breaking the mold with a $0.01 presale that offers unmatched ROI. The platform combines AI and blockchain to provide practical solutions for dApps, content creation and analytics. But that’s not all. Ruvi AI’s VIP bonus tiers offer an opportunity to maximize returns like never before. Take the VIP 5 tier for example. With a $5,000 investment, you get 500,000 $RUVI tokens at $0.01 each. But here’s the game changing part: VIP 5 members get a 100% matching bonus, doubling their tokens to 1,000,000. At the public listing price of $0.07, those 1,000,000 tokens will be worth $70,000, that’s 1,300% initial ROI. Analysts predict Ruvi AI could go even higher, to $1 per token. That would make those 1,000,000 tokens worth $1,000,000, making Ruvi AI a wealth building opportunity like no other. Leaderboard Rewards Make Ruvi AI Irresistible Ruvi AI’s leaderboard rewards takes investment incentives to the next level. Designed to reward its most loyal community members, the program distributes fixed token rewards to the top holders based on their total holdings. This encourages investors to grow their $RUVI portfolio and gives tangible benefits to those who participate actively. Rewards are given to the top 1,000 holders, with the biggest bonuses for the top ranks. From generous rewards for the top 10 holders to incentives for the top 1,000, the program makes sure every achieved rank gets meaningful rewards. And these rewards are on top of the VIP bonuses, giving more token allocation to investors portfolios. For the top of the leaderboard, this is a golden opportunity to accumulate more wealth while solidifying their support for Ruvi AI’s long term goals. How Ruvi AI Will Outperform Cardano The main difference between Ruvi AI and Cardano is the scope of their ROI. Cardano’s stability and slow growth is good for long term but not enough for the exponential gains Ruvi AI offers. With the opportunity to get in at $0.01 per token and robust reward systems like VIP bonuses and leaderboard prizes, Ruvi AI gives investors a real shot at big returns. What sets Ruvi apart is its ability to tap into the growing demand for AI driven blockchain applications. This real world utility adds credibility to its growth projections, making it more than just a speculative play. Time to Act Ruvi AI’s presale is a rare chance to get in at $0.01 before the listing and the price surge. While Cardano will deliver stable gains in the coming months, Ruvi AI’s innovative approach and multi layered incentives makes it a once in a lifetime investment opportunity. With only 3 months until Ruvi AI’s full potential kicks in, the clock is ticking for investors to get in the presale. By October, Ruvi AI might not only outperform Cardano but redefine what’s possible in the crypto space. Get in now and be part of the story everyone will be talking about.

Despite its loyal community and previous hype, the momentum appears to be shifting. Ethereum (ETH), trading at $1,476, is gaining fresh institutional interest ahead of the ETF momentum, while emerging DeFi performing Mutuum Finance (MUTM), is capturing attention with its next-generation lending protocol. The presale is now in phase 4 after selling out the third one faster than expected. Over $6.5 million has been raised, attracting more than 8100 holders. Investors are piling in at $0.025 before the price jumps 20% to $0.03 in phase 5. Those buying today are set for a 140% ROI when the project finally launches at $0.06. ADA could be left behind as ETH and MUTM move into the spotlight, with analysts forecasting a reshuffling of the altcoin leaderboard. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Grows Mutuum Finance is redefining decentralized lending with its cutting-edge dual-lending model, which has driven rapid adoption. With over 8100 investors contributing $6.5 million during the presale, confidence in the project continues to grow. Currently trading at $0.025 in Phase 4, the price is set for a 20% jump in Phase 5, giving investors an opportunity for significant gains. Combining high market demand with unique lending mechanics, analysts see MUTM as one of the most undervalued yet promising DeFi projects, with the potential to surpass $2 post-launch. In a recent update that’s generating serious buzz, Mutuum Finance launched an interactive dashboard with a real-time leaderboard, showcasing its top 50 token holders. These elite investors aren’t just getting recognition, they’ll also be rewarded with bonus tokens for maintaining their position. Transforming DeFi with a Hybrid Lending Approach Mutuum Finance makes its lending platform stand out because it unites both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models. Users participating in P2C model liquidity pools can obtain passive income through smart contract-based automated USDT lending operations. Users who select P2P transactions handle their money directly through peer-to-peer deals which bypass financial institutions. Mutuum Finance combines P2C and P2P models to create features which improve protection along with efficiency and decentralization and thus aligns well with DeFi investors who want yield-bearing alternatives. Building a Secure and Stable Ecosystem As proof of its commitment to stability, Mutuum Finance is issuing a fully collateralized USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum network. Contrary to algorithmic stablecoins, which have been criticized for potentially leading to insolvency, this token will be over-collateralized to minimize risk and make it trustworthy in the long term. Combined with open financial architectures and audited smart contracts, this architecture increases investor trust while filling the biggest gaps seen in past DeFi projects. The company makes continuous community expansion possible through generous rewards programs. The giveaway provides 10 lucky winners with MUTM tokens worth $10,000 from a $100,000 fund and the referral program compensates users for referring new investors. Platform users who join at an early stage get premium staking pools alongside governance power along with exclusive updates while continuing their relationship with the platform. Sustainable Tokenomics for Long-Term Growth Tokenomics mechanisms of the project create controlled distribution and maintain lasting value growth. The presale token distribution limitation together with deflationary mechanisms enables Mutuum Finance to maintain token scarcity that might fuel price elevation. Through its staking system the project offers valuable benefits which motivate constant user engagement while supporting the token’s continuous development throughout the system. Mutuum Finance is making waves with its next-gen lending platform. With over $6.5 million raised from more than 8,100 holders, and a presale price currently at $0.025 set to jump 20% in the next phase, MUTM offers early investors a potential 140% ROI at launch.

Cardano is pushing toward the $1 mark but remains weighed down by resistance and investor caution. Solana, backed by ETF optimism and a tightening supply, is showing strength with eyes on $1,000. But then there’s BlockDAG , quietly shifting the narrative with its early airdrop, 600% bonus, and a presale ROI already hitting 2,380%. While ADA and SOL work to maintain their positions, BlockDAG is rewarding early adopters and offering what many investors are hunting for: access, timing, and a spot among the top crypto gainers. Cardano’s $1 Challenge Amid Lightchain AI’s Rise Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at approximately $0.63, maintaining a strong position with its scalable infrastructure and loyal community. However, it faces resistance at the $1 mark, with analysts viewing the $0.66 support line as critical; failure to maintain this level could lead to further declines. Furthermore, market volatility and geopolitical uncertainties have also contributed to investor caution, inhibiting ADA’s upward momentum. Meanwhile, Lightchain AI, an AI-powered blockchain project, has raised $18.3 million during its presale, reflecting growing belief in its approach to decentralization. With that in mind, features designed to tackle transparency, governance, and scalability are helping Lightchain AI quickly become a serious player in the altcoin space. As a result, while ADA pushes upward, Lightchain AI is building momentum that could outpace expectations. Solana Targets $1,000 as ETF Optimism and Tariff Policy Shift Boost Momentum Solana (SOL) experienced a 15% rebound to $116 following former President Donald Trump’s announcement to roll back global tariffs, signaling potential economic shifts. Additionally, this policy change, coupled with the appointment of crypto advocate Paul Atkins to the SEC, increased the likelihood of a Solana ETF approval to 81%, enhancing institutional interest. Moreover, on-chain data revealed that over 64% of SOL is staked, reducing circulating supply and alleviating sell pressure. At the same time, the slowdown in token unlocks further tightens supply dynamics. According to analysts, technical analysis by CryptoCurb suggests a parabolic trajectory for Solana, with historical patterns indicating a possible surge to $1,000, supported by strong accumulation zones between $100 and $115. Therefore, the combination of favorable regulatory developments, macroeconomic factors, and constrained supply positions Solana for a significant upward movement. Altogether, this confluence of factors contributes to the current Solana (SOL) price surge. BlockDAG’s Early Airdrop Gives Golden Ticket Holders a Head Start BlockDAG is giving new users a serious advantage with its “Golden Ticket” promo, offering a 600% bonus and early airdrop access for those who use the code BDAG1200. In practical terms, this means first-time buyers get six times the tokens during presale and receive them before the general public, even before the presale ends. This is especially beneficial if the token hits exchanges shortly after mainnet launch. Not surprisingly, this first-mover advantage is already gaining attention. With $213.5 million raised, 19.2 billion tokens sold, and a 2,380% ROI since batch one, BlockDAG’s presale ranks among the most successful in the space. Currently, Batch 27 is live at $0.0248, making timing critical for anyone eyeing potential gains. Looking ahead, an upcoming AMA on April 17 could bring key updates—mainnet launch details, testnet results, or international expansion news. In parallel, the project is kicking off its first global convention tour, bringing the community closer to the team and building long-term confidence. Ultimately, for those scanning the space for the top crypto opportunities, BlockDAG’s early airdrop isn’t just a gimmick—it’s a tactical edge. Getting tokens ahead of public distribution lets holders ride the momentum and potentially capitalize on post-listing demand, making it a smart play for those who act fast. BlockDAG’s Early Access Model Sets It Apart from ADA and SOL While Cardano wrestles with key resistance and Solana rides regulatory optimism, BlockDAG is offering something different—early access and real traction. Its 600% bonus and pre-distribution airdrop aren’t just promotions; they represent a head start that other projects aren’t offering right now. With over $213 million raised and a 2,380% ROI since batch one, BlockDAG is making timing matter. For those comparing top crypto plays, the edge goes to the one that rewards first movers. BlockDAG isn’t waiting for market approval—it’s already giving its community a reason to stay ahead of the curve.
