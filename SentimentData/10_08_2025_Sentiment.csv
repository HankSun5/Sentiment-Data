The order sets strict limits on when banks can refuse to serve lawful businesses, including crypto firms. The order also introduces an independent overseer to ensure compliance. The move has sparked debate in the crypto and financial community. Some see it as the end of “Operation Choke Point 2.0.” Others are waiting to see if the order will truly restore accounts to crypto companies that were previously debanked. Caitlin Long on Independent Watchdog for Crypto Debanking Issues In a recent X post , Custodia Bank founder and CEO Caitlin Long spotlighted these new changes. She said the creation of an independent overseer is the most significant part of the executive order. President Trump appointed Kelly Loeffler, a former U.S. senator, pro-Bitcoin, to oversee the compliance of the order. Her role is to monitor debanking activities outside of the control of the three main banking regulators. This includes the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Federal Reserve (Fed), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). Before entering politics, Loeffler was CEO of Bakkt, an institutional Bitcoin futures platform. Her appointment proves that the current administration wants someone with deep knowledge of the crypto industry in a position of authority. Concerns About Political Bias in the Banking Sector Long said the decision to put the Small Business Administration (SBA) in charge shows a lack of confidence in traditional banking regulators. She added that it signals doubt about those agencies’ willingness to address political bias. Long notes that political leanings among Fed and FDIC staff may have influenced past actions. She pointed out that in 2024, up to 92% of their political donations went to Democratic candidates. Critics worry that such biases may have shaped regulatory decisions. It was noted that during the Biden administration, many crypto-related firms faced scrutiny . Some were even cut off from banking services despite following all legal requirements. Custodia Bank itself was cut off from several banking partners after regulators pressured them, despite having a clean compliance record. Protection for All Lawful Businesses, Not Just Crypto The executive order focuses on protecting lawful business activities instead of naming specific industries. This means banks cannot refuse services simply because a company operates in crypto , as long as the company follows the law. The rule also protects other lawful businesses that could face discrimination for political reasons. Caitlin Long believes the success of the order will depend on its practical results. If banks that previously shut out lawful crypto firms are compelled to reopen their accounts, the order will have achieved its goal. For now, the crypto sector is watching closely to see whether Trump’s debanking order leads to real change. Some fear it could become another unfulfilled promise in the long battle for fair banking access.

According to technical analysis, Dogecoin’s recent price action has opened up a pathway to $1 that’s becoming increasingly visible if some conditions are met. Particularly, technical analysis by crypto analyst MMBTtrader on the TradingView platform outlines a bullish setup that formed after a decisive Dogecoin price breakout from a long-term downtrend channel on the 3-day candlestick chart. Related Reading: Crypto Is Here To Stay—Even The SEC Can’t Do Anything About It, Analyst Says Downtrend Channel Breakout And Retest Complete As shown in the 3-day candlestick price chart below, which was initially shared by MMBTtrader, Dogecoin broke above a descending parallel channel on July 15. This breakout is significant because it represents a shift in market structure from sustained selling pressure to an expansion phase from a channel that had contained its price action since late 2024. However, after breaking out of this channel in mid-July, Dogecoin kicked off a correction path on July 21 that saw it reach down towards the upper trendline of the descending channel again. As noted by the analyst, this move allowed Dogecoin to successfully retest the breakout zone, which is a move he sees as confirmation that bulls have regained control. Notably, the 0.61 Fibonacci retracement level appears as a key pivot point where Dogecoin’s price action eventually found strong support. This support was around the $0.188 price low on August 2, where it bounced upwards and has closed three bullish 3-day candles since then. MMBTtrader interpreted these candles as a healthy signal, suggesting that over-leveraged long positions have already been flushed out, and Dogecoin’s price action is now in a more stable state for a strong upside move. Dogecoin Will Reach $1 When This Happens Now that Dogecoin seems to have bounced from its retest of the descending trendline, the analyst highlighted some targets on the way to $1. The first price target is $0.32, which aligns with the 0.236 Fibonacci resistance and acted as a strong support level in December 2024. As such, breaching this level would represent a decisive break above a support-turned-resistance situation. One of the most important observations in the analysis is the $0.40 resistance level, which is marked on the chart with a prominent red horizontal zone. According to MMBTtrader, a clean break above $0.40 would shift Dogecoin into what he calls an “extremely bullish” phase. A breakout above $0.40 would unlock upside potential and push Dogecoin to new price territories above its current all-time high of $0.73. Particularly, the projection is that of a move to $0.75 and the most-coveted $1 price level.

According to data from CoinGecko, the altcoin is one of the top gainers amongst the large-cap assets, with its value up by double digits in the last seven days. Interestingly, the XRP price seems to only be at the beginning of what looks like an even broader upward trend. This positive setup is even more supported by rapidly improving fundamentals of cryptocurrencies globally, but especially in the United States. Why XRP Surged 630% And 54% In Its Last Two Major Rallies In an August 8 post on X, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez painted an exciting bullish picture for the XRP price. According to the online pundit, the latest on-chain indications are that the XRP token is about to embark on an extended bullish rally over the next few months. This positive projection revolves around unique movements of the MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) Ratio, which assesses whether a cryptocurrency (XRP, in this case) is overvalued or not. Martinez noted that the altcoin could be back on its bullish tracks following a golden cross between the MVRV ratio and its 200-day simple moving average (SMA). Typically, a golden cross refers to a bullish signal in technical analysis where a short-term moving average (MVRV ratio) crosses from below a long-term moving average (200-day moving average). What’s more interesting is the performance of XRP price the last two times this golden cross occurred. According to the latest on-chain data, the last two times the MVRV ratio flashed this golden cross, the price of XRP surged by 630% and 54%, respectively. If history is anything to go by, the reappearance of this signal could open the doors to an extended rally for the third-largest cryptocurrency. There is no question that the improving climate for cryptocurrencies in the United States could provide an enabling environment to sustain a significant bull run for the XRP token. Moreover, the shout of an altcoin season beginning further gives credence to the potential of XRP’s price witnessing exponential growth in the next few months. XRP Price At A Glance As of this writing, the value of XRP stands at around $3.31, with a 0.7% decline in the past 24 hours. This past day’s action is not a strong reflection of the altcoin’s performance on the weekly timeframe. According to data from CoinGecko, the XRP price jumped by more than 10% to reclaim the $3 mark over the past week.

The incident, which took place on Tuesday evening, August 5, is the latest in a growing pattern of crypto-related crimes in France. Details Of The Attack According to local media reports, the incident began at around 7:15 p.m. at the Peninsula Hotel, a luxury establishment located on Avenue Kléber in Paris’s 16th arrondissement. Hotel staff alerted the police after witnessing five unknown men approach one of their guests and demand, “Give us 400,000 euros, and it’s over.” The victim was then forcibly taken from the hotel to an area near the Arc de Triomphe, where he was physically assaulted. Officers from the anti-crime brigade quickly responded and arrested all five suspects in the 8th arrondissement. Initial investigations revealed that the group may be connected to a nearby nightclub, where the victim allegedly owed €40,000. Police believes the suspects were attempting to collect that debt by force. The victim was briefly interviewed by authorities and said he had been beaten and threatened. He reported that the attackers took his iPhone 13 Pro Max and a hard drive containing Bitcoin worth around €2 million. He added that a previous incident had occurred the week before, during which the same individuals had displayed a weapon. The suspects were taken into custody at the First District Police headquarters for extortion. During the night, investigators from the Anti-Banditism Brigade took over the case. The Paris prosecutor’s office confirmed that five people were in custody and that investigations and hearings are ongoing. Crypto Crime in Paris on the Rise This isn’t the first time Paris has made the headlines for crypto-related crime. The country has endured a series of violent kidnappings targeting individuals in the industry. The most recent case happened in May and involved a failed attempt by a masked gang to abduct relatives of the co-founder of French Bitcoin exchange Paynium. Twenty five suspects were later indicted for the failed abduction. Another incident saw the father of a crypto millionaire being hijacked while walking their dog. David Balland, co-founder of Ledger, and his wife were also taken from their home in France in January, with French special forces rescuing the couple after a 58-hour ordeal. The operation led to multiple arrests, including individuals with prior crypto-related convictions. Both cases involved a ransom demand, with the victims being released with missing fingers.

Nvidia Corp., currently valued at close to $4.5 trillion , holds the position as the world’s most valuable business, while AI innovators such as OpenAI and Anthropic have secured funding worth tens of billions of dollars. But beyond the enthusiasm, investors are preparing for market shifts on a scale not seen since the early days of the web, according to Bloomberg . Many are repositioning their investments away from companies seen as exposed to artificial intelligence, driven competition, anticipating a drop in demand for their offerings as the technology becomes more prevalent. Website-creation platform Wix.com Ltd., stock-image supplier Shutterstock Incorporated, and software producer Adobe Incorporated are among 26 businesses identified by Bank of America as being in the highest-risk category. Since mid-May, this collection has trailed the S&P 500 Index by about 22 percentage points, after previously moving mostly in line with the market since ChatGPT first appeared in late 2022. “The disruption is real,” said Daniel Newman, CEO of the Futurum Group. “We thought it would happen over five years. It seems like it is going to happen over two. Service-based businesses with a high headcount are going to be really vulnerable.” Although no major business collapses have yet been tied directly to artificial intelligence, software that can program, handle complex questions, and produce imagery or videos is beginning to challenge older business approaches. With firms such as Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. committing hundreds of billions to AI development, the competitive strain is building. Wix.com and Shutterstock have both seen their share prices drop more than 33% this year, compared with an 8.6% increase for the S&P 500. Adobe’s stock is down 23% as investors worry customers may turn to AI for making images, like Coca-Cola did in an ad campaign. The nervousness extends past the creative and staffing industries. Gartner Incorporated’s shares sank 30% last week, the steepest one-week drop in its history, after it cut its yearly revenue forecast. While Gartner pointed to U.S. policy shifts such as budget cuts and tariffs, some analysts suggested that AI could offer less expensive alternatives to its research services. Morgan Stanley said the update “added fuel to the AI disruption case,” and Baird noted heightened concerns about AI’s influence. Gartner did not respond. Not every business on AI’s path is struggling Technology has a long history of displacing older markets, from telegraphs replaced by telephones to Blockbuster losing out to Netflix. Adam Sarhan, CEO of 50 Park Investments, said, “Any company where you’re paying someone to do something that AI can do faster and cheaper will be wiped out, think graphic design, administrative work, data analysis.” Duolingo Inc., despite competition from AI translation systems, has doubled its share price over the last year after boosting its 2025 revenue guidance, thanks in part to its own AI-powered tools. Still, questions linger over how sustainable such growth will be. The gap between stock market winners and laggards has widened considerably in 2025. Earlier this year, low-cost AI products from China raised doubts about U.S. dominance, but instead of slowing their efforts, large tech players have expanded their budgets. Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet Inc., and Amazon.com Inc. are forecast to invest roughly $350 billion in total capital spending this fiscal year, almost 50% higher than the prior year, largely to expand AI infrastructure. This surge has benefited companies like Nvidia, whose processors drive most AI systems. Determining which enterprises are most at risk isn’t always simple. Alphabet, a leader in AI development, still appears on Bank of America’s high-risk roster, in part because it must defend its stronghold in online search. In other cases, the risk is clearer: advertising giant Omnicom Group Inc. has dropped 15% this year, and WPP Plc has plummeted over 50%, amid reports that Meta aims to fully automate ad creation.

Other major asset classes have posted more modest gains, with emerging market stocks (VWO) up 15.6%, the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) up 12.7% and U.S. large caps (SPY) rising 9.4%. Meanwhile, U.S. mid caps (MDY) and small caps (IWM) 0.2% have only gained 0.8%, respectively. This marks the first time gold and bitcoin have occupied the top two positions in Bilello’s annual asset class rankings since records began. 2011–2025 Cumulative returns Over the longer term, bitcoin has delivered an extraordinary 38,897,420% total return since 2011 — a figure that dwarfs all other asset classes in the dataset. Gold’s 126% cumulative return over the same period puts it in the middle of the pack, trailing equity benchmarks like the Nasdaq 100 (1101%) and U.S. large caps (559%), as well as mid caps (316%), small caps (244%) and emerging market stocks (57%). Based on Bilello’s figures, bitcoin’s total return has exceeded gold’s by more than 308,000 times over the past 14 years. 2011–2025 Annualized returns When measured on an annualized basis, bitcoin’s dominance is equally clear. The flagship cryptocurrency has delivered a 141.7% average annual gain since 2011, compared with 5.7% for gold, 18.6% for the Nasdaq 100, 13.8% for U.S. large caps and 4.4% to 16.4% for other major equity and real estate indexes. Gold’s long-term stability has made it a valuable hedge in certain market cycles, but its pace of appreciation has been far slower than bitcoin’s exponential climb. Gold vs. bitcoin, according to Peter Brandt Renowned trader Peter Brandt weighed in on Aug. 8, contrasting gold’s merits as a store of value with bitcoin’s potential to surpass all fiat alternatives. “Some think gold is a great store of value — and it is. But the ultimate store of value will prove to be bitcoin,” he said on X, sharing a long-term chart of the U.S. dollar’s purchasing power. His comments echo the growing narrative that bitcoin’s scarcity and decentralization make it uniquely positioned to outperform traditional hedges over time. Technical Analysis Highlights According to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model, between Aug. 8 at 21:00 UTC and Aug. 9 at 20:00 UTC, bitcoin traded within a $1,534.42 range (1.31%) from $116,352.52 to $117,886.44. Price opened near $116,900 and moved sideways before surging during Asian hours, climbing from $116,440 to $117,886 between 05:00 UTC and 10:00 UTC on Aug. 9, with 24-hour trading volume exceeding 9,000 BTC during these intervals. Strong buying emerged near $116,420 at 05:00 UTC, while selling pressure intensified around the $117,886 high. Bitcoin closed the session at $116,517, down 0.32% from the open, with defined support at $116,400–$116,500 and resistance at $117,400–$117,900 In the final hour of the analysis period (Aug. 9, 19:06–20:05 UTC), bitcoin remained under downward pressure within a $195.11 band, sliding from $116,629.40 to $116,519.29 (-0.09%). The largest final-hour volume spike occurred at 19:27 UTC, when 296.43 BTC changed hands as price tested $116,547 support. Recovery attempts were repeatedly capped near $116,600–$116,713, in line with earlier intraday resistance.

Those who recognized its promise reaped massive rewards as the token skyrocketed in value. Today, seasoned crypto investors are drawing similar comparisons to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a project that is quietly building one of the strongest presales in the DeFi space. What sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart is not just the current price of $0.035 during its Phase 6 presale but the solid foundation of real-world utility, a carefully designed ecosystem, and a highly secure architecture validated by a CertiK audit. Strong Growth, Clear Roadmap, and Real Utility Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already attracted more than 15,000 holders, raising upwards of $14.25 million in its current presale phase. With 15% of its tokens sold at the $0.035 price point, the momentum behind MUTM is unmistakable. Investors who entered during the very first phase at $0.01 have experienced a substantial 250% return. Looking ahead, the token is expected to list at $0.06, positioning these early supporters for an impressive sixfold return on their initial investment before broader exchange listings even take place. The project’s roadmap offers a clear vision of what lies ahead. While significant elements of Phase 1, such as the presale launch, marketing efforts, and the CertiK smart contract audit (which earned an excellent score of 95), are completed, much of the platform’s core infrastructure is still in development. Smart contract enhancements, full frontend and backend integration, regulatory compliance, and the beta launch are all forthcoming milestones. Additionally, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing for exchange listings and multi-chain deployments, which will further expand its reach and utility. Stablecoin, Dual Lending and Security One of the most innovative features on the horizon is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s stablecoin. This stablecoin will operate on an overcollateralized model, meaning users will be able to mint it only by borrowing against trusted crypto assets like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH). The stablecoin’s price stability will be maintained through governance-controlled interest rates that automatically adjust based on market demand. Arbitrage mechanisms will also come into play, ensuring the stablecoin remains tightly pegged to $1. These dynamic controls will balance supply and demand to preserve the token’s value in volatile markets. Adding further incentive, users will be able to stake mtTokens—interest-bearing tokens received when lending into the platform’s pools—in designated smart contracts. mtToken stakers will earn rewards in MUTM tokens sourced from protocol-generated revenues. In the future, a portion of this revenue will be used to buy back MUTM tokens from the open market, creating a sustainable value cycle that benefits loyal holders. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will offer two distinct lending options tailored to different investor profiles. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending model allows users to lend stablecoins such as USDT to borrowers who provide blue-chip crypto like BTC as collateral. This setup offers relatively stable returns with moderate risk. Conversely, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending channel caters to more aggressive traders who want to engage with short-term, risk-on loans backed by volatile tokens including BONK and TRUMP. This dual approach ensures the platform appeals to a wide range of users, from cautious lenders to speculative borrowers. Security remains a top priority for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The CertiK audit has verified the platform’s smart contracts for vulnerabilities and robustness, granting a high assurance score. To further protect the ecosystem, the project has introduced a $50,000 Bug Bounty program, rewarding white-hat hackers for identifying bugs with payouts ranging up to $2,000 depending on severity. Alongside this, a $100,000 giveaway campaign is active, incentivizing community growth and engagement. Why Now Is the Time for Smart Money Smart investors are already positioning themselves ahead of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s upcoming price increase. Once Phase 6 concludes, the price per token will rise by 15% to $0.040 in Phase 7. This creates a narrow window for new buyers to enter at the lowest available price before the token appreciates further. Given the project’s impressive early traction, innovative technology, and clear pathway to unlocking major utility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up to be one of the most promising opportunities on the market today. For anyone watching the space closely, the time to act is now before the presale price rises and the token begins its official journey on exchanges. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building to offer a unique blend of innovation, security, and growth potential that smart money is already seizing, making it a standout presale poised for significant impact.

Institutions continue to invest billions into U.S-based Bitcoin ETFs and as the American regulatory landscape turns more crypto-friendly, attention is gradually shifting toward altcoins. Crypto traders and investors are waiting for the early signs of the breakout of altcoin season 2025 And while altcoins are showing signs of strength, a new project is gaining traction. MAGACOIN FINANCE is coming out as a top contender in this bull cycle . While Bitcoin remains the benchmark, analysts point to projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE as potential breakout candidates during the next leg of alt season. Its rising momentum and growing presale activity have drawn attention from both retail and strategic investors looking for exposure outside of legacy coins. Bitcoin May Look Strong, but Altcoins Might Make a Comeback Soon Bitcoin’s current price has a strong hold above $110,000, climbing nearly doubling over the past 12 months. Institutional interest has never been higher – July’s record $12.8 billion in net ETF inflows stirred the market and bullish predictions started flooding social media. Meanwhile, macro factors such as a weak U.S. dollar and a liquidity boost from central banks have pushed global liquidity to $176.2 trillion, indirectly supporting crypto valuations. Institutional confidence is reflected in moves like Anthony Pompliano’s launch of ProCap BTC, expected to hold up to $1 billion in Bitcoin. Vietnam’s decision to legalize crypto payments starting next year could also unlock growth across Southeast Asia. All signs point to broader adoption and improving sentiment, but the real question remains: when will that spill over into altcoins? The Altcoin that Grabs the Spotlight As the market prepares for a potential altcoin surge, the fast-growing investor base and mega bullish price predictions make MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the cryptocurrencies to watch closely in the next few months. Unlike meme coins driven with absolutely no utility, this project is backed by real development and early ecosystem utility. Analysts predict MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver up to 68x returns during the next bull run , saying this could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity . With early rounds selling out in record time , the project is becoming one of 2025’s most talked-about altcoins. Early backers see the limited entry window as an opportunity to lock in gains before major listings take it mainstream. Alt Season May Be Brewing Below the Surface Altcoin season is very close as Bitcoin dominance is currently at 60.6%, and a slip below 60% could spark the next bull cycle for alternative cryptocurrencies. As of now, altcoin performance remains mixed. Ethereum is up 50% in the past year, while Solana has slipped 48% from its ATH. Cardano is still far away from its previous record price of $3.01. However, XRP and Tron have flipped green, hinting at potential leaders once momentum shifts. Another key indicator is the total altcoin market cap, which currently sits at $1.51 trillion. Historical patterns also show that crypto markets respond to global liquidity with a delay—meaning the recent expansion could fuel gains into late Q3. What’s Next? Bitcoin’s current strength is underpinned by institutional inflows, improving global liquidity, and political support in the U.S. But as history has shown, once Bitcoin cools, altcoins tend to accelerate. That transition may already be underway. With projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE gaining traction, investors are starting to position themselves for what could be a lucrative second half of 2025.

The directive will expand how Americans invest for retirement and potentially give bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies a stronger role in long-term portfolios. But this change will not roll out quickly, and analysts say it faces major hurdles before most savers ever see it in their accounts. Under the order, retirement plans could one day allow holdings in assets like bitcoin, which has seen growing institutional demand since U.S. bitcoin ETFs launched last year. The potential is there for crypto to become part of mainstream retirement investing. But even with Trump’s approval , that doesn’t mean employers will suddenly add BONK, Pudgy Penguins, or other meme coins to employee investment menus. Doug Boneparth, certified financial planner and founder of Bone Fide Wealth, said it was notable to see “digital assets getting presidential-level attention,” but stressed “the reality is a lot more nuanced.” Employers face legal and risk hurdles before adding crypto The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) governs how retirement plans are managed, and any major change in investment options requires careful review and agreement from plan sponsors. These sponsors carry fiduciary responsibilities, meaning they must run the plan in the best interest of participants and comply with ERISA. That makes it harder to add volatile, still-developing assets like crypto. Fidelity broke new ground in 2022 as the first major provider to give savers the option to put bitcoin in their 401(k)s, but Doug said whether employees could use it “came down to employers’ risk tolerance and fiduciary responsibility.” That’s not going to shift immediately because of an executive order. Preston Cherry, certified financial planner and founder of Concurrent Financial Planning, warned that too many investment choices can backfire. “People become overwhelmed with the investment menu options,” he said, adding that this often leads to lower participation. Even when employers offer education on these investments, workers have to opt in to receive it, and Preston said participation rates “are typically low.” He also questioned how employers will decide which coins are allowed. Separating bitcoin, ether, and Solana from the rest of the crypto market requires oversight from an investment committee or plan sponsor. Without it, employees could end up exposed to coins with extreme price swings. Preston pointed out that many people “can’t understand 30%, 40%, 50% drawdowns – and it could be destructive.” While he’s not against crypto in retirement accounts, he urged investors to “be crypto cautious.” Plan providers and recordkeepers will control final decisions Even if employers are willing to add crypto, the choice may ultimately rest with plan providers and recordkeepers. U.S. retirement accounts held $43 trillion in assets in the first quarter, with about $9 trillion in 401(k)s. By comparison, the entire crypto market is worth nearly $4 trillion. Integrating the two is a huge step, and companies controlling plan infrastructure will decide whether it’s worth the operational and regulatory challenges. Trump’s order follows other administration moves to promote U.S. dominance in crypto. In July, he signed the GENIUS Act, the first U.S. law for stablecoins. The Securities and Exchange Commission has also launched Project Crypto, aimed at updating securities rules for crypto-based trading. Tyrone Ross, CEO of registered investment advisor 401 Financial, said, “The plan providers, the third-party providers, the recordkeepers, are going to decide the end result here, if they want to put crypto in or not.” He added that while the administration is committed to making the U.S. the global crypto hub, major firms like Fidelity, Schwab, MassMutual, and Vanguard may not rush to implement the change. Doug agreed that the executive order is “more symbolic than structural right now.” But he also said it opens a door for education in the retirement space. While he believes bitcoin has a long-term place in a diversified portfolio, he emphasized that fiduciaries must weigh opportunity and risk before offering it. “If we do this right, the door opens a little wider to the future of retirement investing,” Doug said. “If we don’t? Well then, who knows what meme coin we’re going to see on a retirement plan statement.” Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Prices drop, sentiment turns negative, and many investors retreat. But for those with long-term vision, this is often where the biggest opportunities begin. Buying in a bear market means getting assets at a discount – something seasoned investors call a “building phase” rather than a downturn. Some early movers are already looking toward strategic plays, including MAGACOIN FINANCE, a fast-growing altcoin that’s seeing record presale activity. As attention shifts away from hype and toward fundamentals, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are positioning themselves for the next breakout. Bitcoin Bitcoin remains the most trusted name in crypto, and for good reason. It’s limited to 21 million coins, making it a hedge against inflation and currency debasement. Despite market dips, BTC has consistently bounced back, often leading each new bull cycle. It’s the coin institutional investors tend to turn to first when risk appetite returns. Ethereum Ethereum has built an entire ecosystem that continues to evolve. With thousands of apps running on its blockchain and its recent upgrades reducing energy consumption and boosting scalability, ETH remains one of the strongest assets to hold during downturns. It’s a bet on innovation, not just speculation. MAGACOIN FINANCE While the top cryptos remain solid options, some investors are betting on bigger returns with emerging assets. MAGACOIN FINANCE is now targeting a massive 74x rally, drawing strong attention as early-stage demand hits new highs . With each round selling out faster than the last, it’s attracting comparisons to early-stage breakouts like DOGE and SHIBA – but with a utility-focused roadmap that aims to reward long-term holders. This could be the best altcoin for those seeking early-mover gains before broader adoption. Solana (SOL) Solana stands out for its fast transactions and low fees—features that matter more than ever in a market that demands efficiency. With developers flocking to its ecosystem and institutional interest growing, SOL has the momentum to push forward even when market conditions get tough. XRP XRP continues to be a favorite among those betting on traditional finance merging with blockchain. With its focus on real-world utility and ongoing developments in global payment systems, XRP is still considered a strong hold, especially with legal clarity expected to further unlock its price potential. Final Thoughts Bear markets are uncomfortable—but they’re also where wealth is built. Investors who stay focused on quality assets and adopt smart strategies like dollar-cost averaging, diversification, and staking can ride out the downturn and come out stronger. Bitcoin and Ethereum remain core holdings, but emerging stars like MAGACOIN FINANCE could offer the kind of explosive upside that turns down markets into unimaginable opportunities.

The only other stock to cross 7% was Apple in 2023. Even in the height of the 2000 dot-com bubble, Microsoft and General Electric never went past 4%. IBM’s peak in 1984 was about 6%, which now sits below Nvidia’s new record. This level means Nvidia’s daily price changes can sway the entire index more than any other company has in over four decades. The scale of Nvidia’s weight also shows how concentrated the market has become. One stock now holds a share bigger than any company during several of the most famous bull markets. That includes the 1999–2000 tech frenzy and IBM’s mid-80s corporate peak. U.S. approves H20 chip sales to China after earlier ban The U.S. Commerce Department has begun issuing licenses for Nvidia to export its H20 AI chips to China. The move comes after Washington reversed an April ban last month. Nvidia had created the H20 to comply with Biden-era rules on AI chip exports, but those restrictions still stopped shipments to China earlier this year. The company had warned in July that the sales ban could wipe $8 billion from its quarterly revenue. During the same month, Nvidia applied for licenses and was told approvals would be fast. On Wednesday, CEO Jensen Huang met with President Donald Trump at the White House, according to Reuters. It is still unclear how many licenses have been issued, which Chinese buyers can receive the H20, or the total shipment value. The new clearance reopens one of Nvidia’s biggest markets. While the H20 was designed to stay inside the export limits, the previous ban cut the company off from Chinese clients until now. Apple, Alphabet flagged as overbought while others slide Apple and Alphabet are now among Wall Street’s most overbought stocks by the 14-day relative strength index (RSI), which measures momentum. An RSI above 70 can suggest a pullback is near. Apple’s RSI reached 72 after a 13.3% weekly jump — its biggest gain in over five years — boosted by an extra $100 billion pledge for U.S. investment. That adds to the $500 billion commitment made in February. Apple’s expanded domestic production plans appear to shield it from Trump’s newly announced 100% tariffs on imported semiconductors and chips. Trump said on Wednesday that companies building in the U.S. would not be subject to the duties. The statement came after Apple’s July 31 earnings showed 10% revenue growth, its fastest since late 2021. Alphabet rose 6.5% for the week, with its RSI hitting 75. The company’s late-July earnings showed revenue up 14% year-over-year. Alphabet also plans to raise 2025 capital spending by $10 billion to handle rising demand for its cloud services. On the opposite side, Airbnb is among the most oversold stocks. Its RSI sits at 29 after a 5.3% drop this week. While it beat second-quarter forecasts, Airbnb warned of a weaker second half, guiding Q3 revenue between $4.02 billion and $4.10 billion, with analysts expecting $4.05 billion. The Trade Desk took the biggest hit. Its shares fell 37% for the week and plunged 39% on Friday alone, the worst single day in company history. The drop followed second-quarter results that topped estimates but were overshadowed by new competition from Amazon in online ads and the resignation of CFO Laura Schenkein. CEO Jeff Green also mentioned inflation pressures from Trump’s tariffs during the earnings call. Multiple analysts, including those from Citi, Wedbush, Bank of America, and MoffettNathanson, cut their ratings. Citi analyst Ygal Arounian wrote , “We still don’t believe Amazon is the main factor here, but results will inevitably raise more investor questions around the competitive environment and will remain an overhang.” Get seen where it counts.

Chainlink and Hedera are two well-known projects holding steady without delivering clear breakouts. In contrast, Cold Wallet is building momentum quietly, combining self-custody with a reward-driven system that keeps growing. While Chainlink expands its oracles and Hedera works on enterprise adoption, Cold Wallet is shifting the focus. Its utility-based model and 4,900% ROI potential are linked to an active reward ecosystem. At its current Stage 17 price of $0.00998, Cold Wallet is drawing attention from those seeking the best performing crypto today before the next major market move. Chainlink (LINK) Faces Resistance Near $17 Recent analysis on Chainlink (LINK) shows it is struggling to break past the $17.64 resistance level. The project continues to expand its role in real-time data services and strategic collaborations, but price action remains cautious. LINK has been trading within a set range for weeks, despite strong ecosystem updates. Experts note that breaking above $17.50 with strong trading volume could push LINK toward the $20 level. Until then, movement is likely to stay limited. This slower pace may encourage traders to explore other options for faster gains, with projects like Cold Wallet offering stronger early-stage ROI setups. Hedera (HBAR) Holds Support but Lacks Price Drive Hedera (HBAR) is holding its weekly support zones but has not shown significant upside recently. Price movement has been mostly flat, which some see as a pause before potential action, while others see it as reduced market interest. Technically, HBAR must close above $0.085 to spark renewed momentum. Similar patterns in the past have led to either rallies or declines depending on trading volume. Although Hedera continues to grow its enterprise ecosystem, its market price has yet to reflect these developments. This steady performance creates space for newer projects with higher growth potential. Cold Wallet fits this profile, providing both real-world utility and cashback benefits. Its design strengthens its position among those looking for the best performing crypto today under $0.01. Cold Wallet’s Cashback Approach and Its Growing Appeal Crypto was never meant to feel this costly to use. Gas fees, swap fees, and bridge fees act like hidden charges that make participation expensive. These costs are slowing adoption. Cold Wallet is designed to reverse that pattern. Instead of charging users for being active, it gives them rewards. Every time you use crypto with Cold Wallet, you receive a percentage back in CWT. It works as a simple cycle. Use the wallet, and it sends rewards back automatically. Pay gas? Receive CWT. Swap coins? Earn more. Bridge or move funds? You still get rewarded. This approach shifts the value cycle from being draining to being regenerative. It creates a reason to remain active in crypto without the constant financial hit that most platforms bring. CWT is not an extra feature. It is the core of the model. Cold Wallet’s tokenomics focus on rewarding real activity and scaling in a sustainable way. With its presale price at $0.00998 in Stage 17, the projected ROI is 4,900%, offering an advantage over coins that are stuck in slow price action. With $5.8 million already raised and a total of 150 stages, the early entry phase is still open. As the presale progresses, the price of CWT will increase. Cold Wallet’s framework is not driven by pure speculation. It is built around use, making it a system that stands out. In a market filled with passive holders, it encourages staying active and earning at the same time. Market Position and Potential Ahead Chainlink and Hedera still hold long-term value for those waiting for ecosystem progress to impact price. However, both remain in extended consolidation phases, giving little near-term ROI. This is why more attention is turning toward new utility-driven projects like Cold Wallet. With its cashback reward system and a current price of $0.00998 paired with 4,900% potential growth, Cold Wallet is not only among the best performing crypto today but is also structured to grow alongside its active users. The $5.8M already raised shows that early participants are taking notice of its approach.

Cardano (ADA) now struggles to stay near $0.50, while TRON (TRX) looks like it’s prepping to push past $0.34. Both remain top-tier altcoins in terms of activity, but the real action is happening elsewhere. But BlockDAG is where large buyers are focusing now. It’s not just the $0.0016 entry point that’s drawing attention; it’s the chance to claim a chunk of the platform’s massive 10 BTC pool, active until August 11. The prize? Real Bitcoin, based on how much BDAG is picked up during this round. The sooner buyers get in, the bigger their potential payout. Whales are circling fast, scooping up BDAG before others can claim their slice. BlockDAG’s 10 BTC Giveaway Pulls in Whales Fast Big names in crypto aren’t sitting around waiting for BlockDAG to go live; they’re jumping into BDAG now to lock in their place in the 10 BTC distribution event. This isn’t some typical promo. It’s a direct split of 10 Bitcoin, based on how much BDAG each buyer holds by August 11. The more BDAG is locked in, the higher the share of BTC earned. The longer the delay, the smaller the reward, because whales are stacking up. This offer runs alongside BlockDAG’s $0.0016 GLOBAL LAUNCH release, offering a possible 3,025% return compared to the $0.05 launch price. Already, over $367 million has come in, and 24.8 billion BDAG have been sold. The current price is well below the Batch 29 rate of $0.0276, but that price will return after August 11. That gives current buyers a rare opportunity to load up on BDAG at a deep discount. To push things further, BlockDAG has launched Dashboard V4, a live trading simulator designed to prep users for launch. It features real-time BDAG price charts, wallet balances, and an exchange-style order book. Users can test out trades before things go live. It’s sleek, interactive, and unlike most presales, which only give static dashboards or email alerts. Even among the market’s top trending altcoins, it’s hard to find this mix: low pricing, high ROI potential, and an active BTC payout system. BlockDAG checks all three boxes, and the whale activity proves it. Cardano (ADA) Struggles to Stay Above $0.50 Cardano (ADA) is in a tug-of-war zone near the $0.50 threshold. After making some upward moves, price action now sits near $0.48–$0.50, where bulls and bears are both applying pressure. A close above $0.52 might revive bullish momentum, but volume remains patchy. If ADA dips under $0.47, it could retest the $0.44 area seen earlier this summer. Despite the choppy action, ADA remains a watchlist coin for many traders seeking mid-cycle setups. Developers continue pushing upgrades like Hydra for scaling and sidechain features that could help sentiment long-term. However, for now, traders are reacting more to price patterns than news. ADA needs stronger buying power if it wants to reclaim top-tier altcoin status in this cycle. Breaking $0.52 cleanly would be the first step. TRON (TRX) Bulls Target $0.45, But Caution on RSI TRON (TRX) has seen a bump to around $0.332 after gaining 3%, with healthy trading volume backing the move. Buyers are pushing toward the $0.34–$0.35 level, and a breakout above could unlock a run to $0.45. On-chain stats remain solid: 323M+ active accounts and over $27B TVL. Derivatives traders are also showing optimism, with futures open interest ticking upward. Still, there’s a warning sign: RSI is now near 75, which is often a red flag for overbought territory. A pullback to $0.318 or even $0.30 isn’t off the table if momentum fades. That said, accumulation trends and consistent CVD data suggest buyers are still in control, provided support levels don’t break. TRX remains one of the few large-cap coins holding technical strength, and a clean break above $0.35 could bring in another round of volume. Looking Ahead Cardano (ADA) is stuck just shy of $0.50, with eyes on $0.52 as the next key test. TRON (TRX) remains technically strong but needs a clean push past $0.35 before RSI overheats. Both are still among the Top trending Altcoins, but neither has the traction right now that BlockDAG’s presale is seeing. With the 10 BTC distribution active and BDAG priced at just $0.0016 during the GLOBAL LAUNCH window, big buyers are stacking fast to maximize returns. Over $367M raised and 24.8B coins sold show just how aggressive the buying has become. The BTC pool is real, it’s running until August 11, and those who buy more now get a larger share. Wait too long, and whales will scoop up most of it. BDAG buyers aren’t just looking for returns; they’re playing for Bitcoin.

The executive order which is set to be signed this week, Trump is pushing to allow 401(k) retirement accounts to invest in crypto, private equity, and other non-traditional assets. The decision marks a major shift away from decades of conservative financial planning, potentially unlocking trillions in sidelined capital. This action builds on Trump’s growing embrace of digital assets. Over the past few months, he has hosted blockchain innovators at the White House, proposed a federal crypto advisory role, and even called for the U.S. to build a national Bitcoin reserve. With lawsuits against key platforms like Coinbase and Uniswap dropped, it’s clear that crypto policy under Trump is entering a friendlier phase. And now altcoins are gaining traction. The broader crypto market cap sits at around $3.76 trillion, and while Bitcoin still leads, its dominance has dropped to 60.7%, a clear signal that altcoins are starting to take the spotlight. Signs of Early Altseason Ethereum overshadowed Bitcoin’s performance with its Q2 2025 performance. Ethereum’s outperformance is often an early sign of capital rotating into altcoins—something that historically precedes full-blown altseasons. Altcoin-related metrics also support this narrative. According to CryptoQuant, weekly altcoin deposits on Binance have surged past 45,000, the highest in nearly a year. Technical signals are flashing green as well—the altcoin market cap just printed a golden cross, and the Altseason Index has climbed from 26 to 37, indicating a growing appetite for higher-risk assets. Current conditions are quite similar to the pre-bull market phase of 2021, where many altcoins created fortunes for a lot of investors. The Altcoin That Was Rated the Top Early-Stage Gem With the early signs of the altcoin season, MAGACOIN FINANCE has come out as a great opportunity for investors looking to gain an exposure to a project before it becomes mainstream. The project’s rapid rise has drawn incredible attention, especially since it offers more than just hype. With an expanding ecosystem, continuous development, and multiple sell-out early rounds , it’s quickly earning a reputation as 2025’s best crypto opportunity. What’s driving this buzz? Investor demand is skyrocketing, and the project is gaining traction across top-tier communities looking for the next 50x+ opportunity . Early supporters have already seen returns up to 7,800%, and with broader altcoin adoption accelerating, MAGACOIN FINANCE is well-positioned to ride the wave. Altcoin Momentum is Surging The numbers don’t lie—Ethereum’s dominance, on-chain flows, and altcoin market activity all point to a rising tide. While a full-scale altseason hasn’t officially begun, the early ingredients are there. Traders and analysts are watching closely, and many are already positioning themselves ahead of a potential breakout. With Trump’s crypto-friendly pivot and new access to retirement capital, Web3 could become a serious contender in traditional finance portfolios—something that would have seemed impossible just a few years ago. Final Words Trump’s executive order may be the biggest policy shakeup crypto has seen in years. By opening up 401(k) access to alternative assets like crypto, he’s creating the conditions for major capital inflows. At the same time, Ethereum’s strong Q3 and a wave of altcoin signals are setting the stage for a major rally. And as excitement builds, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to attract attention as the top altcoin presale to watch —giving early investors a shot at extraordinary gains before the next leg of the bull market kicks in.

Analyst Points To Key Level For A Comeback,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-reclaim-all-time-high/,"The Bitcoin price has been enjoying some form of resurgence over the past week, returning above the significant $115,000 level again. The premier cryptocurrency briefly crossed the $117,000 mark on Friday, August 8, capitalizing on recent bullish developments in the United States. On Thursday, August 7, United States President Donald Trump signed an executive order allowing cryptocurrency investment in 401(k) plans. The Bitcoin price rallied on the back of this positive development and looks set to continue this ascent back to its current all-time high. Why 118,000 Might Be Crucial For Bull Run Resumption In a recent post on the social media platform X, prominent crypto analyst Titan of Crypto put forward an interesting outlook for the Bitcoin price over the coming days. According to the current setup, the flagship cryptocurrency could be on its way back to its record-high price of around $122,800. Related Reading: Analyst Outlines How Production Cost Determines XRP Price, But Is It Better Than Bitcoin? Titan of Crypto highlighted that the Bitcoin price has been on an upward trend since April 2025 and recently just bounced off the ascending trendline. Also, the market leader has filled the Fair Value Gap (FVG), a liquidity void often created by a sharp movement in price. However, the Bitcoin price seems to be approaching a critical level around the Kijun-sen (blue line) from the Ichimoku Cloud indicator. The Kijun-sen, also known as the Base Line, often represents the market’s equilibrium and can act as a key support and resistance level. As shown in the chart setup above, the market leader has climbed back above the Tenkan-sen (red line), which is an indicator of early momentum shift. Meanwhile, the Kijun-sen (hovering around $118,000) appears to be the only obstacle in the way of Bitcoin returning to its all-time-high price within the $123,000 region. However, a sustained close above the “blue line” could suggest a resumption of the bull run for the price of BTC. Moreover, the Chikou Span (orange line), which is a lagging indicator, remains in the bullish zone, supporting a broader uptrend narrative for the market leader. Bitcoin Price Overview As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin stands at around $116,880, with no significant movement in the past 24 hours. This sluggishness does not adequately reflect the coin’s activity over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, the premier cryptocurrency is up by more than 3% on the weekly timeframe.

His time on the council encouraged significant engagement with the crypto industry. According to reports, Hines will be replaced by his deputy, Patrick Witt, who is currently the deputy director of the council and acting director of the Office of Strategic Capital at the Department of Defense. While Hines has shared an intention to return to the private sector , there are indications that he plans to retain an advisory role as a special government employee and will assist White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks with AI-related initiatives. Bo Hines walks away from White House role Hines shared a statement regarding the development on X, expressing how honorable it has been to serve in President Trump’s administration and work alongside AI & Crypto Czar David Sacks as Executive Director of the White House Crypto Council . “Together, we have positioned America as the crypto capital of the world. I’m deeply grateful to the industry for its unwavering support — I love this community and all we’ve built together. As I return to the private sector, I look forward to continuing my support for the crypto ecosystem as it thrives here in the United States,” he wrote. The administration’s AI and Crypto Czar, David Sacks shared his admiration for Hines’ “expertise” in leading the inaugural crypto council and his role in pulling accomplishments like the crypto summit, GENIUS Act, and digital assets report over the finish line. The Trump appointee also said he looks forward to the departing Hines’ “advise” in the future. Acting CFTC head is also on her way out Hines is the latest Trump appointee to reveal his desire to return to the private sector upon resignation. In May, it was revealed that the current head of the CFTC , Caroline Pham, also has similar plans scheduled for later this year. Pham confirmed this is true while delivering a speech at the International Swaps and Derivatives Association Annual Meeting in Amsterdam, saying she’ll step down as soon as Brian Quintenz is confirmed as chairman. “I will be returning to the private sector once Brian Quintenz is confirmed as Chairman,” she said. “While I don’t have any specific plans for what’s next for me personally yet, I hope to make some over the next several months.” Pham’s exit comes after fellow Republican commissioner, Summer Mersinger, departed the agency to become the CEO of the crypto advocacy group Blockchain Association in June.

That pause triggered a coordinated effort led by senior figures in Washington to pressure foreign leaders into signing off on arrangements quickly, even if the final details were left for later. By May, Stephen Miran, a senior economic adviser, traveled to France and Germany to warn officials that if they did not engage in serious talks with the U.S., their countries would face steep tariffs. In June, he repeated the message to the European Commission in Brussels. The campaign, which has since produced a tariff truce with China and agreements with the EU, Japan, and South Korea, also saw the imposition of the highest overall U.S. tariffs since the Great Depression, with higher rates on nearly 100 countries taking effect on Thursday. White House pursued fast-track agreements over lengthy trade deals While Miran was delivering his threats in Europe, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer ran private negotiations. Their focus was securing promises of major investment in the U.S. and tariffs aligned with Trump’s policy preferences. White House spokesman Kush Desai described the team as “delivering one historic trade deal after another” for American industries. Trump’s approach with allies and rivals has been to push for broad, accelerated agreements instead of lengthy, legally binding trade deals. Greer explained after talks with Chinese officials in Stockholm that “this is not like a free-trade agreement” with arbitration processes, but rather an emergency measure under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which Trump can change as needed. Some of the announced deals still lack key details. In Southeast Asia, the administration has warned countries they will face doubled tariffs or more if their exports contain excessive Chinese content. No threshold has been disclosed for what level of Chinese components would trigger the penalty. A senior official said the administration knows “what that rule of origin is going to be” but has not implemented it. Retailers and governments in the Philippines, Vietnam, and Malaysia have not been briefed on the specifics. Elsewhere, agreements are still in progress. The U.S. and U.K. have not finalized terms for U.K. steel exports under their May pact. U.S. and Japanese negotiators met this week to determine how automotive tariffs will be handled, while Tokyo’s promised $550 billion in infrastructure funding remains subject to Trump’s discretion. Personal pressure on European leaders before key announcements The administration faces an August 12 deadline, when tariffs on China will rise to as high as 85% if Trump does not extend the current truce. In late July, ahead of a deal with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Scotland, Lutnick personally called French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and other EU leaders. Officials said he feared von der Leyen could not commit without their backing. Macron resisted a broader agreement, but Lutnick warned that if France wanted Sanofi, its pharmaceutical giant, to stay in the country, it should not push back. At the time, Trump was threatening more than 200% tariffs on non-U.S. pharmaceutical firms, a move that could have prompted Sanofi to relocate. The final agreement imposed a 15% tariff on European pharmaceutical products, left U.S. goods tariff-free, and secured an EU commitment to buy $750 billion in American energy exports through 2028. Just before Trump signed an order on July 31 setting a 39% tariff on Switzerland, Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter called him to argue over the $38 billion U.S. trade deficit with her country. Trump later said she “didn’t want to listen” to his concerns. An aide to Greer told Keller-Sutter to present a strong plan to reduce the deficit. Keller-Sutter flew to Washington but was unable to meet Bessent, Lutnick, or Greer. She instead met with Secretary of State Marco Rubio. A Swiss official said their proposal would cut the trade gap but declined to give details. No agreement has been reached. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

49827076,https://timestabloid.com/?p=77701,1754782222,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Set To Explode. Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-set-to-explode-heres-why/,"XRP could be positioned for another upward movement after its Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio produced a bullish indicator for the third time since November 2024. The development, highlighted by market analyst Ali Martinez, comes as XRP attempts to reclaim its yearly high of $3.66 in the wake of renewed momentum following the conclusion of the SEC vs. Ripple case. Understanding the MVRV Golden Cross The MVRV ratio compares an asset’s total market value with the average cost basis of all tokens in circulation. Analysts use it to assess whether a cryptocurrency is trading above or below its aggregate acquisition price, helping to gauge potential overvaluation or undervaluation. A golden cross in this context occurs when the short-term MVRV surpasses the long-term MVRV, often appearing during rapid price movements. Such a shift can indicate strengthening market sentiment and the potential for further gains. Historical Patterns Since November 2024 Martinez’s data shows that this signal has preceded notable price increases for XRP in recent history. The first occurrence appeared in early November 2024, shortly after the U.S. presidential election. In the weeks following, XRP rose sharply, moving past key resistance levels at $2 and $3. That rally ultimately delivered a gain of approximately 630% from the point of the cross. The second golden cross materialized in early July 2025, following months of sideways trading between February and June. This time, the price appreciation was more moderate, with XRP climbing about 54% before reaching $3.66 by mid-July. Current Market Position and Potential Scenarios The latest golden cross emerged earlier this month, during XRP’s recovery from a decline below $3. As of report time, XRP is valued at $3.32 . If price action mirrors the November 2024 rally, a similar 630% gain would place XRP near $24, a level also suggested earlier this year by trader Davinci Jeremie as a possible target for the current market cycle. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Following the July 2025 pattern would imply a smaller but still significant increase of 54%, which would bring XRP to approximately $5. This aligns with commentary from YouTuber DustyBC, who has argued that any price under $5 should be considered undervalued for XRP. A third scenario considers the average of the previous two rallies, amounting to a 342% increase. Under this projection, XRP could rise to around $14.40 over the coming months if similar conditions develop. While the degree of price movement will depend on broader market sentiment and external catalysts, historical performance suggests that the MVRV golden cross has been a consistently bullish signal for XRP over the past year. Traders and investors will now be watching closely to see if the latest signal delivers another substantial rally.

With total market capitalization surging and on-chain activity heating up, investor sentiment is turning bullish once again. Amid this upswing, smart money is eyeing a new wave of altcoins with long-term growth potential – XRP, Cardano, and one emerging name gaining traction fast: МAGACOIN FINANCE. The renewed momentum follows the passage of the GENIUS Act in the U.S., marking the first comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins. Paired with a more cooperative stance from the SEC and record-breaking inflows into Ethereum ETFs, the market is entering what many see as a more mature, sustainable growth cycle. As institutional adoption deepens and traditional finance merges with crypto infrastructure, top altcoins are primed to benefit. XRP XRP is once again drawing attention as clarity around its legal status gives the token room to breathe. With Ripple’s ongoing expansion into cross-border settlements and partnerships with central banks, the coin is reclaiming its spot among high-utility assets. Analysts are watching closely for a potential retest of $3.2, especially if market conditions hold and demand for real-world tokenization continues to grow. MAGACOIN FINANCE MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly becoming one of the most discussed altcoins of 2025. Following a strong presale phase and increased community engagement, the project’s new round has launched after the previous stage filled in record time. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its aggressive roadmap and ecosystem utility that appeals to both retail and whale investors. With whispers of a potential 42x return, early adopters are scrambling to secure their positions before listings begin on major exchanges. Cardano Cardano continues to push forward with its smart contract infrastructure and real-world use cases, particularly in the education and identity sectors. While it’s seen slower price movement compared to some competitors, ADA’s long-term potential remains intact. The launch of new dApps, partnerships with academic institutions, and its commitment to sustainability keep it on the radar of long-term investors. A clean break above the $0.80 level could signal a fresh leg higher. Conclusion The broader crypto recovery looks to be more than just a temporary bounce. With new regulatory frameworks, rising ETF inflows, and surging DeFi and AI innovation, the foundation appears stronger than in past cycles. XRP and Cardano continue to impress with their expanding ecosystems, while MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a major opportunity amid this next phase of crypto adoption.

Bowman was one of two governors who disagreed with the Fed’s decision last month to keep short-term interest rates between 4.25% and 4.50%, the level they have held since December. While many Fed officials have been reluctant to push for rate cuts because of concerns that tariffs from the Trump administration could slow progress toward lowering inflation to the Fed’s 2% target, recent comments from several policymakers suggest growing support for cuts. Speaking to the Kansas Bankers Association as mentioned in a Reuters report , Bowman said acting at the last meeting would have been a way to guard against more damage to the labor market and a possible slowdown in economic growth. Her comments on Saturday placed even greater emphasis on labor market weakness than her earlier explanation following last month’s policy vote. According to a Cryptopolitan, Bowman had already signaled her openness to supporting a July rate cut if inflation remained low Unemployment rises as job growth slowed The Labor Department reported on Friday that the unemployment rate rose to 4.2%, which Bowman described as “close to rounding up to 4.3%.” The same report also revised past figures, showing job growth over the last three months slowed to an average of 35,000 per month. “This is well below the moderate pace seen earlier in the year, likely due to a significant softening in labor demand,” Bowman said. She added that her own forecast since last December has included three rate cuts for this year, and the latest jobs data strengthens that outlook. As highlighted by Cryptopolitan , Bowman and Waller’s earlier calls for policy easing had already shifted market expectations. The Fed has three policy meetings left in the year in September, October, and December. Economists generally view job gains of about 100,000 a month as enough to keep the labor market steady. That figure may be lower now due to reduced immigration since President Donald Trump began his second term in January. Bowman’s clear backing of rate cuts comes as Trump has repeatedly pressed the central bank to ease policy. The search for a replacement for Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whose term ends in May, is already underway. Among those being considered is Governor Christopher Waller, who, like Bowman, dissented from last month’s decision. Bowman said she began making the case for a July rate cut during the Fed’s June meeting. Trump, meanwhile, has claimed that the latest jobs figures were “rigged” and dismissed the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics shortly after the report was released. Policies expected to offset tariff impact Bowman has often said that large revisions to employment data make her careful about relying too much on a single report. However, on Saturday she noted that the most recent information on economic growth, jobs, and inflation points to higher risks to employment, one of the Fed’s two main goals. She also said that recent inflation numbers make her more confident that the administration’s tariffs will not cause lasting price increases. Without tariff-related goods price rises, underlying inflation is “much closer” to the Fed’s 2% target than the official June reading of 2.8%, which was based on the core personal consumption expenditures price index over 12 months. Bowman said Trump’s policies, including tax reductions and deregulation, are likely to balance out any economic slowdown or price increases caused by import tariffs. With housing demand possibly at its lowest point since the financial crisis and the labor market no longer adding upward pressure on inflation, she said the chances of prices rising too quickly have reduced.

On August 7, 2025 , both parties filed a joint dismissal of appeals in the U.S. Court of Appeals, finalizing the landmark decision that XRP is not a security in secondary market sales . Under the resolution, Ripple will pay a $125 million penalty for past institutional sales but avoids further federal litigation. This outcome solidifies regulatory clarity for XRP and opens the door to potential products like a spot XRP ETF , which analysts say has a 95% chance of approval before October. Following the news, XRP surged more than 12% , reaffirming investor optimism and signaling a broader shift toward altcoin risk appetite. But while XRP may lead the news cycle, many insiders are pointing elsewhere for the next major rally. MAGACOIN FINANCE Rise as Ripple Win Triggers Market Rally As the altcoin market regains strength, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now emerging as a standout. Analysts suggest that in the wake of Ripple’s legal victory, projects that combine community governance , cultural relevance , and narrative strength could see exponential growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE fits that profile perfectly. Described as a decentralized political memecoin , MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t just another speculative asset—it’s a movement powered by ideology, community, and anti-centralisation values. On-chain data shows rising wallet growth, increased whale accumulation, and rapidly growing transaction volumes. With the token still trading below $1, experts believe MAGACOIN FINANCE offers one of the last entry points before a potential major breakout. Forecasts suggest the project could deliver gains as high as 13,900% in the upcoming market cycle. In the eyes of many analysts, MAGACOIN FINANCE now stands as the best altcoin to buy heading into late 2025. Broader Market Signals Turn Bullish After Ripple Win The end of the Ripple case is already impacting broader market dynamics. Confidence is rising across altcoins with strong fundamentals and legal clarity. While XRP continues to rise, attention is shifting toward tokens with strong communities and narrative momentum . Alongside MAGACOIN, other utility-focused tokens are gaining investor interest. But few match MAGACOIN’s combination of memetic energy, ideological appeal, and grassroots support—all factors that analysts say can drive virality and long-term engagement. Outlook: Altseason Momentum Building Fast With Bitcoin holding above $117,000 and Ethereum nearing $3,900 , institutional sentiment is strengthening across the board. President Trump’s recent executive order enabling crypto inclusion in retirement plans has further bolstered market stability. But as analysts scan the landscape for the best altcoin to buy , MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to top their lists. If the current momentum holds, this meme-powered altcoin could be the breakout story of the post-Ripple market.

The FIRE movement (Financial Independence, Retire Early) has found a new ally in cryptocurrency, where explosive returns can significantly outperform traditional portfolios. While the risk is high, so is the potential reward—and that’s exactly what draws a new wave of early retirement seekers to this path. A balanced FIRE plan might typically focus on low-cost index funds, real estate, or dividend stocks. But crypto enthusiasts have flipped the script, betting on digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum to act as growth engines that outperform legacy systems. Within this evolving playbook, emerging altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE are attracting attention as high-upside additions to early-stage portfolios, especially for those looking to maximize gains before broader adoption. Crypto FIRE Strategy: How It Works Rather than relying on slow and steady compounding over decades, a crypto-centric FIRE strategy places calculated bets on faster-moving assets. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) typically form the foundation due to their long-term track records and institutional backing. But for meaningful upside, investors allocate to altcoins with high growth potential and strong communities behind them. Projects in sectors like DeFi, GameFi, and infrastructure tokens round out the strategy, aiming to catch early-stage growth before prices explode. Success depends not just on what you invest in, but how you invest—employing tactics like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) to reduce emotional decision-making and mitigate volatility. Periodic rebalancing is key, especially after sharp market movements. Selling partial gains from top performers and reinvesting in undervalued tokens can maintain healthy risk exposure while banking profits. For U.S. investors, self-directed crypto IRAs can also unlock long-term tax benefits that make early retirement even more achievable. Why This New Altcoin is Gaining Traction With Early Retirees For those chasing big returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being called one of the best altcoins to watch right now. Experts estimate it could deliver a 67x ROI in the upcoming market run, citing its rapidly expanding user base, early-stage growth potential, and structured presale phases that reward early participation. Unlike meme coins with no clear path forward, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building out a full ecosystem of utility, staking, and community-driven development. As momentum builds, comparisons are being made to the early days of breakout tokens like SHIBA INU—but with a clearer roadmap and increasing support from long-term crypto investors. With investor demand rising fast and current rounds selling out quicker each time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming a favorite for those looking to retire early with a bold, high-growth strategy. The Path to Early Retirement Early retirement through crypto isn’t guaranteed—but with the right portfolio, the right mindset, and a commitment to long-term strategies like DCA and rebalancing, it’s more possible than ever. For investors looking beyond the mainstream cryptocurrencies that have already established themselves, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE offer the kind of upside that could supercharge a portfolio and turn calculated risk into real wealth .

Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) has posted steady fundraising alongside rising attention for BTC Layer-2 projects, though it’s still early. Maxi Doge (MAXI) has caught eyes with its meme appeal, but its staying power remains uncertain. Then there’s BlockDAG (BDAG) , surging past $367 million in its presale, holding its price at $0.0016 with a countdown that’s drawing serious attention. With the GLOBAL LAUNCH Release set, the tone feels different. For those tracking crypto presales this year, these three offer a telling picture, but one appears to be sprinting toward something bigger. Bitcoin Hyper Update: Layer-2 Project Building Visibility Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) is seeing increased attention among BTC-related altcoins, with its presale approaching $7 million. Built as a Layer-2 network using the Solana Virtual Machine, the project’s goal is to bring programmability to Bitcoin without changing its core layer. Some analysts have noted the recent rise in presale participation, but long-term adoption is still unclear. The early traction seems driven more by speculative interest and influencer discussions than by proven use cases. The coming months will be the real test of Bitcoin Hyper’s ability to move from concept to sustained growth. Maxi Doge Price Prediction: Meme Appeal Faces Reality Check Maxi Doge (MAXI) has generated excitement in early presale stages, raising over $397K so far. Its branding mixes a fitness theme with Shiba Inu imagery, focusing more on entertainment than utility. Current forecasts remain speculative, with near-term targets suggesting a post-presale price of $0.0002745. Bullish estimates point to $0.001 by 2025, and a highly optimistic $0.02 by 2030. However, without confirmed exchange listings or strong technical foundations, the coin’s future hinges heavily on its ability to keep viral interest alive beyond its launch window. BlockDAG’s GLOBAL LAUNCH Release Approaches: Final Window at $0.0016 Time is running out for BlockDAG’s presale, with the GLOBAL LAUNCH Release locked for August 11. While this isn’t the official listing date, it is a turning point for the project. Buyers still have access to the frozen $0.0016 price, but that window is closing fast. Once the countdown ends, the price will shift to the Batch 29 level of $0.0276, and if that batch sells out early, it could climb again before hitting the $0.05 listing price. From the current entry point to launch, the potential return stands at 3,025%, with gains of 2,660% already locked from Batch 1 to Batch 29. These figures are rare in late-stage presales, adding urgency to the final days. BlockDAG has already raised over $367 million, sold 24.8 billion coins, and more than 19,000 crypto miners, making it the largest presale in the current crypto market. Analysts remain confident in its trajectory, forecasting a path to $1 soon after launch, with longer-term targets of $5 and even $10. For anyone tracking crypto presales in 2025, this is the last major low entry point before prices shift permanently. The GLOBAL LAUNCH Release is not just another milestone; it is the trigger event that will redefine BDAG’s market position and set the stage for its next phase of growth. Which Projects Will Hold Their Ground? Bitcoin Hyper, Maxi Doge, and BlockDAG have each found an audience. Yet, not all are equally positioned for lasting relevance. Bitcoin Hyper benefits from the BTC narrative, but its real adoption remains a question mark. Maxi Doge may attract quick attention, though meme appeal without depth often fades fast. BlockDAG’s track record stands apart. With $367 million raised, 24.8 billion coins sold, and a GLOBAL LAUNCH Release ending the $0.0016 price lock on August 11, it offers the largest upside window in the 2025 presale space. In a market where excitement often outpaces results, BlockDAG’s momentum is supported by both scale and measurable progress.

The Tron(TRX) price forecast leans slightly positive as large wallets collect over 1.3 billion tokens, but a move past $0.34 needs more support. The XRP price drop has drawn more concern. A sharp selloff cleared $358 million in leveraged trades, pushing XRP below $2.92 and revealing fragile positions in the process. These two assets show a sense of uncertainty. Cold Wallet (CWT) , however, is showing different momentum. Its presale has already raised $5.8 million, with more than 691 million tokens sold. From its Stage 1 price to today’s $0.00998, the price has climbed 34.5%. With a confirmed launch price of $0.3517, that points to a return of 3,633%. Many are no longer waiting on the sidelines. Tron(TRX) Price Forecast: Will Momentum Break the Barrier? Tron (TRX) is trading close to $0.33, showing some stability even as the market trends lower. The recent buildup of over 1.3 billion TRX in whale wallets has sparked new attention toward the Tron(TRX) price forecast, adding a layer of interest among analysts. If TRX can push past the $0.34 barrier, it might open a path toward $0.40 and perhaps even $0.48. Still, not everything supports that climb. The Money Flow Index is trailing the price move, hinting that overall market liquidity is still lacking. For the Tron(TRX) price forecast to stay strong, bulls need to hold the $0.32 level and close the week with momentum. Sudden XRP Price Drop Follows Large-Scale Liquidations XRP has seen more downward action this week. A wave of leveraged liquidations caused a quick 3% fall, marking the beginning of a sharp XRP price drop. XRP briefly dipped to $2.80, made a short recovery, then fell again by 4% on Tuesday, staying below $2.92. The selloff was triggered by a long-short imbalance of 7,676%, which resulted in $358 million in liquidations. The XRP price drop broke through key support levels, and even though the price bounced off its 50-day EMA, tools like RSI and MACD still show weak buying pressure. Traders are staying cautious, watching for clearer signals. Cold Wallet Presale Demand Surges as ROI Gap Shrinks Cold Wallet’s presale is drawing rare attention in crypto, where the gains are both clear and trackable. Starting at $0.007 in Stage 1 and now at $0.00998 in Stage 17, the token has climbed 34.5% in just days. But with the launch price fixed at $0.3517, a 3,633% return is still possible. Momentum is only picking up. Over $5.8 million has been raised, and 691 million tokens have been bought already. Each stage brings more participants, cutting the upside with each new entry. Traders are responding quickly to the project’s value-driven design. Cold Wallet goes beyond storage. It builds returns from usage. Swaps, bridges, and even gas fees feed back into the system, rewarding users in CWT, the token at its core. The idea of recovering value from everyday transactions is striking a chord. With presale stages closing fast and the ROI margin shrinking, the longer someone waits, the less room remains to catch the full upside. Which Is the Top Trending Crypto Today? Tension is building in the market right now. The Tron(TRX) price forecast holds near $0.33, boosted by 1.3 billion TRX scooped up by whale wallets, but follow-through is uncertain. Bulls need a strong finish to the week to keep the move alive. Meanwhile, a steep XRP price drop followed a 3% decline driven by $358 million in forced liquidations. XRP now trades under $2.92, and weak buy signals suggest traders remain cautious for good reason. In the middle of this caution, Cold Wallet is standing out as a top trending crypto . It has raised $5.8 million, sold 691 million tokens, and locked in a 34.5% presale price jump. The remaining 3,633% ROI isn’t just a number, it’s one of the last setups with visible upside that’s fading by the day.

Elon Musk’s Net Worth as the Benchmark As of August 1, 2025, Forbes places Elon Musk’s net worth at approximately $401.2 billion, reaffirming his position as the world’s richest individual. This figure serves as the reference point for calculating how much XRP one would require to exceed Elon Musk’s fortune at a $10,000 valuation per coin. XRP Supply and the Market Capitalization Implications XRP’s current circulating supply is roughly 59.3 billion tokens, with a maximum total supply of 100 billion. At a hypothetical price of $10,000 per token, the circulating market capitalization would surge to around $593 trillion. THE #XRP SURGE IS HERE! pic.twitter.com/TUW6f9PDdR — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) August 9, 2025 On a fully diluted basis, the figure would approach $1 quadrillion. For perspective, these amounts are many times larger than the total global GDP, underscoring the sheer economic improbability of such valuations. Breaking Down the Calculation Dividing Musk’s estimated $401.2 billion net worth by $10,000 per XRP results in approximately 40.12 million XRP needed to surpass his wealth. Levi’s cited figure of 50 million XRP, while slightly higher, offers a rounded and rhetorically impactful estimate suitable for social media discussion. Practical and Liquidity Constraints Even setting aside the implausible market capitalization, acquiring tens of millions of XRP at or near a $10,000 valuation would be virtually impossible in practice. The act of purchasing such a vast quantity would cause extreme market slippage, diminish liquidity, and deter market makers from participating. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 In addition, Ripple’s programmed escrow releases regularly inject more XRP into circulation, making the token’s available supply dynamic and unpredictable. These realities further diminish the feasibility of the scenario Levi describes. Final Assessment Levi’s statement—“You would need a 50 million XRP to be wealthier than Elon Musk if XRP hits $10,000 per coin”—is an engaging thought experiment and a testament to the aspirational spirit within segments of the crypto community. However, when assessed through the lens of updated net worth figures, current XRP supply data, and macroeconomic constraints, it becomes clear that the premise is far removed from practical financial reality. While the discussion fuels the imagination of XRP enthusiasts, it ultimately serves as a reminder that sound investment decisions should be grounded in verifiable facts and realistic market conditions.

49829348,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=782085,1754784814,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/49829348.jpeg,Elon Musk’s Tesla seeks to enter UK energy market,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/tesla-uk-energy-market/,"Elon Musk’s Tesla plans to enter the UK household energy market soon, challenging major providers like Octopus Energy and British Gas. Official documents show that on July 25, Tesla submitted an application to the UK energy regulator, Ofgem. According to Telegraph , the company requested permission to supply electricity to domestic customers. The filing, signed by Andrew Payne signals a notable step forward in the company’s expansion plans. If approved, “Tesla Electric” could begin serving customers as soon as next year. The new service is expected to work hand in hand with Tesla’s existing products, such as its electric vehicles and Powerwall battery units, with the goal of cutting household power expenses. Tesla already operates a comparable program in Texas, where customers can benefit from cheaper charging rates for their cars and earn payments for sending unused solar-generated or battery-stored electricity back to the grid. Reports from 2023 indicated Tesla’s intent to enter the home energy market, alongside recruitment campaigns for policy and operational roles. With tens of thousands of Powerwall batteries already installed in Britain, devices that can store energy from solar panels or off-peak charging, Tesla holds an infrastructure advantage. Moreover, Tesla offers residential EV charging equipment and has over 250,000 cars on UK roads. This network could be key to rolling out “vehicle-to-home” systems, where a car’s battery can supply power to the household. Several other providers are trialling this type of technology, which Tesla could incorporate. Tesla is also active in wholesale energy trading, using large-scale battery facilities and its Autobidder platform to buy and sell stored power. The company has held an Ofgem generation licence since 2020. Even so, the brand faces headwinds. UK sales of Tesla’s electric cars have dropped sharply, with July showing a 60% year-on-year decline, a trend echoed in other European markets, such as Germany, where deliveries fell over 55% . The slump reflects stiffer EV market competition and controversies linked to Musk, including his public support for political figures like Donald Trump and Tommy Robinson. Tesla is facing persistent sales slump in Europe Analysts note that even Musk’s recent efforts to distance himself from politics have not reversed the European sales downturn, with Tesla registering five consecutive months of falling deliveries across the continent. In the US, the company offers a fixed-rate plan for unlimited vehicle charging during certain time windows. Powerwall owners can also link their units to the grid, allowing Tesla to tap into stored energy at peak times in exchange for payments. This setup, known as a “virtual power plant,” combines small-scale energy sources to help stabilise renewable supply. Although the company hasn’t yet outlined pricing or specific plans for the UK, job postings point to virtual power plant integration as a key feature. The system would capture excess wind and solar power when available, then release it back to the grid during demand surges. Tesla previously joined forces with Octopus Energy in 2020 for a combined energy tariff but ended that collaboration three years later to operate independently. It still works with Octopus so Powerwall owners can use the latter’s software to sell stored power at premium times. Approval for an Ofgem electricity supply licence can take up to nine months, though in some cases the process is quicker. Rules have become stricter since the 2021 energy market crisis, when multiple small suppliers collapsed. Tesla has not applied for a licence to supply gas, so households using both fuels will still need a separate gas provider.

While the crypto market remains unpredictable, those who identified breakout projects early in the past cycles saw life-changing returns. With the rise of institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and emerging sectors like AI and modular blockchains, the stage is set for a new generation of crypto leaders. While many will come and go, a handful of projects show the right mix of utility, innovation, and momentum to deliver massive potential by the end of the decade. Among these rising stars, MAGACOIN FINANCE has also drawn attention as a bold newcomer, with market watchers comparing its trajectory to some of the most explosive altcoins in history. Lets have a look at five cryptocurrencies that experts say could surge more than 20x by 2030, based on current momentum and forward-looking potential. 1. XRP XRP continues to be one of the most polarizing but promising cryptocurrencies on the market. Its main value proposition – enabling fast, low-cost cross-border payments – remains a major use case in the evolving financial system. What Could Drive Growth by 2030: Regulatory Win: The long-awaited conclusion of Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC could unleash new institutional capital flows into XRP. ODL Expansion: Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) services could become essential for global finance, positioning XRP as a bridge asset between major fiat currencies. Tokenized Finance Boom: As tokenized assets gain ground, XRP’s speed and low fees may make it a top pick for RWA transfers. Some conservative models place XRP in the $5–$10 range by 2030, but a scenario involving full institutional adoption and widespread utility could push it far beyond those levels. 2. Cardano Built on peer-reviewed research and a strong academic foundation, Cardano has steadily grown into one of the most respected Layer 1 platforms. Key Factors for Long-Term Potential: Hydra Scaling : Hydra, Cardano’s Layer 2 solution, aims to drastically improve throughput – essential for large-scale dApp deployment. Use Cases in Developing Nations: Cardano’s partnerships in Africa and other emerging markets could lead to real-world adoption across education, identity, and finance. DeFi and Governance Expansion: A robust ecosystem of DeFi projects and a community-driven governance model position ADA for steady long-term value growth. If Cardano captures just a fraction of global enterprise and government applications, ADA’s price could surge well past its previous highs – and potentially achieve the 20x target. 3. Celestia Celestia is pioneering a new way to build blockchains through its modular architecture, and it’s already become a favorite among developers looking to launch rollup-based systems. Why It’s a Game-Changer: Modular Design: Separating consensus from execution allows developers to build faster, cheaper, and more flexible chains. Rollup Ecosystem: As Ethereum and other blockchains move toward rollup-centric models, Celestia could become a foundational layer for data availability. Early Mover Advantage: Being one of the first major players in the modular blockchain space gives Celestia a potential lead similar to Ethereum’s early dominance. With the entire industry leaning toward modular scaling, TIA could be one of the few infrastructure tokens to achieve a 20x+ return, especially if it becomes the default data layer for rollups and app chains. 4. MAGACOIN FINANCE MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly establishing itself as one of the most promising altcoins for forward-looking investors. With growing hype and multiple sell-out rounds, it’s drawing comparisons to early-stage breakout stars like SHIBA INU and DOGECOIN – but with a far more structured ecosystem behind it. Unlike typical meme coins, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building long-term utility and tokenomics aimed at rewarding early holders. Analysts now project up to a 12,700% return for early MAGACOIN investors as the next bull cycle picks up momentum. The project’s strong presale performance, continuous development, and viral growth on social media suggest it’s far from a short-term trend. If MAGACOIN hits centralized exchanges at the right time and continues building its ecosystem, it could outpace traditional large caps like XRP and SOL – giving early participants a rare opportunity to get in before the wider crypto market catches on. 5. Virtuals Protocol As artificial intelligence continues to dominate tech headlines, Virtuals Protocol is emerging as a key intersection point between AI and blockchain. What Makes It Stand Out: AI Agent Platform: Virtuals allows developers to build and monetize AI agents on-chain – one of the most exciting new frontiers in crypto. Ethereum Layer-2 : Built on Base, it benefits from Ethereum’s security while offering cheaper, faster transactions. Rapid Ecosystem Expansion : If it can become the leading AI agent platform in crypto, VRS could ride both the AI and Web3 waves simultaneously. While still early-stage, the protocol’s vision and positioning have drawn attention from developers and early investors alike. If AI becomes as integral to crypto as many predict, Virtuals Protocol could easily become a 20x winner by the end of the decade. Conclusion The path to 2030 will be filled with volatility, but also opportunity. From legacy projects like XRP and Cardano to newer infrastructure plays like Celestia and Virtuals Protocol, the crypto space is rich with long-term potential. And for those seeking early exposure to a rapidly growing ecosystem, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out with its ambitious vision and projected 1 2,700% upside , making it a serious contender in the race to define the next generation of altcoins.

With millions of Americans contributing to this plan every two weeks, even a small allocation to Bitcoin could create a steady, long-term inflow of capital far exceeding the impact of spot Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). Related Reading: Crypto Is Here To Stay—Even The SEC Can’t Do Anything About It, Analyst Says Bitcoin To Break Into 401(k) Retirement Market Bitcoin’s possible entry into the US $12 trillion 401(k) investment options could represent one of the largest structural inflows in the asset’s history. Tom Dunleavy, the Head of Venture at Varys Capital and a former senior analyst at Messari, declared in an X social media post on August 7 that cryptocurrencies in the 401(k) retirement plan are much bigger and more bullish news than the ETFs. Dunleavy explained that the US currently has around 100 million Americans participating in the 401(k) plan, where a fixed portion of each paycheck is automatically invested into preselected portfolios of stock and bonds. These allocations are typically reviewed annually at most, creating a steady and predictable stream of capital into financial markets. Additionally, over the past two decades, this 401(k) plan has been a critical driver behind the resilience and long-term upward trajectory of US equities. According to Dunleavy, the total value of assets in the 401(k) plans stands at approximately $12 trillion, with around $50 billion in fresh contributions added every two weeks. The analyst suggested that even a small portfolio allocation to Bitcoin would represent significant and recurring inflows. He estimated that a 1% allocation translates to roughly $120 billion in continuous buying, 3% would equate to $360 billion, and 5% would reach a whopping $600 billion. Unlike one-time purchases, Dunleavy notes that these allocations could continue indefinitely once set, creating a persistent demand floor for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. He also compared the 401(k) plan to ETFs, claiming that cryptocurrencies within the investment pool could have a greater long-term impact than the launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Regulatory Backdrop And BTC’s Path To Adoption Dunleavy has indicated that the possible integration of Bitcoin into the 401(k) investment menus is closely tied to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). He noted that ERISA establishes fiduciary standards designed to protect participants’ interests and ensure they receive promised benefits. Under this framework, most fiduciary risk is borne by consultants, who advise plan sponsors on asset allocation and investment options. Related Reading: Ripple-SEC Legal Drama Ends; XRP Skyrockets 13% For over a decade, these consultants have been researching the cryptocurrency market, building the knowledge base and compliance structures necessary to justify a modest crypto allocation—typically ranging between 1% and 5% for pensions and potentially 401(k) participants. Until recently, structural and regulatory constraints meant crypto could not be directly offered as an investment choice. With those barriers potentially shifting, consultants now have both the regulatory cover and the research credibility to recommend adding Bitcoin to retirement plans.

While Betway, bet365, and Ladbrokes focus on revamping interfaces and expanding their bonuses, they still miss the mark on what matters most: fast access, open terms, and borderless features. Betway has improved cash-out tools, bet365 offers football bonuses, and Ladbrokes is upgrading its look, but all three platforms still operate within traditional boundaries that frustrate today’s global user base. In contrast, Spartans is reshaping how players engage with betting sites. With 5,963 games, fast crypto withdrawals, and clearly defined 35x wagering rules, it skips the noise and delivers results. There’s no need to install apps, no locked regions, and no fine print during withdrawals. While older brands like Betway, bet365, and Ladbrokes count on brand familiarity, Spartans makes performance the main attraction. This direct approach is what positions Spartans as a strong force in the race for the top gambling sites in 2025. Betway Has In-Play Strength but Slows Down on Early Payouts Betway has maintained its place in the UK’s betting sector thanks to consistent sponsorships and quality in-play tools. Its live cash-out feature is reliable and particularly useful for real-time football wagering. Bettors who enjoy tweaking their wagers during a live match will appreciate the control Betway provides. Yet, when it comes to early payout options, Betway falls behind its competitors. Its once-popular “You Lead, You Win” campaign across football and golf is currently unavailable, and there’s no word on when or if it will return. Betway typically revives these features seasonally, but for now, users will need to wait. The platform still offers competitive odds and a user-friendly mobile setup. However, its promotional offers don’t keep pace with crypto-first sites, and its slow banking withdrawals are outdated. In contrast to top gambling sites in 2025 like Spartans, which prioritize fast and borderless payouts, Betway hasn’t evolved fast enough to retain speed-focused users. bet365’s Features Are Solid, but Withdrawal Speed Lags bet365 continues to dominate with its betting variety, early payout promotions, and high-quality livestreams. Its “Two Goals Ahead” feature is especially appealing; if your football team leads by two goals, your bet gets settled as a win instantly. This early cash-out tool is one of the best, and it adds real value to football wagers. The site also boasts partial and full cash-out features, hundreds of football markets, and match streams weekly. It’s a platform made for scale and is reliable in its offerings. Yet, it misses out in areas where newer platforms excel. bet365 still leans on conventional withdrawal systems, which means users wait days to receive their winnings. The lack of crypto options and promotional limitations based on location frustrate modern players. When compared to top gambling sites in 2025 like Spartans, bet365’s strength in features is undermined by slower, outdated payout mechanisms. Ladbrokes Keeps the Basics but Fails to Advance As one of the oldest names in the UK betting scene, Ladbrokes continues to offer standard betting features such as football odds, live betting, and accumulator boosts. Its app interface is smooth and easy for both new and returning users. Yet, when judged against other platforms in 2025, Ladbrokes is missing key upgrades. It doesn’t offer early payout options, and there’s no sign that this will change. While welcome offers and occasional price boosts exist, they fail to stand out amid more competitive promotions elsewhere. Ladbrokes also sticks with bank transfers and debit cards, which are slower and less appealing compared to instant crypto options. Top gambling sites in 2025, like Spartans, are leaving platforms like Ladbrokes behind by making crypto payouts standard and eliminating delays. Spartans Builds Its Edge on Speed, Access, and Clarity Spartans has gained a top spot among the top gambling sites in 2025 by cutting out all the delays and delivering what players truly want. The site features 5,963+ games, a full sportsbook, live odds, and an upfront 35x wagering policy valid for 7 days. It removes all regional blocks, ensures no unclear bonus terms, and runs smoothly without any app installation. Its instant crypto withdrawal support, covering BTC, ETH, ADA, BNB, DAI, USDC, and USDT, is a major shift from standard banking delays. This feature alone pulls in users who value time and privacy. Spartans even adds unique promotions like its Lamborghini giveaway, boosting player excitement without relying on flashy tricks. Designed for mobile and desktop without compromising on speed or features, Spartans caters to modern betting expectations. While Betway, bet365, and Ladbrokes work on catching up, Spartans already delivers. No fluff, no clutter, just direct service. Among the top gambling sites in 2025, Spartans is shaping up as the go-to for crypto-friendly, clarity-driven play. Final Takeaway While Betway scores with live options, bet365 brings strong early payouts, and Ladbrokes holds legacy value, none of them provide the full package like Spartans. From 5,963 games to instant crypto withdrawals and honest bonus terms, Spartans addresses exactly what today’s bettors expect. In a year where speed, fairness, and global flexibility matter most, Spartans is setting the bar. For those seeking function over flash and instant access over drawn-out procedures, Spartans easily ranks among the top gambling sites in 2025 .

Instead of focusing only on trading volume or dominance, many are analyzing real value delivery and consistent returns. While Cardano keeps its positive trend and Polkadot shows technical strength, a different project is moving ahead quickly. Cold Wallet , now available on CoinMarketCap, brings cashback features and potential 4,900% returns for presale users, features that established coins currently lack. The question now is about value, not just reputation. Cold Wallet positions itself as the best crypto right now by offering actual benefits at a price below $0.01, showing a clear edge over slower-moving competitors. Cardano Maintains Positive Momentum Despite Recent Decline Cardano remains one of the key assets to watch in 2025. Despite a 5% price dip recently, ADA continues to hold steady above major support lines. Analysts note that the Cardano bullish trend still holds firm, supported by its growing fundamentals. Its DeFi sector shows consistent TVL growth, and updated staking data confirms ongoing user engagement. Though current market sentiment brings short-term selling, the broader trend remains encouraging. ADA price expectations range between $1.10 and $1.30, based on market stability and ongoing ecosystem development. This points to a 3x return potential from current price levels. Yet, interest is clearly rising in newer entries offering quicker returns. When placed next to Cold Wallet’s early-stage pricing and cashback benefits, ADA appears more conservative. For those targeting faster gains, Cardano may no longer qualify as the best crypto right now. Polkadot Charts Indicate Moderate Upside Toward $8 Polkadot’s current price is just over $4, showing resilience after recent turbulence. Latest Polkadot technical analysis places DOT at a key support range, with MACD and RSI indicators showing stable-to-positive trends. If it maintains this zone, analysts anticipate a possible move toward $6.50–$8 soon, suggesting a possible 2x return. Its network development continues at a steady pace, especially in cross-chain functions and parachain operations through XCM. Still, price growth remains modest, with rising competition from newer layer-1 networks limiting attention. Despite strong infrastructure and community, significant upward movement hinges on increased market activity. This steady pace is pushing some retail users to look elsewhere. Many are favoring options with immediate user benefits and strong growth outlooks. Cold Wallet’s cashback utility and its 50x projection now make it one of the top choices for those focusing on usability and fast gains. Cold Wallet: Transforming User Experience in Crypto Most crypto systems today create friction, charging users just to access their funds or interact on-chain. Cold Wallet is removing that barrier. Now listed on CoinMarketCap and priced at only $0.00998, it rewards user activity instead of penalizing it. Whether users transfer assets, pay gas or swap, they receive CWT rewards in return. The idea is simple: make self-custody not just secure, but also rewarding. Cold Wallet’s model offers up to 100% cashback in CWT along with a presale structure that favors early adopters. This makes each action on the network feel beneficial, not like a cost. Its framework is designed to expand: featuring 150 presale stages, currently in Stage 17, with an entry price still under $0.01 and a listing price projected at $0.3517. That means a 4,900% return is still within reach. With over 694 million coins already sold and presale funding now exceeding $5.8 million, momentum is undeniable. In contrast to the cautious tone of Polkadot technical analysis or the slow climb seen in the Cardano bullish trend, Cold Wallet is building pace rapidly. That’s why it’s increasingly seen as the best crypto right now for those prioritizing strong functionality and high upside. Final Takeaway Cardano maintains solid positioning, defending its support range and showing a potential 3x growth path. Polkadot also shows strength, with technical signs pointing to a climb toward $8. While both continue delivering, their growth is slow and steady. Cold Wallet introduces a different pace entirely. With a cashback model, simple self-custody, and verified listing on CoinMarketCap, it’s offering what others don’t. The possibility of a 50x ROI from current pricing, alongside a live presale still below $0.01, makes it a standout. For anyone seeking the best crypto right now that offers utility, growth, and momentum, Cold Wallet is setting the pace.

Tokens that offer long-term utility — whether through fast, scalable infrastructure or game-changing applications — are catching the attention of smart money and institutional players. Below are seven standout picks that analysts believe will dominate the next cycle, not just because of the narrative, but because of function. From household names to quietly rising stars, these tokens are poised for growth through real-world usage and technical strength. 1. Ethereum (ETH) – The King of Smart Contracts Ethereum continues to be the foundation of decentralized applications. With the success of Ethereum 2.0’s transition to Proof-of-Stake and a thriving Layer-2 ecosystem, ETH remains the top long-term utility asset for developers and institutions alike. 2. Solana (SOL) – Blazing-Fast & Growing Stronger Solana has shaken off its past outages and proven itself as a high-performance blockchain with incredibly low fees. With its adoption in real-world applications (like Visa payments), SOL is becoming the go-to chain for speed and scale. 3. Chainlink (LINK) – Data Feeds Powering DeFi Without Chainlink’s oracle network, DeFi would collapse. LINK’s real-world integrations with banks and legacy systems make it a top utility coin for 2025–2030. Its role is foundational for blockchain to connect with external data securely. 4. Polygon (MATIC) – Layer-2 With Mass Adoption Goals Polygon’s partnerships with companies like Starbucks, Reddit, and Nike prove it’s ready for mainstream use. As a Layer-2 on Ethereum, MATIC enables faster, cheaper transactions while keeping security high. 5. MAGACOIN FINANCE – Expert Forecasts Signal 65x Return Potential Analysts are increasingly watching MAGACOIN FINANCE — a rising altcoin currently in its presale phase. What makes it stand out isn’t just its meme-like energy, but its focus on building a utility-backed ecosystem from day one. Unlike most early-stage tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE has laid out a roadmap centered on long-term usability: staking, governance, and real-world integration. Whale tracking platforms have even flagged high-volume MAGACOIN wallet activity in the past 14 days — a strong early signal that smart money is positioning early. With experts projecting up to 65x ROI for early investors, MAGACOIN FINANCE is shaping up to be a breakout utility coin, not just another meme. 6. Avalanche (AVAX) – Enterprise + DeFi Hybrid Avalanche offers near-instant transaction finality and customizable subnets, making it a favorite for enterprises and DeFi builders alike. Its unique consensus mechanism positions it as one of the most scalable platforms available. 7. Cosmos (ATOM) – Interoperability Pioneer Cosmos is quietly enabling a more connected blockchain world. With its Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, ATOM is helping diverse blockchains work together — a feature that could be critical in the next crypto cycle. Conclusion: Betting on Utility Is the Smart Play This isn’t 2021 anymore — investors are no longer chasing hype alone. As we approach Q4 2025, more crypto holders are looking at utility, scalability, and real-world application as long-term indicators of success. From dominant players like Ethereum and Solana to emerging forces like MAGACOIN FINANCE, these 7 projects offer more than just price action — they offer relevance, adoption, and real value. If the bull market momentum holds, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be this cycle’s surprise success story. With expert forecasts predicting a potential 65x surge, it’s one for every long-term watchlist.
