The order sets strict limits on when banks can refuse to serve lawful businesses, including crypto firms. The order also introduces an independent overseer to ensure compliance. The move has sparked debate in the crypto and financial community. Some see it as the end of “Operation Choke Point 2.0.” Others are waiting to see if the order will truly restore accounts to crypto companies that were previously debanked. Caitlin Long on Independent Watchdog for Crypto Debanking Issues In a recent X post , Custodia Bank founder and CEO Caitlin Long spotlighted these new changes. She said the creation of an independent overseer is the most significant part of the executive order. President Trump appointed Kelly Loeffler, a former U.S. senator, pro-Bitcoin, to oversee the compliance of the order. Her role is to monitor debanking activities outside of the control of the three main banking regulators. This includes the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Federal Reserve (Fed), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). Before entering politics, Loeffler was CEO of Bakkt, an institutional Bitcoin futures platform. Her appointment proves that the current administration wants someone with deep knowledge of the crypto industry in a position of authority. Concerns About Political Bias in the Banking Sector Long said the decision to put the Small Business Administration (SBA) in charge shows a lack of confidence in traditional banking regulators. She added that it signals doubt about those agencies’ willingness to address political bias. Long notes that political leanings among Fed and FDIC staff may have influenced past actions. She pointed out that in 2024, up to 92% of their political donations went to Democratic candidates. Critics worry that such biases may have shaped regulatory decisions. It was noted that during the Biden administration, many crypto-related firms faced scrutiny . Some were even cut off from banking services despite following all legal requirements. Custodia Bank itself was cut off from several banking partners after regulators pressured them, despite having a clean compliance record. Protection for All Lawful Businesses, Not Just Crypto The executive order focuses on protecting lawful business activities instead of naming specific industries. This means banks cannot refuse services simply because a company operates in crypto , as long as the company follows the law. The rule also protects other lawful businesses that could face discrimination for political reasons. Caitlin Long believes the success of the order will depend on its practical results. If banks that previously shut out lawful crypto firms are compelled to reopen their accounts, the order will have achieved its goal. For now, the crypto sector is watching closely to see whether Trump’s debanking order leads to real change. Some fear it could become another unfulfilled promise in the long battle for fair banking access.

According to technical analysis, Dogecoin’s recent price action has opened up a pathway to $1 that’s becoming increasingly visible if some conditions are met. Particularly, technical analysis by crypto analyst MMBTtrader on the TradingView platform outlines a bullish setup that formed after a decisive Dogecoin price breakout from a long-term downtrend channel on the 3-day candlestick chart. Related Reading: Crypto Is Here To Stay—Even The SEC Can’t Do Anything About It, Analyst Says Downtrend Channel Breakout And Retest Complete As shown in the 3-day candlestick price chart below, which was initially shared by MMBTtrader, Dogecoin broke above a descending parallel channel on July 15. This breakout is significant because it represents a shift in market structure from sustained selling pressure to an expansion phase from a channel that had contained its price action since late 2024. However, after breaking out of this channel in mid-July, Dogecoin kicked off a correction path on July 21 that saw it reach down towards the upper trendline of the descending channel again. As noted by the analyst, this move allowed Dogecoin to successfully retest the breakout zone, which is a move he sees as confirmation that bulls have regained control. Notably, the 0.61 Fibonacci retracement level appears as a key pivot point where Dogecoin’s price action eventually found strong support. This support was around the $0.188 price low on August 2, where it bounced upwards and has closed three bullish 3-day candles since then. MMBTtrader interpreted these candles as a healthy signal, suggesting that over-leveraged long positions have already been flushed out, and Dogecoin’s price action is now in a more stable state for a strong upside move. Dogecoin Will Reach $1 When This Happens Now that Dogecoin seems to have bounced from its retest of the descending trendline, the analyst highlighted some targets on the way to $1. The first price target is $0.32, which aligns with the 0.236 Fibonacci resistance and acted as a strong support level in December 2024. As such, breaching this level would represent a decisive break above a support-turned-resistance situation. One of the most important observations in the analysis is the $0.40 resistance level, which is marked on the chart with a prominent red horizontal zone. According to MMBTtrader, a clean break above $0.40 would shift Dogecoin into what he calls an “extremely bullish” phase. A breakout above $0.40 would unlock upside potential and push Dogecoin to new price territories above its current all-time high of $0.73. Particularly, the projection is that of a move to $0.75 and the most-coveted $1 price level.

According to data from CoinGecko, the altcoin is one of the top gainers amongst the large-cap assets, with its value up by double digits in the last seven days. Interestingly, the XRP price seems to only be at the beginning of what looks like an even broader upward trend. This positive setup is even more supported by rapidly improving fundamentals of cryptocurrencies globally, but especially in the United States. Why XRP Surged 630% And 54% In Its Last Two Major Rallies In an August 8 post on X, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez painted an exciting bullish picture for the XRP price. According to the online pundit, the latest on-chain indications are that the XRP token is about to embark on an extended bullish rally over the next few months. This positive projection revolves around unique movements of the MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) Ratio, which assesses whether a cryptocurrency (XRP, in this case) is overvalued or not. Martinez noted that the altcoin could be back on its bullish tracks following a golden cross between the MVRV ratio and its 200-day simple moving average (SMA). Typically, a golden cross refers to a bullish signal in technical analysis where a short-term moving average (MVRV ratio) crosses from below a long-term moving average (200-day moving average). What’s more interesting is the performance of XRP price the last two times this golden cross occurred. According to the latest on-chain data, the last two times the MVRV ratio flashed this golden cross, the price of XRP surged by 630% and 54%, respectively. If history is anything to go by, the reappearance of this signal could open the doors to an extended rally for the third-largest cryptocurrency. There is no question that the improving climate for cryptocurrencies in the United States could provide an enabling environment to sustain a significant bull run for the XRP token. Moreover, the shout of an altcoin season beginning further gives credence to the potential of XRP’s price witnessing exponential growth in the next few months. XRP Price At A Glance As of this writing, the value of XRP stands at around $3.31, with a 0.7% decline in the past 24 hours. This past day’s action is not a strong reflection of the altcoin’s performance on the weekly timeframe. According to data from CoinGecko, the XRP price jumped by more than 10% to reclaim the $3 mark over the past week.

The incident, which took place on Tuesday evening, August 5, is the latest in a growing pattern of crypto-related crimes in France. Details Of The Attack According to local media reports, the incident began at around 7:15 p.m. at the Peninsula Hotel, a luxury establishment located on Avenue Kléber in Paris’s 16th arrondissement. Hotel staff alerted the police after witnessing five unknown men approach one of their guests and demand, “Give us 400,000 euros, and it’s over.” The victim was then forcibly taken from the hotel to an area near the Arc de Triomphe, where he was physically assaulted. Officers from the anti-crime brigade quickly responded and arrested all five suspects in the 8th arrondissement. Initial investigations revealed that the group may be connected to a nearby nightclub, where the victim allegedly owed €40,000. Police believes the suspects were attempting to collect that debt by force. The victim was briefly interviewed by authorities and said he had been beaten and threatened. He reported that the attackers took his iPhone 13 Pro Max and a hard drive containing Bitcoin worth around €2 million. He added that a previous incident had occurred the week before, during which the same individuals had displayed a weapon. The suspects were taken into custody at the First District Police headquarters for extortion. During the night, investigators from the Anti-Banditism Brigade took over the case. The Paris prosecutor’s office confirmed that five people were in custody and that investigations and hearings are ongoing. Crypto Crime in Paris on the Rise This isn’t the first time Paris has made the headlines for crypto-related crime. The country has endured a series of violent kidnappings targeting individuals in the industry. The most recent case happened in May and involved a failed attempt by a masked gang to abduct relatives of the co-founder of French Bitcoin exchange Paynium. Twenty five suspects were later indicted for the failed abduction. Another incident saw the father of a crypto millionaire being hijacked while walking their dog. David Balland, co-founder of Ledger, and his wife were also taken from their home in France in January, with French special forces rescuing the couple after a 58-hour ordeal. The operation led to multiple arrests, including individuals with prior crypto-related convictions. Both cases involved a ransom demand, with the victims being released with missing fingers.

Nvidia Corp., currently valued at close to $4.5 trillion , holds the position as the world’s most valuable business, while AI innovators such as OpenAI and Anthropic have secured funding worth tens of billions of dollars. But beyond the enthusiasm, investors are preparing for market shifts on a scale not seen since the early days of the web, according to Bloomberg . Many are repositioning their investments away from companies seen as exposed to artificial intelligence, driven competition, anticipating a drop in demand for their offerings as the technology becomes more prevalent. Website-creation platform Wix.com Ltd., stock-image supplier Shutterstock Incorporated, and software producer Adobe Incorporated are among 26 businesses identified by Bank of America as being in the highest-risk category. Since mid-May, this collection has trailed the S&P 500 Index by about 22 percentage points, after previously moving mostly in line with the market since ChatGPT first appeared in late 2022. “The disruption is real,” said Daniel Newman, CEO of the Futurum Group. “We thought it would happen over five years. It seems like it is going to happen over two. Service-based businesses with a high headcount are going to be really vulnerable.” Although no major business collapses have yet been tied directly to artificial intelligence, software that can program, handle complex questions, and produce imagery or videos is beginning to challenge older business approaches. With firms such as Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. committing hundreds of billions to AI development, the competitive strain is building. Wix.com and Shutterstock have both seen their share prices drop more than 33% this year, compared with an 8.6% increase for the S&P 500. Adobe’s stock is down 23% as investors worry customers may turn to AI for making images, like Coca-Cola did in an ad campaign. The nervousness extends past the creative and staffing industries. Gartner Incorporated’s shares sank 30% last week, the steepest one-week drop in its history, after it cut its yearly revenue forecast. While Gartner pointed to U.S. policy shifts such as budget cuts and tariffs, some analysts suggested that AI could offer less expensive alternatives to its research services. Morgan Stanley said the update “added fuel to the AI disruption case,” and Baird noted heightened concerns about AI’s influence. Gartner did not respond. Not every business on AI’s path is struggling Technology has a long history of displacing older markets, from telegraphs replaced by telephones to Blockbuster losing out to Netflix. Adam Sarhan, CEO of 50 Park Investments, said, “Any company where you’re paying someone to do something that AI can do faster and cheaper will be wiped out, think graphic design, administrative work, data analysis.” Duolingo Inc., despite competition from AI translation systems, has doubled its share price over the last year after boosting its 2025 revenue guidance, thanks in part to its own AI-powered tools. Still, questions linger over how sustainable such growth will be. The gap between stock market winners and laggards has widened considerably in 2025. Earlier this year, low-cost AI products from China raised doubts about U.S. dominance, but instead of slowing their efforts, large tech players have expanded their budgets. Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet Inc., and Amazon.com Inc. are forecast to invest roughly $350 billion in total capital spending this fiscal year, almost 50% higher than the prior year, largely to expand AI infrastructure. This surge has benefited companies like Nvidia, whose processors drive most AI systems. Determining which enterprises are most at risk isn’t always simple. Alphabet, a leader in AI development, still appears on Bank of America’s high-risk roster, in part because it must defend its stronghold in online search. In other cases, the risk is clearer: advertising giant Omnicom Group Inc. has dropped 15% this year, and WPP Plc has plummeted over 50%, amid reports that Meta aims to fully automate ad creation.

Other major asset classes have posted more modest gains, with emerging market stocks (VWO) up 15.6%, the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) up 12.7% and U.S. large caps (SPY) rising 9.4%. Meanwhile, U.S. mid caps (MDY) and small caps (IWM) 0.2% have only gained 0.8%, respectively. This marks the first time gold and bitcoin have occupied the top two positions in Bilello’s annual asset class rankings since records began. 2011–2025 Cumulative returns Over the longer term, bitcoin has delivered an extraordinary 38,897,420% total return since 2011 — a figure that dwarfs all other asset classes in the dataset. Gold’s 126% cumulative return over the same period puts it in the middle of the pack, trailing equity benchmarks like the Nasdaq 100 (1101%) and U.S. large caps (559%), as well as mid caps (316%), small caps (244%) and emerging market stocks (57%). Based on Bilello’s figures, bitcoin’s total return has exceeded gold’s by more than 308,000 times over the past 14 years. 2011–2025 Annualized returns When measured on an annualized basis, bitcoin’s dominance is equally clear. The flagship cryptocurrency has delivered a 141.7% average annual gain since 2011, compared with 5.7% for gold, 18.6% for the Nasdaq 100, 13.8% for U.S. large caps and 4.4% to 16.4% for other major equity and real estate indexes. Gold’s long-term stability has made it a valuable hedge in certain market cycles, but its pace of appreciation has been far slower than bitcoin’s exponential climb. Gold vs. bitcoin, according to Peter Brandt Renowned trader Peter Brandt weighed in on Aug. 8, contrasting gold’s merits as a store of value with bitcoin’s potential to surpass all fiat alternatives. “Some think gold is a great store of value — and it is. But the ultimate store of value will prove to be bitcoin,” he said on X, sharing a long-term chart of the U.S. dollar’s purchasing power. His comments echo the growing narrative that bitcoin’s scarcity and decentralization make it uniquely positioned to outperform traditional hedges over time. Technical Analysis Highlights According to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model, between Aug. 8 at 21:00 UTC and Aug. 9 at 20:00 UTC, bitcoin traded within a $1,534.42 range (1.31%) from $116,352.52 to $117,886.44. Price opened near $116,900 and moved sideways before surging during Asian hours, climbing from $116,440 to $117,886 between 05:00 UTC and 10:00 UTC on Aug. 9, with 24-hour trading volume exceeding 9,000 BTC during these intervals. Strong buying emerged near $116,420 at 05:00 UTC, while selling pressure intensified around the $117,886 high. Bitcoin closed the session at $116,517, down 0.32% from the open, with defined support at $116,400–$116,500 and resistance at $117,400–$117,900 In the final hour of the analysis period (Aug. 9, 19:06–20:05 UTC), bitcoin remained under downward pressure within a $195.11 band, sliding from $116,629.40 to $116,519.29 (-0.09%). The largest final-hour volume spike occurred at 19:27 UTC, when 296.43 BTC changed hands as price tested $116,547 support. Recovery attempts were repeatedly capped near $116,600–$116,713, in line with earlier intraday resistance.

Those who recognized its promise reaped massive rewards as the token skyrocketed in value. Today, seasoned crypto investors are drawing similar comparisons to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a project that is quietly building one of the strongest presales in the DeFi space. What sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart is not just the current price of $0.035 during its Phase 6 presale but the solid foundation of real-world utility, a carefully designed ecosystem, and a highly secure architecture validated by a CertiK audit. Strong Growth, Clear Roadmap, and Real Utility Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already attracted more than 15,000 holders, raising upwards of $14.25 million in its current presale phase. With 15% of its tokens sold at the $0.035 price point, the momentum behind MUTM is unmistakable. Investors who entered during the very first phase at $0.01 have experienced a substantial 250% return. Looking ahead, the token is expected to list at $0.06, positioning these early supporters for an impressive sixfold return on their initial investment before broader exchange listings even take place. The project’s roadmap offers a clear vision of what lies ahead. While significant elements of Phase 1, such as the presale launch, marketing efforts, and the CertiK smart contract audit (which earned an excellent score of 95), are completed, much of the platform’s core infrastructure is still in development. Smart contract enhancements, full frontend and backend integration, regulatory compliance, and the beta launch are all forthcoming milestones. Additionally, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing for exchange listings and multi-chain deployments, which will further expand its reach and utility. Stablecoin, Dual Lending and Security One of the most innovative features on the horizon is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s stablecoin. This stablecoin will operate on an overcollateralized model, meaning users will be able to mint it only by borrowing against trusted crypto assets like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH). The stablecoin’s price stability will be maintained through governance-controlled interest rates that automatically adjust based on market demand. Arbitrage mechanisms will also come into play, ensuring the stablecoin remains tightly pegged to $1. These dynamic controls will balance supply and demand to preserve the token’s value in volatile markets. Adding further incentive, users will be able to stake mtTokens—interest-bearing tokens received when lending into the platform’s pools—in designated smart contracts. mtToken stakers will earn rewards in MUTM tokens sourced from protocol-generated revenues. In the future, a portion of this revenue will be used to buy back MUTM tokens from the open market, creating a sustainable value cycle that benefits loyal holders. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will offer two distinct lending options tailored to different investor profiles. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending model allows users to lend stablecoins such as USDT to borrowers who provide blue-chip crypto like BTC as collateral. This setup offers relatively stable returns with moderate risk. Conversely, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending channel caters to more aggressive traders who want to engage with short-term, risk-on loans backed by volatile tokens including BONK and TRUMP. This dual approach ensures the platform appeals to a wide range of users, from cautious lenders to speculative borrowers. Security remains a top priority for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The CertiK audit has verified the platform’s smart contracts for vulnerabilities and robustness, granting a high assurance score. To further protect the ecosystem, the project has introduced a $50,000 Bug Bounty program, rewarding white-hat hackers for identifying bugs with payouts ranging up to $2,000 depending on severity. Alongside this, a $100,000 giveaway campaign is active, incentivizing community growth and engagement. Why Now Is the Time for Smart Money Smart investors are already positioning themselves ahead of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s upcoming price increase. Once Phase 6 concludes, the price per token will rise by 15% to $0.040 in Phase 7. This creates a narrow window for new buyers to enter at the lowest available price before the token appreciates further. Given the project’s impressive early traction, innovative technology, and clear pathway to unlocking major utility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up to be one of the most promising opportunities on the market today. For anyone watching the space closely, the time to act is now before the presale price rises and the token begins its official journey on exchanges. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building to offer a unique blend of innovation, security, and growth potential that smart money is already seizing, making it a standout presale poised for significant impact.

Institutions continue to invest billions into U.S-based Bitcoin ETFs and as the American regulatory landscape turns more crypto-friendly, attention is gradually shifting toward altcoins. Crypto traders and investors are waiting for the early signs of the breakout of altcoin season 2025 And while altcoins are showing signs of strength, a new project is gaining traction. MAGACOIN FINANCE is coming out as a top contender in this bull cycle . While Bitcoin remains the benchmark, analysts point to projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE as potential breakout candidates during the next leg of alt season. Its rising momentum and growing presale activity have drawn attention from both retail and strategic investors looking for exposure outside of legacy coins. Bitcoin May Look Strong, but Altcoins Might Make a Comeback Soon Bitcoin’s current price has a strong hold above $110,000, climbing nearly doubling over the past 12 months. Institutional interest has never been higher – July’s record $12.8 billion in net ETF inflows stirred the market and bullish predictions started flooding social media. Meanwhile, macro factors such as a weak U.S. dollar and a liquidity boost from central banks have pushed global liquidity to $176.2 trillion, indirectly supporting crypto valuations. Institutional confidence is reflected in moves like Anthony Pompliano’s launch of ProCap BTC, expected to hold up to $1 billion in Bitcoin. Vietnam’s decision to legalize crypto payments starting next year could also unlock growth across Southeast Asia. All signs point to broader adoption and improving sentiment, but the real question remains: when will that spill over into altcoins? The Altcoin that Grabs the Spotlight As the market prepares for a potential altcoin surge, the fast-growing investor base and mega bullish price predictions make MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the cryptocurrencies to watch closely in the next few months. Unlike meme coins driven with absolutely no utility, this project is backed by real development and early ecosystem utility. Analysts predict MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver up to 68x returns during the next bull run , saying this could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity . With early rounds selling out in record time , the project is becoming one of 2025’s most talked-about altcoins. Early backers see the limited entry window as an opportunity to lock in gains before major listings take it mainstream. Alt Season May Be Brewing Below the Surface Altcoin season is very close as Bitcoin dominance is currently at 60.6%, and a slip below 60% could spark the next bull cycle for alternative cryptocurrencies. As of now, altcoin performance remains mixed. Ethereum is up 50% in the past year, while Solana has slipped 48% from its ATH. Cardano is still far away from its previous record price of $3.01. However, XRP and Tron have flipped green, hinting at potential leaders once momentum shifts. Another key indicator is the total altcoin market cap, which currently sits at $1.51 trillion. Historical patterns also show that crypto markets respond to global liquidity with a delay—meaning the recent expansion could fuel gains into late Q3. What’s Next? Bitcoin’s current strength is underpinned by institutional inflows, improving global liquidity, and political support in the U.S. But as history has shown, once Bitcoin cools, altcoins tend to accelerate. That transition may already be underway. With projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE gaining traction, investors are starting to position themselves for what could be a lucrative second half of 2025.

The directive will expand how Americans invest for retirement and potentially give bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies a stronger role in long-term portfolios. But this change will not roll out quickly, and analysts say it faces major hurdles before most savers ever see it in their accounts. Under the order, retirement plans could one day allow holdings in assets like bitcoin, which has seen growing institutional demand since U.S. bitcoin ETFs launched last year. The potential is there for crypto to become part of mainstream retirement investing. But even with Trump’s approval , that doesn’t mean employers will suddenly add BONK, Pudgy Penguins, or other meme coins to employee investment menus. Doug Boneparth, certified financial planner and founder of Bone Fide Wealth, said it was notable to see “digital assets getting presidential-level attention,” but stressed “the reality is a lot more nuanced.” Employers face legal and risk hurdles before adding crypto The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) governs how retirement plans are managed, and any major change in investment options requires careful review and agreement from plan sponsors. These sponsors carry fiduciary responsibilities, meaning they must run the plan in the best interest of participants and comply with ERISA. That makes it harder to add volatile, still-developing assets like crypto. Fidelity broke new ground in 2022 as the first major provider to give savers the option to put bitcoin in their 401(k)s, but Doug said whether employees could use it “came down to employers’ risk tolerance and fiduciary responsibility.” That’s not going to shift immediately because of an executive order. Preston Cherry, certified financial planner and founder of Concurrent Financial Planning, warned that too many investment choices can backfire. “People become overwhelmed with the investment menu options,” he said, adding that this often leads to lower participation. Even when employers offer education on these investments, workers have to opt in to receive it, and Preston said participation rates “are typically low.” He also questioned how employers will decide which coins are allowed. Separating bitcoin, ether, and Solana from the rest of the crypto market requires oversight from an investment committee or plan sponsor. Without it, employees could end up exposed to coins with extreme price swings. Preston pointed out that many people “can’t understand 30%, 40%, 50% drawdowns – and it could be destructive.” While he’s not against crypto in retirement accounts, he urged investors to “be crypto cautious.” Plan providers and recordkeepers will control final decisions Even if employers are willing to add crypto, the choice may ultimately rest with plan providers and recordkeepers. U.S. retirement accounts held $43 trillion in assets in the first quarter, with about $9 trillion in 401(k)s. By comparison, the entire crypto market is worth nearly $4 trillion. Integrating the two is a huge step, and companies controlling plan infrastructure will decide whether it’s worth the operational and regulatory challenges. Trump’s order follows other administration moves to promote U.S. dominance in crypto. In July, he signed the GENIUS Act, the first U.S. law for stablecoins. The Securities and Exchange Commission has also launched Project Crypto, aimed at updating securities rules for crypto-based trading. Tyrone Ross, CEO of registered investment advisor 401 Financial, said, “The plan providers, the third-party providers, the recordkeepers, are going to decide the end result here, if they want to put crypto in or not.” He added that while the administration is committed to making the U.S. the global crypto hub, major firms like Fidelity, Schwab, MassMutual, and Vanguard may not rush to implement the change. Doug agreed that the executive order is “more symbolic than structural right now.” But he also said it opens a door for education in the retirement space. While he believes bitcoin has a long-term place in a diversified portfolio, he emphasized that fiduciaries must weigh opportunity and risk before offering it. “If we do this right, the door opens a little wider to the future of retirement investing,” Doug said. “If we don’t? Well then, who knows what meme coin we’re going to see on a retirement plan statement.” Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Prices drop, sentiment turns negative, and many investors retreat. But for those with long-term vision, this is often where the biggest opportunities begin. Buying in a bear market means getting assets at a discount – something seasoned investors call a “building phase” rather than a downturn. Some early movers are already looking toward strategic plays, including MAGACOIN FINANCE, a fast-growing altcoin that’s seeing record presale activity. As attention shifts away from hype and toward fundamentals, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are positioning themselves for the next breakout. Bitcoin Bitcoin remains the most trusted name in crypto, and for good reason. It’s limited to 21 million coins, making it a hedge against inflation and currency debasement. Despite market dips, BTC has consistently bounced back, often leading each new bull cycle. It’s the coin institutional investors tend to turn to first when risk appetite returns. Ethereum Ethereum has built an entire ecosystem that continues to evolve. With thousands of apps running on its blockchain and its recent upgrades reducing energy consumption and boosting scalability, ETH remains one of the strongest assets to hold during downturns. It’s a bet on innovation, not just speculation. MAGACOIN FINANCE While the top cryptos remain solid options, some investors are betting on bigger returns with emerging assets. MAGACOIN FINANCE is now targeting a massive 74x rally, drawing strong attention as early-stage demand hits new highs . With each round selling out faster than the last, it’s attracting comparisons to early-stage breakouts like DOGE and SHIBA – but with a utility-focused roadmap that aims to reward long-term holders. This could be the best altcoin for those seeking early-mover gains before broader adoption. Solana (SOL) Solana stands out for its fast transactions and low fees—features that matter more than ever in a market that demands efficiency. With developers flocking to its ecosystem and institutional interest growing, SOL has the momentum to push forward even when market conditions get tough. XRP XRP continues to be a favorite among those betting on traditional finance merging with blockchain. With its focus on real-world utility and ongoing developments in global payment systems, XRP is still considered a strong hold, especially with legal clarity expected to further unlock its price potential. Final Thoughts Bear markets are uncomfortable—but they’re also where wealth is built. Investors who stay focused on quality assets and adopt smart strategies like dollar-cost averaging, diversification, and staking can ride out the downturn and come out stronger. Bitcoin and Ethereum remain core holdings, but emerging stars like MAGACOIN FINANCE could offer the kind of explosive upside that turns down markets into unimaginable opportunities.

The only other stock to cross 7% was Apple in 2023. Even in the height of the 2000 dot-com bubble, Microsoft and General Electric never went past 4%. IBM’s peak in 1984 was about 6%, which now sits below Nvidia’s new record. This level means Nvidia’s daily price changes can sway the entire index more than any other company has in over four decades. The scale of Nvidia’s weight also shows how concentrated the market has become. One stock now holds a share bigger than any company during several of the most famous bull markets. That includes the 1999–2000 tech frenzy and IBM’s mid-80s corporate peak. U.S. approves H20 chip sales to China after earlier ban The U.S. Commerce Department has begun issuing licenses for Nvidia to export its H20 AI chips to China. The move comes after Washington reversed an April ban last month. Nvidia had created the H20 to comply with Biden-era rules on AI chip exports, but those restrictions still stopped shipments to China earlier this year. The company had warned in July that the sales ban could wipe $8 billion from its quarterly revenue. During the same month, Nvidia applied for licenses and was told approvals would be fast. On Wednesday, CEO Jensen Huang met with President Donald Trump at the White House, according to Reuters. It is still unclear how many licenses have been issued, which Chinese buyers can receive the H20, or the total shipment value. The new clearance reopens one of Nvidia’s biggest markets. While the H20 was designed to stay inside the export limits, the previous ban cut the company off from Chinese clients until now. Apple, Alphabet flagged as overbought while others slide Apple and Alphabet are now among Wall Street’s most overbought stocks by the 14-day relative strength index (RSI), which measures momentum. An RSI above 70 can suggest a pullback is near. Apple’s RSI reached 72 after a 13.3% weekly jump — its biggest gain in over five years — boosted by an extra $100 billion pledge for U.S. investment. That adds to the $500 billion commitment made in February. Apple’s expanded domestic production plans appear to shield it from Trump’s newly announced 100% tariffs on imported semiconductors and chips. Trump said on Wednesday that companies building in the U.S. would not be subject to the duties. The statement came after Apple’s July 31 earnings showed 10% revenue growth, its fastest since late 2021. Alphabet rose 6.5% for the week, with its RSI hitting 75. The company’s late-July earnings showed revenue up 14% year-over-year. Alphabet also plans to raise 2025 capital spending by $10 billion to handle rising demand for its cloud services. On the opposite side, Airbnb is among the most oversold stocks. Its RSI sits at 29 after a 5.3% drop this week. While it beat second-quarter forecasts, Airbnb warned of a weaker second half, guiding Q3 revenue between $4.02 billion and $4.10 billion, with analysts expecting $4.05 billion. The Trade Desk took the biggest hit. Its shares fell 37% for the week and plunged 39% on Friday alone, the worst single day in company history. The drop followed second-quarter results that topped estimates but were overshadowed by new competition from Amazon in online ads and the resignation of CFO Laura Schenkein. CEO Jeff Green also mentioned inflation pressures from Trump’s tariffs during the earnings call. Multiple analysts, including those from Citi, Wedbush, Bank of America, and MoffettNathanson, cut their ratings. Citi analyst Ygal Arounian wrote , “We still don’t believe Amazon is the main factor here, but results will inevitably raise more investor questions around the competitive environment and will remain an overhang.” Get seen where it counts.

Chainlink and Hedera are two well-known projects holding steady without delivering clear breakouts. In contrast, Cold Wallet is building momentum quietly, combining self-custody with a reward-driven system that keeps growing. While Chainlink expands its oracles and Hedera works on enterprise adoption, Cold Wallet is shifting the focus. Its utility-based model and 4,900% ROI potential are linked to an active reward ecosystem. At its current Stage 17 price of $0.00998, Cold Wallet is drawing attention from those seeking the best performing crypto today before the next major market move. Chainlink (LINK) Faces Resistance Near $17 Recent analysis on Chainlink (LINK) shows it is struggling to break past the $17.64 resistance level. The project continues to expand its role in real-time data services and strategic collaborations, but price action remains cautious. LINK has been trading within a set range for weeks, despite strong ecosystem updates. Experts note that breaking above $17.50 with strong trading volume could push LINK toward the $20 level. Until then, movement is likely to stay limited. This slower pace may encourage traders to explore other options for faster gains, with projects like Cold Wallet offering stronger early-stage ROI setups. Hedera (HBAR) Holds Support but Lacks Price Drive Hedera (HBAR) is holding its weekly support zones but has not shown significant upside recently. Price movement has been mostly flat, which some see as a pause before potential action, while others see it as reduced market interest. Technically, HBAR must close above $0.085 to spark renewed momentum. Similar patterns in the past have led to either rallies or declines depending on trading volume. Although Hedera continues to grow its enterprise ecosystem, its market price has yet to reflect these developments. This steady performance creates space for newer projects with higher growth potential. Cold Wallet fits this profile, providing both real-world utility and cashback benefits. Its design strengthens its position among those looking for the best performing crypto today under $0.01. Cold Wallet’s Cashback Approach and Its Growing Appeal Crypto was never meant to feel this costly to use. Gas fees, swap fees, and bridge fees act like hidden charges that make participation expensive. These costs are slowing adoption. Cold Wallet is designed to reverse that pattern. Instead of charging users for being active, it gives them rewards. Every time you use crypto with Cold Wallet, you receive a percentage back in CWT. It works as a simple cycle. Use the wallet, and it sends rewards back automatically. Pay gas? Receive CWT. Swap coins? Earn more. Bridge or move funds? You still get rewarded. This approach shifts the value cycle from being draining to being regenerative. It creates a reason to remain active in crypto without the constant financial hit that most platforms bring. CWT is not an extra feature. It is the core of the model. Cold Wallet’s tokenomics focus on rewarding real activity and scaling in a sustainable way. With its presale price at $0.00998 in Stage 17, the projected ROI is 4,900%, offering an advantage over coins that are stuck in slow price action. With $5.8 million already raised and a total of 150 stages, the early entry phase is still open. As the presale progresses, the price of CWT will increase. Cold Wallet’s framework is not driven by pure speculation. It is built around use, making it a system that stands out. In a market filled with passive holders, it encourages staying active and earning at the same time. Market Position and Potential Ahead Chainlink and Hedera still hold long-term value for those waiting for ecosystem progress to impact price. However, both remain in extended consolidation phases, giving little near-term ROI. This is why more attention is turning toward new utility-driven projects like Cold Wallet. With its cashback reward system and a current price of $0.00998 paired with 4,900% potential growth, Cold Wallet is not only among the best performing crypto today but is also structured to grow alongside its active users. The $5.8M already raised shows that early participants are taking notice of its approach.

Cardano (ADA) now struggles to stay near $0.50, while TRON (TRX) looks like it’s prepping to push past $0.34. Both remain top-tier altcoins in terms of activity, but the real action is happening elsewhere. But BlockDAG is where large buyers are focusing now. It’s not just the $0.0016 entry point that’s drawing attention; it’s the chance to claim a chunk of the platform’s massive 10 BTC pool, active until August 11. The prize? Real Bitcoin, based on how much BDAG is picked up during this round. The sooner buyers get in, the bigger their potential payout. Whales are circling fast, scooping up BDAG before others can claim their slice. BlockDAG’s 10 BTC Giveaway Pulls in Whales Fast Big names in crypto aren’t sitting around waiting for BlockDAG to go live; they’re jumping into BDAG now to lock in their place in the 10 BTC distribution event. This isn’t some typical promo. It’s a direct split of 10 Bitcoin, based on how much BDAG each buyer holds by August 11. The more BDAG is locked in, the higher the share of BTC earned. The longer the delay, the smaller the reward, because whales are stacking up. This offer runs alongside BlockDAG’s $0.0016 GLOBAL LAUNCH release, offering a possible 3,025% return compared to the $0.05 launch price. Already, over $367 million has come in, and 24.8 billion BDAG have been sold. The current price is well below the Batch 29 rate of $0.0276, but that price will return after August 11. That gives current buyers a rare opportunity to load up on BDAG at a deep discount. To push things further, BlockDAG has launched Dashboard V4, a live trading simulator designed to prep users for launch. It features real-time BDAG price charts, wallet balances, and an exchange-style order book. Users can test out trades before things go live. It’s sleek, interactive, and unlike most presales, which only give static dashboards or email alerts. Even among the market’s top trending altcoins, it’s hard to find this mix: low pricing, high ROI potential, and an active BTC payout system. BlockDAG checks all three boxes, and the whale activity proves it. Cardano (ADA) Struggles to Stay Above $0.50 Cardano (ADA) is in a tug-of-war zone near the $0.50 threshold. After making some upward moves, price action now sits near $0.48–$0.50, where bulls and bears are both applying pressure. A close above $0.52 might revive bullish momentum, but volume remains patchy. If ADA dips under $0.47, it could retest the $0.44 area seen earlier this summer. Despite the choppy action, ADA remains a watchlist coin for many traders seeking mid-cycle setups. Developers continue pushing upgrades like Hydra for scaling and sidechain features that could help sentiment long-term. However, for now, traders are reacting more to price patterns than news. ADA needs stronger buying power if it wants to reclaim top-tier altcoin status in this cycle. Breaking $0.52 cleanly would be the first step. TRON (TRX) Bulls Target $0.45, But Caution on RSI TRON (TRX) has seen a bump to around $0.332 after gaining 3%, with healthy trading volume backing the move. Buyers are pushing toward the $0.34–$0.35 level, and a breakout above could unlock a run to $0.45. On-chain stats remain solid: 323M+ active accounts and over $27B TVL. Derivatives traders are also showing optimism, with futures open interest ticking upward. Still, there’s a warning sign: RSI is now near 75, which is often a red flag for overbought territory. A pullback to $0.318 or even $0.30 isn’t off the table if momentum fades. That said, accumulation trends and consistent CVD data suggest buyers are still in control, provided support levels don’t break. TRX remains one of the few large-cap coins holding technical strength, and a clean break above $0.35 could bring in another round of volume. Looking Ahead Cardano (ADA) is stuck just shy of $0.50, with eyes on $0.52 as the next key test. TRON (TRX) remains technically strong but needs a clean push past $0.35 before RSI overheats. Both are still among the Top trending Altcoins, but neither has the traction right now that BlockDAG’s presale is seeing. With the 10 BTC distribution active and BDAG priced at just $0.0016 during the GLOBAL LAUNCH window, big buyers are stacking fast to maximize returns. Over $367M raised and 24.8B coins sold show just how aggressive the buying has become. The BTC pool is real, it’s running until August 11, and those who buy more now get a larger share. Wait too long, and whales will scoop up most of it. BDAG buyers aren’t just looking for returns; they’re playing for Bitcoin.

The executive order which is set to be signed this week, Trump is pushing to allow 401(k) retirement accounts to invest in crypto, private equity, and other non-traditional assets. The decision marks a major shift away from decades of conservative financial planning, potentially unlocking trillions in sidelined capital. This action builds on Trump’s growing embrace of digital assets. Over the past few months, he has hosted blockchain innovators at the White House, proposed a federal crypto advisory role, and even called for the U.S. to build a national Bitcoin reserve. With lawsuits against key platforms like Coinbase and Uniswap dropped, it’s clear that crypto policy under Trump is entering a friendlier phase. And now altcoins are gaining traction. The broader crypto market cap sits at around $3.76 trillion, and while Bitcoin still leads, its dominance has dropped to 60.7%, a clear signal that altcoins are starting to take the spotlight. Signs of Early Altseason Ethereum overshadowed Bitcoin’s performance with its Q2 2025 performance. Ethereum’s outperformance is often an early sign of capital rotating into altcoins—something that historically precedes full-blown altseasons. Altcoin-related metrics also support this narrative. According to CryptoQuant, weekly altcoin deposits on Binance have surged past 45,000, the highest in nearly a year. Technical signals are flashing green as well—the altcoin market cap just printed a golden cross, and the Altseason Index has climbed from 26 to 37, indicating a growing appetite for higher-risk assets. Current conditions are quite similar to the pre-bull market phase of 2021, where many altcoins created fortunes for a lot of investors. The Altcoin That Was Rated the Top Early-Stage Gem With the early signs of the altcoin season, MAGACOIN FINANCE has come out as a great opportunity for investors looking to gain an exposure to a project before it becomes mainstream. The project’s rapid rise has drawn incredible attention, especially since it offers more than just hype. With an expanding ecosystem, continuous development, and multiple sell-out early rounds , it’s quickly earning a reputation as 2025’s best crypto opportunity. What’s driving this buzz? Investor demand is skyrocketing, and the project is gaining traction across top-tier communities looking for the next 50x+ opportunity . Early supporters have already seen returns up to 7,800%, and with broader altcoin adoption accelerating, MAGACOIN FINANCE is well-positioned to ride the wave. Altcoin Momentum is Surging The numbers don’t lie—Ethereum’s dominance, on-chain flows, and altcoin market activity all point to a rising tide. While a full-scale altseason hasn’t officially begun, the early ingredients are there. Traders and analysts are watching closely, and many are already positioning themselves ahead of a potential breakout. With Trump’s crypto-friendly pivot and new access to retirement capital, Web3 could become a serious contender in traditional finance portfolios—something that would have seemed impossible just a few years ago. Final Words Trump’s executive order may be the biggest policy shakeup crypto has seen in years. By opening up 401(k) access to alternative assets like crypto, he’s creating the conditions for major capital inflows. At the same time, Ethereum’s strong Q3 and a wave of altcoin signals are setting the stage for a major rally. And as excitement builds, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to attract attention as the top altcoin presale to watch —giving early investors a shot at extraordinary gains before the next leg of the bull market kicks in.

Analyst Points To Key Level For A Comeback,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-reclaim-all-time-high/,"The Bitcoin price has been enjoying some form of resurgence over the past week, returning above the significant $115,000 level again. The premier cryptocurrency briefly crossed the $117,000 mark on Friday, August 8, capitalizing on recent bullish developments in the United States. On Thursday, August 7, United States President Donald Trump signed an executive order allowing cryptocurrency investment in 401(k) plans. The Bitcoin price rallied on the back of this positive development and looks set to continue this ascent back to its current all-time high. Why 118,000 Might Be Crucial For Bull Run Resumption In a recent post on the social media platform X, prominent crypto analyst Titan of Crypto put forward an interesting outlook for the Bitcoin price over the coming days. According to the current setup, the flagship cryptocurrency could be on its way back to its record-high price of around $122,800. Related Reading: Analyst Outlines How Production Cost Determines XRP Price, But Is It Better Than Bitcoin? Titan of Crypto highlighted that the Bitcoin price has been on an upward trend since April 2025 and recently just bounced off the ascending trendline. Also, the market leader has filled the Fair Value Gap (FVG), a liquidity void often created by a sharp movement in price. However, the Bitcoin price seems to be approaching a critical level around the Kijun-sen (blue line) from the Ichimoku Cloud indicator. The Kijun-sen, also known as the Base Line, often represents the market’s equilibrium and can act as a key support and resistance level. As shown in the chart setup above, the market leader has climbed back above the Tenkan-sen (red line), which is an indicator of early momentum shift. Meanwhile, the Kijun-sen (hovering around $118,000) appears to be the only obstacle in the way of Bitcoin returning to its all-time-high price within the $123,000 region. However, a sustained close above the “blue line” could suggest a resumption of the bull run for the price of BTC. Moreover, the Chikou Span (orange line), which is a lagging indicator, remains in the bullish zone, supporting a broader uptrend narrative for the market leader. Bitcoin Price Overview As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin stands at around $116,880, with no significant movement in the past 24 hours. This sluggishness does not adequately reflect the coin’s activity over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, the premier cryptocurrency is up by more than 3% on the weekly timeframe.

His time on the council encouraged significant engagement with the crypto industry. According to reports, Hines will be replaced by his deputy, Patrick Witt, who is currently the deputy director of the council and acting director of the Office of Strategic Capital at the Department of Defense. While Hines has shared an intention to return to the private sector , there are indications that he plans to retain an advisory role as a special government employee and will assist White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks with AI-related initiatives. Bo Hines walks away from White House role Hines shared a statement regarding the development on X, expressing how honorable it has been to serve in President Trump’s administration and work alongside AI & Crypto Czar David Sacks as Executive Director of the White House Crypto Council . “Together, we have positioned America as the crypto capital of the world. I’m deeply grateful to the industry for its unwavering support — I love this community and all we’ve built together. As I return to the private sector, I look forward to continuing my support for the crypto ecosystem as it thrives here in the United States,” he wrote. The administration’s AI and Crypto Czar, David Sacks shared his admiration for Hines’ “expertise” in leading the inaugural crypto council and his role in pulling accomplishments like the crypto summit, GENIUS Act, and digital assets report over the finish line. The Trump appointee also said he looks forward to the departing Hines’ “advise” in the future. Acting CFTC head is also on her way out Hines is the latest Trump appointee to reveal his desire to return to the private sector upon resignation. In May, it was revealed that the current head of the CFTC , Caroline Pham, also has similar plans scheduled for later this year. Pham confirmed this is true while delivering a speech at the International Swaps and Derivatives Association Annual Meeting in Amsterdam, saying she’ll step down as soon as Brian Quintenz is confirmed as chairman. “I will be returning to the private sector once Brian Quintenz is confirmed as Chairman,” she said. “While I don’t have any specific plans for what’s next for me personally yet, I hope to make some over the next several months.” Pham’s exit comes after fellow Republican commissioner, Summer Mersinger, departed the agency to become the CEO of the crypto advocacy group Blockchain Association in June.

That pause triggered a coordinated effort led by senior figures in Washington to pressure foreign leaders into signing off on arrangements quickly, even if the final details were left for later. By May, Stephen Miran, a senior economic adviser, traveled to France and Germany to warn officials that if they did not engage in serious talks with the U.S., their countries would face steep tariffs. In June, he repeated the message to the European Commission in Brussels. The campaign, which has since produced a tariff truce with China and agreements with the EU, Japan, and South Korea, also saw the imposition of the highest overall U.S. tariffs since the Great Depression, with higher rates on nearly 100 countries taking effect on Thursday. White House pursued fast-track agreements over lengthy trade deals While Miran was delivering his threats in Europe, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer ran private negotiations. Their focus was securing promises of major investment in the U.S. and tariffs aligned with Trump’s policy preferences. White House spokesman Kush Desai described the team as “delivering one historic trade deal after another” for American industries. Trump’s approach with allies and rivals has been to push for broad, accelerated agreements instead of lengthy, legally binding trade deals. Greer explained after talks with Chinese officials in Stockholm that “this is not like a free-trade agreement” with arbitration processes, but rather an emergency measure under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which Trump can change as needed. Some of the announced deals still lack key details. In Southeast Asia, the administration has warned countries they will face doubled tariffs or more if their exports contain excessive Chinese content. No threshold has been disclosed for what level of Chinese components would trigger the penalty. A senior official said the administration knows “what that rule of origin is going to be” but has not implemented it. Retailers and governments in the Philippines, Vietnam, and Malaysia have not been briefed on the specifics. Elsewhere, agreements are still in progress. The U.S. and U.K. have not finalized terms for U.K. steel exports under their May pact. U.S. and Japanese negotiators met this week to determine how automotive tariffs will be handled, while Tokyo’s promised $550 billion in infrastructure funding remains subject to Trump’s discretion. Personal pressure on European leaders before key announcements The administration faces an August 12 deadline, when tariffs on China will rise to as high as 85% if Trump does not extend the current truce. In late July, ahead of a deal with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Scotland, Lutnick personally called French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and other EU leaders. Officials said he feared von der Leyen could not commit without their backing. Macron resisted a broader agreement, but Lutnick warned that if France wanted Sanofi, its pharmaceutical giant, to stay in the country, it should not push back. At the time, Trump was threatening more than 200% tariffs on non-U.S. pharmaceutical firms, a move that could have prompted Sanofi to relocate. The final agreement imposed a 15% tariff on European pharmaceutical products, left U.S. goods tariff-free, and secured an EU commitment to buy $750 billion in American energy exports through 2028. Just before Trump signed an order on July 31 setting a 39% tariff on Switzerland, Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter called him to argue over the $38 billion U.S. trade deficit with her country. Trump later said she “didn’t want to listen” to his concerns. An aide to Greer told Keller-Sutter to present a strong plan to reduce the deficit. Keller-Sutter flew to Washington but was unable to meet Bessent, Lutnick, or Greer. She instead met with Secretary of State Marco Rubio. A Swiss official said their proposal would cut the trade gap but declined to give details. No agreement has been reached. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

49827076,https://timestabloid.com/?p=77701,1754782222,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Set To Explode. Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-set-to-explode-heres-why/,"XRP could be positioned for another upward movement after its Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio produced a bullish indicator for the third time since November 2024. The development, highlighted by market analyst Ali Martinez, comes as XRP attempts to reclaim its yearly high of $3.66 in the wake of renewed momentum following the conclusion of the SEC vs. Ripple case. Understanding the MVRV Golden Cross The MVRV ratio compares an asset’s total market value with the average cost basis of all tokens in circulation. Analysts use it to assess whether a cryptocurrency is trading above or below its aggregate acquisition price, helping to gauge potential overvaluation or undervaluation. A golden cross in this context occurs when the short-term MVRV surpasses the long-term MVRV, often appearing during rapid price movements. Such a shift can indicate strengthening market sentiment and the potential for further gains. Historical Patterns Since November 2024 Martinez’s data shows that this signal has preceded notable price increases for XRP in recent history. The first occurrence appeared in early November 2024, shortly after the U.S. presidential election. In the weeks following, XRP rose sharply, moving past key resistance levels at $2 and $3. That rally ultimately delivered a gain of approximately 630% from the point of the cross. The second golden cross materialized in early July 2025, following months of sideways trading between February and June. This time, the price appreciation was more moderate, with XRP climbing about 54% before reaching $3.66 by mid-July. Current Market Position and Potential Scenarios The latest golden cross emerged earlier this month, during XRP’s recovery from a decline below $3. As of report time, XRP is valued at $3.32 . If price action mirrors the November 2024 rally, a similar 630% gain would place XRP near $24, a level also suggested earlier this year by trader Davinci Jeremie as a possible target for the current market cycle. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Following the July 2025 pattern would imply a smaller but still significant increase of 54%, which would bring XRP to approximately $5. This aligns with commentary from YouTuber DustyBC, who has argued that any price under $5 should be considered undervalued for XRP. A third scenario considers the average of the previous two rallies, amounting to a 342% increase. Under this projection, XRP could rise to around $14.40 over the coming months if similar conditions develop. While the degree of price movement will depend on broader market sentiment and external catalysts, historical performance suggests that the MVRV golden cross has been a consistently bullish signal for XRP over the past year. Traders and investors will now be watching closely to see if the latest signal delivers another substantial rally.

With total market capitalization surging and on-chain activity heating up, investor sentiment is turning bullish once again. Amid this upswing, smart money is eyeing a new wave of altcoins with long-term growth potential – XRP, Cardano, and one emerging name gaining traction fast: МAGACOIN FINANCE. The renewed momentum follows the passage of the GENIUS Act in the U.S., marking the first comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins. Paired with a more cooperative stance from the SEC and record-breaking inflows into Ethereum ETFs, the market is entering what many see as a more mature, sustainable growth cycle. As institutional adoption deepens and traditional finance merges with crypto infrastructure, top altcoins are primed to benefit. XRP XRP is once again drawing attention as clarity around its legal status gives the token room to breathe. With Ripple’s ongoing expansion into cross-border settlements and partnerships with central banks, the coin is reclaiming its spot among high-utility assets. Analysts are watching closely for a potential retest of $3.2, especially if market conditions hold and demand for real-world tokenization continues to grow. MAGACOIN FINANCE MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly becoming one of the most discussed altcoins of 2025. Following a strong presale phase and increased community engagement, the project’s new round has launched after the previous stage filled in record time. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its aggressive roadmap and ecosystem utility that appeals to both retail and whale investors. With whispers of a potential 42x return, early adopters are scrambling to secure their positions before listings begin on major exchanges. Cardano Cardano continues to push forward with its smart contract infrastructure and real-world use cases, particularly in the education and identity sectors. While it’s seen slower price movement compared to some competitors, ADA’s long-term potential remains intact. The launch of new dApps, partnerships with academic institutions, and its commitment to sustainability keep it on the radar of long-term investors. A clean break above the $0.80 level could signal a fresh leg higher. Conclusion The broader crypto recovery looks to be more than just a temporary bounce. With new regulatory frameworks, rising ETF inflows, and surging DeFi and AI innovation, the foundation appears stronger than in past cycles. XRP and Cardano continue to impress with their expanding ecosystems, while MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a major opportunity amid this next phase of crypto adoption.

Bowman was one of two governors who disagreed with the Fed’s decision last month to keep short-term interest rates between 4.25% and 4.50%, the level they have held since December. While many Fed officials have been reluctant to push for rate cuts because of concerns that tariffs from the Trump administration could slow progress toward lowering inflation to the Fed’s 2% target, recent comments from several policymakers suggest growing support for cuts. Speaking to the Kansas Bankers Association as mentioned in a Reuters report , Bowman said acting at the last meeting would have been a way to guard against more damage to the labor market and a possible slowdown in economic growth. Her comments on Saturday placed even greater emphasis on labor market weakness than her earlier explanation following last month’s policy vote. According to a Cryptopolitan, Bowman had already signaled her openness to supporting a July rate cut if inflation remained low Unemployment rises as job growth slowed The Labor Department reported on Friday that the unemployment rate rose to 4.2%, which Bowman described as “close to rounding up to 4.3%.” The same report also revised past figures, showing job growth over the last three months slowed to an average of 35,000 per month. “This is well below the moderate pace seen earlier in the year, likely due to a significant softening in labor demand,” Bowman said. She added that her own forecast since last December has included three rate cuts for this year, and the latest jobs data strengthens that outlook. As highlighted by Cryptopolitan , Bowman and Waller’s earlier calls for policy easing had already shifted market expectations. The Fed has three policy meetings left in the year in September, October, and December. Economists generally view job gains of about 100,000 a month as enough to keep the labor market steady. That figure may be lower now due to reduced immigration since President Donald Trump began his second term in January. Bowman’s clear backing of rate cuts comes as Trump has repeatedly pressed the central bank to ease policy. The search for a replacement for Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whose term ends in May, is already underway. Among those being considered is Governor Christopher Waller, who, like Bowman, dissented from last month’s decision. Bowman said she began making the case for a July rate cut during the Fed’s June meeting. Trump, meanwhile, has claimed that the latest jobs figures were “rigged” and dismissed the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics shortly after the report was released. Policies expected to offset tariff impact Bowman has often said that large revisions to employment data make her careful about relying too much on a single report. However, on Saturday she noted that the most recent information on economic growth, jobs, and inflation points to higher risks to employment, one of the Fed’s two main goals. She also said that recent inflation numbers make her more confident that the administration’s tariffs will not cause lasting price increases. Without tariff-related goods price rises, underlying inflation is “much closer” to the Fed’s 2% target than the official June reading of 2.8%, which was based on the core personal consumption expenditures price index over 12 months. Bowman said Trump’s policies, including tax reductions and deregulation, are likely to balance out any economic slowdown or price increases caused by import tariffs. With housing demand possibly at its lowest point since the financial crisis and the labor market no longer adding upward pressure on inflation, she said the chances of prices rising too quickly have reduced.

On August 7, 2025 , both parties filed a joint dismissal of appeals in the U.S. Court of Appeals, finalizing the landmark decision that XRP is not a security in secondary market sales . Under the resolution, Ripple will pay a $125 million penalty for past institutional sales but avoids further federal litigation. This outcome solidifies regulatory clarity for XRP and opens the door to potential products like a spot XRP ETF , which analysts say has a 95% chance of approval before October. Following the news, XRP surged more than 12% , reaffirming investor optimism and signaling a broader shift toward altcoin risk appetite. But while XRP may lead the news cycle, many insiders are pointing elsewhere for the next major rally. MAGACOIN FINANCE Rise as Ripple Win Triggers Market Rally As the altcoin market regains strength, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now emerging as a standout. Analysts suggest that in the wake of Ripple’s legal victory, projects that combine community governance , cultural relevance , and narrative strength could see exponential growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE fits that profile perfectly. Described as a decentralized political memecoin , MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t just another speculative asset—it’s a movement powered by ideology, community, and anti-centralisation values. On-chain data shows rising wallet growth, increased whale accumulation, and rapidly growing transaction volumes. With the token still trading below $1, experts believe MAGACOIN FINANCE offers one of the last entry points before a potential major breakout. Forecasts suggest the project could deliver gains as high as 13,900% in the upcoming market cycle. In the eyes of many analysts, MAGACOIN FINANCE now stands as the best altcoin to buy heading into late 2025. Broader Market Signals Turn Bullish After Ripple Win The end of the Ripple case is already impacting broader market dynamics. Confidence is rising across altcoins with strong fundamentals and legal clarity. While XRP continues to rise, attention is shifting toward tokens with strong communities and narrative momentum . Alongside MAGACOIN, other utility-focused tokens are gaining investor interest. But few match MAGACOIN’s combination of memetic energy, ideological appeal, and grassroots support—all factors that analysts say can drive virality and long-term engagement. Outlook: Altseason Momentum Building Fast With Bitcoin holding above $117,000 and Ethereum nearing $3,900 , institutional sentiment is strengthening across the board. President Trump’s recent executive order enabling crypto inclusion in retirement plans has further bolstered market stability. But as analysts scan the landscape for the best altcoin to buy , MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to top their lists. If the current momentum holds, this meme-powered altcoin could be the breakout story of the post-Ripple market.

The FIRE movement (Financial Independence, Retire Early) has found a new ally in cryptocurrency, where explosive returns can significantly outperform traditional portfolios. While the risk is high, so is the potential reward—and that’s exactly what draws a new wave of early retirement seekers to this path. A balanced FIRE plan might typically focus on low-cost index funds, real estate, or dividend stocks. But crypto enthusiasts have flipped the script, betting on digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum to act as growth engines that outperform legacy systems. Within this evolving playbook, emerging altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE are attracting attention as high-upside additions to early-stage portfolios, especially for those looking to maximize gains before broader adoption. Crypto FIRE Strategy: How It Works Rather than relying on slow and steady compounding over decades, a crypto-centric FIRE strategy places calculated bets on faster-moving assets. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) typically form the foundation due to their long-term track records and institutional backing. But for meaningful upside, investors allocate to altcoins with high growth potential and strong communities behind them. Projects in sectors like DeFi, GameFi, and infrastructure tokens round out the strategy, aiming to catch early-stage growth before prices explode. Success depends not just on what you invest in, but how you invest—employing tactics like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) to reduce emotional decision-making and mitigate volatility. Periodic rebalancing is key, especially after sharp market movements. Selling partial gains from top performers and reinvesting in undervalued tokens can maintain healthy risk exposure while banking profits. For U.S. investors, self-directed crypto IRAs can also unlock long-term tax benefits that make early retirement even more achievable. Why This New Altcoin is Gaining Traction With Early Retirees For those chasing big returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being called one of the best altcoins to watch right now. Experts estimate it could deliver a 67x ROI in the upcoming market run, citing its rapidly expanding user base, early-stage growth potential, and structured presale phases that reward early participation. Unlike meme coins with no clear path forward, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building out a full ecosystem of utility, staking, and community-driven development. As momentum builds, comparisons are being made to the early days of breakout tokens like SHIBA INU—but with a clearer roadmap and increasing support from long-term crypto investors. With investor demand rising fast and current rounds selling out quicker each time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming a favorite for those looking to retire early with a bold, high-growth strategy. The Path to Early Retirement Early retirement through crypto isn’t guaranteed—but with the right portfolio, the right mindset, and a commitment to long-term strategies like DCA and rebalancing, it’s more possible than ever. For investors looking beyond the mainstream cryptocurrencies that have already established themselves, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE offer the kind of upside that could supercharge a portfolio and turn calculated risk into real wealth .

Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) has posted steady fundraising alongside rising attention for BTC Layer-2 projects, though it’s still early. Maxi Doge (MAXI) has caught eyes with its meme appeal, but its staying power remains uncertain. Then there’s BlockDAG (BDAG) , surging past $367 million in its presale, holding its price at $0.0016 with a countdown that’s drawing serious attention. With the GLOBAL LAUNCH Release set, the tone feels different. For those tracking crypto presales this year, these three offer a telling picture, but one appears to be sprinting toward something bigger. Bitcoin Hyper Update: Layer-2 Project Building Visibility Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) is seeing increased attention among BTC-related altcoins, with its presale approaching $7 million. Built as a Layer-2 network using the Solana Virtual Machine, the project’s goal is to bring programmability to Bitcoin without changing its core layer. Some analysts have noted the recent rise in presale participation, but long-term adoption is still unclear. The early traction seems driven more by speculative interest and influencer discussions than by proven use cases. The coming months will be the real test of Bitcoin Hyper’s ability to move from concept to sustained growth. Maxi Doge Price Prediction: Meme Appeal Faces Reality Check Maxi Doge (MAXI) has generated excitement in early presale stages, raising over $397K so far. Its branding mixes a fitness theme with Shiba Inu imagery, focusing more on entertainment than utility. Current forecasts remain speculative, with near-term targets suggesting a post-presale price of $0.0002745. Bullish estimates point to $0.001 by 2025, and a highly optimistic $0.02 by 2030. However, without confirmed exchange listings or strong technical foundations, the coin’s future hinges heavily on its ability to keep viral interest alive beyond its launch window. BlockDAG’s GLOBAL LAUNCH Release Approaches: Final Window at $0.0016 Time is running out for BlockDAG’s presale, with the GLOBAL LAUNCH Release locked for August 11. While this isn’t the official listing date, it is a turning point for the project. Buyers still have access to the frozen $0.0016 price, but that window is closing fast. Once the countdown ends, the price will shift to the Batch 29 level of $0.0276, and if that batch sells out early, it could climb again before hitting the $0.05 listing price. From the current entry point to launch, the potential return stands at 3,025%, with gains of 2,660% already locked from Batch 1 to Batch 29. These figures are rare in late-stage presales, adding urgency to the final days. BlockDAG has already raised over $367 million, sold 24.8 billion coins, and more than 19,000 crypto miners, making it the largest presale in the current crypto market. Analysts remain confident in its trajectory, forecasting a path to $1 soon after launch, with longer-term targets of $5 and even $10. For anyone tracking crypto presales in 2025, this is the last major low entry point before prices shift permanently. The GLOBAL LAUNCH Release is not just another milestone; it is the trigger event that will redefine BDAG’s market position and set the stage for its next phase of growth. Which Projects Will Hold Their Ground? Bitcoin Hyper, Maxi Doge, and BlockDAG have each found an audience. Yet, not all are equally positioned for lasting relevance. Bitcoin Hyper benefits from the BTC narrative, but its real adoption remains a question mark. Maxi Doge may attract quick attention, though meme appeal without depth often fades fast. BlockDAG’s track record stands apart. With $367 million raised, 24.8 billion coins sold, and a GLOBAL LAUNCH Release ending the $0.0016 price lock on August 11, it offers the largest upside window in the 2025 presale space. In a market where excitement often outpaces results, BlockDAG’s momentum is supported by both scale and measurable progress.

The Tron(TRX) price forecast leans slightly positive as large wallets collect over 1.3 billion tokens, but a move past $0.34 needs more support. The XRP price drop has drawn more concern. A sharp selloff cleared $358 million in leveraged trades, pushing XRP below $2.92 and revealing fragile positions in the process. These two assets show a sense of uncertainty. Cold Wallet (CWT) , however, is showing different momentum. Its presale has already raised $5.8 million, with more than 691 million tokens sold. From its Stage 1 price to today’s $0.00998, the price has climbed 34.5%. With a confirmed launch price of $0.3517, that points to a return of 3,633%. Many are no longer waiting on the sidelines. Tron(TRX) Price Forecast: Will Momentum Break the Barrier? Tron (TRX) is trading close to $0.33, showing some stability even as the market trends lower. The recent buildup of over 1.3 billion TRX in whale wallets has sparked new attention toward the Tron(TRX) price forecast, adding a layer of interest among analysts. If TRX can push past the $0.34 barrier, it might open a path toward $0.40 and perhaps even $0.48. Still, not everything supports that climb. The Money Flow Index is trailing the price move, hinting that overall market liquidity is still lacking. For the Tron(TRX) price forecast to stay strong, bulls need to hold the $0.32 level and close the week with momentum. Sudden XRP Price Drop Follows Large-Scale Liquidations XRP has seen more downward action this week. A wave of leveraged liquidations caused a quick 3% fall, marking the beginning of a sharp XRP price drop. XRP briefly dipped to $2.80, made a short recovery, then fell again by 4% on Tuesday, staying below $2.92. The selloff was triggered by a long-short imbalance of 7,676%, which resulted in $358 million in liquidations. The XRP price drop broke through key support levels, and even though the price bounced off its 50-day EMA, tools like RSI and MACD still show weak buying pressure. Traders are staying cautious, watching for clearer signals. Cold Wallet Presale Demand Surges as ROI Gap Shrinks Cold Wallet’s presale is drawing rare attention in crypto, where the gains are both clear and trackable. Starting at $0.007 in Stage 1 and now at $0.00998 in Stage 17, the token has climbed 34.5% in just days. But with the launch price fixed at $0.3517, a 3,633% return is still possible. Momentum is only picking up. Over $5.8 million has been raised, and 691 million tokens have been bought already. Each stage brings more participants, cutting the upside with each new entry. Traders are responding quickly to the project’s value-driven design. Cold Wallet goes beyond storage. It builds returns from usage. Swaps, bridges, and even gas fees feed back into the system, rewarding users in CWT, the token at its core. The idea of recovering value from everyday transactions is striking a chord. With presale stages closing fast and the ROI margin shrinking, the longer someone waits, the less room remains to catch the full upside. Which Is the Top Trending Crypto Today? Tension is building in the market right now. The Tron(TRX) price forecast holds near $0.33, boosted by 1.3 billion TRX scooped up by whale wallets, but follow-through is uncertain. Bulls need a strong finish to the week to keep the move alive. Meanwhile, a steep XRP price drop followed a 3% decline driven by $358 million in forced liquidations. XRP now trades under $2.92, and weak buy signals suggest traders remain cautious for good reason. In the middle of this caution, Cold Wallet is standing out as a top trending crypto . It has raised $5.8 million, sold 691 million tokens, and locked in a 34.5% presale price jump. The remaining 3,633% ROI isn’t just a number, it’s one of the last setups with visible upside that’s fading by the day.

Elon Musk’s Net Worth as the Benchmark As of August 1, 2025, Forbes places Elon Musk’s net worth at approximately $401.2 billion, reaffirming his position as the world’s richest individual. This figure serves as the reference point for calculating how much XRP one would require to exceed Elon Musk’s fortune at a $10,000 valuation per coin. XRP Supply and the Market Capitalization Implications XRP’s current circulating supply is roughly 59.3 billion tokens, with a maximum total supply of 100 billion. At a hypothetical price of $10,000 per token, the circulating market capitalization would surge to around $593 trillion. THE #XRP SURGE IS HERE! pic.twitter.com/TUW6f9PDdR — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) August 9, 2025 On a fully diluted basis, the figure would approach $1 quadrillion. For perspective, these amounts are many times larger than the total global GDP, underscoring the sheer economic improbability of such valuations. Breaking Down the Calculation Dividing Musk’s estimated $401.2 billion net worth by $10,000 per XRP results in approximately 40.12 million XRP needed to surpass his wealth. Levi’s cited figure of 50 million XRP, while slightly higher, offers a rounded and rhetorically impactful estimate suitable for social media discussion. Practical and Liquidity Constraints Even setting aside the implausible market capitalization, acquiring tens of millions of XRP at or near a $10,000 valuation would be virtually impossible in practice. The act of purchasing such a vast quantity would cause extreme market slippage, diminish liquidity, and deter market makers from participating. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 In addition, Ripple’s programmed escrow releases regularly inject more XRP into circulation, making the token’s available supply dynamic and unpredictable. These realities further diminish the feasibility of the scenario Levi describes. Final Assessment Levi’s statement—“You would need a 50 million XRP to be wealthier than Elon Musk if XRP hits $10,000 per coin”—is an engaging thought experiment and a testament to the aspirational spirit within segments of the crypto community. However, when assessed through the lens of updated net worth figures, current XRP supply data, and macroeconomic constraints, it becomes clear that the premise is far removed from practical financial reality. While the discussion fuels the imagination of XRP enthusiasts, it ultimately serves as a reminder that sound investment decisions should be grounded in verifiable facts and realistic market conditions.

49829348,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=782085,1754784814,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/49829348.jpeg,Elon Musk’s Tesla seeks to enter UK energy market,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/tesla-uk-energy-market/,"Elon Musk’s Tesla plans to enter the UK household energy market soon, challenging major providers like Octopus Energy and British Gas. Official documents show that on July 25, Tesla submitted an application to the UK energy regulator, Ofgem. According to Telegraph , the company requested permission to supply electricity to domestic customers. The filing, signed by Andrew Payne signals a notable step forward in the company’s expansion plans. If approved, “Tesla Electric” could begin serving customers as soon as next year. The new service is expected to work hand in hand with Tesla’s existing products, such as its electric vehicles and Powerwall battery units, with the goal of cutting household power expenses. Tesla already operates a comparable program in Texas, where customers can benefit from cheaper charging rates for their cars and earn payments for sending unused solar-generated or battery-stored electricity back to the grid. Reports from 2023 indicated Tesla’s intent to enter the home energy market, alongside recruitment campaigns for policy and operational roles. With tens of thousands of Powerwall batteries already installed in Britain, devices that can store energy from solar panels or off-peak charging, Tesla holds an infrastructure advantage. Moreover, Tesla offers residential EV charging equipment and has over 250,000 cars on UK roads. This network could be key to rolling out “vehicle-to-home” systems, where a car’s battery can supply power to the household. Several other providers are trialling this type of technology, which Tesla could incorporate. Tesla is also active in wholesale energy trading, using large-scale battery facilities and its Autobidder platform to buy and sell stored power. The company has held an Ofgem generation licence since 2020. Even so, the brand faces headwinds. UK sales of Tesla’s electric cars have dropped sharply, with July showing a 60% year-on-year decline, a trend echoed in other European markets, such as Germany, where deliveries fell over 55% . The slump reflects stiffer EV market competition and controversies linked to Musk, including his public support for political figures like Donald Trump and Tommy Robinson. Tesla is facing persistent sales slump in Europe Analysts note that even Musk’s recent efforts to distance himself from politics have not reversed the European sales downturn, with Tesla registering five consecutive months of falling deliveries across the continent. In the US, the company offers a fixed-rate plan for unlimited vehicle charging during certain time windows. Powerwall owners can also link their units to the grid, allowing Tesla to tap into stored energy at peak times in exchange for payments. This setup, known as a “virtual power plant,” combines small-scale energy sources to help stabilise renewable supply. Although the company hasn’t yet outlined pricing or specific plans for the UK, job postings point to virtual power plant integration as a key feature. The system would capture excess wind and solar power when available, then release it back to the grid during demand surges. Tesla previously joined forces with Octopus Energy in 2020 for a combined energy tariff but ended that collaboration three years later to operate independently. It still works with Octopus so Powerwall owners can use the latter’s software to sell stored power at premium times. Approval for an Ofgem electricity supply licence can take up to nine months, though in some cases the process is quicker.

While the crypto market remains unpredictable, those who identified breakout projects early in the past cycles saw life-changing returns. With the rise of institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and emerging sectors like AI and modular blockchains, the stage is set for a new generation of crypto leaders. While many will come and go, a handful of projects show the right mix of utility, innovation, and momentum to deliver massive potential by the end of the decade. Among these rising stars, MAGACOIN FINANCE has also drawn attention as a bold newcomer, with market watchers comparing its trajectory to some of the most explosive altcoins in history. Lets have a look at five cryptocurrencies that experts say could surge more than 20x by 2030, based on current momentum and forward-looking potential. 1. XRP XRP continues to be one of the most polarizing but promising cryptocurrencies on the market. Its main value proposition – enabling fast, low-cost cross-border payments – remains a major use case in the evolving financial system. What Could Drive Growth by 2030: Regulatory Win: The long-awaited conclusion of Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC could unleash new institutional capital flows into XRP. ODL Expansion: Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) services could become essential for global finance, positioning XRP as a bridge asset between major fiat currencies. Tokenized Finance Boom: As tokenized assets gain ground, XRP’s speed and low fees may make it a top pick for RWA transfers. Some conservative models place XRP in the $5–$10 range by 2030, but a scenario involving full institutional adoption and widespread utility could push it far beyond those levels. 2. Cardano Built on peer-reviewed research and a strong academic foundation, Cardano has steadily grown into one of the most respected Layer 1 platforms. Key Factors for Long-Term Potential: Hydra Scaling : Hydra, Cardano’s Layer 2 solution, aims to drastically improve throughput – essential for large-scale dApp deployment. Use Cases in Developing Nations: Cardano’s partnerships in Africa and other emerging markets could lead to real-world adoption across education, identity, and finance. DeFi and Governance Expansion: A robust ecosystem of DeFi projects and a community-driven governance model position ADA for steady long-term value growth. If Cardano captures just a fraction of global enterprise and government applications, ADA’s price could surge well past its previous highs – and potentially achieve the 20x target. 3. Celestia Celestia is pioneering a new way to build blockchains through its modular architecture, and it’s already become a favorite among developers looking to launch rollup-based systems. Why It’s a Game-Changer: Modular Design: Separating consensus from execution allows developers to build faster, cheaper, and more flexible chains. Rollup Ecosystem: As Ethereum and other blockchains move toward rollup-centric models, Celestia could become a foundational layer for data availability. Early Mover Advantage: Being one of the first major players in the modular blockchain space gives Celestia a potential lead similar to Ethereum’s early dominance. With the entire industry leaning toward modular scaling, TIA could be one of the few infrastructure tokens to achieve a 20x+ return, especially if it becomes the default data layer for rollups and app chains. 4. MAGACOIN FINANCE MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly establishing itself as one of the most promising altcoins for forward-looking investors. With growing hype and multiple sell-out rounds, it’s drawing comparisons to early-stage breakout stars like SHIBA INU and DOGECOIN – but with a far more structured ecosystem behind it. Unlike typical meme coins, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building long-term utility and tokenomics aimed at rewarding early holders. Analysts now project up to a 12,700% return for early MAGACOIN investors as the next bull cycle picks up momentum. The project’s strong presale performance, continuous development, and viral growth on social media suggest it’s far from a short-term trend. If MAGACOIN hits centralized exchanges at the right time and continues building its ecosystem, it could outpace traditional large caps like XRP and SOL – giving early participants a rare opportunity to get in before the wider crypto market catches on. 5. Virtuals Protocol As artificial intelligence continues to dominate tech headlines, Virtuals Protocol is emerging as a key intersection point between AI and blockchain. What Makes It Stand Out: AI Agent Platform: Virtuals allows developers to build and monetize AI agents on-chain – one of the most exciting new frontiers in crypto. Ethereum Layer-2 : Built on Base, it benefits from Ethereum’s security while offering cheaper, faster transactions. Rapid Ecosystem Expansion : If it can become the leading AI agent platform in crypto, VRS could ride both the AI and Web3 waves simultaneously. While still early-stage, the protocol’s vision and positioning have drawn attention from developers and early investors alike. If AI becomes as integral to crypto as many predict, Virtuals Protocol could easily become a 20x winner by the end of the decade. Conclusion The path to 2030 will be filled with volatility, but also opportunity. From legacy projects like XRP and Cardano to newer infrastructure plays like Celestia and Virtuals Protocol, the crypto space is rich with long-term potential. And for those seeking early exposure to a rapidly growing ecosystem, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out with its ambitious vision and projected 1 2,700% upside , making it a serious contender in the race to define the next generation of altcoins.

With millions of Americans contributing to this plan every two weeks, even a small allocation to Bitcoin could create a steady, long-term inflow of capital far exceeding the impact of spot Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). Related Reading: Crypto Is Here To Stay—Even The SEC Can’t Do Anything About It, Analyst Says Bitcoin To Break Into 401(k) Retirement Market Bitcoin’s possible entry into the US $12 trillion 401(k) investment options could represent one of the largest structural inflows in the asset’s history. Tom Dunleavy, the Head of Venture at Varys Capital and a former senior analyst at Messari, declared in an X social media post on August 7 that cryptocurrencies in the 401(k) retirement plan are much bigger and more bullish news than the ETFs. Dunleavy explained that the US currently has around 100 million Americans participating in the 401(k) plan, where a fixed portion of each paycheck is automatically invested into preselected portfolios of stock and bonds. These allocations are typically reviewed annually at most, creating a steady and predictable stream of capital into financial markets. Additionally, over the past two decades, this 401(k) plan has been a critical driver behind the resilience and long-term upward trajectory of US equities. According to Dunleavy, the total value of assets in the 401(k) plans stands at approximately $12 trillion, with around $50 billion in fresh contributions added every two weeks. The analyst suggested that even a small portfolio allocation to Bitcoin would represent significant and recurring inflows. He estimated that a 1% allocation translates to roughly $120 billion in continuous buying, 3% would equate to $360 billion, and 5% would reach a whopping $600 billion. Unlike one-time purchases, Dunleavy notes that these allocations could continue indefinitely once set, creating a persistent demand floor for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. He also compared the 401(k) plan to ETFs, claiming that cryptocurrencies within the investment pool could have a greater long-term impact than the launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Regulatory Backdrop And BTC’s Path To Adoption Dunleavy has indicated that the possible integration of Bitcoin into the 401(k) investment menus is closely tied to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). He noted that ERISA establishes fiduciary standards designed to protect participants’ interests and ensure they receive promised benefits. Under this framework, most fiduciary risk is borne by consultants, who advise plan sponsors on asset allocation and investment options. Related Reading: Ripple-SEC Legal Drama Ends; XRP Skyrockets 13% For over a decade, these consultants have been researching the cryptocurrency market, building the knowledge base and compliance structures necessary to justify a modest crypto allocation—typically ranging between 1% and 5% for pensions and potentially 401(k) participants. Until recently, structural and regulatory constraints meant crypto could not be directly offered as an investment choice. With those barriers potentially shifting, consultants now have both the regulatory cover and the research credibility to recommend adding Bitcoin to retirement plans.

While Betway, bet365, and Ladbrokes focus on revamping interfaces and expanding their bonuses, they still miss the mark on what matters most: fast access, open terms, and borderless features. Betway has improved cash-out tools, bet365 offers football bonuses, and Ladbrokes is upgrading its look, but all three platforms still operate within traditional boundaries that frustrate today’s global user base. In contrast, Spartans is reshaping how players engage with betting sites. With 5,963 games, fast crypto withdrawals, and clearly defined 35x wagering rules, it skips the noise and delivers results. There’s no need to install apps, no locked regions, and no fine print during withdrawals. While older brands like Betway, bet365, and Ladbrokes count on brand familiarity, Spartans makes performance the main attraction. This direct approach is what positions Spartans as a strong force in the race for the top gambling sites in 2025. Betway Has In-Play Strength but Slows Down on Early Payouts Betway has maintained its place in the UK’s betting sector thanks to consistent sponsorships and quality in-play tools. Its live cash-out feature is reliable and particularly useful for real-time football wagering. Bettors who enjoy tweaking their wagers during a live match will appreciate the control Betway provides. Yet, when it comes to early payout options, Betway falls behind its competitors. Its once-popular “You Lead, You Win” campaign across football and golf is currently unavailable, and there’s no word on when or if it will return. Betway typically revives these features seasonally, but for now, users will need to wait. The platform still offers competitive odds and a user-friendly mobile setup. However, its promotional offers don’t keep pace with crypto-first sites, and its slow banking withdrawals are outdated. In contrast to top gambling sites in 2025 like Spartans, which prioritize fast and borderless payouts, Betway hasn’t evolved fast enough to retain speed-focused users. bet365’s Features Are Solid, but Withdrawal Speed Lags bet365 continues to dominate with its betting variety, early payout promotions, and high-quality livestreams. Its “Two Goals Ahead” feature is especially appealing; if your football team leads by two goals, your bet gets settled as a win instantly. This early cash-out tool is one of the best, and it adds real value to football wagers. The site also boasts partial and full cash-out features, hundreds of football markets, and match streams weekly. It’s a platform made for scale and is reliable in its offerings. Yet, it misses out in areas where newer platforms excel. bet365 still leans on conventional withdrawal systems, which means users wait days to receive their winnings. The lack of crypto options and promotional limitations based on location frustrate modern players. When compared to top gambling sites in 2025 like Spartans, bet365’s strength in features is undermined by slower, outdated payout mechanisms. Ladbrokes Keeps the Basics but Fails to Advance As one of the oldest names in the UK betting scene, Ladbrokes continues to offer standard betting features such as football odds, live betting, and accumulator boosts. Its app interface is smooth and easy for both new and returning users. Yet, when judged against other platforms in 2025, Ladbrokes is missing key upgrades. It doesn’t offer early payout options, and there’s no sign that this will change. While welcome offers and occasional price boosts exist, they fail to stand out amid more competitive promotions elsewhere. Ladbrokes also sticks with bank transfers and debit cards, which are slower and less appealing compared to instant crypto options. Top gambling sites in 2025, like Spartans, are leaving platforms like Ladbrokes behind by making crypto payouts standard and eliminating delays. Spartans Builds Its Edge on Speed, Access, and Clarity Spartans has gained a top spot among the top gambling sites in 2025 by cutting out all the delays and delivering what players truly want. The site features 5,963+ games, a full sportsbook, live odds, and an upfront 35x wagering policy valid for 7 days. It removes all regional blocks, ensures no unclear bonus terms, and runs smoothly without any app installation. Its instant crypto withdrawal support, covering BTC, ETH, ADA, BNB, DAI, USDC, and USDT, is a major shift from standard banking delays. This feature alone pulls in users who value time and privacy. Spartans even adds unique promotions like its Lamborghini giveaway, boosting player excitement without relying on flashy tricks. Designed for mobile and desktop without compromising on speed or features, Spartans caters to modern betting expectations. While Betway, bet365, and Ladbrokes work on catching up, Spartans already delivers. No fluff, no clutter, just direct service. Among the top gambling sites in 2025, Spartans is shaping up as the go-to for crypto-friendly, clarity-driven play. Final Takeaway While Betway scores with live options, bet365 brings strong early payouts, and Ladbrokes holds legacy value, none of them provide the full package like Spartans. From 5,963 games to instant crypto withdrawals and honest bonus terms, Spartans addresses exactly what today’s bettors expect. In a year where speed, fairness, and global flexibility matter most, Spartans is setting the bar. For those seeking function over flash and instant access over drawn-out procedures, Spartans easily ranks among the top gambling sites in 2025 .

Instead of focusing only on trading volume or dominance, many are analyzing real value delivery and consistent returns. While Cardano keeps its positive trend and Polkadot shows technical strength, a different project is moving ahead quickly. Cold Wallet , now available on CoinMarketCap, brings cashback features and potential 4,900% returns for presale users, features that established coins currently lack. The question now is about value, not just reputation. Cold Wallet positions itself as the best crypto right now by offering actual benefits at a price below $0.01, showing a clear edge over slower-moving competitors. Cardano Maintains Positive Momentum Despite Recent Decline Cardano remains one of the key assets to watch in 2025. Despite a 5% price dip recently, ADA continues to hold steady above major support lines. Analysts note that the Cardano bullish trend still holds firm, supported by its growing fundamentals. Its DeFi sector shows consistent TVL growth, and updated staking data confirms ongoing user engagement. Though current market sentiment brings short-term selling, the broader trend remains encouraging. ADA price expectations range between $1.10 and $1.30, based on market stability and ongoing ecosystem development. This points to a 3x return potential from current price levels. Yet, interest is clearly rising in newer entries offering quicker returns. When placed next to Cold Wallet’s early-stage pricing and cashback benefits, ADA appears more conservative. For those targeting faster gains, Cardano may no longer qualify as the best crypto right now. Polkadot Charts Indicate Moderate Upside Toward $8 Polkadot’s current price is just over $4, showing resilience after recent turbulence. Latest Polkadot technical analysis places DOT at a key support range, with MACD and RSI indicators showing stable-to-positive trends. If it maintains this zone, analysts anticipate a possible move toward $6.50–$8 soon, suggesting a possible 2x return. Its network development continues at a steady pace, especially in cross-chain functions and parachain operations through XCM. Still, price growth remains modest, with rising competition from newer layer-1 networks limiting attention. Despite strong infrastructure and community, significant upward movement hinges on increased market activity. This steady pace is pushing some retail users to look elsewhere. Many are favoring options with immediate user benefits and strong growth outlooks. Cold Wallet’s cashback utility and its 50x projection now make it one of the top choices for those focusing on usability and fast gains. Cold Wallet: Transforming User Experience in Crypto Most crypto systems today create friction, charging users just to access their funds or interact on-chain. Cold Wallet is removing that barrier. Now listed on CoinMarketCap and priced at only $0.00998, it rewards user activity instead of penalizing it. Whether users transfer assets, pay gas or swap, they receive CWT rewards in return. The idea is simple: make self-custody not just secure, but also rewarding. Cold Wallet’s model offers up to 100% cashback in CWT along with a presale structure that favors early adopters. This makes each action on the network feel beneficial, not like a cost. Its framework is designed to expand: featuring 150 presale stages, currently in Stage 17, with an entry price still under $0.01 and a listing price projected at $0.3517. That means a 4,900% return is still within reach. With over 694 million coins already sold and presale funding now exceeding $5.8 million, momentum is undeniable. In contrast to the cautious tone of Polkadot technical analysis or the slow climb seen in the Cardano bullish trend, Cold Wallet is building pace rapidly. That’s why it’s increasingly seen as the best crypto right now for those prioritizing strong functionality and high upside. Final Takeaway Cardano maintains solid positioning, defending its support range and showing a potential 3x growth path. Polkadot also shows strength, with technical signs pointing to a climb toward $8. While both continue delivering, their growth is slow and steady. Cold Wallet introduces a different pace entirely. With a cashback model, simple self-custody, and verified listing on CoinMarketCap, it’s offering what others don’t. The possibility of a 50x ROI from current pricing, alongside a live presale still below $0.01, makes it a standout. For anyone seeking the best crypto right now that offers utility, growth, and momentum, Cold Wallet is setting the pace.

49830731,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=173999,1754787655,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/49830731.jpeg,Utility + Scalability = 7 Explosive Long-Term Crypto Picks,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/utility-scalability-7-explosive-long-term-crypto-picks/,"As the crypto market matures, investors are moving past hype and focusing on projects with real-world value. Tokens that offer long-term utility — whether through fast, scalable infrastructure or game-changing applications — are catching the attention of smart money and institutional players. Below are seven standout picks that analysts believe will dominate the next cycle, not just because of the narrative, but because of function. From household names to quietly rising stars, these tokens are poised for growth through real-world usage and technical strength. 1. Ethereum (ETH) – The King of Smart Contracts Ethereum continues to be the foundation of decentralized applications. With the success of Ethereum 2.0’s transition to Proof-of-Stake and a thriving Layer-2 ecosystem, ETH remains the top long-term utility asset for developers and institutions alike. 2. Solana (SOL) – Blazing-Fast & Growing Stronger Solana has shaken off its past outages and proven itself as a high-performance blockchain with incredibly low fees. With its adoption in real-world applications (like Visa payments), SOL is becoming the go-to chain for speed and scale. 3. Chainlink (LINK) – Data Feeds Powering DeFi Without Chainlink’s oracle network, DeFi would collapse. LINK’s real-world integrations with banks and legacy systems make it a top utility coin for 2025–2030. Its role is foundational for blockchain to connect with external data securely. 4. Polygon (MATIC) – Layer-2 With Mass Adoption Goals Polygon’s partnerships with companies like Starbucks, Reddit, and Nike prove it’s ready for mainstream use. As a Layer-2 on Ethereum, MATIC enables faster, cheaper transactions while keeping security high. 5. MAGACOIN FINANCE – Expert Forecasts Signal 65x Return Potential Analysts are increasingly watching MAGACOIN FINANCE — a rising altcoin currently in its presale phase. What makes it stand out isn’t just its meme-like energy, but its focus on building a utility-backed ecosystem from day one. Unlike most early-stage tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE has laid out a roadmap centered on long-term usability: staking, governance, and real-world integration. Whale tracking platforms have even flagged high-volume MAGACOIN wallet activity in the past 14 days — a strong early signal that smart money is positioning early. With experts projecting up to 65x ROI for early investors, MAGACOIN FINANCE is shaping up to be a breakout utility coin, not just another meme. 6. Avalanche (AVAX) – Enterprise + DeFi Hybrid Avalanche offers near-instant transaction finality and customizable subnets, making it a favorite for enterprises and DeFi builders alike. Its unique consensus mechanism positions it as one of the most scalable platforms available. 7. Cosmos (ATOM) – Interoperability Pioneer Cosmos is quietly enabling a more connected blockchain world. With its Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, ATOM is helping diverse blockchains work together — a feature that could be critical in the next crypto cycle. Conclusion: Betting on Utility Is the Smart Play This isn’t 2021 anymore — investors are no longer chasing hype alone. As we approach Q4 2025, more crypto holders are looking at utility, scalability, and real-world application as long-term indicators of success. From dominant players like Ethereum and Solana to emerging forces like MAGACOIN FINANCE, these 7 projects offer more than just price action — they offer relevance, adoption, and real value. If the bull market momentum holds, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be this cycle’s surprise success story. With expert forecasts predicting a potential 65x surge, it’s one for every long-term watchlist.

While DOGE continues to face unpredictable swings driven largely by hype and market sentiment, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a fundamentally strong project with real utility and steadily growing investor interest. Currently in Phase 6 of its presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised over $14.25 million, attracting more than 15,000 holders worldwide. Only 15% of its tokens have been sold so far at the attractive price of $0.035, making this an ideal moment to consider MUTM as a more stable and promising DeFi opportunity compared to DOGE’s rollercoaster ride. Dogecoin (DOGE) Tanks 16.7% to $0.20 Dogecoin (DOGE) plummeted 16.7% to ~$0.20, down from $0.24, as part of a broader crypto market sell-off, with $758 million in liquidations, including $23.16 million in DOGE positions, per Coinspeaker data. The drop, reported on August 1, 2025, follows a stronger U.S. dollar and unchanged Fed rates (4.25%-4.5%), prompting traders to exit risky assets. DOGE fell below its 200-day SMA ($0.212), with trading volume spiking to $2.48 billion, per CryptoRank. Technical indicators show a bearish MACD and RSI at 38, with support at $0.194 and resistance at $0.212. Despite whale accumulation of 310 million DOGE ($62M), macro pressures like U.S.-China trade tensions and a weak jobs report fuel bearish sentiment. A rebound above $0.212 could target $0.25, but a break below $0.194 risks $0.18. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s Beta Launch to Transform Speculation Into Utility What sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart from typical meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) is its imminent beta platform launch, expected to coincide with the token’s listing on exchanges. This event will convert MUTM from a speculative asset into a fully functional DeFi ecosystem, enabling users to directly experience the platform’s lending, borrowing, and staking features. Unlike DOGE, which primarily thrives on community hype and limited real-world use cases, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers tangible financial tools that generate ongoing demand for its token. The beta launch will allow users to stake mtTokens in the designated smart contracts to earn MUTM rewards, engage in Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending by depositing assets like BTC, ETH, and earning stable APYs, and explore Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending arrangements with flexible terms with highly volatile assets used as collateral. This shift toward utility-based growth means that as more people interact with the platform, demand for MUTM tokens will grow sustainably, supporting strong price momentum well beyond speculative cycles. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s two-tier lending system offers an appealing contrast to DOGE’s one-dimensional token model. For example, in the P2C lending model, users can borrow USDT stablecoins by pledging ETH as collateral with a conservative 60% loan-to-value ratio, providing lower risk and steady interest returns. On the other hand, the P2P model caters to borrowers and lenders willing to negotiate terms using altcoins like PEPE, SHIB or TRUMP, capturing higher yields and offering greater flexibility. This versatility enables MUTM to appeal to a broad spectrum of DeFi participants, increasing its growth potential beyond the reach of meme coins tied purely to market sentiment. Layer-2 Upgrade and Roadmap Milestones Position MUTM for Long-Term Growth Another powerful driver behind Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s expected rise is its Layer-2 integration, which will significantly reduce gas fees and increase transaction speeds on the platform. This enhancement will create a cost-efficient and user-friendly environment, addressing two major barriers that limit adoption on many existing Layer-1 blockchains. By cutting costs and speeding up operations, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will attract more DeFi users looking for practical lending and borrowing solutions, strengthening MUTM token demand in the process. Meanwhile, the project’s well-structured roadmap is progressing steadily, with Phase 1 mostly complete and Phase 2 already in development. These milestones build confidence among investors that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will deliver its promised features on time. Furthermore, the upcoming token listings on major exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, KuCoin, Kraken, and MEXC will expose MUTM to a wider audience, including institutional investors who prefer projects with proven roadmaps and audit-backed security. The platform’s recent CertiK audit, which scored 95 on token security and 78 on its advanced Skynet monitoring, confirms that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is serious about protecting investor assets and maintaining transparency. This level of security will likely attract cautious investors who have been burned by volatile meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and are seeking a safer, more utility-rich alternative. Adding to the appeal, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is running a $100,000 giveaway event where ten lucky winners will each receive $10,000 worth in MUTM tokens. This generous incentive encourages early participation and rewards the growing community of supporters. However, with only 15% of Phase 6 tokens sold, this opportunity is limited. The token price is set to increase by 15% to $0.040 soon, making now one of the last chances to buy MUTM at a favorable price before the presale moves forward.

According to multiple analysts, three tokens stand out during this correction: XRP, Shiba Inu (SHIB), and MAGACOIN FINANCE, a rising star among political crypto projects. XRP Eyes $11–$37 Targets Based on Historical Cycles XRP continues to attract bullish outlooks from analysts despite macro headwinds. Market expert EGRAG recently identified a key ascending resistance trendline, dubbed “The Chasm,” that has historically limited XRP’s rallies. In past cycles, a breakout from this level triggered explosive gains. If XRP merely “touches” the Chasm line, projections place it around $11. Meanwhile, a full breakout similar to its 2017 move could push it as high as $37, according to EGRAG. Supporting this outlook, other technical analysts point to XRP’s recent breakout from a bull flag formation. Chart Nerd, a prominent analyst, highlights XRP’s $2.60 support zone and sets near-term targets at $8 and $15. He emphasized whale accumulation and renewed social momentum as key drivers during this dip. These developments make XRP one of the best altcoin to buy during this dip. Shiba Inu Targets 156% Rally as Technical Setup Strengthens Shiba Inu (SHIB) also enters the spotlight as one of the best altcoin to buy during a dip, following a confirmed bullish divergence on the two-day chart. According to analyst Javon Marks, SHIB could rally over 156%, aiming for a target near $0.000032, if it maintains support at the current consolidation level around $0.0000125. Further backing the bullish narrative, SHIB recently broke out of a descending channel, with analyst Jonathan Carter identifying key resistance levels at $0.00001400, $0.00001750, and beyond. High-volume zones and whale activity continue to suggest that the memecoin could be preparing for its next leg up. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Best Altcoin to Buy for 700% Potential? Likewise, MAGACOIN FINANCE is standing out as the most promising altcoin among emerging projects. With a politically charged narrative, meme utility, and strong anti-centralization messaging, the token has gained ground across analyst reviews and community discussions. Several presale rounds have already sold out, and analysts are forecasting an easy 700% gain based on early momentum, viral engagement, and strategic roadmap execution. MAGACOIN FINANCE is particularly attractive to retail traders seeking alternatives to institutional products stalled by regulatory uncertainty. As traders pivot away from slow-moving ETF approvals and into trend-driven opportunities, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become the best altcoin to buy now, not just during this dip, but for the broader 2025 cycle. Conclusion While the broader crypto market remains under pressure, savvy investors are using this dip as a strategic buying opportunity. Analysts are placing XRP, Shiba Inu (SHIB), and MAGACOIN FINANCE at the top of their watchlists. This is thanks to strong technical setups, growing community momentum, and significant upside potential. While all three altcoins present compelling opportunities, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s early-stage momentum and unique narrative could offer the most significant upside for risk-tolerant investors.

Yet, maintaining its stance at the $3.3000 resistance level is notable following the strong bullish rally seen yesterday. Daily Candle Stalls, But XRPBTC Pair Shows Strength Cryptowzrd provided a detailed breakdown of XRP’s current market setup, noting that the daily candle closed indecisively. Despite this, the XRPBTC pair ended the session with a somewhat bullish tone. According to the expert, a decisive move above 0.0028750 BTC could spark a rapid and impulsive upside rally, adding significant momentum to XRP’s bullish prospects from its present position. Related Reading: Analyst Warns XRP Investors Not To Let Fear Dictate Moves As Long As Price Holds This Level He pointed out that XRP was hovering near the $3.23 resistance level, a key zone that has the potential to unlock further gains. Should this level give way, the price could advance toward the next major resistance at $3.65. The momentum from such a breakout could be amplified if paired with strength in the BTC market. Beyond the $3.65 threshold, Cryptowzrd foresees the possibility of XRP surging toward a new all-time high near $4.60. He stressed that such a move would likely be driven by a strong, impulsive rally fueled by increased buying pressure and market enthusiasm. This scenario would mark a significant milestone in XRP’s current recovery phase. On the downside, $2.80 remains the critical daily support level to watch. Maintaining this support is vital for preserving the overall bullish market structure. A breakdown below it could alter the current outlook, potentially inviting deeper corrections and cooling bullish sentiment. Looking ahead, Cryptowzrd confirmed that his attention will remain on lower time frame chart formations in the coming sessions. He is particularly focused on identifying the next viable scalp opportunity, as the current secured position continues to work in favor of the broader strategy. Volatility Persists As Traders Eye $3.23 Retest Wrapping up the analysis, the analyst highlighted that XRP’s intraday chart experienced significant volatility on Friday and is likely to maintain that intensity in the near term. Such choppy price action presents both risks and opportunities for short-term traders. Related Reading: XRP Price Poised for Fresh Upward Move Amid Renewed Bullish Pressure The analyst pointed out that a retest of the $3.23 level as support, followed by a bullish reversal, could pave the way for another promising long position. Conversely, a decisive breakout above the $3.23 intraday resistance would likely propel XRP toward the $3.65 resistance zone, offering a clear upside target. For now, Cryptowzrd stressed the importance of patience, emphasizing that the next move should come from a healthy and mature trade setup.

With Solana holding steady and Ethereum under heavy sell pressure near resistance, analysts now point to MAGACOIN FINANCE as the alternative for high-growth investors. Dogecoin Whales Accumulate 1 Billion Tokens Dogecoin (DOGE) is back in the spotlight after crypto whales snapped up over 1 billion DOGE, worth nearly $200 million, within just 24 hours. According to analyst Ali Martinez, these high-volume purchases now account substantial portion of DOGE’s total circulating supply. The massive accumulation centers on the potential approval of a spot DOGE ETF in the U.S., with approval odds surging from 56% to 74% in recent days. Such a product would open the floodgates for institutional investment and help DOGE challenge top-tier altcoins. Solana and Ethereum Show Stability, but Limited Upside While DOGE builds momentum, Solana continues to shine with strong fundamentals. Trading at $163.51 with a market cap of $88.04 billion, Solana is praised for its fast transaction speeds and low fees. However, its price movement has been relatively stable, with daily volume down 8.74%, prompting investors to seek faster-moving opportunities. Ethereum, on the other hand, is facing a more fragile setup. Currently priced at $3,651, ETH is struggling against a long-standing resistance zone between $3,600–$4,000. This level previously triggered a 66% drop in late 2024. CryptoQuant data shows a Net Taker Volume outflow of -$418.8 million, the second-largest ever recorded, suggesting panic selling or heavy profit-taking. With technical indicators like RSI cooling off, analysts warn ETH could drop another 25%–35% unless it breaks through resistance with strong volume. MAGACOIN FINANCE Emerges as Top Altcoin Pick As blue-chip tokens like ETH and SOL stabilize, investors are hunting for the next high-upside gem—and many believe they’ve found it in MAGACOIN FINANCE . Top analysts are now singling out MAGACOIN FINANCE as a standout contender for long-term growth, endorsing it as a leading crypto to buy for sustainable gains. The project blends meme-driven virality with a utility-focused roadmap, echoing the early stages of PEPE’s 2022 breakout. MAGACOIN FINANCE remains in an exclusive early-access phase with limited supply, offering a strategic entry point ahead of major exchange listings. Conclusion With DOGE whales betting big, Solana maintaining its DeFi dominance, and Ethereum facing serious resistance, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the most promising crypto for investors seeking early-phase exposure and massive growth potential. Analysts are already ranking it as a top pick for 2025’s most notable project. For investors willing to look early and think differently, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents a high-conviction opportunity in a rapidly maturing meme sector.

This August, three standout projects are commanding investor interest: MAGACOIN FINANCE , Qubetics , and Ravi . Each brings a unique strategy to the table: meme-backed momentum, AI-integrated infrastructure, and SocialFi innovation. But one is clearly leading in metrics, trust, and momentum — and analysts agree it’s MAGACOIN’s cycle to dominate. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Meme Momentum With Real Backing Unlike typical meme coins that lean only on hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting a new standard for trust-first community tokens. MAGACOIN FINANCE has successfully passed rigorous audits and supported by an active, trusted investor network The community is growing rapidly and experiencing increased inflows from ETH and XRP wallets. More impressively, the retention rate is high. Early participants aren’t exiting — they’re staking, referring, and growing the brand organically. Insiders suggest CEX listings are imminent, which could propel MAGACOIN FINANCE into its next phase of visibility. With crypto research groups and alpha communities already calling it one of the most confident bets of Q3 , analysts now project a realistic 20x–35x return window , with further upside depending on listing velocity. Qubetics: AI Infrastructure for Web3 Devs Qubetics is emerging as the go-to solution for developers seeking to integrate artificial intelligence directly into decentralized applications. It’s building a “plug-and-play” AI environment, where models like GPT-4 can be connected to DeFi tools, DAOs, or NFT marketplaces using decentralized compute modules. Early reviews from blockchain dev communities point to strong demand for this use case, especially as app-layer AI gains adoption. With a conservative presale cap and a first-mover advantage in AI x Web3 infrastructure there is a growing expectation.. Ravi: The SocialFi Sleeper With Wallet-Native Utility Ravi is a lesser-known but fast-rising SocialFi project building a content network where embedded smart wallets power every interaction. From tipping and posting to voting and monetising, all actions are handled via a native zkSync-based wallet layer — removing friction and improving speed. What sets Ravi apart is its working prototype, strong UX, and focus on onboarding creators outside the crypto-native crowd. Its tokenomics are lean, and the entry point is low — making it a potential for investors who favor product-first startups with mass-market appeal. Conclusion: Three Narratives, One Clear Leader Qubetics offers AI-powered building blocks. Ravi delivers SocialFi wrapped in smart UX. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is leading August’s presale rankings because of one thing: execution . With audits in hand, a vibrant community, and exchange momentum building fast, MAGACOIN FINANCE is primed not only to deliver — but to outperform every expectation.

The FIRE movement (Financial Independence, Retire Early) has found a new ally in cryptocurrency, where explosive returns can significantly outperform traditional portfolios. While the risk is high, so is the potential reward—and that’s exactly what draws a new wave of early retirement seekers to this path. A balanced FIRE plan might typically focus on low-cost index funds, real estate, or dividend stocks. But crypto enthusiasts have flipped the script, betting on digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum to act as growth engines that outperform legacy systems. Within this evolving playbook, emerging altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE are attracting attention as high-upside additions to early-stage portfolios, especially for those looking to maximize gains before broader adoption. Crypto FIRE Strategy: How It Works Rather than relying on slow and steady compounding over decades, a crypto-centric FIRE strategy places calculated bets on faster-moving assets. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) typically form the foundation due to their long-term track records and institutional backing. But for meaningful upside, investors allocate to altcoins with high growth potential and strong communities behind them. Projects in sectors like DeFi, GameFi, and infrastructure tokens round out the strategy, aiming to catch early-stage growth before prices explode. Success depends not just on what you invest in, but how you invest—employing tactics like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) to reduce emotional decision-making and mitigate volatility. Periodic rebalancing is key, especially after sharp market movements. Selling partial gains from top performers and reinvesting in undervalued tokens can maintain healthy risk exposure while banking profits. For U.S. investors, self-directed crypto IRAs can also unlock long-term tax benefits that make early retirement even more achievable. Why This New Altcoin is Gaining Traction With Early Retirees For those chasing big returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being called one of the best altcoins to watch right now. Experts estimate it could deliver a 67x ROI in the upcoming market run, citing its rapidly expanding user base, early-stage growth potential, and structured presale phases that reward early participation. Unlike meme coins with no clear path forward, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building out a full ecosystem of utility, staking, and community-driven development. As momentum builds, comparisons are being made to the early days of breakout tokens like SHIBA INU—but with a clearer roadmap and increasing support from long-term crypto investors. With investor demand rising fast and current rounds selling out quicker each time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming a favorite for those looking to retire early with a bold, high-growth strategy. The Path to Early Retirement Early retirement through crypto isn’t guaranteed—but with the right portfolio, the right mindset, and a commitment to long-term strategies like DCA and rebalancing, it’s more possible than ever. For investors looking beyond the mainstream cryptocurrencies that have already established themselves, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE offer the kind of upside that could supercharge a portfolio and turn calculated risk into real wealth .

As the market heats up ahead of Q4 2025, four standout presales are drawing serious attention. Each offers real utility, strong demand, and growing ecosystems. But one project stands out as the top pick for early ROI. MAGACOIN FINANCE—Best Bet for Early ROI Hunters MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of the most anticipated presales in the 2025 crypto market. It combines a bold, meme-driven identity with a growing online presence that has captivated early investors. Designed to offer more than just hype, it aims to create lasting impact in the altcoin space through community strength and viral momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE, crowned the best crypto presale for early ROI hunters, has drawn serious attention from analysts and retail buyers. Its explosive presale traction, combined with a dedicated base of supporters, positions it as a front-runner in this cycle’s high-ROI opportunities. While many projects promise gains after launch, MAGACOIN delivers excitement right from its presale stage. Pepe Dollar (PEPD)—Meme Power Meets Real-World Utility Pepe Dollar (PEPD) isn’t just another meme coin. Built as an Ethereum Layer-2 token, PEPD combines humor and utility into a unique ecosystem. It satirizes fiat systems while offering tools for DeFi, token creation, and crypto gaming. The presale is still in Stage 1, priced at $0.004688, with over 90% of tokens already snapped up. Interest surged with a 20% instant bonus promo, making this one of the fastest-selling meme projects of the year. Its blend of satire, serious features, and early-stage pricing gives Pepe Dollar the potential to punch far above its weight in 2025. BlockchainFX (BFX)—The All-in-One Super App for Traders BlockchainFX is quickly becoming a favorite for investors looking for real utility during the presale stage. This token powers a working super app that blends crypto, stocks, commodities, and forex trading. BFX’s ecosystem has passed a CertiK audit and follows strict KYC compliance. Over 10,000 daily users are already generating live revenue. More than $4.68 million has been raised so far, showing massive presale traction. What makes $BFX unique is its ability to offer daily USDT rewards to token holders—up to 7% even before public launch. The current presale price of $0.018 offers over 2.7x gains before its confirmed launch at $0.05. With Visa card benefits and a 30% bonus (BLOCK30), BFX is a standout in presales with working features and actual profits. BlockDAG (BDAG)—A Live Platform Before Token Launch BlockDAG (BDAG) is taking an unusual but effective path. While most crypto presales promote future promises, BDAG offers access to a fully operational trading platform during the presale itself. Users can now test buy and sell functions, track price charts, and interact with real-time data. It’s a functional dashboard—not just a concept. That transparency builds serious trust among early participants. This bold strategy puts BlockDAG in a unique category. It allows presale users to simulate real trading before the token even hits the market. That live experience sets BDAG apart from traditional presale hype. Final Thoughts Each of these four presales—MAGACOIN FINANCE, PEPD, BFX, and BDAG—offers strong ROI potential. However, MAGACOIN FINANCE leads the charge with its unmatched blend of narrative, community, and projected returns. As early buyers prepare for Q4, these tokens are dominating watchlists and analyst picks across the board.

BlockDAG has now raised $367 million during its presale and is offering a $0.0016 token price until August 11, with listings already confirmed on 20 exchanges. That alone puts it at the top of investor watchlists. But it’s not just momentum, it’s delivery. BlockDAG already has live tools like a working trading simulator and widely adopted mining apps. Compared to price action in Sui and XRP, BlockDAG stands out for offering not just upside, but real access. The numbers are growing, and the countdown is on. If you’re looking for the crypto gem of 2025 , it’s time to pay attention. Sui’s Institutional Support & Wallet Explosion Signal Growth Sui is gaining strength with a wave of institutional support. The biggest driver? Swiss-regulated AMINA Bank added SUI to its trading and custody offerings. That single move triggered a record-breaking 1.28 million new wallets in a day, pushing the total above 257 million. That kind of adoption is hard to ignore. Technically, SUI is staying strong at $3.50 and forming a bullish double-bottom pattern. Analysts are pointing toward a breakout past $5, backed by on-chain activity, retail demand, and expanding developer contributions. It’s clear Sui is climbing the ranks, and that’s why many are calling it a rising crypto gem of 2025 . XRP’s Breakout Pattern Could Lead to One of 2025’s Biggest Moves XRP isn’t done yet. Analysts are highlighting a chart setup that mirrors earlier patterns that came just before massive rallies. If XRP can push past current resistance, it could hit $48.90, a move that would be one of the year’s biggest among top-cap tokens. Short-term indicators suggest a 20% run could come by the end of the month. Whale accumulation is up, and fewer tokens are hitting exchanges, pointing to stronger holder confidence. For traders watching for technical setups with explosive potential, XRP’s breakout formation is one of the most exciting right now. Still, while XRP offers momentum, it’s BlockDAG that delivers both upside and entry-level affordability, something large caps just can’t match. BlockDAG Is the Crypto Gem of 2025, & It’s Just Getting Started What sets BlockDAG apart is simple: it’s already delivering. While most presales are just promises, BDAG has launched real products ahead of listing. Its Dashboard V4 simulates a full trading experience with charts, trade orders, and wallet tracking. That’s real utility, already in the hands of users. The X1 mobile miner has pulled in over 2.5 million users, while the X10 hardware miner offers up to 200 BDAG daily when paired with X1. This dual system allows everyday users and serious earners alike to join the network with ease. BlockDAG’s architecture combines blockchain and DAG tech for unmatched speed, between 2,000 and 15,000 transactions per second. It’s EVM-compatible and includes a low-code smart contract builder, opening the door for fast dApp deployment and future cross-chain upgrades. But it doesn’t stop there. Daily Buyer Battles reward top buyers with unsold tokens, while a 10 BTC Auction is live now. Buy before August 11, and you’re in. The higher your purchase, the better your odds. On top of that, 20 exchanges are ready to list BDAG the moment the $600M presale cap is hit. The returns? At $0.0016: Reaching $0.05 = 3,025% ROI Reaching $1 = 62,400% ROI Reaching $10 = 624,900% ROI These are numbers based on fixed pricing, not hype. For anyone chasing returns in 2025, BlockDAG is a true crypto gem of 2025 with the math to prove it. Summing Up Crypto investors are shifting their focus in 2025, from pure speculation to substance. Sui is winning attention for its regulated growth and wallet boom. XRP is exciting traders with breakout potential and whale support. But BlockDAG is doing what others aren’t, delivering real tools, community engagement, and a presale that offers instant exposure and a chance at massive ROI. With over $367 million already raised, a live ecosystem, and 2.5 million+ users onboard, BDAG is no longer just promising, it’s executing. At $0.0016, the upside is massive, and there’s no token vesting. With 20 exchanges lined up, liquidity is ready the moment the presale ends. For anyone looking for real value, scale-ready architecture, and one last chance before the price resets, BlockDAG leads as the most complete crypto gem of 2025 , ready for liftoff.

New Bullish Pattern Has Traders Loading Up Fast,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/xrp-double-bottom-breakout-new-bullish-pattern-has-traders-loading-up-fast/,"XRP is back in the spotlight, and this time, technical traders are leading the charge. A classic double bottom formation is taking shape on the 4-hour chart – a signal widely recognized as bullish . XRP has bounced twice off support and is now approaching the critical $3.00 neckline. If buying momentum continues, many believe this could open the door to a short-term rally targeting $3.15 and possibly even $3.31. But there’s a growing conversation among seasoned investors: while XRP remains one of the most important names in crypto, is its most explosive era already in the rearview? With its market cap already towering above $175 billion, and years of price action behind it, many wonder if opportunities for massive gains now lie elsewhere. And increasingly, that “elsewhere” is pointing toward earlier-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP’s Double Bottom Draws Short-Term Optimism The technical structure spotted by EGRAG CRYPTO is compelling. With lows near $2.81 and $2.91 and a neckline forming at $3, XRP’s double bottom is a textbook reversal signal. Traders are watching volume and market confirmation closely – if the price convincingly breaks the neckline, XRP could rapidly test resistance at $3.15 and $3.31. Still, there’s an underlying sense that XRP – while strong – isn’t built for the kind of meteoric 50x or 100x moves seen in newer assets. Regulatory wins and institutional flows could boost the price over time, but its maturity and size naturally cap its upside potential in the short term. That’s prompting many to look toward faster-moving, earlier-stage altcoins . MAGACOIN FINANCE Emerges as a Prime Contender For investors actively seeking the next big altcoin breakout, MAGACOIN FINANCE is climbing rapidly to the top of their watchlists. The project just earned top-tier security ratings , a major green flag in today’s risk-aware environment. At the same time, its community is expanding fast , with both everyday crypto users and seasoned analysts joining early . Unlike coins already listed on major exchanges, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in its presale phase, giving new investors a rare opportunity to secure a position before the mass adoption. Analysts are increasingly comparing its trajectory to the early days of Avalanche and Cardano, both of which exploded in value after hitting key momentum milestones. As one analyst recently noted, “MAGACOIN FINANCE is following the same playbook – strong foundation, real community traction, and perfect timing .” Same Market, Different Stories XRP will likely remain a central player in crypto for years to come, especially as Ripple expands partnerships and regulatory clarity improves. But the game has changed. Investors today are hunting for flexibility, fast growth, and fresh narratives. And that’s something MAGACOIN FINANCE offers . Unlike XRP, it’s not limited by a decade of price history or regulatory baggage. It’s agile, community-driven, and built with today’s market expectations in mind. For those who missed previous cycles – or simply want to diversify into higher-upside assets – MAGACOIN FINANCE presents a compelling alternative . Conclusion XRP’s double bottom may deliver solid short-term returns, especially if momentum breaks through the $3 neckline. But when it comes to portfolio-defining moves, the best returns often come from early conviction – not late confirmation. That’s why MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly gaining ground with serious investors. With many milestones now surpassed, top security credentials in place, and a thriving presale underway, it’s attracting attention not just as another altcoin – but as a rare opportunity at the right time.

Cardano’s recent breakout has bulls eyeing $1.50, while Chainlink is shaping up for a possible $28 retest. But another name is quietly gaining traction, and doing more than just keeping up. Cold Wallet is still early in its presale journey but is already generating buzz with a bold 4,900% ROI forecast and a referral model that pays users instantly. While ADA and LINK may be aiming for 2–4x growth, Cold Wallet is eyeing a much bigger leap. With real-time USDT rewards, bonus CWT for referrals, and a presale price still under one cent, Cold Wallet stands out as one of the most talked-about presales in the market right now. Cardano Price Watch: Holding Steady as Bulls Target $1.50 Cardano has shaken off weeks of sideways action and is now showing signs of strength. With ADA pushing past key levels above $0.45, excitement is building again. Analysts are watching for a sustained move toward $1.50, with some long-range outlooks hinting at even higher milestones down the line. Developer activity remains strong, and DeFi TVL continues to rise on the network, adding to the growing optimism. Still, ADA’s growth curve is expected to be slow and steady. It’s built on fundamentals and community strength, but not known for wild swings. Many who hold Cardano are now branching out to newer names with more aggressive upside, and Cold Wallet is landing on their radar thanks to its current low price and high ROI outlook. Chainlink Price Forecast: Bulls Look for a Break Above $25 Chainlink is trending upward as demand for oracles increases. After holding above $16 and recovering from its consolidation near $12, LINK is showing bullish momentum. The current Chainlink price forecast puts $28 as the next big target, with heavy attention on the $25–$28 range. A clear break above this could bring a new leg up, fueled by expanding usage across smart contract platforms. Utility is what sets Chainlink apart. More protocols are leaning on LINK to power real-world data feeds, giving it long-term value. But even if it hits $28, the jump from here is roughly a 2x. Compare that with Cold Wallet’s 4,900% ROI potential, and the difference is clear, Cold Wallet is offering a level of upside that’s hard to ignore, especially at its current Stage 17 presale price of $0.00998. How Cold Wallet Rewards Its Users for Using Crypto! What makes Cold Wallet stand out isn’t just price. It’s how users are rewarded. The in-app referral system is already live and paying users in USDT. Whether you’re completing a swap or inviting someone new, the model is simple, both the sender and receiver earn. Once a $5 balance is hit, rewards are unlocked automatically. It’s instant, clear, and totally user-friendly. But there’s more. During the presale, those referrals are supercharged with bonus CWT. Anyone who brings in new users earns 10% extra in CWT, and the person they invite gets 5%. All of it is distributed with a matching vesting schedule to keep things fair and sustainable. The rewards are pulled from a separate pool, so it won’t affect the core supply. No complicated tiers, no locked dashboards, just clean, one-level rewards that work. Cold Wallet is currently in Stage 17, priced at $0.00998, and has already raised over $5.78 million. The goal? A listing price of $0.3517, which represents a massive 4,900% return from today’s level. That kind of jump is what’s drawing serious attention, not just because of the upside, but because of the timing. Unlike Cardano and Chainlink, which are mature players with limited near-term growth, Cold Wallet still has room to run. It’s not just hype, it’s a chance to ride something early with real rewards already flowing through the app. Final Thoughts Cardano’s breakout is real, and Chainlink’s bullish structure is impressive. But their growth stories are unfolding slowly. Cold Wallet, on the other hand, is taking a more aggressive route, rewarding users instantly and offering one of the highest potential ROIs on the market today. With real-time USDT payouts and referral bonuses in CWT during the presale, it’s doing what many projects only promise, giving back as it grows. In a market full of clones and gimmicks, Cold Wallet is creating a system that’s both easy to join and rewarding to stick with.

Three transfers were logged, totaling 1 billion XRP. The largest single transfer was 500 million XRP, valued at approximately $1.64 billion, to an unknown wallet. Two additional releases attributed to Ripple accounted for 500 million XRP, recorded as 100 million XRP (approximately $328 million) and 400 million XRP (nearly $1.31 billion). Together, these movements represent an approximate total value of $3.28 billion. Xaif (@Xaif_Crypto), a popular figure in the XRP community, shared the news of the Escrow unlocks, as this occurred days after its usual schedule. Massive #XRP Escrow Unlock! 500M XRP ($1.64B) – Unknown wallet 100M XRP ($328M) – Ripple 400M XRP ($1.31B) – Ripple Total: 1B XRP worth $3.28B unleashed in minutes! pic.twitter.com/zfsKBnYYHh — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) August 9, 2025 Unusual Escrow Activity On August 2, Ripple locked 700 billion tokens and did not record any further unlocks. The company often unlocks 1 billion tokens at the start of every month, and this is his daily work. The sudden release of these tokens shocked many in the XRP community. In May, a similar occurrence shocked the market, as the company locked 700 million tokens while the 1 billion token release had not happened . Although Ripple has now released its 1 billion tokens for August, one of the transactions references tokens unlocked from an unknown wallet; the community is left with more questions about Ripple’s escrow activity than usual. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Earlier in 2024, Ripple’s escrow mechanism faced irregularities that also raised questions. The unlock system failed for the first few months of the year, resulting in a smaller amount being unlocked at the beginning of each month. When these errors occurred, Ripple always made up the difference, releasing the remaining tokens later in each of the affected months. However, the current anomaly appears not to have originated from a similar error with the escrow system, and the token unlock, although late, indicates that Ripple is adhering to its release schedule. Market Impact and Next Steps Large and concentrated transfers out of escrow can affect liquidity metrics and influence trader behavior. XRP is currently trading at $3.24, showing a slight decrease of 1.84%. However, the asset has an excited community, as it is up over 16% from last week. Market participants will closely monitor XRP’s short-term movements to determine the impact of the escrow unlock on price activity.

While bulls still aim for $200K, analysts are flagging short-term risks. Ethereum and Litecoin are also nearing pivotal resistance zones. Meanwhile, a new player, MAGACOIN FINANCE, is gaining recognition as one of the top altcoins to buy, with breakout potential that’s drawing comparisons to Shiba Inu’s early phase. Bitcoin: $200K Still on the Horizon, But First, A Correction? Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading around $114,000 after peaking above $123,000 in mid-July. However, key technical indicators have flashed red. The weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dipped below its 14-week simple moving average, a crossover that preceded 25–33% corrections twice in 2024. If history repeats, BTC could fall to $95,000 before resuming its long-term uptrend. Despite this near-term risk, macro sentiment remains bullish. Analysts such as Ash Crypto suggest Bitcoin may still be mirroring its 2017 cycle, which ended in a parabolic move. With institutional support intact and long-term holders still accumulating, the $200,000 target is not off the table, but it may require some short-term pain before another leg up. Ethereum: Heavy Selling Pressure Near Resistance Ethereum (ETH) is also battling a multiyear resistance zone between $3,600 and $4,000, the same level that triggered a brutal 66% decline in late 2024. On-chain data reveals a worrying trend: Net Taker Volume dropped to -$418.8 million this week, the second-largest daily outflow in ETH’s history, with over 115,000 more ETH sold than bought via market orders. This suggests a cooling rally as traders take profits and momentum slows. Still, ETH’s fundamentals remain intact, with the broader Ethereum ecosystem continuing to expand across DeFi and Web3. If bulls can reclaim $4,000, it could open the door to a run toward new highs. But for now, caution dominates the charts. Litecoin: Mining Fatigue and Sideways Action Litecoin (LTC) is down roughly 10% from its July high, now trading near $109. With daily trading volume at $1.4 billion, analysts note that miner sentiment is waning. Institutional mining activity has stalled, and whale wallets have shown signs of redistribution despite retail interest picking up. LTC’s price is currently consolidating between the $106.30 Fib support and the 50-day EMA resistance at $118.60. Social sentiment remains flat, with dominance at just 0.73%. While Litecoin has proven resilient in past cycles, it will need a strong catalyst—perhaps a surprise ETF narrative or Bitcoin’s recovery—to regain upward momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The SHIB-Style Breakout Setup in Early Access While major caps like BTC, ETH, and LTC face headwinds, MAGACOIN FINANCE is stealing the spotlight as one of the most talked-about early-stage altcoins. Analysts are drawing parallels to SHIBA INU’s explosive 2021 rally, citing MAGACOIN’s political theme appeal, limited supply, and strong community traction. What sets it apart is timing; it’s still pre-CEX listing, where the biggest gains tend to occur. Crypto whales and early buyers are positioning themselves now, with top market commentators identifying it as one of the best cryptos to buy for significant growth. As sentiment shifts from large-cap consolidation to narrative-driven plays, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out. Its early-access window is closing fast, and history has shown that breakout setups don’t stay quiet for long. For those looking to outperform in the next wave, MAGACOIN may be the name to watch. Conclusion The crypto market is shifting gears. While Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin reassess their positions near key resistance levels, a new narrative is emerging around low-cap, high-potential tokens. Amid this, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining traction as the best crypto to buy for significant growth.

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with excitement as the Bitcoin price has achieved a significant milestone, surging remarkably above the $118,000 mark. According to recent Bitcoin World market monitoring , BTC is currently trading at an impressive $118,020.83 on the Binance USDT market. This notable BTC surge is capturing the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike, signaling a robust movement within the broader crypto market . For those engaged in Bitcoin trading , this development represents a pivotal moment, shaping the landscape of future cryptocurrency news . What’s Fueling This Remarkable BTC Surge? Many factors contribute to such significant price movements in the digital asset space. The recent BTC surge can be attributed to a confluence of bullish indicators and growing market confidence. Firstly, increasing institutional adoption plays a crucial role. Major corporations and financial institutions are showing greater interest in Bitcoin, viewing it as a legitimate store of value and an attractive investment. Institutional Inflows: Large-scale investments from funds and corporations provide substantial buying pressure. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic uncertainties often drive investors towards decentralized assets like Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. Halving Impact: The recent Bitcoin halving event, which reduces the supply of new BTC, historically precedes significant price appreciation due to supply-demand dynamics. These elements collectively build a strong foundation for sustained growth, drawing more participants into the ecosystem. Navigating the Current Crypto Market Rally: What Investors Should Know The upward trajectory of Bitcoin often sets the tone for the entire crypto market . When Bitcoin performs strongly, it typically pulls altcoins along, creating a broader rally. This current market environment presents both opportunities and considerations for investors. Understanding the sentiment and technical indicators is crucial for informed decision-making. As the market experiences this renewed vigor, it is important to observe liquidity and trading volumes. High volumes accompanying price increases often indicate strong conviction behind the move, rather than mere speculative spikes. However, volatility remains a characteristic of the crypto space, and prudent risk management is always advised. Understanding Bitcoin Trading at These Elevated Levels For active participants in Bitcoin trading , the $118,000 level becomes a new psychological and technical benchmark. Traders are now observing whether this level can transform into a strong support zone for future price action. Identifying key support and resistance levels is vital for strategic entry and exit points. While the current momentum is strong, traders often look for signs of consolidation or potential pullbacks before the next leg up. Monitoring order books on major exchanges like Binance, where BTC is actively traded, can provide insights into immediate supply and demand dynamics. Additionally, derivatives markets often reflect broader sentiment and can influence spot prices. What This Means for Future Cryptocurrency News and Trends? This significant move in the Bitcoin price is likely to dominate cryptocurrency news headlines for weeks to come. It reaffirms Bitcoin’s position as the leading digital asset and could pave the way for increased mainstream adoption and regulatory clarity. As Bitcoin continues to gain traction, we may see more traditional financial products emerging, further bridging the gap between conventional finance and the digital asset world. The long-term outlook appears increasingly positive, with many analysts forecasting even higher targets. However, the path to these targets is rarely linear. Investors should remain informed about global economic shifts, regulatory developments, and technological advancements within the blockchain space, as these factors will continue to influence market trends. In conclusion, Bitcoin’s ascent above $118,000 is a testament to its enduring strength and growing appeal. This remarkable Bitcoin price milestone not only excites current holders but also signals a vibrant and evolving crypto market for newcomers. Whether you are deeply involved in Bitcoin trading or simply following the latest cryptocurrency news , this rally underscores the dynamic nature of digital assets. Staying informed and exercising caution remain key principles in this exhilarating landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Has Bitcoin ever reached this price before? No, the current surge above $118,000 marks a significant new milestone for Bitcoin, setting a fresh all-time high. This achievement highlights its continued growth and increasing valuation in the digital asset space. 2. What does reaching $118,000 mean for Bitcoin’s future? This price level signifies strong positive market sentiment and potentially establishes a new psychological support level for Bitcoin. It suggests growing confidence among investors and could pave the way for further upward movement, although market volatility is always a factor. 3. Is this a good time to start Bitcoin trading? While the current momentum is exciting, entering Bitcoin trading during a rapid surge carries increased volatility and risk. It is crucial to conduct thorough research, understand market dynamics, and implement robust risk management strategies before making any investment decisions. 4. How does this BTC surge affect other cryptocurrencies? Historically, a strong BTC surge often leads to a positive ripple effect across the broader crypto market . Many altcoins tend to follow Bitcoin’s price action, experiencing their own rallies. However, individual altcoin performance can vary based on their unique fundamentals and market capitalization. 5.

This shift may have gone largely unnoticed by the market, according to Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise Asset Management. Market Sleeping On SEC’s Pivot? In a recent investor note, Hougan pointed to the speech delivered by SEC Chair Paul Atkins at the America First Policy Institute, titled “American Leadership in the Digital Finance Revolution.” Hougan described the document as “the most bullish government document I have read in my entire crypto career.” The speech outlined a comprehensive agenda, which is referred to as “Project Crypto.” This, according to Hougan, includes a blueprint to modernize digital asset regulation in a way that boosts innovation and positions the United States as a leader in the global crypto economy. While the broader market has not yet responded, Hougan believes that Atkins’ vision has not been priced into the market. He explained that investors are underestimating how a friendlier SEC stance could catalyze a structural pivot across multiple crypto sectors. “I’ve studied and written about crypto nonstop for the past eight years. I’ve long been bullish about the future of crypto, and I’ve said that all assets will eventually move over blockchain-based rails. But after reading the speech, I’m realizing I have to think bigger – and move to a faster timeline. If it wasn’t priced in for me, I’m going to guess it wasn’t priced in for others.” Based on the content of the speech, Hougan identified three key themes poised to benefit: Layer 1 smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana, public trading platforms such as Coinbase and Robinhood, and decentralized finance protocols, including Uniswap and Aave. Hougan warned that the market’s failure to acknowledge this regulatory inflection point could represent a missed opportunity. The exec also noted that such moves have historically resulted in outsized gains across high-beta sectors. While skepticism remains due to the SEC’s longstanding adversarial stance toward the crypto industry, Hougan’s interpretation of Atkins’ remarks suggests a serious re-evaluation is underway. Calls For Privacy Protections and DeFi Inclusion Adding to this regulatory narrative was a noteworthy speech from another SEC official. Earlier this week, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce called for stronger protection of financial privacy and crypto users’ rights during a speech at the Science of Blockchain Conference. She criticized the country’s financial system’s surveillance practices, while arguing that the Bank Secrecy Act and tools like the SEC’s Consolidated Audit Trail compromise individual freedom. Peirce even went on to highlight the benefits of DeFi and privacy-preserving technologies like zero-knowledge proofs. She urged regulators not to criminalize open-source developers or force reporting in peer-to-peer crypto transactions.

As crypto enters a fresh bull run, analysts are closely tracking the top 10 meme coins in 2025, projects that combine viral energy, community loyalty, and real innovation. For anyone eyeing the top 10 meme coins in 2025, it’s clear: the rules of the game have changed. It’s no longer just about the biggest names. The spotlight is shifting to meme coins with unique stories, powerful utility, and, when it comes to one standout, exclusive early access. Let’s break down the coins catching serious attention as the bulls take over. 1.

Why Scarcity Makes MoonBull the Talk of 2025 The psychology behind MoonBull’s early access strategy is simple yet powerful. Humans instinctively value what’s scarce, and in crypto, being first often means outsized rewards. Analysts note that most of the top 10 meme coins in 2025 saw their biggest returns during exclusive launch phases, and MoonBull’s approach creates a sense of urgency for anyone who doesn’t want to miss out on the next viral project. The rush to be on the inside is more than hype; it’s a proven path to outperformance for traders who move quickly. 2.

While Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to dominate headlines, savvy investors are rotating into mid- and low-cap coins with more room to run. The goal isn’t just safety -it’s upside. That’s why 2025 is being hailed as the year of the underdog, with capital flowing toward projects that combine solid fundamentals, untapped narratives, and real growth potential. Among the most promising? Tron (TRX), Sui (SUI), and a fast-rising presale token called MAGACOIN FINANCE, which some analysts say could deliver returns that put XRP’s early surge to shame . Tron (TRX): quietly expanding while others slow down Tron has spent years flying under the radar, but its consistent growth and expanding ecosystem make it a strong contender for 2025. Originally criticized for lack of innovation, Tron has steadily evolved into one of the most used Layer 1 networks in terms of daily transaction volume—especially in the stablecoin and DeFi space. With USDT flowing across the Tron blockchain at a scale few other chains can match, and an increasing number of dApps being deployed, TRX has quietly become a high – throughput , low-cost blockchain with real-world utility. If sentiment shifts in its favor during the next altcoin wave, TRX could finally break out of its long-term consolidation range, offering strong upside for patient holders. MAGACOIN FINANCE the must-buy presale as traders eye massive 13,800% profits Amid all the speculation about established altcoins, one project is consistently stealing the spotlight among high-reward investors : MAGACOIN FINANCE. Still not listed on major exchanges, MAGACOIN has already generated enormous buzz across trading forums, fueled by its viral branding and active political edge. But beyond the hype lies a project showing real traction. Daily engagement has surged beyond early forecasts , presale rounds are closing in record time , and wallet data confirms that larger investors are moving in early. The latest market models now suggest that MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver up to 13,800% ROI – yes, turning a modest $500 stake into nearly $70,000 if projections play out . While tokens like XRP once offered those kinds of returns in their infancy, analysts argue that MAGACOIN FINANCE is uniquely positioned to replicate that early-stage upside. It combines virality with a roadmap grounded in strategic community growth and early exchange integration. As traders search for that one gem that could define the cycle, MAGACOIN is quickly becoming the must-watch candidate . SUI: scalable Layer 1 with serious developer momentum Launched in 2023, SUI has quickly built a name as a developer-friendly, high-performance blockchain focused on speed, scalability, and low latency. Backed by former Meta engineers and leveraging a parallel execution model, SUI supports Web3 gaming, finance, and NFT infrastructure—all sectors poised to rebound in 2025 . What sets SUI apart is its early-stage positioning combined with high-level infrastructure. While other Layer 1s fight over crowded use cases, SUI is laying the foundation for clean, modular app design and seamless smart contract deployment. As user-facing dApps and partnerships ramp up, many traders believe SUI could mirror the early trajectories of Solana and Avalanche, both of which saw 10X–40X runs once adoption took off. Conclusion: Undervalued doesn’t mean underwhelming TRX and SUI both offer strong narratives heading into 2025. Tron brings network maturity and stablecoin dominance; SUI offers cutting-edge tech with explosive Layer 1 potential. But for those aiming for transformative gains, not just respectable returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out. With analysts projecting a 13,800% profit window and traders treating it like the next big presale breakout, this is one project that can’t be ignored. 2025 may belong to the giants – but the biggest winners, as always, could come from the underdogs .

Solana Aims for $320 While Algorand Struggles,https://thecoinrise.com/cold-wallet-gets-listed-on-cmc-solana-aims-for-320-while-algorand-struggles/,"Crypto traders are shifting focus as market narratives split between growth and practical use. Solana is gaining pace with projections suggesting a breakout could reach $320. On the other hand, Algorand continues to face weak demand and struggles to regain traction. Yet in the background, Cold Wallet quietly secures CoinMarketCap (CMC) validation and introduces a cashback system that adds real value each time users interact with crypto. While price activity grabs headlines, actual functionality is what may drive value long-term. Forecasts show Solana has room to climb, Algorand could stay stagnant, and Cold Wallet may turn out to be a serious contender among upcoming crypto projects in 2025. Solana Builds Momentum with $320 in Sight Solana is triggering bullish signals on many fronts. It has broken through a prominent bull flag pattern, which traditionally signals strong upward continuation if volume holds up. Analysts are closely watching for a climb past $300 and possibly reaching $320. Key contributors to this surge include improved institutional participation, greater network stability, and rising activity in its DeFi and NFT sectors. These aren’t just technical indicators. Solana’s fast processing speed and minimal fees are attracting developers back to its ecosystem. Recent changes to its validator rewards and smart contract tools are also contributing to this momentum. Solana has surpassed multiple resistance points and shows ongoing strength. However, the next phase of growth depends on sustained momentum. For anyone considering which crypto to buy today, Solana brings a strong foundation with visible traction. But chasing a coin after it has already pumped can limit upside, especially compared to lower-entry options like Cold Wallet. Algorand Fails to Break Pattern as Optimism Remains Low Algorand hasn’t kept up. A recent 47% dip in Arbitrum’s price has had ripple effects across Layer-2 and smart contract platforms, impacting ALGO as well. Although there’s no direct link, this downturn in sentiment has weighed heavily on Algorand, which hasn’t seen any major recovery even as the wider market finds some stability. Most Algorand price forecasts remain cautious, as the coin is still trading under key support near $0.20. With declining volume and slower ecosystem development, buyers seem wary. Other blockchains like Avalanche and Solana are expanding at a much faster pace, leaving Algorand struggling to keep up. Connections to broader issues like Arbitrum’s slide only deepen the concern. If Algorand fails to create a new use case or attract users with a strong story, it may keep losing ground. For those checking which crypto to buy today, ALGO lacks clear triggers. On the flip side, Cold Wallet is shaping up with something more tangible: direct user-focused benefits. Cold Wallet’s CMC Recognition and Reward System Bring Real User Value Cold Wallet is now listed on CoinMarketCap, giving it global price visibility and strengthening its credibility. But beyond just being trackable, it stands out by offering a real benefit, a cashback model that gives users rewards each time they engage with crypto. This reward structure is supported by the CWT coin and a flexible cashback tier system. The more CWT a user holds, the better their rewards, without needing to stake, lock tokens, or deal with complicated tools. Users just keep their coins in Cold Wallet, and the system does the rest. Cashback is applied automatically to gas costs, swaps, and crypto-fiat transactions. Bronze-tier users get back 10% on gas, 5% on swaps, and 5% on fiat bridges. At the top Diamond tier, users can receive 100% gas refunds along with 50% returns on swaps and fiat bridges. This turns Cold Wallet into a near-zero-fee tool for frequent users, moving away from the fee-heavy models used by most wallets today. This cashback model reshapes the answer to which crypto to buy today, by providing real use and value beyond price movements. With carefully managed reward limits and tier structures, Cold Wallet is designed for long-term performance. As more users join, demand for CWT rises naturally, creating growth that few base-layer chains can duplicate. The current presale price stands at $0.00998, with a future listing price of $0.3517, reflecting a 4,900% potential return. Over 694 million coins have been sold in stage 17 of the presale, and funding has surpassed $5.8 million. While these numbers draw attention, the cashback mechanics and overall setup are what could give Cold Wallet long-lasting strength. Final Say Solana appears poised for a near-term rally and remains one of the stronger-performing projects. However, its current valuation may already include much of the upcoming movement. Algorand, still weighed down by weak sentiment and external factors like Arbitrum’s decline, is having a hard time regaining support or relevance. In contrast, Cold Wallet presents a fresh model that combines ease of use, meaningful rewards, and CMC transparency. Its cashback setup benefits users who carry out regular actions like bridging, swapping, or paying gas. With a relatively low entry price and a structure built for scaling, it may be one of the most overlooked crypto projects today. If you’re thinking about which crypto presale to buy today , the answer may not be in trending charts but in utility. Cold Wallet offers both a compelling case and a growing community that rewards real activity.

Hedera (HBAR) is pressing toward $0.25 with whale activity building, and Avalanche (AVAX) has held about $22 after a strong July. Both stories look constructive, yet neither puts BTC straight into a buyer’s wallet. BlockDAG (BDAG) does. Right now the sale delivers real BTC in real time. A 10 BTC pool is live, and each BDAG purchase earns a proportional share. There is no lottery and no tricks. Buy more, receive more Bitcoin. Anyone looking to buy cryptocurrency today and lock in immediate upside will notice the difference. BlockDAG’s presale is not just another launch. It is a live route to Bitcoin payouts before the market open, giving buyers something concrete while they wait for the BDAG listing. That clarity matters right now. BlockDAG’s 10 BTC Auction Delivers Real Bitcoin to Buyers Before August 11 What if a presale paid in Bitcoin before launch day? Hedera (HBAR) is holding near $0.25 with whale activity climbing, and Avalanche (AVAX) is steady at $22 after a strong July. Both show promise, but neither is putting BTC directly into buyers’ wallets. BlockDAG is changing that. The project’s 10 BTC reward pool is live, giving buyers proportional Bitcoin payouts with every BDAG purchase. There’s no draw or chance element, rewards are calculated on purchase size, and more BDAG means more BTC. It’s immediate value rather than waiting for launch. BlockDAG’s presale is in Batch 29, with over $367 million raised and 24.8 billion coins sold. Coins are priced at $0.0016 for a limited time via Dashboard V4, with a $0.05 launch price targeting up to 3,025% ROI from this tier. Buyers also get access to a live trading simulator to prepare for launch. The giveaway closes August 11, and all payouts happen on-chain in real time. While other projects talk about future potential, BlockDAG is delivering Bitcoin right now, making it stand out in today’s presale market. Hedera’s Climb Toward $0.27 Gains Strength with Whale Accumulation & Institutional Moves Hedera (HBAR) has seen an 8.9% rise, trading at $0.2513 as of August 6. Whale wallets now control over 77% of the supply, and institutional interest is rising after adopting the ERC-3643 token standard. This could expand regulated asset tokenization on the network, pushing analysts to watch $0.27 as the next key resistance. Some long-term projections even suggest $2 by 2025, though the nearer target is $0.30. HBAR’s adoption is also climbing, with the African Open University using its token service for academic credentials. Its ISO 20022 compliance could draw attention from traditional finance. Trading volumes remain steady, and support has held around $0.23. Technical setups suggest bullish pressure, but liquidations near $0.276 remain a watch point. Whether for short-term plays or long-term holds, HBAR is back in the spotlight with its recent move. Avalanche Holds $22 as TVL Growth & On-Chain Activity Support Strong Outlook Avalanche (AVAX) has been trading sideways since August 3, holding at $22 after peaking near $23.08. Despite a recent plateau, it remains up 30% in 30 days. Technical charts show solid support at $22, with $23.50 as the next resistance and $26 as a breakout zone. Its Total Value Locked has climbed to $1.9B, up 90% since March, with rising on-chain activity and futures interest. These metrics suggest renewed confidence from larger market players. Current forecasts place AVAX between $21.80 and $23.60 in August, with potential to test $32 later this year. While it’s consolidating now, a push above $25 could open the door for stronger gains. Bitcoin Rewards Give BlockDAG an Edge Hedera’s steady climb above $0.25 and Avalanche’s stability at $22 show both projects are holding strong in the market. Yet neither offers immediate payouts to buyers. BlockDAG does. Its 10 BTC reward pool is open until August 11, giving every BDAG buyer a guaranteed share of Bitcoin based on purchase size. With the coin priced at $0.0016 until launch at $0.05, the upside is paired with instant BTC rewards. All transactions are transparent, on-chain, and already active. For anyone seeking a presale with both growth potential and immediate returns, BlockDAG’s offer is unmatched in the current market. Once the pool closes, the chance to earn Bitcoin before launch will be gone.

The latest milestone comes with a retail optimism, which is overshadowing bearish views. Bullish Hashtags Dominate Social Media Ether is currently trading above $4,200, and this surge has sparked optimism among traders. In fact, social media sentiment shows a strong bullish tilt, with hashtags like #buying, #bought, #bullish, and #higher trending alongside ETH. On the other hand, bearish commentary, including #selling, #sold, #bearish, and #lower, is appearing at roughly half the rate. Crypto analytics platform, Santiment highlighted the growing retail-driven enthusiasm but warned that excessive FOMO could temporarily stall the rally’s momentum if sentiment becomes overly one-sided. Meanwhile, institutional activity has also played a major role in Ethereum’s latest climb. Since July 10, over 1.035 million ETH worth approximately $4.17 billion have been accumulated by unidentified whales or institutions, according to pseudonymous blockchain analyst EmberCN. The purchases were made via exchanges and institutional platforms, and coincided with a 45% price surge from $2,600 to $4,000. Most holdings are believed to belong to institutions or US-listed firms with ETH reserves, excluding the known SBET address. The average acquisition price during this period was about $3,546, signaling large-scale strategic positioning. Beyond market mood and accumulation, the altcoin has broken a historical supply record. Another Milestone For Ethereum As of August 9th, Ethereum’s circulating supply has reached a record 121 million ETH, as per network data shared by CryptoQuant. The milestone comes nearly three years after the network hit 120 million ETH on August 22, 2022, following a slow but consistent increase. Ethereum currently issues around 2,500 to 3,000 ETH daily. While new ETH is minted daily, staking continues to play a significant role in shaping net supply growth. Every ETH locked in staking contracts is temporarily effectively removed from circulation, which offsets a portion of new issuance and acts as a check on inflation. In total, Ethereum has minted approximately 157.18 million ETH to date. This figure is achieved after combining the 121 million in circulation and over 36.18 million locked in staking. The dual mechanism of issuance and staking-driven absorption creates a balance in the network’s monetary base. Although the deflationary narrative has softened for now, the long-term price impact will hinge on whether network activity can justify the growing supply. If demand lags, inflationary pressure could weigh on valuation; if it matches or exceeds supply growth, the expansion may support continued price stability or appreciation.

Several new reports point to growing optimism tied to potential ETF approval, increased institutional adoption, and favorable technical patterns forming across multiple timeframes. Bitget’s research division believes spot XRP ETF approval could unlock a powerful wave of inflows – potentially $4–8 billion -with the third quarter of 2025 cited as a likely timeframe for regulatory clarity. Meanwhile, short-term projections from traders like Peter Brandt suggest XRP could rally nearly 60% in the coming months, pushing toward $4.47 if current momentum holds. Against this backdrop, analysts are also identifying under-the-radar altcoins that could outperform top-tier tokens like XRP – one such project now gaining traction is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which some say is tracking toward even larger upside . Technical targets support XRP’s bullish outlook XRP recently broke through the critical $3.28 resistance level – corresponding with the 1.618 Fibonacci extension. If bullish sentiment continues, the next logical technical target is around $5.13 , tied to the 2.618 extension. Machine-learning models factoring in both momentum and Fibonacci zones suggest a ceiling as high as $5.50 , provided XRP breaks above $3.60 and legal conditions remain favorable.Still, risks remain. XRP’s future trajectory depends heavily on a successful resolution to its long-running SEC battle and whether regulators approve an ETF. Without those catalysts, XRP may remain range-bound – a reality prompting some investors to rotate into earlier-stage tokens with higher upside. Analysts forecast 20x for early-stage project One such early-stage token gaining serious attention is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has just achieved a major community milestone : daily active engagement has far exceeded expectations, signaling surging traction ahead of exchange listings. Riding the energy of the altcoin season but backed by structured utility, the project has captured a rapidly growing user base and now stands out among altcoins poised for explosive movement. Leading market analysts have begun projecting that MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver up to 20x gains in the coming months, citing its viral community momentum, early demand, and the repeatable patterns seen in other breakout tokens like SHIBand DOGE. Importantly, these forecasts are grounded not just in hype, but in observed wallet activity, early accumulation from large holders , and rounds that have sold out faster than expected. For traders scanning the horizon for the next high-momentum breakout , MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly climbing to the top of watchlists. Market rotation favors high-upside altcoins with breakout narratives With top-tier assets like XRP and Ethereum entering deeper accumulation ranges, more traders are reallocating capital to early-stage plays with asymmetrical upside. This shift in strategy aligns with prior cycles where newer tokens vastly outperformed blue chips during the early phases of a bull run. In that light, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s rapid growth and active community engagement make it an attractive option for those willing to enter before broader awareness takes hold.That said, XRP remains fundamentally strong. Its payments infrastructure, institutional use cases, and ETF potential keep it in the spotlight. But in terms of raw percentage return, emerging tokens are really hard to ignore. Conclusion: XRP eyes $5, but MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver 20x returns first XRP’s climb toward $5 hinges on legal clarity and ETF approval – both within reach but not guaranteed. As investors await the next move, some are turning toward projects with higher ROI potential. With daily engagement at record highs and 20x returns predicted by analysts , MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a bold but strategic choice for early movers eyeing the next altcoin cycle.

This breakdown was the end of a major market battle. Here’s our analysis of the lead-up . Technical Levels Under Pressure According to Dan Gambardello, Bitcoin dominance recently fell under the 60% psychological barrier and dipped below the green moving average support. It now tests the blue moving average near 59%. The last time this happened was in November 2024, which led to a brief altcoin surge before Bitcoin regained control.

The move follows a clean bounce off the daily demand area around $3.00–$3.10, with spot netflow data showing $2.23M in outflows on August 9, suggesting accumulation by long-term holders.

Appointed in December 2024 by the president to lead the administration’s key crypto advisory group, Hines has played a significant role in shaping the Council’s policy direction over the past eight months. Before joining the Trump administration, Hines worked as a partner at a growth equity firm, bringing a strong investment and strategic background to his position in the White House. While leaving his full-time post, he will remain involved in government as a special employee, collaborating with entrepreneur and investor David Sacks on artificial intelligence initiatives. In his statement, Hines expressed gratitude to the crypto community for its support during his tenure and highlighted the importance of continued dialogue between policymakers and the digital asset industry . His departure marks a notable leadership change in the administration’s crypto policy team, with his deputy, Patrick Witt, expected to assume the role of executive director. Market participants and industry leaders will now be watching closely to see how this transition impacts the White House’s stance on cryptocurrency regulation and innovation in the coming months. Leadership Transition At The White House Crypto Council Hines issued a heartfelt statement marking the end of his tenure. “Serving in President Trump’s administration and working alongside our brilliant AI & Crypto Czar David Sacks as Executive Director of the White House Crypto Council has been the honor of a lifetime,” Hines stated . Hines’ departure comes after nearly eight months of leading the Council, during which he played a central role in advancing policy discussions around blockchain innovation, market structure, and digital asset adoption. His leadership helped foster collaboration between regulators, industry stakeholders, and policymakers, cementing the Council’s influence in shaping the administration’s crypto strategy. According to crypto journalist Eleanor Terret, Patrick Witt — who currently serves as Executive Director of the President’s Council of Advisors for Digital Assets and Acting Director of the Department of Defense Office of Strategic Capital — is expected to succeed Hines in the role. Witt’s appointment would signal continuity in the Council’s direction while potentially introducing new strategic priorities. The leadership transition marks a pivotal moment for US crypto policy. As regulatory frameworks evolve and market adoption accelerates, the incoming leadership will face the challenge of balancing innovation with oversight. Industry participants will be watching closely to see whether Witt continues Hines’ pro-growth stance and maintains the administration’s stated goal of making the United States the global leader in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Total Crypto Market Nears All-Time High The total cryptocurrency market cap is showing strong bullish momentum, currently sitting at $3.87 trillion and edging closer to a potential new all-time high (ATH) near the $4 trillion mark. Price action has been consolidating in a tight range just below this key psychological level, suggesting market participants are preparing for a breakout. The chart shows a clear uptrend supported by the 50-day simple moving average (SMA), which continues to act as dynamic support. Both the 100-day and 200-day SMAs are sloping upward, reinforcing the longer-term bullish structure. After a period of sideways trading earlier in the year, the market cap has recovered sharply, with buying volume increasing in recent weeks. A breakout above the current resistance zone would mark a historic milestone for the crypto market, potentially opening the door for an accelerated rally as investor sentiment strengthens. This bullish setup is further fueled by strong performance from Bitcoin, Ethereum, and select altcoins, alongside rising institutional interest and regulatory clarity in major markets.

Traditional sportsbooks are being matched and often outperformed by agile, crypto-first platforms that provide instant withdrawals, no KYC signups, and bonus offers rarely seen in the conventional market. From UFC and football to cricket and live in-play betting, the top bitcoin sports betting websites now deliver a smooth, fully integrated Web3 experience. These platforms combine technical efficiency with engaging features that keep users active and satisfied. Our review of the leading crypto and Bitcoin sportsbooks of 2025 considered payment speed, betting market depth, bonus value, and overall usability. One platform rises above the rest in this year’s rankings: Spartans , a high-performance betting site redefining decentralized wagering. 1. Spartans: Sets the Standard for Speed and Global Access Spartans has quickly risen to the forefront of the top bitcoin sports betting websites by delivering what many platforms only promise: unmatched speed and accessibility.

It blends a full sportsbook with a feature-rich casino, offering everything from pre-match wagers to live betting on major sports. Unique alt-lines, extensive props, and generous loyalty perks such as rakeback and daily spins keep players coming back. While it currently lacks FIAT onboarding and a standalone mobile app, its browser version is smooth and fast. The 150% welcome bonus and tiered VIP program make it especially attractive to crypto whales and long-term bettors. Even without live streaming, real-time stat visualizers and robust crypto tools ensure an engaging experience. 3. Cloudbet: Retains Prestige with High Limits and Proven Trust Cloudbet remains a leader among the top bitcoin sports betting websites, earning loyalty since its 2013 launch. It delivers sharp odds, high limits, and live streaming for sports like football, basketball, tennis, and esports.

The platform supports BTC and various altcoins, pairing its sleek interface with a fast real-time betting engine designed for today’s digital-native bettors. Its promotions include first deposit matches and recurring tournaments that keep competition fierce. While it does not yet match the extensive features of Spartans or Stake, Thunderpick’s sharp focus on esports and responsive customer service are building a loyal following. For players who prioritize speed, niche markets, and crypto flexibility, Thunderpick is an emerging contender worth watching. Key Takeaways The online betting industry is changing fast, and crypto is driving that transformation.

Starting with just $2,900, they turned it into nearly $3.8 million in just three and a half months – thanks to one token: TROLL. Meme coins like TROLL are known for their explosive volatility, but this case shows just how wild the gains can get when timing, hype, and strategy align. While most of the market has been watching blue-chip altcoins and Bitcoin’s slow grind, stories like this are reminding investors where some of the biggest risks – and biggest rewards – still lie. As this plays out, new low-cap projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are getting more attention from early-stage investors looking for similar breakout potential before listings and mass adoption kick in. The Trade That Shocked Solana According to blockchain data from Solscan, frostx.sol accumulated 20.91 million TROLL tokens earlier this year. Despite the price of TROLL being under a penny at the time, it’s now trading at around $0.16, thanks to a series of powerful catalysts. The trader has sold just 2.55 million tokens so far, realizing $50,700, but continues to hold more than 18 million TROLL, currently valued at $3.73 million. The coin has skyrocketed by 305% in the last 7 days alone, and it’s still gaining momentum. The reason? Smart promotion, strategic timing, and community hype. MAGACOIN FINANCE Price Rising Again As retail investors race to discover the next meme coin rocket, MAGACOIN FINANCE is starting to stand out for its sustained growth and serious community traction. The project’s last presale stage sold out in record time, and the current round is filling up just as fast. Analysts are pointing to its unique combination of early-investor benefits , exchange-ready momentum, and long-term ecosystem plans. With prices already climbing again, some say this could be the next big move for those who missed out on TROLL. Early backers are targeting up to 31x returns , based on current entry prices and projections once it hits major listings. How TROLL Went Viral TROLL’s rise isn’t just a fluke – it’s a masterclass in memecoin marketing. Much of its success can be credited to Pump.fun, a launchpad known for surfacing viral tokens on Solana. Recently, TROLL was granted the highly sought-after Community Takeover (CTO) status by the platform, propelling it into the spotlight. This status unlocks perks like curated social media campaigns, revenue-sharing models, and top billing in promotional spots. In tandem with this exposure, a listing on KuCoin gave TROLL additional legitimacy. Although most of the trading is still happening on decentralized exchanges like PumpSwap and Meteora, the listing signaled a new phase of adoption. The Future of Meme Coin Gains This isn’t the first time we’ve seen a small investment flip into millions—but it’s a reminder that the meme coin cycle is still alive and well. And in crypto, stories like this are more than just entertainment – they influence behavior. Traders are hunting for the next undervalued gem, and platforms that offer early access to such tokens are gaining rapid traction. The question now: can lightning strike twice? Conclusion The jaw-dropping TROLL trade shows what’s possible in the crypto market when risk meets perfect timing. As TROLL’s surge continues to draw headlines, smart investors are already eyeing MAGACOIN FINANCE as the next major breakout . With a new round open and price climbing, it might be the next big name in the meme coin game.

He said the couple, who he called “very average minds,” had beaten “thousands” of professional investors and hedge fund managers. Trump claimed it was all done through “inside information” and questioned why no investigation had been launched. He also reminded followers that Nancy impeached him twice “on no grounds” and lost. Trump’s attack came a few days after he directed sharp criticism at Senator Josh Hawley over his Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Securities and Investments (PELOSI) Act. The bill passed the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in an 8–7 vote last Wednesday, with Hawley siding with every Democrat. Trump accused Hawley of helping Democrats “target” him and described the senator as a “pawn” despite having supported his elections twice. “I don’t think real Republicans want to see their President, who has had unprecedented success, targeted because of the whims of a second-tier senator named Josh Hawley,” Trump wrote. Hawley clashes with Republicans during committee vote The PELOSI Act would bar members of Congress from owning or trading individual stocks. It also covers the president and vice president, but with a phase-in period ensuring Trump and Vice President JD Vance would not be directly affected. The language didn’t stop Trump from questioning Hawley’s motives. He said the bill was “great” for Nancy and Paul but “so bad” for the country, and wondered why Hawley would back something Nancy “is in absolute love with.” During the committee hearing earlier that day, Hawley faced pushback from Senator Rick Scott, a close Trump ally and the wealthiest member of the Senate. Scott argued it was wrong to “attack people because they make money,” but agreed Congress should not be trading stocks. He said Hawley’s bill was “way different” and raised concerns about how to handle illiquid assets under the proposal. Hawley reminded Scott that he had supported the same provision last year. Committee Chairman Rand Paul also opposed moving the legislation forward, but Hawley still advanced it. Trump criticized Hawley for siding with Democrats to block a review into Nancy’s stock trading history over the last 25 years, a review supported by Scott and most other Republicans. Trump calls for Pelosi investigation, Hawley backs prosecution Speaking to reporters hours before his Truth Social post, Trump said he liked the idea of a trading ban “conceptually” but would need to review the details. He said Nancy “became rich by having inside information” and “made a fortune with her husband,” calling it “disgraceful.” He added, “What I do think is Nancy Pelosi should be investigated.” Paul has made millions over decades as a venture capitalist, building an estimated net worth of $262 million with Nancy, according to Quiver Quantitative. Critics, especially Republicans, have argued his trades present a conflict of interest given Nancy’s long-time influence in Congress. Hawley later told Fox News that Nancy “should not just be investigated, but prosecuted,” and said it “needs to be illegal” to profit from trading on nonpublic information.

Bitcoin HYPER has drawn attention through forecasts tied to potential price appreciation. Meanwhile, MAXI Doge has gained early support thanks to impressive presale results and ambitious high-leverage trading plans. By contrast, BlockDAG’s presale takes a more interactive approach. It simulates a live exchange environment where participants can place simulated trades, watch price movements in real time, and analyze order book depth. This hands-on experience, paired with substantial fundraising and a limited-time pricing window, gives BlockDAG (BDAG) a distinctive edge. It offers early access along with valuable market exposure ahead of its official listing. Bitcoin HYPER Price Outlook Reflects Growth Potential Bitcoin HYPER is gaining interest with an entry price around $0.0125 and a planned listing near $0.013. Market projections indicate that, if conditions such as strong exchange listings and sustained Bitcoin momentum hold, the token could reach $0.20 by year-end, representing a potential 16 times gain from listing. A more cautious estimate places the price between $0.03 and $0.04. The Bitcoin HYPER price prediction depends on factors like listing speed, liquidity availability, and Bitcoin’s broader market performance. Some analysts anticipate Bitcoin reaching $150,000 to $200,000 in 2025, which could boost demand for HYPER as a leveraged play. MAXI Doge Rally Potential Based on Market Execution MAXI Doge has attracted attention by raising $350,000 during its first presale week, setting the stage for a possible price rally. With a presale price near $0.00025, projections suggest that, depending on exchange listings and liquidity, MAXI could trade between $0.0003 and $0.0012 in 2025. The project’s main appeal lies in its goal to introduce up to 1,000 times leverage trading, which could attract traders looking for high-risk, high-reward exposure. This also introduces greater volatility, making price movements more significant. The success of the rally will depend on exchange onboarding, trading pair depth, and sustained trading volume. BlockDAG Presale Offers a Real-Time Trading Experience Before Launch BlockDAG’s presale is reshaping how early-stage crypto participation feels by creating an experience that closely mimics a live exchange. Instead of a traditional static buy-and-hold presale, participants can engage with a trading simulator that allows them to place simulated orders, track price movements as they happen, and observe the depth of the order book. This interactive format gives buyers a practical understanding of how the token may perform once it lists. The scale of the presale reinforces this dynamic market environment. BlockDAG has raised $367 million to date and sold over 24.9 billion coins. Currently in batch 29 at $0.0276, the presale offers an impressive 2,660% return from the first batch. At the same time, a limited-time opportunity lets new participants acquire coins at just $0.0016, greatly increasing the potential upside for those entering now. This model merges educational and strategic benefits with strong financial incentives. Buyers gain firsthand exposure to market demand effects on price while experiencing simulated trading conditions before the token hits major exchanges. This hands-on engagement fosters a deeper connection and confidence among early participants. By combining interactive trading features with robust presale momentum, BlockDAG sets a new benchmark for early crypto projects. It offers a live market feel well ahead of launch, ensuring buyers enter with both insight and significant value on their side. This positions BlockDAG as one of the most engaging opportunities in the crypto space today. Key Insights Current presales each bring unique advantages to the table. Bitcoin HYPER’s outlook is closely tied to Bitcoin’s overall market trends, while MAXI Doge attracts attention with its high-leverage trading concept and early funding momentum. BlockDAG stands apart by providing an interactive presale experience that simulates live market conditions. Participants can place simulated trades, monitor real-time price changes, and explore order book depth to gain valuable insight before the token officially lists. Supported by significant fundraising and a limited-time pricing offer, BlockDAG combines engagement with strong potential returns at launch.

Chumba Casino is pulling services from states like New Jersey after stricter gambling rules impacted its dual-currency setup. At the same time, PokerStars is turning toward live casino games and tournament series, shifting its product scope rather than expanding access. While both brands pivot in different directions, another platform is stepping forward with a stronger model. Spartans is gaining recognition as a top-tier betting site in 2025, thanks to its simple 35x wagering structure, instant crypto withdrawals, and affiliate payouts with no hidden limits. No geo-restrictions. No promo confusion. No holding periods. Instead of scrambling to keep pace with changing laws, Spartans are building a cleaner, more rewarding experience: for players, promoters, and anyone cashing out. Chumba’s State Exit Opens the Door Chumba Casino is stepping back from several U.S. states, including New Jersey, as more laws target the dual-currency system used by sweepstakes casinos. Starting July 29, users in New Jersey can no longer collect new Sweeps Coins, and withdrawals will stop by late September. Other states; like Montana, Connecticut, and New York, have already enforced similar rules, making Sweeps Coins unavailable in ten regions so far. Gold Coins are still available for play, but they can’t be redeemed for real rewards. That shift has disappointed users who valued Chumba for its unique earning model. Without the chance to cash out, Gold Coins feel more like a demo mode than a real-money option. The broader picture isn’t encouraging. With more state-level bans tightening, Chumba’s model seems increasingly unstable. For those looking for fast access, real rewards, and low-risk betting, the uncertainty around Chumba makes way for newer, more direct platforms to rise. PokerStars Leans Into Live Dealer Focus PokerStars is adapting too, but in a more focused way. While the WCOOP series still draws poker fans, the platform is shifting toward live casino content through a renewed partnership with Evolution. This move adds popular live dealer games like Lightning Roulette, Crazy Time, and Craps to its offerings across Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Ontario. This helps PokerStars strengthen its live presence, but it also signals a narrow focus. The platform remains centered on poker events and table games, with little flexibility for crypto-based betting or broader sportsbook integration. It’s still a destination for tournament play, but not much beyond that. There’s no doubt that PokerStars holds weight in the poker world. But for casual bettors looking for variety, speed, and wider betting options, the experience still feels somewhat limited. Live dealer titles are a strong addition, but the site’s broader features fall short of delivering daily, all-around betting value. Spartans Delivers What Bettors Actually Want In contrast to platforms adjusting under pressure, Spartans is setting a new benchmark. It gives users a 300% bonus with a clear 35x wagering requirement, valid for 7 days, and the terms are the same for everyone, no region-specific conditions, no loopholes. Crypto bettors benefit even more. Payouts via BTC, ETH, and USDT are processed on the spot. There’s no extra waiting period or hidden verification steps. The platform is built entirely around crypto, so there’s no fiat drama or conversion delays. It’s fast, and it works. Spartans’ affiliate model follows the same logic. Partners can pick from CPA, Hybrid, or Rev Share setups, with straightforward terms and no confusing performance clauses. There are no surprises, just real payouts for actual signups. Along with 5,963 games from 43 studios, a live sportsbook with combo bet options and stat-driven betting, and a Lamborghini giveaway tied to user activity, Spartans gives both players and affiliates the tools they want. No fluff, no confusion, just smooth, reliable betting. Spartans Stands Out in a Shifting Market Chumba’s partial withdrawal and PokerStars’ narrowed approach highlight the changing landscape of online betting. Spartans, meanwhile, is growing by delivering exactly what today’s users expect: fast payouts, real value, and easy terms. There are no legal grey areas to wait out. No limited access due to geography or short-lived tournament hype. Spartans is running daily with full features, offering something steady for players and profitable for affiliates. The platform strips away the clutter and makes room for usability, rewards, and clarity. In a space where most brands are still trying to adapt, Spartans have already arrived. Whether someone’s in it to play, promote, or just cash out faster; Spartans offer the better route.

Dogecoin Turns Bullish & Ethereum Targets $4K",https://thecoinrise.com/cold-wallets-4900-roi-potential-shakes-the-market-dogecoin-turns-bullish-ethereum-targets-4k/,"In 2025, crypto users are shifting their attention from trend-driven assets to platforms that offer real-world usage. While Ethereum remains firm near crucial price zones and Dogecoin pushes to regain positive momentum, users are now leaning toward projects delivering genuine functionality. Cold Wallet stands out in this changing environment. Featuring cashback functionality, strong presale traction, and a forecasted 4,900% return, it is quickly emerging as the best-performing crypto today. Unlike older assets that depend on market trends and hype waves, Cold Wallet provides direct benefits with every interaction. Swaps, bridges, and onboarding actions reward users through CWT, a coin created for practical returns and consistent usage. While Dogecoin price forecast boosts short-term excitement and Ethereum price analysis fuels strategic long-term plans, Cold Wallet effectively brings together high return potential with day-to-day value. Dogecoin Price Forecast Sees Rally Potential Amid Sentiment Shifts After a long phase of sideways movement, Dogecoin is once again flashing signs of strength. Recent Dogecoin price forecast discussions highlight a climb to $0.36 if the coin holds above the $0.243 resistance level. Analysts credit this setup to improving meme coin sentiment, rising trading activity, and a resurgence of community attention. Some speculative models even suggest a surge to $2 in the event of market-wide enthusiasm. Still, there are caution flags. Dogecoin’s movements often follow the pulse of social hype rather than any consistent growth or tech updates. While this offers quick gains to short-term traders, those seeking practical usage continue to question DOGE’s future. Its long-term success hinges almost entirely on external trends and viral triggers. This makes DOGE’s breakout case unstable. Though a rally is possible, the risk remains elevated. For users looking for daily value and more stable gains, Cold Wallet is drawing attention as the best-performing crypto today, rooted not in memes but in dependable features. Ethereum Price Analysis Targets $4K Yet Faces Resistance Headwinds Ethereum continues to hold its place as a critical digital asset, with Ethereum price analysis showing another test of the $4,000 level. Despite repeated rejections near this point, ETH continues to build pressure near the resistance line. A breakout could push the price toward $4,300 or $4,500, supported by buzz around ETFs, large-scale capital inflow, and L2 network upgrades. Ethereum’s foundation remains strong. It leads the charge in DeFi and smart contract sectors, with on-chain growth visible in total value locked and rollup activity. Analysts largely agree that ETH remains a solid asset heading into the next market wave. However, Ethereum’s gains appear more controlled. Most projections offer a 2x or 3x return from here, not insignificant, but modest. In contrast, Cold Wallet is trading at under one cent and projects a 50x return, presenting a quicker route to larger gains. As performance is now measured not just in hype but in function, Cold Wallet is carving out its place as the best-performing crypto today. Cold Wallet: Utility-Powered Rewards System Drives 50x Potential Cold Wallet goes beyond traditional storage; it is designed to reward usage. At its center is the CWT coin, fueling a reward-first design that gives cashback for on-chain actions. When users pay gas fees, part of that cost comes back in CWT. Higher CWT holdings unlock greater returns, with top-tier users able to reclaim up to 100%. But it’s not just gas rewards. Users who swap through the wallet earn CWT too. The system rewards those who hold more with increased returns. Cashback also applies to bridging funds and converting between crypto and fiat. What’s usually an expense becomes a reward, making every action inside Cold Wallet an earning opportunity. These rewards aren’t temporary perks; they’re built into the system. A set reserve of tokens backs this feature, managed through a halving model and designed for longevity. A four-level tiering system ensures everyone has access to benefits while maintaining balance and token value. Cold Wallet is currently in Stage 17 of its presale, with the coin priced at $0.00998. The campaign has already raised over $5.8 million, and its expected launch price of $0.3517 hints at a possible 4,900% increase, translating to a 50x boost for those entering now. With active cashback, user-centric rewards, and real utility, Cold Wallet is clearly more than just the best-performing crypto today; it’s becoming one of the standout projects across the market. Final Thoughts Dogecoin’s possible breakout is linked to crowd sentiment and can shift easily. Ethereum’s path suggests steady growth, but with limited explosive potential. Cold Wallet, on the other hand, gives users daily reasons to stay involved, delivering functional rewards and massive ROI potential. Having crossed $5.8 million in funds raised, with features that offer paybacks on every crypto action and a listing price far above its current value, Cold Wallet fills the gap left by meme coins and older networks. It’s not just about paper value; it’s reshaping the meaning of crypto performance. So, for those wondering which is the best-performing crypto today , the answer lies not in trends but in utility. Cold Wallet shows that when a platform has purpose, the returns follow.

Both networks have unique strengths—Ethereum with its vast developer ecosystem and upcoming upgrades, and Solana with its lightning-fast transactions and growing adoption. But which one offers better upside this summer? As AI platforms sharpen their forecasts, many investors are beginning to expand their radar beyond just ETH and SOL. One emerging name being consistently mentioned in analyst circles is MAGACOIN FINANCE, a presale altcoin that’s rapidly gaining ground for long-term investors seeking early-stage exposure to the next big gainer. Ethereum’s Fundamentals Still Solid Ethereum remains the most dominant smart contract platform, and the upcoming Fusaka hard fork in November is expected to drive renewed interest. With features like PeerDAS and EIP-7934, Ethereum aims to further reduce Layer-2 fees and improve data availability—potentially attracting more dApps and institutional users. Historically, similar upgrades like the Merge in 2022 led to significant price appreciation, and bulls are expecting the same again. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Momentum with Long-Term Investors While blue chips like Ethereum and Solana remain relevant, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing attention for its explosive potential, with crypto experts predicting long-term gains that could outpace both ETH and SOL. The project has secured endorsements from top influencers and continues to trend on platforms like X and Telegram. Its early-stages have already hit multiple milestones, and momentum is building fast. With early-stage prices still available, strategic buyers are eyeing this as one of the most promising altcoin entries of the year. Solana’s Performance and Real-World Adoption Solana, meanwhile, is thriving thanks to real-world use cases. Public companies are turning to Solana for staking rewards and blockchain infrastructure. With daily yields approaching 8% for validators and the successful launch of its Seeker smartphone, Solana is proving it’s more than just hype. This kind of real-world traction gives SOL a strong foundation heading into Q3 and Q4 of 2025. Conclusion Both Ethereum and Solana are poised for a strong summer, backed by institutional adoption, technical innovation, and community support. But for investors willing to take a strategic early position, MAGACOIN FINANCE may offer the biggest upside of all, especially as long-term predictions highlight its breakout potential.

While the crypto market remains unpredictable, those who identified breakout projects early in the past cycles saw life-changing returns. With the rise of institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and emerging sectors like AI and modular blockchains, the stage is set for a new generation of crypto leaders. While many will come and go, a handful of projects show the right mix of utility, innovation, and momentum to deliver massive potential by the end of the decade. Among these rising stars, MAGACOIN FINANCE has also drawn attention as a bold newcomer, with market watchers comparing its trajectory to some of the most explosive altcoins in history. Lets have a look at five cryptocurrencies that experts say could surge more than 20x by 2030, based on current momentum and forward-looking potential. 1. XRP XRP continues to be one of the most polarizing but promising cryptocurrencies on the market. Its main value proposition – enabling fast, low-cost cross-border payments – remains a major use case in the evolving financial system. What Could Drive Growth by 2030: Regulatory Win: The long-awaited conclusion of Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC could unleash new institutional capital flows into XRP. ODL Expansion: Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) services could become essential for global finance, positioning XRP as a bridge asset between major fiat currencies. Tokenized Finance Boom: As tokenized assets gain ground, XRP’s speed and low fees may make it a top pick for RWA transfers. Some conservative models place XRP in the $5–$10 range by 2030, but a scenario involving full institutional adoption and widespread utility could push it far beyond those levels. 2. Cardano Built on peer-reviewed research and a strong academic foundation, Cardano has steadily grown into one of the most respected Layer 1 platforms. Key Factors for Long-Term Potential: Hydra Scaling : Hydra, Cardano’s Layer 2 solution, aims to drastically improve throughput – essential for large-scale dApp deployment. Use Cases in Developing Nations: Cardano’s partnerships in Africa and other emerging markets could lead to real-world adoption across education, identity, and finance. DeFi and Governance Expansion: A robust ecosystem of DeFi projects and a community-driven governance model position ADA for steady long-term value growth. If Cardano captures just a fraction of global enterprise and government applications, ADA’s price could surge well past its previous highs – and potentially achieve the 20x target. 3. Celestia Celestia is pioneering a new way to build blockchains through its modular architecture, and it’s already become a favorite among developers looking to launch rollup-based systems. Why It’s a Game-Changer: Modular Design: Separating consensus from execution allows developers to build faster, cheaper, and more flexible chains. Rollup Ecosystem: As Ethereum and other blockchains move toward rollup-centric models, Celestia could become a foundational layer for data availability. Early Mover Advantage: Being one of the first major players in the modular blockchain space gives Celestia a potential lead similar to Ethereum’s early dominance. With the entire industry leaning toward modular scaling, TIA could be one of the few infrastructure tokens to achieve a 20x+ return, especially if it becomes the default data layer for rollups and app chains. 4. MAGACOIN FINANCE MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly establishing itself as one of the most promising altcoins for forward-looking investors. With growing hype and multiple sell-out rounds, it’s drawing comparisons to early-stage breakout stars like SHIBA INU and DOGECOIN – but with a far more structured ecosystem behind it. Unlike typical meme coins, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building long-term utility and tokenomics aimed at rewarding early holders. Analysts now project up to a 12,700% return for early MAGACOIN investors as the next bull cycle picks up momentum. The project’s strong presale performance, continuous development, and viral growth on social media suggest it’s far from a short-term trend. If MAGACOIN hits centralized exchanges at the right time and continues building its ecosystem, it could outpace traditional large caps like XRP and SOL – giving early participants a rare opportunity to get in before the wider crypto market catches on. 5. Virtuals Protocol As artificial intelligence continues to dominate tech headlines, Virtuals Protocol is emerging as a key intersection point between AI and blockchain. What Makes It Stand Out: AI Agent Platform: Virtuals allows developers to build and monetize AI agents on-chain – one of the most exciting new frontiers in crypto. Ethereum Layer-2 : Built on Base, it benefits from Ethereum’s security while offering cheaper, faster transactions. Rapid Ecosystem Expansion : If it can become the leading AI agent platform in crypto, VRS could ride both the AI and Web3 waves simultaneously. While still early-stage, the protocol’s vision and positioning have drawn attention from developers and early investors alike. If AI becomes as integral to crypto as many predict, Virtuals Protocol could easily become a 20x winner by the end of the decade. Conclusion The path to 2030 will be filled with volatility, but also opportunity. From legacy projects like XRP and Cardano to newer infrastructure plays like Celestia and Virtuals Protocol, the crypto space is rich with long-term potential. And for those seeking early exposure to a rapidly growing ecosystem, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out with its ambitious vision and projected 1 2,700% upside , making it a serious contender in the race to define the next generation of altcoins.

Both parties have filed to dismiss their appeals , closing this chapter of regulatory uncertainty. While the outcome removes a significant obstacle for market sentiment, it does not, according to some experts, guarantee meaningful price appreciation for XRP in the near term. Jake Claver, a financial expert and CEO of Digital Ascension Group , has suggested that the real driver of XRP’s next major move will not be its legal clarity. “XRP’s real move will come from a supply shock during a global liquidity crisis,” he stated, adding that much of the current price activity is speculation and institutional positioning ahead of possible spot ETF products . I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. If the Ripple case has anything to do with XRP price appreciation… it would be a security of Ripple.. XRPs real move will come from a supply shock during a global liquidity crisis. Until then it’s all speculation and institutional… — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) August 8, 2025 Understanding the Supply Shock A supply shock occurs when the amount of XRP available for trading in the open market declines sharply. This can happen if large holders move significant quantities off exchanges into cold storage, institutions accumulate and hold long-term positions, or distribution schedules are slowed. When available liquidity is tight, buyers have fewer options, and even moderate purchasing activity can push prices upward more quickly. In practical terms, a genuine supply shock can alter market behavior by reducing depth in the order books, widening spreads, and increasing slippage. With fewer tokens available, the cost of acquiring XRP at scale rises sharply, making upward moves more pronounced and difficult to reverse until new liquidity enters the market. The Role of a Global Liquidity Crisis While Claver identifies the supply shock as the key catalyst, he also connects it to the possibility of a global liquidity crisis . Such a crisis involves a sharp reduction in available capital and credit across financial markets. With those conditions, XRP could face heightened demand at precisely the moment the circulating supply is constrained. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This combination can create a price environment where even modest inflows have an outsized effect. The global liquidity crisis could amplify the consequences of reduced availability, helping XRP to grow rapidly. Why Market Structure Matters More Than Sentiment Claver’s argument rests on the idea that market mechanics, rather than headlines, will drive the most significant moves. XRP rallied from around $3 to $3.38 following the end of the lawsuit, but its inability to reclaim its all-time high of $3.65 following such monumental news adds credence to Claver’s belief. While ending the legal battle may not cause the surge many market participants want, the positive price impact from a supply shock and liquidity crisis can be swift and substantial.

49843312,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdags-0-0016-presale-is-live-with-10-btc-prizes-sui-secures-support-link-adds-data-streams-2/,1754806564,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/49843312.jpeg,BlockDAG’s $0.0016 Presale is Live with 10 BTC Prizes: SUI Secures Support & LINK Adds Data Streams!,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdags-0-0016-presale-is-live-with-10-btc-prizes-sui-secures-support-link-adds-data-streams-2/,"Missed the early moves on major players like Sui or Chainlink? That is a question many traders are asking as Sui’s latest changes open new institutional access through AMINA Bank and Chainlink’s Data Streams bring real-time tokenized stock pricing to 37 blockchains. Both projects are making impressive progress and attracting serious attention. The bigger opportunity, however, might be unfolding elsewhere. BlockDAG’s (BDAG) presale is locked at $0.0016, offering a live trading simulation that lets participants see exactly how early buying could play out. With the added draw of a 10 BTC auction and competitive dashboard leaderboards, BlockDAG turns buying into an interactive and rewarding experience. While some watch from the sidelines, others are already simulating their potential gains in real time. Sui Gains Institutional Backing and Developer Momentum Sui is making headlines after Switzerland’s AMINA Bank became the first regulated bank to offer trading and custody for SUI, with staking services on the way. This follows the release of 76.27 million tokens, its largest unlock yet, which pushed the price to the $3.39 to $3.46 range. Despite the dip, July DEX volume exceeded $14 billion, and total value locked stayed between $2 and $2.3 billion. Developer activity is also rising, with 3,000 attending Sui’s Summer 2025 events, a 50% jump from last year. Paired with upgrades like passkey and multisig support, analysts see a rebound toward $4.85 to $5.36 if support holds. Chainlink Pushes Forward with Real-Time Data Streams Chainlink’s new Data Streams feature delivers live pricing for U.S. stocks and ETFs such as SPY, QQQ, and NVDA to 37 blockchains. This allows developers to build tokenized stocks, synthetic ETFs, and advanced DeFi tools with near-instant data. GMX and Kamino are among the first to integrate the service. LINK rose about 4% to $17 after the launch but remains in a $13.5 to $17 range. Breaking $20 could target $31 or even $42 to $44. The upcoming Chainlink Runtime Environment will cut development timelines, boosting its role in bridging traditional finance with blockchain. BlockDAG Lets You See and Simulate Your Potential Gains Many traders have looked back at Bitcoin or Solana charts and wished they had bought earlier. BlockDAG is tapping into that feeling with a live trading dashboard that goes beyond static numbers. At the current $0.0016 price, users can simulate what their holdings could look like if BDAG reaches its planned $0.05 launch value. The platform displays live order book movements, updates wallet balances instantly, and visually maps out potential profit curves. It turns the idea of waiting into something you can see and feel. This approach is backed by real traction. Over 24.9 billion BDAG have been sold, with $367 million already raised. The $0.0016 presale price remains available only until August 11, after which it resets to around $0.00276 and is expected to rise further. That gives current buyers the most upside window of the entire presale. Adding more incentive, BlockDAG is running a 10 BTC auction worth over $1.1 million. Every BDAG purchase before August 11 secures a proportional share of the Bitcoin prize pool, offering an immediate and measurable bonus alongside the long-term growth potential. With its interactive dashboard, live leaderboard rankings, and fast-approaching deadline, BlockDAG is positioning itself as one of the top cryptos to buy now. It allows participants to test strategies, track rewards, and see potential gains before the coin even lists. Final Analysis Sui’s latest changes signal growing institutional confidence, with AMINA Bank offering trading and custody while developers roll out meaningful network upgrades. Chainlink is also stepping up with Data Streams, delivering real-time stock and ETF pricing to 37 blockchains and opening the door for large-scale tokenized finance adoption. BlockDAG brings a different kind of opportunity. Its $0.0016 presale price, live trading simulation, and 10 BTC auction that let participants experience potential gains before launch. This turns the presale into an active, rewarding process. While some watch from the sidelines, others are already simulating profits and securing their share.

This recognition highlights Ripple’s philanthropic initiatives and its growing influence in financial inclusion and blockchain innovation. While XRP’s momentum builds and analysts debate whether it could surpass Ethereum or even challenge Bitcoin’s dominance, a different kind of narrative being led by MAGACOIN FINANCE, a presale token projected to deliver outsized returns, is catching fire. XRP Challenges Ethereum’s #2 Spot In Q2 2025, XRP overtook Ethereum in retail trading revenue on Coinbase, claiming 13% of the platform’s retail transaction income compared to Ethereum’s 12%. Analysts attribute the shift to increased retail demand, renewed institutional interest, and growing speculation around a potential XRP ETF. This isn’t XRP’s first brush with second place. In January 2018, its market cap briefly surpassed Ethereum’s. Now, with XRP liquidity surging and forecasts predicting a 500% price increase to $12.50 by 2028, XRP could surpass ETH once again—especially if Ethereum’s momentum slows. Still, while Ethereum boasts deep developer networks and robust Layer 2 activity, its ETF inflows have recently stalled. That could create a window for XRP to reclaim the #2 spot if current trends hold. Bitcoin Still the Mountain to Climb Despite its gains, XRP faces a steep climb to reach Bitcoin’s throne. As of mid-2025, Bitcoin’s market cap stands above $2 trillion, compared to XRP’s ~$138 billion. To catch up, XRP would need to rally nearly 1,500%—an unlikely feat without major institutional adoption and multiple ETF approvals. While XRP has shown strength in specific markets like India—where it briefly overtook Bitcoin in trading volume—it would take a historic shift in demand to dethrone Bitcoin as the industry’s flagship asset. MAGACOIN FINANCE Enters the Spotlight As XRP eyes Ethereum’s market cap and investors look beyond large-cap tokens, a new contender is rising: MAGACOIN FINANCE . Analysts are calling it one of the most explosive presale opportunities in the current cycle. Strategists predict MAGACOIN could outperform Layer 1 giants like Solana and Cardano, forecasting potential gains of up to 15,000%. The project combines DeFi infrastructure, governance utilities, and staking incentives to offer early participants high-risk, high-reward exposure. Online sentiment is surging. Forums, Telegram groups, and X (formerly Twitter) communities are abuzz with speculation. For investors seeking the next wave of market momentum, MAGACOIN is increasingly seen as a serious bet. Conclusion Ripple’s U.S. recognition and XRP’s shifting position in the market spotlight a maturing crypto landscape. As XRP contends with Ethereum and eyes longer-term moves against Bitcoin, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE offer a compelling alternative path for traders looking to capitalize on market rotation. Whether institutional capital continues to flow into XRP—or diversifies into the next Solana or Cardano—remains to be seen, but the crypto leaderboard is more dynamic than ever because MAGACOIN FINANCE is the clear winner of the market.

Over the past days, bullish momentum has pushed many digital assets higher, with price structures showing clear signs of strength. For many traders, this is the moment they’ve been waiting for—the long-anticipated shift where altcoins outperform Bitcoin and deliver outsized returns. Related Reading: Bitcoin–S&P 500 Correlation Hits 80%, Tying Crypto To Stocks Ethereum’s recent breakout above key resistance levels has added fuel to the narrative, with large-cap and mid-cap altcoins following in its footsteps. The market’s renewed optimism has sparked speculation that the altseason cycle, where capital rotates from Bitcoin into the broader altcoin market, may already be underway. However, not all experts are convinced. Some point to Bitcoin’s continued dominance and the fact that most altcoins remain well below their all-time highs as reasons for caution. Historical altseasons have typically seen aggressive outperformance across the board, something the market has yet to fully confirm. Altseason Still Waiting For Its True Breakout According to top analyst Darkfost, the much-anticipated altseason hasn’t truly begun. By examining a comparative chart of Bitcoin, large caps (top 20), and mid/small caps, Darkfost notes that the current cycle is showing the weakest altcoin performance so far. While altcoins have made notable moves in recent weeks, their gains still pale in comparison to Bitcoin’s dominant run. The last instance that resembled a genuine altseason occurred in early 2024, when altcoins—particularly mid- and small-cap projects—outpaced Bitcoin over a short but intense period. That surge marked a clear capital rotation away from BTC into the broader market, delivering outsized returns for altcoin holders. However, the present market conditions suggest that kind of broad-based outperformance has yet to materialize. Even though Ethereum has broken above multi-year highs and several altcoins are posting impressive gains, the rally appears selective rather than widespread. Large caps are recovering steadily, but mid- and small-cap coins—often the hallmark of an explosive altseason—are still lagging. This disparity suggests that institutional and retail capital remains concentrated in more established assets. For a confirmed altseason, analysts will be watching for a sustained breakout in mid- and small-cap performance relative to BTC. Until that shift occurs, the current market may be better described as a strong altcoin rally within Bitcoin’s dominant phase rather than the start of a full-scale altseason.

This rally brings the market close to retesting its 2025 highs around the $1.6 trillion level, a critical resistance zone that has capped altcoin gains in previous attempts. The chart reveals that the market has been in a sustained uptrend since early 2024, with price action consistently holding above the 50-week moving average (blue line) and maintaining bullish structure. Both the 100-week (green) and 200-week (red) moving averages are trending higher, reinforcing long-term support and signaling healthy market conditions. Related Reading: Bitcoin Futures Bias Turns Neutral As OI Net Position Hits Zero – Details If the breakout occurs, TOTAL2 could target the previous all-time high zone near $1.75–$1.8 trillion, marking a potential acceleration in capital rotation from Bitcoin into altcoins. Conversely, failure to clear this resistance could lead to a short-term pullback toward $1.4 trillion support, which aligns with the 50-week MA. The coming weeks will be crucial for determining whether altseason truly ignites.

Maestro anticipates volumes to keep surging as enterprises continue to stack BTC in their treasuries and more idle coins are activated for yield and further uses. “We’re witnessing the convergence of TradFi and DeFi into a Bitcoin‑denominated capital market,” said Marvin Bertin, Co‑Founder and CEO of Maestro.“For the first time since 2009, the critical pieces for on‑chain financial apps on Bitcoin are in place, spanning exchanges, lending, and stablecoins. Bitcoin is evolving from a static reserve asset into a dynamic, productive financial network.” Staking And Lending With over 68,500 bitcoin in TVL ($7.39 billion), staking has become the most widely used application in BitcoinFi. Re-staking has also been steadily on the rise, with $3.32 billion BTC being re-staked, meaning the niche now secures over $10 billion through yield-bearing protocols. Babylon currently leads in scale ($4.79B), but Solv, Lombard, and CoreDAO are advancing the frontier of liquid staking tokens (LSTs), restaking strategies, and dual-token security models. Bitcoin-native lending is being spearheaded by Liquidium, with over $500M in volume. Source: Maestro Another form of staking gaining traction is dual staking, introduced by CoreDAO, with over $615M of BTC staked. The incentives include block rewards from their native CORE tokens and a share of transaction fees, which are distributed to stakers and validators. A few challenges remain, as many staking returns do not align with treasury rates, with yield and liquidity being dispersed across different chains and protocols. It is to be seen whether the durability of BTC-secured networks can continue to deliver sustainable rewards. Programmability Layers Bitcoin scaling and Layer 2 (L2) layers have $5.52 billion (52,000 coins) in total value locked (TVL), hinting at developer and user demand driven by native smart contracts, yield, and asset allocation, whilst keeping self-custody, and having settlement guarantees. The Stacks layer is leading in growth, more than doubling its TVL for Q2 and adding roughly 2000 BTC. Sidechains still hold most of the asset in BitcoinFi, but the architecture is diversifying, with rollups and execution layers looking promising. Source: Maestro Bitcoin’s legacy constraint is slowly peeling away, as the base layer was never meant for programmability. While Ethereum has over $116 billion in DeFi TVL, BTC-aligned infrastructure remains lagging at just over $5.5B in TVL across scaling layers. However, new sidechains, rollups, and various environments continue to emerge, pushing the largest asset per market cap beyond its passive store-of-value role. Metaprotocols Runes, Ordinals, and BRC-20 tokens accounted for 40.6% of all Bitcoin transactions in the first half of 2025, with BRC-20 volume reaching $128 million. Following a pullback last year, Ordinals experienced a strong recovery, with over 80 million inscriptions by mid-2025, generating 6,940 BTC (~$681M) in fees. Runes are rebounding from a sharp decline in minting and trading volume at the end of 2024. Source: Maestro Stablecoins With $860 million in TVL (over 42% Quarter-over-Quarter), this asset class has come to prevalence within the Bitcoin ecosystem, thanks to maturing L2s and growing demand for native primitives. CDP-based (Collateralized Debt Position) stablecoins, such as Avalon’s USDa ($559M), have seen early traction in BitcoinFi. High-yield stablecoins, such as Hermetica’s 25% APY offering, point towards a demand for capital-generating assets. Source: Maestro A few hurdles remain, with fragmented liquidity (the inability to conclude a transaction with one or more participants due to a lack of clearing arrangements) being one of them, as it limits market depth across chains and L2s. The oracle design remains an issue for CDPs (collateralized debt positions), and composability tradeoffs introduce rigidity between performance and decentralization. Venture Funding After a period of declining interest, BitcoinFi funding has surged to $175 million across 32 rounds in the first half of 2025, with the activities focused not only on infrastructure. In the same half of the year, out of the 32 deals, 20 were targeted on DeFi, apps, and custody. Capital is being shifted towards usability and products, with infrastructure now on the back seat. Source: Maestro The beginning of the year saw leading investment firms, such as Pantera Capital, Founders Fund, and Standard Crypto, among others, validating the niche as a popular frontier in the cryptocurrency universe. These notable deals indicate a potent combination of infrastructure depth and application-layer traction, with investor interest coming from both traditional and crypto-native firms.

It frames XRP dominance against historical peaks and troughs, and identifies Fib retracement thresholds that function as potential resistance and confirmation levels. EGRAG CRYPTO emphasized the significance of dominance in assessing price direction, advising followers to keep a close eye on the dominance chart as a leading indicator for the wider market. Levels to Watch for XRP The chart positions Fib 0.5 at 5.92% as the first material barrier that must be surpassed with confirmation before higher targets become plausible. Beyond that, Fib 0.618 is identified at 8.87%; Fib 0.702 is set at 11.61% and is described as the analyst’s optimal target for this cycle. The analyst also outlined more ambitious thresholds, marking Fib 0.888 at 21.58% and Fib 1 at 31.35% as the ultimate targets for the digital asset. #XRP Dominance: Your Key to Price Discovery! Trust me, you'll want to keep a close eye on the #XRP Dominance Chart, it’s a crucial indicator of our price direction! Key Levels to Watch: Fib 0.5 (5.92%): We need to breach this level with confirmation to unlock the next… pic.twitter.com/nH19n5fQL9 — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) August 9, 2025 Can XRP Reach This Target? Analysts have shared bullish expectations based on technical indicators on XRP’s dominance chart, and EGRAG CRYPTO points to historical data to support his prediction. The chart shows XRP falling in 2017 and testing the shakeout zone before going on a remarkable rally to its previous all-time high. The digital asset tested that zone again in 2024 and has outperformed expectations since then. It reached a multi-year peak of $3.39 in January, and after consolidating for months , resumed its climb, reaching a new all-time high of $3.65 . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP’s Path to 31.35% Dominance According to EGRAG CRYPTO, if dominance clears the 0.5 level with follow-through, the path toward 8.87% and then 11.61% will become clearer. The analyst highlighted 11.61% as a key benchmark, suggesting that failure to reach it means XRP underperformed. Conversely, achieving 21.5% dominance would represent a significant structural improvement. The final target is 31.35% dominance, which matches its performance in 2017 and early 2018. These levels would likely attract renewed liquidity and longer-term capital commitments. Risk management is implicit in the chart’s structure. As XRP grows, resistance levels will become potential supply zones, and the velocity of dominance gains will shape how traders adjust their positions.

The MUTM token price in stage 6 of presale is $0.035. A 14.29% increase to $0.04 will happen at stage 7. E arly investors are going to see a 200% return when the token is on the market. Mutuum Finance has already raised over $14.25 million and onboarded over 15000 investors to date. With Ripple facing more pressure in terms of regulatory headwinds and slowing network adoption, sentiment appears to be readjusting. Early MUTM adoption metrics report growing momentum among institutional pilots and retail clients seeking real-world payment interoperability, a market previously dominated by XRP. XRP Sees August Volatility with Shift in Market Liquidity XRP is trading between $2.94 and $3.06 as August gets underway with mixed sentiment. While the token is still a cross-border settlement asset in the XRP Ledger system, recent market flows see a softening of trading volumes in the face of ongoing regulatory scrutiny and slow rate of adoption. Analysts are monitoring whether the changes indicate a short-term adjustment or a bigger-scale re-ordering of capital within the space as new-gen blockchain projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gain popularity. Mutuum Finance Shines in Presale, Achieves 95.00 Trust Score in Audit Mutuum Finance is showing strength within the DeFi realm. The project is audited and certified by Certik with 95.0/100 trust score. It is giving a secure platform to perform DeFi transactions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is bringing innovative lending attributes together with the potential of an ecosystem having a known route to future DeFi. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also developing an Ethereum, fully collateralized USD-backed stablecoin. It will offer long-term stability, trustworthiness, and liquidity to customers of any kind. Giveaway and $50,000 Bug Bounty to Enhance DeFi Security Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has dropped a $100,000 giveaway . 10 lucky winners will get $10,000 MUTM tokens. The project has also launched a top 50 token holder leaderboard who will get bonus tokens based on their rank. In order to further strengthen its platform, Mutuum Finance has also introduced a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program in collaboration with CertiK. It will pay and reward for each bug at four levels, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low. The Next Generation of DeFi Lending MUTM offers consumers a safe and effective double lending channel. Peer-to-Contract model smart contracts offer intermediary-free lending. Smart contracts are enabled with automatic interest rates to shift in such a manner as to automatically produce high interest rates. Peer-to-Peer infrastructure aids in removing intermediaries and providing lenders and borrowers with instant access to each other. Mutuum Finance has already raised more than $14.25 million and attracted more than 15,000 investors, demonstrating its rapid market penetration. At $0.035 during Phase 6, the token will rise to $0.04 during Phase 7, up 14.29%, providing early investors with potential returns of 200% plus. With a CertiK trust score of 95.0/100 on a secure dual-lending protocol and an upcoming stablecoin pegged to the USD, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is well-positioned to capture capital inflows flowing out of legacy assets like XRP. Investors wishing to earn a profit before the next presale price hike should acquire MUTM tokens as soon as possible.

Through this structure, the company will hold its own WLFI tokens and participate in this new trend in the cryptocurrency market. According to sources familiar with the matter, the target fund size under the deal, which has yet to be finalized, is approximately $1.5 billion. Negotiations with major investors in the technology and crypto sectors are reportedly progressing rapidly. Related News: Historic Moment: A Company Listed in the US for the First Time Announces It Will Purchase a Large Amount of Ripple (XRP) Shares World Liberty's website lists US President Donald Trump as an “honorary co-founder.” Last year, the company announced plans for a crypto lending app and began offering a dollar-pegged stablecoin called USD1. While the WLFI tokens were initially designed as non-transferable governance tokens, they will soon be tradable on the open market. Digital asset treasuries, firms that raise capital to acquire cryptocurrencies, have announced plans to raise approximately $79 billion for Bitcoin purchases alone in 2025.

The big push came from heavy buying into Bitcoin ETFs, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust leading the charge by adding $157.6 million. This kind of strong activity shows growing confidence from institutional investors, sending a clear message that the market is backing Bitcoin’s upward run. A new breakout contender stands at the intersection of surging market interest and meme magic: Bitcoin Penguins (BPENGU). Fresh, quirky, and powered by the latest tech, BPENGU is capturing the imagination of a rapidly growing community eager to leave their mark on the 2025 altcoin narrative. But with time running out on the presale, those who hesitate will almost certainly be left behind. Why the Penguin is crypto’s next power symbol BPENGU isn’t just trading on cute branding, though its signature penguin spirit is endearing enough to fuel headlines and hashtags worldwide. Just like penguins, whose strength comes from moving together, BPENGU’s community, known as the “waddle,” thrives on collective energy, support, and purpose. From day one, the project has been about more than fleeting meme status. Real-world collaborations, dynamic campaigns, and cross-platform brand moments are setting the stage for BPENGU to become a lasting cultural phenomenon in crypto and beyond. The penguin isn’t just a mascot; it’s a symbol of resilience, adaptability, and community-driven momentum. The numbers that drive the hype Behind the charm is a lean, scarcity-driven structure that’s fuelling BPENGU’s momentum. The total supply is fixed at 10 billion tokens, with 55% (5.5 billion) devoted solely to the presale.This means the majority of circulating tokens will go straight into the hands of early supporters. Another 20% is set aside for staking rewards, giving holders the chance to earn without selling, building price stability over time. 10% goes into liquidity to ensure smooth market entry post‑listing, while smaller allocations power community airdrops, charity initiatives, and long-term growth. Right now, that presale is closing in on the final stretch with less than 20 days remaining before the waddle pulls up the ladder. Each of the 15 stages lasts just two days, with prices climbing 5% every step of the way. The earlier you join, the more tokens you can secure for the same investment, simple math that’s making latecomers scramble to get in before the next bump. Countdown to takeoff: Be first or be forgotten This is the final lap. With the presale nearing its end, every day of hesitation could cost you a better entry price, and once the $10M hard cap is hit, the doors close regardless of the calendar. The confirmed September 2, 2025 exchange listing means your tokens will go live almost immediately, with no indefinite waiting or uncertainty. BPENGU isn’t just a coin, it’s a moment. One that will be remembered by the people who acted while the clock was still ticking. History in crypto rewards decisive moves, and this is one of them. There’s no second chance at being first. Secure your part of BPENGU before the presale melts away.

After a powerful run earlier in the year, BTC is now consolidating between $114,000 and $120,000, with falling ETF flows and shrinking spot volume pointing to reduced momentum. But what some see as a pause — others view as a window. According to analysts, Bitcoin’s correction is opening the door for altcoins to take the spotlight, and savvy investors are rotating into assets with stronger near-term upside. Top of the list? XRP, Ethereum, and the surging presale project MAGACOIN FINANCE. Each offers a different kind of opportunity — from infrastructure to utility to asymmetric presale gains — but all three are aligned with capital trends shaping August 2025. Ethereum: Quiet Strength, Long-Term Momentum Ethereum may not be making headlines daily, but beneath the surface, it remains the most important infrastructure play in crypto. With Layer-2 rollups expanding, ETH ETF interest stabilizing, and ongoing deflationary mechanics in place, Ethereum is quietly building toward another major leg up. ETH’s price has held steady despite broader market cooling, and institutional interest hasn’t faded. Analysts view this moment as accumulation territory — with many projecting a breakout above $4,000 once macro conditions shift back in crypto’s favor. For those seeking strong fundamentals, Ethereum remains an anchor. XRP: Legal Clarity Meets Whale Activity XRP has regained momentum thanks to renewed legal clarity, growing institutional partnerships, and aggressive whale accumulation. On-chain data shows significant increases in large wallet holdings, particularly after the token pushed past the $3.60 resistance earlier this summer. With ETF speculation building and Ripple expanding into real-world banking infrastructure, XRP is being framed as a utility-driven altcoin with room to run. Some analysts have forecast a 3x–5x move by the end of 2025 — particularly if more jurisdictions greenlight XRP-based financial products. Its mix of legal momentum and payment-based use cases make it a standout rotation target in this phase. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale Power Play While Ethereum and XRP cater to established capital, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting early investors chasing breakout ROI. This presale token isn’t just hype — it’s double-audited by HashEx and CertiK , features a fixed 170 billion token supply , and operates with zero-tax trading , offering clean tokenomics built for mass adoption. The project is gaining rapid traction across Telegram, X, and top presale dashboards, with inflow momentum outpacing many listed altcoins. What’s driving urgency now is the EXTRA50X bonus code , which gives 50% more tokens to the first 500 buyers in this round — a bonus that could disappear fast as allocation fills. Final Take: Correction Sets the Stage As Bitcoin cools, opportunity heats up elsewhere. Ethereum offers long-term conviction. XRP brings legal momentum and real-world relevance. And MAGACOIN FINANCE delivers rare, early access at a massive upside. With the EXTRA50X code still live, this may be the last moment to enter MAGACOIN before retail demand floods in.

49848842,552503,1754812802,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49848842.jpeg,Vitalik Buterin Regains Billionaire Status As Ethereum Hits Multi-Year Highs,https://bitcoinist.com/vitalik-buterin-regains-billionaire-status-ethereum/,"Ethereum has soared to a multi-year high, touching the $4,330 level — its highest price since November 2021. This milestone not only reinforces ETH’s dominant position in the crypto market but also marks the return of co-founder Vitalik Buterin to billionaire status, with his publicly known wallets now valued above the billion-dollar mark. Since April, Ethereum has delivered a staggering gain of over 200%, outpacing most major cryptocurrencies and reigniting bullish sentiment across the market. Analysts attribute the rally to strong fundamentals, including increasing adoption in decentralized finance (DeFi), the rapid growth of layer-2 scaling solutions, and rising institutional interest. The rally comes amid tightening supply dynamics, with exchange balances dropping to multi-year lows, suggesting that long-term holders and institutional players are accumulating aggressively. On-chain data points to sustained network activity and expanding use cases, adding fuel to the bullish outlook. Many market watchers believe Ethereum is setting up for further gains, potentially challenging its all-time highs in the months ahead. As the ecosystem continues to expand and regulatory clarity improves, ETH appears poised to remain at the center of the next major wave in crypto growth. Buterin’s Holdings Cross $1B As Ethereum Rally Gains Momentum According to blockchain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence, Buterin holds approximately 240,000 ETH, alongside other digital assets such as MOODENG and DINU. At current market prices, his ETH holdings alone are worth around $1 billion, cementing his status as one of the wealthiest figures in crypto — at least on-chain. The surge in ETH’s price comes after a series of volatile moves earlier this year that left some questioning the sustainability of the rally. However, the latest breakout above $4,300 suggests strong underlying momentum. Institutional adoption is playing a crucial role, with public companies like Sharplink Gaming adding Ethereum to their balance sheets as part of their treasury strategy. This marks a notable shift in corporate crypto allocation trends, where ETH is increasingly seen not just as a speculative asset but as a core long-term holding. With on-chain data pointing to robust network activity, the supply-demand dynamics appear favorable for continued gains. As institutions, public companies, and long-term holders continue to accumulate, Ethereum’s bullish narrative remains intact — and Buterin’s billion-dollar stake is now riding the wave. Ethereum Price Analysis: Breakout To Multi-Year Highs Ethereum (ETH) has surged to $4,242, marking its highest level since November 2021 and confirming a major breakout on the weekly chart. The rally, driven by strong bullish momentum, saw ETH climb over 21% in the past week, decisively breaking through the $3,860 resistance level that had capped price advances earlier in the year. The breakout is supported by rising volume, signaling robust buying interest. ETH is now trading well above its 50-, 100-, and 200-week moving averages, which are all sloping upward — a classic sign of a strong uptrend. This alignment suggests that the medium- to long-term trend remains firmly bullish. If momentum continues, the next significant target lies near the $4,800–$4,900 range, aligning with the previous all-time highs. However, after such a steep move, short-term consolidation is possible, with $3,860 now acting as a key support level. A deeper pullback could retest $2,852, but this scenario would likely require a broader market correction.

During this period, the leading altcoin has surged past $4,000 for the first time since December 2024 and is also now trading above $4,200, reclaiming a level it last held in 2021. According to on-chain data, the breakout has injected confidence into the market, especially among retail traders. Ethereum’s technical setup and comparisons with Bitcoin are now showing the possibility of a rally on par with the most explosive phases in its history. Related Reading: Ripple-SEC Legal Drama Ends; XRP Skyrockets 13% Ethereum Fractal Structure Signals 1,110% Rally According to technical analysis of Ethereum’s price action on the weekly candlestick timeframe chart, the leading altcoin is about to enter into a 1,110% rally that might take its price above $20,000. This analysis was initially noted by crypto analyst Merlijn The Trader, who identified a repeating cycle that closely aligns Ethereum’s current performance with Bitcoin’s 2018-2021 run. Taking to the social media platform X, the analyst noted that in that earlier cycle, Bitcoin endured an 83% drop from its highs before staging a powerful 342% recovery. This was followed by a secondary correction of around 63%, which ultimately served as the base for a 1,110% surge between the second half of 2020 and the first half of 2021. Ethereum’s weekly chart has been following the same sequence almost step-for-step in the past few years. After a steep 83% decline from its 2021 peak, Ethereum mounted a 342% rebound, only to experience a deep retracement of roughly 63% to $1,500 in April 2025. Since then, however, Ethereum has mounted another rebound, with the latest move being the most recent rally back above $4,200. Image From X: Merlijn The Trader This latest rally shows Ethereum is now in the final phase, where it could be positioned for a comparable explosive run to as high as $20,000 if the fractal continues to play out. In another analysis, Merlijn The Trader also pointed out that Ethereum’s weekly chart is echoing its own 2017 breakout structure. In that cycle, Ethereum reclaimed the 50-week moving average after a prolonged consolidation phase before entering into a sustained and powerful rally. The 2025 chart shows a similar reclaim of the 50 MA, and the price is now breaking above the $4,000 resistance zone that has stood since March 2024. Image From X: Merlijn The Trader Bullish Sentiment Building Above $4,000 Although Ethereum’s recent price rally can be mostly attributed to institutional buys in Spot Ethereum ETFs, the breakout above $4,000 has not gone unnoticed in the broader market. Notably, data from on-chain analytics platform Santiment reflects a dramatic rise in bullish activity across social channels. Mentions tied to buying, optimism, and higher price expectations have surged sharply, now outpacing bearish commentary such as selling or lower price calls by almost two-to-one. Although this can create the conditions in which Ethereum’s rally can sustain momentum, too much FOMO can also put a temporary halt to any rally.

This area coincides with a 4-hour supply block and the upper Bollinger Band, creating strong overhead pressure. The pullback comes after a multi-day rally from the $0.326 low, where buyers staged an aggressive breakout through short-term resistance. What’s Happening With Pi Coin’s Price? Pi Network price dynamics (Source: TradingView) On the daily chart, PI remains in a broader downtrend, with descending trendline resistance still capping upside since May. The recent rally broke above the short-term dynamic levels but stalled precisely at the confluence of the $0.46 supply zone and the daily EMA cluster. The On-Balance Volume (OBV) remains near multi-month lows, suggesting that despite the price spike, broader accumulation is still weak. Pi Network price dynamics (Source: TradingView) On the 4-hour chart, the rally pushed price above the 20 EMA ($0.391) and 50 EMA ($0.384), but sellers defended the 200 EMA at $0.4287. The rejection has sent PI back toward the mid-Bollinger Band ($0.4402), which now acts as immediate resistance. … The post Pi Network (PI) Price Prediction for August 11 appeared first on Coin Edition .",Market|News|Price Analysis|Price Prediction|Pi (PI),EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coin Edition', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/7/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinquora,2025-08-10 08:03:16
49847550,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=408004,1754813287,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/49847550.jpeg,We Asked 3 AIs: Is Ripple’s XRP Heading for a Crash or a Moonshot?,https://cryptopotato.com/we-asked-3-ais-is-ripples-xrp-heading-for-a-crash-or-a-moonshot/,"TL;DR In this article, some of the most popular AI solutions, including ChatGPT’s just-released 5.0 version, will speculate on XRP’s future price movements. Some of the answers might surprise the perma-bulls. Moonshot or Pullback? Ripple’s native token made history in mid-July when it skyrocketed by over 60% within a week or so and blasted through its January 2018 all-time high of $3.4 to mark a new one at $3.65. Somewhat expected, it started to retrace in the following weeks and dipped toward $2.7. However, the bulls are back in town, pushing XRP above the crucial support-turn-resistance and now back to a support level at $3. As of press time, the asset stands well above it ($3.25), which has prompted numerous analysts and full-time XRP bulls to outline some massive predictions . To gain a more neutral perspective, though, we decided to ask ChatGPT’s latest version, Gemini, and Grok about their take on the matter. ChatGPT acknowledged the recent correction, indicating that XRP is now at a “pivotal point in its 2025 price journey.” It believes the asset has strong chances of overcoming the current hurdles, especially if the following factors play out in its favor: The Bullish Case (Moonshot Potential) Strong Institutional Interest – Speculation over a future spot XRP ETF and growing partnerships in cross-border payments could bring major capital inflows. Technical Support Holding – Key levels around $2.70–$2.80 have so far absorbed selling pressure, suggesting buyers are defending critical territory. However, it also outlined a bearish scenario, in which XRP loses some ground and heads for an extended correction. This could be prompted by post-rally exhaustion, given its massive rise since the US elections last year, and overall market uncertainty, such as the aftershock of some of Trump’s controversial global policies. Gemini outlined the recent positive developments in the Ripple-SEC legal case as bullish factors for the underlying asset’s price, and noted that it could open the door for the approval of the much-anticipated XRP ETFs in the US. “The approval of an XRP ETF, following the successful launches of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, would introduce a new class of institutional and retail investors to the asset, potentially driving significant capital inflow and price appreciation.” However, Gemini, alongside Grok, noted that XRP still faces certain risks, such as growing competition and the possibility of whales taking profits following the recent rally. Something identical transpired after the asset reached a new ATH, with whales disposing of massive token portions in just days. Conclusion In general, the three AIs were bullish on XRP’s future price movements, especially given the end of the lawsuit against the SEC, Ripple’s expansion in terms of acquisitions, and the underlying asset’s technical structure. Gemini said: “The current market sentiment, bolstered by the resolution of the SEC lawsuit and the potential for a spot ETF, overwhelmingly favors a bullish outlook for XRP. The token is at a critical juncture, with many analysts forecasting a significant rally if it can break through key resistance levels. However, as with any cryptocurrency, the path forward.” ChatGPT, though, was slightly more cautious: “XRP’s next big move depends on whether it can hold above its key $2.70 support zone and reclaim the $3.40–$3.65 range. A confirmed breakout could set the stage for a moonshot toward $4 and beyond. A breakdown, however, might drag it back toward the mid-$2 range or even lower.” It also advised traders to watch for big whale moves, the overall transaction volumes, and news related to the company behind it.

From unsolicited phone calls to convincing replicas of legitimate websites, scammers are continually refining their methods to extract sensitive information and digital assets. James Rule (@RuleXRP), a cryptocurrency educator with seven years of experience in the industry, recently outlined the most prevalent scams encountered within the community. He reported receiving frequent accounts of victims losing funds to schemes that exploit fear, trust, and social engineering. His cautionary remarks follow a series of incidents in which members of the XRP ecosystem, including high-profile figures such as Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz, have intervened to expose fraudulent actors . VERY IMPORTANT!!!! THE MOST COMMON CRYPTO SCAMS THAT I HAVE SEEN IN 7 YEARS. Believe me, I get messages every week from the community telling me that they were scammed. FEAR SCAMS: Texts, E-mails and Phone Calls from a fake exchange or wallet… — James Rule XRP (@RuleXRP) August 9, 2025 Fear-Based Manipulation Tactics One of the most common scams relies on inducing panic. Targets receive texts, emails, or calls from individuals posing as representatives of major exchanges or wallet providers, such as Coinbase or Ledger, claiming that their accounts have been compromised. These communications often direct users to fraudulent websites designed to harvest login credentials, passwords, and recovery phrases. Some messages even provide a “help” phone number, which connects directly to the scammer. Impersonation scams are a big problem in the crypto space, and according to James, criminals have begun sending physical letters that mimic official correspondence from wallet manufacturers, complete with QR codes intended to lure recipients into compromising their accounts. False Promises of Cryptocurrency Giveaways Another recurring scam involves fraudulent giveaways. James emphasized that Ripple will never distribute XRP for free in exchange for deposits or payments. Scammers often promote these schemes through fake social media accounts or impersonations of public figures, misleading victims into sending cryptocurrency or cash to unverified wallets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Once transferred, the funds are impossible to recover. Ripple has reiterated that it will never ask the community to send XRP , and the same rule applies to its executives, as scams impersonating them are prominent. Deceptive Social Media and Self-Custody Risks Scammers often impersonate help desks, advisers, or content creators on social media, contacting users through comments or direct messages. Some offer unsolicited assistance to gain trust. James advises verifying identities independently and remaining “very cautious” online. The rule also emphasized that Self-custody wallets require strict security . Seed or recovery phrases, whether 12 or 24 words, must never be shared as wallets cannot be recovered once compromised. Maintaining vigilance is essential. He advised crypto holders to ignore unknown calls, delete suspicious texts, and avoid clicking links or scanning QR codes from unverified sources. As James stressed, the safest approach is simple: never trust anyone without absolute confirmation of their legitimacy.

A few altcoins have doubled down on their recent gains, including LINK, which has rocketed by almost 7% to trade above $22. BTC Sees August Peak The current month didn’t start all that well for the primary cryptocurrency as it dipped to a multi-week low of $112,000 just three days in. This came amid ongoing political tension between some of the Great Powers, which included the movement of nuclear submarines. However, the asset reacted well to that dip and started to recover almost immediately. Within just a few days, by last Friday, bitcoin was already knocking on the $117,000 door. Although it experienced some resistance there, the bulls were persistent and managed to break through on Saturday. They kept the pressure on in the past several hours as well, helping BTC breach the $118,000 line. As such, bitcoin marked a ten-day high at around $118,500 earlier today. Despite losing some ground since then, it’s still around 1% up on the day.

He argued that the waiver produces concrete operational consequences for the court injunction that followed the agency’s enforcement action. In his post, he explained that the permanent injunction prevents Ripple from violating securities laws. However, if the laws are changed, future sales without registration would not violate the law or the injunction. He noted that “Ripple was found to have violated the law as it existed at the time of its misconduct.” Fagel explained that this scenario, where the law is changed, would “render the injunction largely moot.” He also says that the SEC’s recent waiver has the same effect. 2/ ..wouldn't violate the law (or, thus, the injunction). It wouldn't change the fact that Ripple was found to have violated the law as it existed at the time of its misconduct, but it would render the injunction largely moot. (Though yesterday's waiver arguably does the same.) — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) August 9, 2025 Immediate Regulatory Effect The waiver removes a regulatory disqualification that had prevented Ripple from relying on a key exemption under Regulation D. With that barrier removed, Ripple can pursue private capital from accredited investors without submitting to full SEC registration where the exemption applies. The administrative relief, therefore, reduces a discrete compliance obligation tied to the injunction and restores a practical route for capital formation and corporate funding. Impact on Ripple’s Operations and Legal Standing While the waiver does not erase the court’s finding that Ripple violated securities laws in its past institutional sales of XRP, it has significant implications for the company’s ability to operate. For Ripple, the development arrives at a time when it is seeking to expand both its product suite and its geographic footprint using XRP . Access to capital under less restrictive conditions could accelerate those ambitions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 By reinstating access to Regulation D exemptions, the company can once again raise funds through private offerings, which could support expansion plans, product development, and potential strategic acquisitions. Legal Clarity for Ripple and XRP Fagel’s interpretation also clarifies that the injunction remains in place for as long as the underlying law remains unchanged. However, in practice, the waiver neutralizes a key operational restriction. The company can now engage in certain transactions that were previously off-limits without risking a violation of the injunction. The SEC’s decision to grant relief to Ripple after the prolonged lawsuit shows the pro-crypto stance of the current administration and marks the end of the war on crypto that lasted for years. The legal battle between Ripple and the SEC is now over , and for XRP holders and market participants, the decision further reduces legal uncertainty around Ripple’s future activities.

The nightclub Hi Ibiza, ranked top in the world, opened what its owners called the first permanent art gallery inside a club. The development is seen as an effort to mix nightlife with digital art. According to reports, the nightclub was launched this summer, unveiling its gallery alongside Ibiza-based nightlife group The Night League. The nightclub, which has been voted as the world’s best in the last four consecutive years, also unveiled London digital art collective W1 Curates. The exhibition blends digital, physical, interactive installations, and custom-built display technology. In-club art gallery launches with works from famous artists According to the organizers, the gallery presents a selection of works from the best artists across the world. “From cinematic design to surreal architecture and cyberpunk storytelling, the gallery presents a curated selection of today’s most influential digital artists,” the organizers said in a statement. In addition, it is also seen as a broader push to bring digital and NFT art into physical locations. This is not the first time that such a blend has been witnessed across the world, with Bright Moments launching its NFT gallery in Venice, California, in 2021. Web3 NYC Gallery also followed in the same path the next year, launching its Genesis NFT exhibition in New York. The in-club gallery space features a mural work created by a British graffiti artist, Mr Cenz, at the entrance of the club. Visitors are allowed to scan the mural with the W1 Curates smartphone application, revealing an augmented reality animation. Inside the art gallery, several works are lined up, including two sculptures made by British graphic designer and album cover artist KidEight, known to have collaborated with 2 Chainz, French Montana, Gucci Mane, and Fabulous. He also collaborated with American street artist WhIsBe to create a six-foot green gummy bear. Other artists featured inside the in-club gallery include Annibale Siconolfi, Mad Dog Jones, Shiro, Ash Thorp, Six N. Five, and Beeple, who is popular for selling one of the biggest digital artworks—Everydays: The first 5,000 Days. Beeple sold the artwork in 2021 for $69.3 million at an auction, with the sale coming at a time when the NFT sector was just trying to penetrate the mainstream market. Other artists have since gone on to sell more digital artworks. According to the organizers, the lineup is expected to rotate every two weeks during the summer. The main in-club gallery space was designed by W1 Curates, creating a space to adapt to each artist’s color palette using large-scale projection and immersive lighting. The gallery launch will include talks by W1 Curates, Seedphrase, Bitcoin historian and artist Smashtoshi, Trevor Jones, and Farokh, president and co-founder of DASTAN. The in-club art gallery is also expected to have a Wild Corner featuring a DJ set to entertain the guests. The exhibition features “cutting-edge digital artists alongside additional physical works, encouraging guests to explore, pause, and connect with the art beyond the dance floor,” the organizers said. Meanwhile, the hype around NFTs has seemed to have cooled down in the last few years, with trading volumes dropping drastically. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Mutuum Finance is in presale Phase 6 and is presently valued at $0.035. The next price increase will bring the token to $0.04 in phase 7. Investors positioning early will see at least 400% returns once the token goes live. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has crossed more than $14.25 million raised and welcomed more than 15000 token holders. Mutuum Finance’s recent momentum and utility-driven growth are pushing it to the forefront of crypto news. Cardano Holds Steady as August Price Forecast Unfolds Cardano (ADA) is trading at $0.7989, showing resilience within its intraday range of $0.7409 to $0.7991 as market participants assess its near-term price trajectory for August. The network’s development roadmap remains anchored in gradual, research-driven upgrades, with recent governance decisions, such as the approval of significant treasury-funded initiatives, highlighting its structured approach to ecosystem growth. As broader crypto market sentiment shifts between established and emerging assets, Cardano maintains a steady presence alongside newer entrants like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Unveils Phase 6 of Its Presale Mutuum Finance has concluded Phase 5 of its presale and advanced into Phase 6, where its tokens are priced at $0.035. Its next price increase will drive the price of its tokens up 14.29% to $0.04. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has already raised over $14.25 million and attracted over 15000 holders. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Joins Hands with CertiK to Unveil $50K Bug Bounty Mutuum Finance is in collaboration with CertiK to launch a Bug Bounty Program. The program’s reward fund stands at $50,000 USDT. Four categories i.e. low, minor, major and critical will be rewarded under the program. The program shows the vision of Mutuum Finance to establish community-driven, secure and sustainable ecosystem. The project has also been rigorously audited by Certik on user fund security and security of the blockchain. This is a milestone on Mutuum Finance’s vision for an open institution-grade DeFi protocol. The audit rewarded MUTM a 95/ 100 security score. Mutuum Finance Launches MUTM Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched a $100,000 giveaway where 10 lucky participants will be rewarded with $10,000 in MUTM tokens.

Markets moved fast, and so did headline writers, but the numbers behind the noise are plain. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Still King Of Capital Inflows, According To Michael Saylor Arkham Valuation And Wallets According to Arkham, wallets linked to Vitalik Buterin now hold about 240,042 ETH, giving him an on-chain value near $1.04 billion at recent prices. Those wallets also show smaller stakes in tokens like AETHWETH, White, Moodeng and WETH. This is a price-driven snapshot of holdings that are visible on public ledgers, not a full accounting of any off-chain assets or tax liabilities. Based on reports, Ether climbed as much as 6.20% on Saturday and breached the $4,300 level for the first time since December 2024. Nansen data put Ether around $4,250 at the time of reporting. Traders pointed out that a move to $4,500 would put roughly $1.35 billion of short positions at risk, according to CoinGlass, which feeds talk of a potential short squeeze. Fast moves like this can trigger big liquidations and amplify swings. ETFs And Flows Driving Demand According to Arkham, ETF activity sent $461 million to ETH compared with $404 million to BTC. Over five trading days, US-based spot Ether ETFs recorded net inflows of $326 million, compared with $253.2 million for Bitcoin, based on Farside data. Those steady flows add another channel of demand for spot ETH and help explain why institutions and traders are watching price action closely. A History Of On-Chain Wealth Vitalik first crossed the on-chain billionaire threshold at age 27, in May 2021, when Ether traded above $3,000 and holdings were roughly 333,500 ETH — then worth about $1.029 billion. That rise came after ETH moved from around $700 at the start of 2021 to much higher levels later that year. What’s different now is that the figure is again a simple product of visible token holdings and a higher ETH price. Related Reading: Ripple-SEC Legal Drama Ends; XRP Skyrockets 13% In a recent interview, Buterin warned against a heavy reliance on large treasuries and borrowing in the ecosystem. He said that if treasuries ever caused major damage to ETH, it would be because some players turned the market into an over-borrowed setup. That kind of caution from a founder matters to investors who are weighing long-term structural risks against short-term price moves.

He told his nearly 6 million followers that seeing Ethereum shorts “get smoked” put a smile on his face and warned that anyone shorting Bitcoin or Ethereum “will be run over.” At the same time, Bitcoin pushed past $117,000 and Ether climbed back above $4,200. Policy Move Sparks A Fresh Rally According to market reports, a recent executive action signed by President Trump helped spark the move. The order was tied to retirement account rules and stirred talk that 401(k) flows could become more crypto friendly, which pushed funds and traders to rethink bearish bets. Price swings followed quickly, and traders who had bet against the rally found themselves under pressure. It puts a smile on my face to see ETH shorts get smoked today. Stop betting against BTC and ETH – you will be run over. — Eric Trump (@EricTrump) August 8, 2025 Reports have pointed to heavy buying from US spot ETFs and a handful of treasury buyers that are grabbing up Ether. That clearing of supply on exchanges is making it harder for sellers to keep the price down. Ether’s jump above $4,200 was the first time it hit that level since December 2024, and market players said it helped spark a wave of short covering that amplified the gains. Shorts Took The Brunt Based on trading-data summaries, about $208 million of Ethereum positions were liquidated in a 24-hour window, which made up over 56% of nearly $370 million wiped from the futures market during that span. Of the Ether losses, around $184 million came from short positions and $24 million from longs. That flood of forced exits pushed the rebound to be sharper than many expected. Eric Trump’s post added fuel to the social side of the move. He’s been vocal about buying every Ether dip, and his message was one of glee as bears were squeezed. Traders watching the tape said the mix of policy headlines, ETF inflows, and social media heat created the perfect setup for quick, volatile moves. Analysts Offer Wildly Different Paths Analysts are split on how high Ether could go if the momentum holds. Some put a bullish scenario that reaches toward $16,000 by year-end under favorable conditions. Other market voices have sketched even more aggressive paths, with one analyst suggesting a near sevenfold rise toward $25,000 in an extreme case. Those calls sit beside more cautious takes that warn the ride could reverse just as fast. Eric Trump believes those betting against Bitcoin and Ethereum could face heavy losses, adding social heat to a rally driven by policy moves and ETF inflows.

Key Takeaways: World Liberty Financial aims to raise $1.5B to launch a NASDAQ-listed treasury company for WLFI. The WLFI token has generated $550M in sales since its launch alongside the USD1 stablecoin. Analysts warn the treasury company model is highly exposed to crypto market volatility. Investor materials indicate Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. are expected to join the board, according to a Friday report from Fortune . If completed, the venture would mark another expansion of the Trump family’s growing presence in the digital asset sector. World Liberty’s WLFI Token Sales Hit $550M Since Launch Since unveiling World Liberty last fall, the group has rolled out a stablecoin (USD1) and the WLFI token, which has reportedly generated $550 million in sales. Neither World Liberty nor representatives for Eric and Donald Jr. responded to requests for comment. The proposed treasury company would join a recent wave of “digital asset treasury companies” — public firms structured to hold large cryptocurrency reserves on their balance sheets. The model was popularized by Michael Saylor, who transformed MicroStrategy into a Bitcoin acquisition vehicle in 2020, later rebranding it as Strategy in 2025. Strategy’s market value soared to nearly $113 billion as it amassed over $72 billion in Bitcoin, despite quarterly revenue of just $115 million.

Similar strategies have attracted significant attention from traders who view these companies’ stocks as proxies for the underlying crypto assets they hold. The trend has broadened beyond Bitcoin. This year has seen the emergence of treasury companies for Ethereum, Litecoin, Sui, and Ethena. Even Trump Media joined the movement earlier this summer, acquiring $2 billion worth of Bitcoin for its own balance sheet. Advocates say these structures allow traditional investors, including those limited to brokerages like Vanguard, to gain crypto exposure without directly buying tokens. However, some analysts caution that the model carries risk, warning that valuations could collapse if the crypto rally falters. Critics argue that these firms’ fortunes are overly dependent on volatile token prices, making them vulnerable to downturns. Trump Nets Over $26M in Crypto Donations This Year As reported, the crypto industry has donated over $26 million to Donald Trump this year, according to newly released campaign finance filings. Campaign finance records show that contributions to the pro-Trump super PAC, MAGA Inc., came from some of the biggest names in crypto. Blockchain.com led the list with a $5 million donation. Venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz each gave $3 million, while Gemini Trust added nearly $3 million. Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss also contributed $500,000 each personally. Other major donors include Ondo Finance with $2.1 million and Paradigm, which gave $1.2 million. Trump’s crypto-linked holdings are also a substantial part of his personal wealth . Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index estimates that TMTG stock represents $2.2 billion of Trump’s $6.6 billion fortune. His broader cryptocurrency investments are believed to have gained at least $620 million in recent months. Notably, nearly 70 nominees and officials in the Trump administration reportedly hold crypto or investments in blockchain companies , with holdings ranging from modest sums to over $120 million.

For XRP holders, the latest projection suggests a steady but modest growth curve, with values of $3.49 in 2026, $4.24 in 2030, $5.41 in 2035, and $6.90 in 2040. It is a respectable climb, yet for many traders seeking faster compounding gains, the slow-and-steady pace is starting to feel more like a Sunday stroll than a bull run sprint. That is where investor attention is shifting. While XRP may hold its ground as a long-term, lower-volatility option, a different conversation is heating up, one focused on high-growth potential, AI-driven rewards, and market-ready liquidity. At the center of that discussion is Bitcoin Swift, also known as BTC3, which has rapidly become the most talked-about presale of the season. XRP’s Place in the Forecast To be clear, XRP remains a foundational asset for many portfolios. Its projected price milestones reflect a solid performance, especially for those prioritizing stability. The utility of its payment network and its regulatory positioning give it a strong case for long-term relevance. Still, its gradual appreciation means that traders looking for sharper short-term ROI may be tempted to diversify into projects with more aggressive growth strategies, and that is exactly where BTC3 enters the scene. Why Bitcoin Swift is Pulling in Investors Bitcoin Swift (BTC3) is designed as a decentralized financial operating system, not just another speculative token. It integrates programmable PoY rewards, AI-powered smart contracts, a privacy-first decentralized identity framework, and a hybrid PoW plus PoS consensus model. This combination delivers scalability, compliance readiness, and adaptive governance. Its PoY system is a standout feature, dynamically adjusting rewards based on network activity, sustainability metrics, and governance decisions. AI agents inside smart contracts can adapt and optimize without manual updates. Quadratic voting tied to decentralized identity ensures governance power stays with engaged participants, not just deep-pocketed whales. Security and Investor Confidence BTC3’s credibility is supported by multiple verifications, including the Solidproof Audit , the Spywolf Audit , and team KYC . According to internal sources, a third audit with a well-known blockchain firm is already underway, further strengthening protocol integrity and investor trust. Influencer Spotlight A wave of respected crypto voices has been covering BTC3: Crypto Sister has analyzed its adaptive PoY reward system. Bull Run Angel discussed its potential for building sustainable wealth. Token Galaxy broke down its technical and governance strengths. Technical Highlights That Matter Some of the most investor-attracting features include: AI Energy Efficiency : AI oracles track environmental impact and reward low-carbon participation. Governance Architecture : AI-assisted proposal screening, DID reputation scoring, and quadratic voting ensure fair governance. Bitcoin Swift also integrates privacy-preserving zk-SNARK technology, allowing compliance checks without revealing sensitive personal data. Stage 4 Presale Momentum BTC3’s Stage 4 presale is showing serious traction: Price at $4, with a planned launch at $15 Stage 4 APY at 106% Over 2,100 investors and $580k+ raised PoY rewards distributed at the end of each presale stage for immediate benefits Insider chatter suggests the team is already in talks with major exchanges such as MEXC, KuCoin, and LBank. Adding to its appeal, BTC3 has one of the highest liquidity levels seen at this stage, which is crucial for smooth post-launch trading and reduced volatility. Referral Program Driving Expansion BTC3’s referral system doubles the reward potential. Anyone referring a new participant earns 10% instantly, and the referred buyer gets the same bonus. This straightforward approach fuels organic network growth while rewarding active community members. Roadmap Overview Q3–Q4 2025: Presale launch and PoY reward activation on Solana Q1 2026: AI-powered smart contracts and oracle integration Q2 2026: zk-SNARK ledger and privacy-focused DeFi beta Q3 2026: AI-driven governance rollout Q4 2026: BTC3 mainnet launch and institutional onboarding Final Verdict: Why Bitcoin Swift Is Dominating Headlines While XRP’s steady rise to $6.90 by 2040 makes it a reliable long-term hold, Bitcoin Swift’s rapid innovation cycle, high liquidity, and AI-driven economic model position it as the breakout story of the year. For investors willing to embrace new tech and adaptive governance, BTC3 offers a growth profile that is hard to ignore.

Binance Coin price analysis gives a bullish prediction regarding ongoing market events. The coin’s value has increased to $803 in the past 24 hours. If buyers continue to push the price upward, a strong increase toward $818 might emerge. On the other hand, if sellers defend the immediate resistance at the $816 level strongly, BNB price might see a correction, and the next target could be $794.4. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $5,928.95 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB up? BNB found support, and the price moved toward $803. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has gained up to 0.51 percent of its value if looked at from an overall view. Will BNB reach $800? Most crypto analysts, including WalletInvestor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $800 mark in 2025, which would be higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2026. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes it a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2028, according to Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $5,928.95 by 2031.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coingecko Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May, while it marked a new ATH of $858.34 on July 28. Heading into August, BNB is trading at approximately $767.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB|MARKET|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-10 10:00:00

49852094,https://timestabloid.com/?p=77512,1754820037,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Before You Double Down on XRP or SOL, You Might Want to See Why This Altcoin Is Gaining Ground At This Pace",https://timestabloid.com/before-you-double-down-on-xrp-or-sol-you-might-want/,"XRP and SOL have long been favorites for many crypto investors looking for relatively stable, well-known projects. They’ve earned their reputation as solid picks. But smart investors today are increasingly seeking out emerging altcoins with smaller market caps that boast real-world utility, clear roadmaps, and strong growth potential. One such rising star is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , an innovative DeFi platform making waves with its unique lending models and rapidly growing community. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out because it is building to blend traditional crypto lending with a fresh approach that opens up opportunities often missed by giants like XRP and SOL. Its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending pools will enable users to deposit blue-chip assets and earn passive income, while borrowers gain liquidity without losing exposure to their holdings. Unlocking New Possibilities with Dual Lending Models Take the P2C system as an example: a user who deposits $2,500 worth of Binance Coin (BNB) at a conservative 65% Loan-to-Value (LTV) will be able to borrow $1,625 USDT against that collateral. Meanwhile, the lender supplying funds to the pool will earn a robust 10.8% annual percentage yield (APY), which will translate to $270 in yearly earnings. This arrangement will allow borrowers to maintain their position in BNB, benefiting from any future price appreciation while accessing liquid funds. It’s a win-win scenario not commonly available on XRP or SOL platforms, which typically won’t focus on lending mechanics with such flexibility. Beyond this, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending model will tap into higher-risk, higher-reward segments by enabling loans secured by memecoins like FLOKI and TRUMP. These markets will remain largely untapped by the larger platforms, offering investors the chance to engage with assets that have explosive growth potential but were previously sidelined due to risk or regulatory concerns. This dual lending framework will position Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a versatile platform catering to conservative and speculative users alike, expanding its reach well beyond what many established altcoins will offer. Presale Momentum and Clear Growth Path Fuel Investor Confidence Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale, priced at $0.035 per token, and has raised a remarkable $14.25 million to date. With 15% of the total token supply sold and over 15,100 holders onboard, the project’s community is gaining strength. Investors are eagerly anticipating the upcoming Phase 7 price increase to $0.040, which is driving excitement and a sense of urgency among presale participants. The potential upside for early adopters is exemplified by a confident investor who shifted $1,000 out of SOL into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) during Phase 1 when the token was priced at just $0.01. Today, that initial stake is valued at $3,500. As the token approaches its planned listing price of $0.06, the holding’s value will climb to $6,000. Looking further ahead, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s ambitious roadmap projects a post-listing price exceeding $3 per token, translating that same investment into an astonishing $300,000. What fuels this confidence is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s focus on delivering tangible utility. Upcoming milestones such as the launch of its decentralized stablecoin, integration of Layer-2 scalability solutions, the beta release of its platform, and listings on major exchanges will create multiple catalysts for value appreciation. Unlike many tokens that rely solely on market hype, MUTM’s growth is grounded in clear, practical advancements that will enhance user adoption and platform sustainability. Security and Giveaways Additionally, security and community trust are priorities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has undergone a rigorous CertiK audit, earning a score of 95 and a Skynet rating of 78—figures that highlight strong code quality and security standards. The platform is also launching a $50,000 Bug Bounty program with tiered rewards ranging from $200 to $2,000 for vulnerabilities found, incentivizing continuous improvement. Coupled with a $100,000 giveaway campaign, these initiatives foster community engagement and broaden appeal. While XRP and SOL remain solid pillars in the crypto ecosystem, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is carving its own path as a utility-driven altcoin with a compelling narrative. Its dual lending system will unlock new financial possibilities, and the growing presale traction signals investor confidence in its long-term vision. For those seeking to diversify beyond the usual names, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents an accessible opportunity with the infrastructure and momentum to deliver meaningful returns. As the crypto market grows, the time to explore emerging projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now—before the market fully recognizes their potential and prices reflect what investors already see.

Both parties have agreed to drop pending appeals, providing regulatory clarity that could smooth the ETF approval process. Following the development, industry analysts are increasingly confident about XRP’s ETF prospects. For instance, Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas has maintained a 95% approval probability, dismissing recent drops in prediction market odds as insignificant. Notably, data from crypto prediction market Polymarket indicates that the odds for an XRP ETF approval in 2025 have fallen below the 80% mark to the current 77%. On the other hand, Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, believes major asset managers like BlackRock are now more likely to file for an XRP spot ETF , arguing it makes “zero sense” to limit offerings to Bitcoin and Ethereum alone.
