The order sets strict limits on when banks can refuse to serve lawful businesses, including crypto firms. The order also introduces an independent overseer to ensure compliance. The move has sparked debate in the crypto and financial community. Some see it as the end of “Operation Choke Point 2.0.” Others are waiting to see if the order will truly restore accounts to crypto companies that were previously debanked. Caitlin Long on Independent Watchdog for Crypto Debanking Issues In a recent X post , Custodia Bank founder and CEO Caitlin Long spotlighted these new changes. She said the creation of an independent overseer is the most significant part of the executive order. President Trump appointed Kelly Loeffler, a former U.S. senator, pro-Bitcoin, to oversee the compliance of the order. Her role is to monitor debanking activities outside of the control of the three main banking regulators. This includes the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Federal Reserve (Fed), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). Before entering politics, Loeffler was CEO of Bakkt, an institutional Bitcoin futures platform. Her appointment proves that the current administration wants someone with deep knowledge of the crypto industry in a position of authority. Concerns About Political Bias in the Banking Sector Long said the decision to put the Small Business Administration (SBA) in charge shows a lack of confidence in traditional banking regulators. She added that it signals doubt about those agencies’ willingness to address political bias. Long notes that political leanings among Fed and FDIC staff may have influenced past actions. She pointed out that in 2024, up to 92% of their political donations went to Democratic candidates. Critics worry that such biases may have shaped regulatory decisions. It was noted that during the Biden administration, many crypto-related firms faced scrutiny . Some were even cut off from banking services despite following all legal requirements. Custodia Bank itself was cut off from several banking partners after regulators pressured them, despite having a clean compliance record. Protection for All Lawful Businesses, Not Just Crypto The executive order focuses on protecting lawful business activities instead of naming specific industries. This means banks cannot refuse services simply because a company operates in crypto , as long as the company follows the law. The rule also protects other lawful businesses that could face discrimination for political reasons. Caitlin Long believes the success of the order will depend on its practical results. If banks that previously shut out lawful crypto firms are compelled to reopen their accounts, the order will have achieved its goal. For now, the crypto sector is watching closely to see whether Trump’s debanking order leads to real change. Some fear it could become another unfulfilled promise in the long battle for fair banking access.

According to technical analysis, Dogecoin’s recent price action has opened up a pathway to $1 that’s becoming increasingly visible if some conditions are met. Particularly, technical analysis by crypto analyst MMBTtrader on the TradingView platform outlines a bullish setup that formed after a decisive Dogecoin price breakout from a long-term downtrend channel on the 3-day candlestick chart. Related Reading: Crypto Is Here To Stay—Even The SEC Can’t Do Anything About It, Analyst Says Downtrend Channel Breakout And Retest Complete As shown in the 3-day candlestick price chart below, which was initially shared by MMBTtrader, Dogecoin broke above a descending parallel channel on July 15. This breakout is significant because it represents a shift in market structure from sustained selling pressure to an expansion phase from a channel that had contained its price action since late 2024. However, after breaking out of this channel in mid-July, Dogecoin kicked off a correction path on July 21 that saw it reach down towards the upper trendline of the descending channel again. As noted by the analyst, this move allowed Dogecoin to successfully retest the breakout zone, which is a move he sees as confirmation that bulls have regained control. Notably, the 0.61 Fibonacci retracement level appears as a key pivot point where Dogecoin’s price action eventually found strong support. This support was around the $0.188 price low on August 2, where it bounced upwards and has closed three bullish 3-day candles since then. MMBTtrader interpreted these candles as a healthy signal, suggesting that over-leveraged long positions have already been flushed out, and Dogecoin’s price action is now in a more stable state for a strong upside move. Dogecoin Will Reach $1 When This Happens Now that Dogecoin seems to have bounced from its retest of the descending trendline, the analyst highlighted some targets on the way to $1. The first price target is $0.32, which aligns with the 0.236 Fibonacci resistance and acted as a strong support level in December 2024. As such, breaching this level would represent a decisive break above a support-turned-resistance situation. One of the most important observations in the analysis is the $0.40 resistance level, which is marked on the chart with a prominent red horizontal zone. According to MMBTtrader, a clean break above $0.40 would shift Dogecoin into what he calls an “extremely bullish” phase. A breakout above $0.40 would unlock upside potential and push Dogecoin to new price territories above its current all-time high of $0.73. Particularly, the projection is that of a move to $0.75 and the most-coveted $1 price level.

According to data from CoinGecko, the altcoin is one of the top gainers amongst the large-cap assets, with its value up by double digits in the last seven days. Interestingly, the XRP price seems to only be at the beginning of what looks like an even broader upward trend. This positive setup is even more supported by rapidly improving fundamentals of cryptocurrencies globally, but especially in the United States. Why XRP Surged 630% And 54% In Its Last Two Major Rallies In an August 8 post on X, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez painted an exciting bullish picture for the XRP price. According to the online pundit, the latest on-chain indications are that the XRP token is about to embark on an extended bullish rally over the next few months. This positive projection revolves around unique movements of the MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) Ratio, which assesses whether a cryptocurrency (XRP, in this case) is overvalued or not. Martinez noted that the altcoin could be back on its bullish tracks following a golden cross between the MVRV ratio and its 200-day simple moving average (SMA). Typically, a golden cross refers to a bullish signal in technical analysis where a short-term moving average (MVRV ratio) crosses from below a long-term moving average (200-day moving average). What’s more interesting is the performance of XRP price the last two times this golden cross occurred. According to the latest on-chain data, the last two times the MVRV ratio flashed this golden cross, the price of XRP surged by 630% and 54%, respectively. If history is anything to go by, the reappearance of this signal could open the doors to an extended rally for the third-largest cryptocurrency. There is no question that the improving climate for cryptocurrencies in the United States could provide an enabling environment to sustain a significant bull run for the XRP token. Moreover, the shout of an altcoin season beginning further gives credence to the potential of XRP’s price witnessing exponential growth in the next few months. XRP Price At A Glance As of this writing, the value of XRP stands at around $3.31, with a 0.7% decline in the past 24 hours. This past day’s action is not a strong reflection of the altcoin’s performance on the weekly timeframe. According to data from CoinGecko, the XRP price jumped by more than 10% to reclaim the $3 mark over the past week.

The incident, which took place on Tuesday evening, August 5, is the latest in a growing pattern of crypto-related crimes in France. Details Of The Attack According to local media reports, the incident began at around 7:15 p.m. at the Peninsula Hotel, a luxury establishment located on Avenue Kléber in Paris’s 16th arrondissement. Hotel staff alerted the police after witnessing five unknown men approach one of their guests and demand, “Give us 400,000 euros, and it’s over.” The victim was then forcibly taken from the hotel to an area near the Arc de Triomphe, where he was physically assaulted. Officers from the anti-crime brigade quickly responded and arrested all five suspects in the 8th arrondissement. Initial investigations revealed that the group may be connected to a nearby nightclub, where the victim allegedly owed €40,000. Police believes the suspects were attempting to collect that debt by force. The victim was briefly interviewed by authorities and said he had been beaten and threatened. He reported that the attackers took his iPhone 13 Pro Max and a hard drive containing Bitcoin worth around €2 million. He added that a previous incident had occurred the week before, during which the same individuals had displayed a weapon. The suspects were taken into custody at the First District Police headquarters for extortion. During the night, investigators from the Anti-Banditism Brigade took over the case. The Paris prosecutor’s office confirmed that five people were in custody and that investigations and hearings are ongoing. Crypto Crime in Paris on the Rise This isn’t the first time Paris has made the headlines for crypto-related crime. The country has endured a series of violent kidnappings targeting individuals in the industry. The most recent case happened in May and involved a failed attempt by a masked gang to abduct relatives of the co-founder of French Bitcoin exchange Paynium. Twenty five suspects were later indicted for the failed abduction. Another incident saw the father of a crypto millionaire being hijacked while walking their dog. David Balland, co-founder of Ledger, and his wife were also taken from their home in France in January, with French special forces rescuing the couple after a 58-hour ordeal. The operation led to multiple arrests, including individuals with prior crypto-related convictions. Both cases involved a ransom demand, with the victims being released with missing fingers.

Nvidia Corp., currently valued at close to $4.5 trillion , holds the position as the world’s most valuable business, while AI innovators such as OpenAI and Anthropic have secured funding worth tens of billions of dollars. But beyond the enthusiasm, investors are preparing for market shifts on a scale not seen since the early days of the web, according to Bloomberg . Many are repositioning their investments away from companies seen as exposed to artificial intelligence, driven competition, anticipating a drop in demand for their offerings as the technology becomes more prevalent. Website-creation platform Wix.com Ltd., stock-image supplier Shutterstock Incorporated, and software producer Adobe Incorporated are among 26 businesses identified by Bank of America as being in the highest-risk category. Since mid-May, this collection has trailed the S&P 500 Index by about 22 percentage points, after previously moving mostly in line with the market since ChatGPT first appeared in late 2022. “The disruption is real,” said Daniel Newman, CEO of the Futurum Group. “We thought it would happen over five years. It seems like it is going to happen over two. Service-based businesses with a high headcount are going to be really vulnerable.” Although no major business collapses have yet been tied directly to artificial intelligence, software that can program, handle complex questions, and produce imagery or videos is beginning to challenge older business approaches. With firms such as Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. committing hundreds of billions to AI development, the competitive strain is building. Wix.com and Shutterstock have both seen their share prices drop more than 33% this year, compared with an 8.6% increase for the S&P 500. Adobe’s stock is down 23% as investors worry customers may turn to AI for making images, like Coca-Cola did in an ad campaign. The nervousness extends past the creative and staffing industries. Gartner Incorporated’s shares sank 30% last week, the steepest one-week drop in its history, after it cut its yearly revenue forecast. While Gartner pointed to U.S. policy shifts such as budget cuts and tariffs, some analysts suggested that AI could offer less expensive alternatives to its research services. Morgan Stanley said the update “added fuel to the AI disruption case,” and Baird noted heightened concerns about AI’s influence. Gartner did not respond. Not every business on AI’s path is struggling Technology has a long history of displacing older markets, from telegraphs replaced by telephones to Blockbuster losing out to Netflix. Adam Sarhan, CEO of 50 Park Investments, said, “Any company where you’re paying someone to do something that AI can do faster and cheaper will be wiped out, think graphic design, administrative work, data analysis.” Duolingo Inc., despite competition from AI translation systems, has doubled its share price over the last year after boosting its 2025 revenue guidance, thanks in part to its own AI-powered tools. Still, questions linger over how sustainable such growth will be. The gap between stock market winners and laggards has widened considerably in 2025. Earlier this year, low-cost AI products from China raised doubts about U.S. dominance, but instead of slowing their efforts, large tech players have expanded their budgets. Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet Inc., and Amazon.com Inc. are forecast to invest roughly $350 billion in total capital spending this fiscal year, almost 50% higher than the prior year, largely to expand AI infrastructure. This surge has benefited companies like Nvidia, whose processors drive most AI systems. Determining which enterprises are most at risk isn’t always simple. Alphabet, a leader in AI development, still appears on Bank of America’s high-risk roster, in part because it must defend its stronghold in online search. In other cases, the risk is clearer: advertising giant Omnicom Group Inc. has dropped 15% this year, and WPP Plc has plummeted over 50%, amid reports that Meta aims to fully automate ad creation.

Other major asset classes have posted more modest gains, with emerging market stocks (VWO) up 15.6%, the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) up 12.7% and U.S. large caps (SPY) rising 9.4%. Meanwhile, U.S. mid caps (MDY) and small caps (IWM) 0.2% have only gained 0.8%, respectively. This marks the first time gold and bitcoin have occupied the top two positions in Bilello’s annual asset class rankings since records began. 2011–2025 Cumulative returns Over the longer term, bitcoin has delivered an extraordinary 38,897,420% total return since 2011 — a figure that dwarfs all other asset classes in the dataset. Gold’s 126% cumulative return over the same period puts it in the middle of the pack, trailing equity benchmarks like the Nasdaq 100 (1101%) and U.S. large caps (559%), as well as mid caps (316%), small caps (244%) and emerging market stocks (57%). Based on Bilello’s figures, bitcoin’s total return has exceeded gold’s by more than 308,000 times over the past 14 years. 2011–2025 Annualized returns When measured on an annualized basis, bitcoin’s dominance is equally clear. The flagship cryptocurrency has delivered a 141.7% average annual gain since 2011, compared with 5.7% for gold, 18.6% for the Nasdaq 100, 13.8% for U.S. large caps and 4.4% to 16.4% for other major equity and real estate indexes. Gold’s long-term stability has made it a valuable hedge in certain market cycles, but its pace of appreciation has been far slower than bitcoin’s exponential climb. Gold vs. bitcoin, according to Peter Brandt Renowned trader Peter Brandt weighed in on Aug. 8, contrasting gold’s merits as a store of value with bitcoin’s potential to surpass all fiat alternatives. “Some think gold is a great store of value — and it is. But the ultimate store of value will prove to be bitcoin,” he said on X, sharing a long-term chart of the U.S. dollar’s purchasing power. His comments echo the growing narrative that bitcoin’s scarcity and decentralization make it uniquely positioned to outperform traditional hedges over time. Technical Analysis Highlights According to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model, between Aug. 8 at 21:00 UTC and Aug. 9 at 20:00 UTC, bitcoin traded within a $1,534.42 range (1.31%) from $116,352.52 to $117,886.44. Price opened near $116,900 and moved sideways before surging during Asian hours, climbing from $116,440 to $117,886 between 05:00 UTC and 10:00 UTC on Aug. 9, with 24-hour trading volume exceeding 9,000 BTC during these intervals. Strong buying emerged near $116,420 at 05:00 UTC, while selling pressure intensified around the $117,886 high. Bitcoin closed the session at $116,517, down 0.32% from the open, with defined support at $116,400–$116,500 and resistance at $117,400–$117,900 In the final hour of the analysis period (Aug. 9, 19:06–20:05 UTC), bitcoin remained under downward pressure within a $195.11 band, sliding from $116,629.40 to $116,519.29 (-0.09%). The largest final-hour volume spike occurred at 19:27 UTC, when 296.43 BTC changed hands as price tested $116,547 support. Recovery attempts were repeatedly capped near $116,600–$116,713, in line with earlier intraday resistance.

Those who recognized its promise reaped massive rewards as the token skyrocketed in value. Today, seasoned crypto investors are drawing similar comparisons to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a project that is quietly building one of the strongest presales in the DeFi space. What sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart is not just the current price of $0.035 during its Phase 6 presale but the solid foundation of real-world utility, a carefully designed ecosystem, and a highly secure architecture validated by a CertiK audit. Strong Growth, Clear Roadmap, and Real Utility Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already attracted more than 15,000 holders, raising upwards of $14.25 million in its current presale phase. With 15% of its tokens sold at the $0.035 price point, the momentum behind MUTM is unmistakable. Investors who entered during the very first phase at $0.01 have experienced a substantial 250% return. Looking ahead, the token is expected to list at $0.06, positioning these early supporters for an impressive sixfold return on their initial investment before broader exchange listings even take place. The project’s roadmap offers a clear vision of what lies ahead. While significant elements of Phase 1, such as the presale launch, marketing efforts, and the CertiK smart contract audit (which earned an excellent score of 95), are completed, much of the platform’s core infrastructure is still in development. Smart contract enhancements, full frontend and backend integration, regulatory compliance, and the beta launch are all forthcoming milestones. Additionally, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing for exchange listings and multi-chain deployments, which will further expand its reach and utility. Stablecoin, Dual Lending and Security One of the most innovative features on the horizon is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s stablecoin. This stablecoin will operate on an overcollateralized model, meaning users will be able to mint it only by borrowing against trusted crypto assets like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH). The stablecoin’s price stability will be maintained through governance-controlled interest rates that automatically adjust based on market demand. Arbitrage mechanisms will also come into play, ensuring the stablecoin remains tightly pegged to $1. These dynamic controls will balance supply and demand to preserve the token’s value in volatile markets. Adding further incentive, users will be able to stake mtTokens—interest-bearing tokens received when lending into the platform’s pools—in designated smart contracts. mtToken stakers will earn rewards in MUTM tokens sourced from protocol-generated revenues. In the future, a portion of this revenue will be used to buy back MUTM tokens from the open market, creating a sustainable value cycle that benefits loyal holders. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will offer two distinct lending options tailored to different investor profiles. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending model allows users to lend stablecoins such as USDT to borrowers who provide blue-chip crypto like BTC as collateral. This setup offers relatively stable returns with moderate risk. Conversely, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending channel caters to more aggressive traders who want to engage with short-term, risk-on loans backed by volatile tokens including BONK and TRUMP. This dual approach ensures the platform appeals to a wide range of users, from cautious lenders to speculative borrowers. Security remains a top priority for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The CertiK audit has verified the platform’s smart contracts for vulnerabilities and robustness, granting a high assurance score. To further protect the ecosystem, the project has introduced a $50,000 Bug Bounty program, rewarding white-hat hackers for identifying bugs with payouts ranging up to $2,000 depending on severity. Alongside this, a $100,000 giveaway campaign is active, incentivizing community growth and engagement. Why Now Is the Time for Smart Money Smart investors are already positioning themselves ahead of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s upcoming price increase. Once Phase 6 concludes, the price per token will rise by 15% to $0.040 in Phase 7. This creates a narrow window for new buyers to enter at the lowest available price before the token appreciates further. Given the project’s impressive early traction, innovative technology, and clear pathway to unlocking major utility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up to be one of the most promising opportunities on the market today. For anyone watching the space closely, the time to act is now before the presale price rises and the token begins its official journey on exchanges. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building to offer a unique blend of innovation, security, and growth potential that smart money is already seizing, making it a standout presale poised for significant impact.

Institutions continue to invest billions into U.S-based Bitcoin ETFs and as the American regulatory landscape turns more crypto-friendly, attention is gradually shifting toward altcoins. Crypto traders and investors are waiting for the early signs of the breakout of altcoin season 2025 And while altcoins are showing signs of strength, a new project is gaining traction. MAGACOIN FINANCE is coming out as a top contender in this bull cycle . While Bitcoin remains the benchmark, analysts point to projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE as potential breakout candidates during the next leg of alt season. Its rising momentum and growing presale activity have drawn attention from both retail and strategic investors looking for exposure outside of legacy coins. Bitcoin May Look Strong, but Altcoins Might Make a Comeback Soon Bitcoin’s current price has a strong hold above $110,000, climbing nearly doubling over the past 12 months. Institutional interest has never been higher – July’s record $12.8 billion in net ETF inflows stirred the market and bullish predictions started flooding social media. Meanwhile, macro factors such as a weak U.S. dollar and a liquidity boost from central banks have pushed global liquidity to $176.2 trillion, indirectly supporting crypto valuations. Institutional confidence is reflected in moves like Anthony Pompliano’s launch of ProCap BTC, expected to hold up to $1 billion in Bitcoin. Vietnam’s decision to legalize crypto payments starting next year could also unlock growth across Southeast Asia. All signs point to broader adoption and improving sentiment, but the real question remains: when will that spill over into altcoins? The Altcoin that Grabs the Spotlight As the market prepares for a potential altcoin surge, the fast-growing investor base and mega bullish price predictions make MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the cryptocurrencies to watch closely in the next few months. Unlike meme coins driven with absolutely no utility, this project is backed by real development and early ecosystem utility. Analysts predict MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver up to 68x returns during the next bull run , saying this could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity . With early rounds selling out in record time , the project is becoming one of 2025’s most talked-about altcoins. Early backers see the limited entry window as an opportunity to lock in gains before major listings take it mainstream. Alt Season May Be Brewing Below the Surface Altcoin season is very close as Bitcoin dominance is currently at 60.6%, and a slip below 60% could spark the next bull cycle for alternative cryptocurrencies. As of now, altcoin performance remains mixed. Ethereum is up 50% in the past year, while Solana has slipped 48% from its ATH. Cardano is still far away from its previous record price of $3.01. However, XRP and Tron have flipped green, hinting at potential leaders once momentum shifts. Another key indicator is the total altcoin market cap, which currently sits at $1.51 trillion. Historical patterns also show that crypto markets respond to global liquidity with a delay—meaning the recent expansion could fuel gains into late Q3. What’s Next? Bitcoin’s current strength is underpinned by institutional inflows, improving global liquidity, and political support in the U.S. But as history has shown, once Bitcoin cools, altcoins tend to accelerate. That transition may already be underway. With projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE gaining traction, investors are starting to position themselves for what could be a lucrative second half of 2025.

The directive will expand how Americans invest for retirement and potentially give bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies a stronger role in long-term portfolios. But this change will not roll out quickly, and analysts say it faces major hurdles before most savers ever see it in their accounts. Under the order, retirement plans could one day allow holdings in assets like bitcoin, which has seen growing institutional demand since U.S. bitcoin ETFs launched last year. The potential is there for crypto to become part of mainstream retirement investing. But even with Trump’s approval , that doesn’t mean employers will suddenly add BONK, Pudgy Penguins, or other meme coins to employee investment menus. Doug Boneparth, certified financial planner and founder of Bone Fide Wealth, said it was notable to see “digital assets getting presidential-level attention,” but stressed “the reality is a lot more nuanced.” Employers face legal and risk hurdles before adding crypto The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) governs how retirement plans are managed, and any major change in investment options requires careful review and agreement from plan sponsors. These sponsors carry fiduciary responsibilities, meaning they must run the plan in the best interest of participants and comply with ERISA. That makes it harder to add volatile, still-developing assets like crypto. Fidelity broke new ground in 2022 as the first major provider to give savers the option to put bitcoin in their 401(k)s, but Doug said whether employees could use it “came down to employers’ risk tolerance and fiduciary responsibility.” That’s not going to shift immediately because of an executive order. Preston Cherry, certified financial planner and founder of Concurrent Financial Planning, warned that too many investment choices can backfire. “People become overwhelmed with the investment menu options,” he said, adding that this often leads to lower participation. Even when employers offer education on these investments, workers have to opt in to receive it, and Preston said participation rates “are typically low.” He also questioned how employers will decide which coins are allowed. Separating bitcoin, ether, and Solana from the rest of the crypto market requires oversight from an investment committee or plan sponsor. Without it, employees could end up exposed to coins with extreme price swings. Preston pointed out that many people “can’t understand 30%, 40%, 50% drawdowns – and it could be destructive.” While he’s not against crypto in retirement accounts, he urged investors to “be crypto cautious.” Plan providers and recordkeepers will control final decisions Even if employers are willing to add crypto, the choice may ultimately rest with plan providers and recordkeepers. U.S. retirement accounts held $43 trillion in assets in the first quarter, with about $9 trillion in 401(k)s. By comparison, the entire crypto market is worth nearly $4 trillion. Integrating the two is a huge step, and companies controlling plan infrastructure will decide whether it’s worth the operational and regulatory challenges. Trump’s order follows other administration moves to promote U.S. dominance in crypto. In July, he signed the GENIUS Act, the first U.S. law for stablecoins. The Securities and Exchange Commission has also launched Project Crypto, aimed at updating securities rules for crypto-based trading. Tyrone Ross, CEO of registered investment advisor 401 Financial, said, “The plan providers, the third-party providers, the recordkeepers, are going to decide the end result here, if they want to put crypto in or not.” He added that while the administration is committed to making the U.S. the global crypto hub, major firms like Fidelity, Schwab, MassMutual, and Vanguard may not rush to implement the change. Doug agreed that the executive order is “more symbolic than structural right now.” But he also said it opens a door for education in the retirement space. While he believes bitcoin has a long-term place in a diversified portfolio, he emphasized that fiduciaries must weigh opportunity and risk before offering it. “If we do this right, the door opens a little wider to the future of retirement investing,” Doug said. “If we don’t? Well then, who knows what meme coin we’re going to see on a retirement plan statement.” Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Prices drop, sentiment turns negative, and many investors retreat. But for those with long-term vision, this is often where the biggest opportunities begin. Buying in a bear market means getting assets at a discount – something seasoned investors call a “building phase” rather than a downturn. Some early movers are already looking toward strategic plays, including MAGACOIN FINANCE, a fast-growing altcoin that’s seeing record presale activity. As attention shifts away from hype and toward fundamentals, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are positioning themselves for the next breakout. Bitcoin Bitcoin remains the most trusted name in crypto, and for good reason. It’s limited to 21 million coins, making it a hedge against inflation and currency debasement. Despite market dips, BTC has consistently bounced back, often leading each new bull cycle. It’s the coin institutional investors tend to turn to first when risk appetite returns. Ethereum Ethereum has built an entire ecosystem that continues to evolve. With thousands of apps running on its blockchain and its recent upgrades reducing energy consumption and boosting scalability, ETH remains one of the strongest assets to hold during downturns. It’s a bet on innovation, not just speculation. MAGACOIN FINANCE While the top cryptos remain solid options, some investors are betting on bigger returns with emerging assets. MAGACOIN FINANCE is now targeting a massive 74x rally, drawing strong attention as early-stage demand hits new highs . With each round selling out faster than the last, it’s attracting comparisons to early-stage breakouts like DOGE and SHIBA – but with a utility-focused roadmap that aims to reward long-term holders. This could be the best altcoin for those seeking early-mover gains before broader adoption. Solana (SOL) Solana stands out for its fast transactions and low fees—features that matter more than ever in a market that demands efficiency. With developers flocking to its ecosystem and institutional interest growing, SOL has the momentum to push forward even when market conditions get tough. XRP XRP continues to be a favorite among those betting on traditional finance merging with blockchain. With its focus on real-world utility and ongoing developments in global payment systems, XRP is still considered a strong hold, especially with legal clarity expected to further unlock its price potential. Final Thoughts Bear markets are uncomfortable—but they’re also where wealth is built. Investors who stay focused on quality assets and adopt smart strategies like dollar-cost averaging, diversification, and staking can ride out the downturn and come out stronger. Bitcoin and Ethereum remain core holdings, but emerging stars like MAGACOIN FINANCE could offer the kind of explosive upside that turns down markets into unimaginable opportunities.

The only other stock to cross 7% was Apple in 2023. Even in the height of the 2000 dot-com bubble, Microsoft and General Electric never went past 4%. IBM’s peak in 1984 was about 6%, which now sits below Nvidia’s new record. This level means Nvidia’s daily price changes can sway the entire index more than any other company has in over four decades. The scale of Nvidia’s weight also shows how concentrated the market has become. One stock now holds a share bigger than any company during several of the most famous bull markets. That includes the 1999–2000 tech frenzy and IBM’s mid-80s corporate peak. U.S. approves H20 chip sales to China after earlier ban The U.S. Commerce Department has begun issuing licenses for Nvidia to export its H20 AI chips to China. The move comes after Washington reversed an April ban last month. Nvidia had created the H20 to comply with Biden-era rules on AI chip exports, but those restrictions still stopped shipments to China earlier this year. The company had warned in July that the sales ban could wipe $8 billion from its quarterly revenue. During the same month, Nvidia applied for licenses and was told approvals would be fast. On Wednesday, CEO Jensen Huang met with President Donald Trump at the White House, according to Reuters. It is still unclear how many licenses have been issued, which Chinese buyers can receive the H20, or the total shipment value. The new clearance reopens one of Nvidia’s biggest markets. While the H20 was designed to stay inside the export limits, the previous ban cut the company off from Chinese clients until now. Apple, Alphabet flagged as overbought while others slide Apple and Alphabet are now among Wall Street’s most overbought stocks by the 14-day relative strength index (RSI), which measures momentum. An RSI above 70 can suggest a pullback is near. Apple’s RSI reached 72 after a 13.3% weekly jump — its biggest gain in over five years — boosted by an extra $100 billion pledge for U.S. investment. That adds to the $500 billion commitment made in February. Apple’s expanded domestic production plans appear to shield it from Trump’s newly announced 100% tariffs on imported semiconductors and chips. Trump said on Wednesday that companies building in the U.S. would not be subject to the duties. The statement came after Apple’s July 31 earnings showed 10% revenue growth, its fastest since late 2021. Alphabet rose 6.5% for the week, with its RSI hitting 75. The company’s late-July earnings showed revenue up 14% year-over-year. Alphabet also plans to raise 2025 capital spending by $10 billion to handle rising demand for its cloud services. On the opposite side, Airbnb is among the most oversold stocks. Its RSI sits at 29 after a 5.3% drop this week. While it beat second-quarter forecasts, Airbnb warned of a weaker second half, guiding Q3 revenue between $4.02 billion and $4.10 billion, with analysts expecting $4.05 billion. The Trade Desk took the biggest hit. Its shares fell 37% for the week and plunged 39% on Friday alone, the worst single day in company history. The drop followed second-quarter results that topped estimates but were overshadowed by new competition from Amazon in online ads and the resignation of CFO Laura Schenkein. CEO Jeff Green also mentioned inflation pressures from Trump’s tariffs during the earnings call. Multiple analysts, including those from Citi, Wedbush, Bank of America, and MoffettNathanson, cut their ratings. Citi analyst Ygal Arounian wrote , “We still don’t believe Amazon is the main factor here, but results will inevitably raise more investor questions around the competitive environment and will remain an overhang.” Get seen where it counts.

Chainlink and Hedera are two well-known projects holding steady without delivering clear breakouts. In contrast, Cold Wallet is building momentum quietly, combining self-custody with a reward-driven system that keeps growing. While Chainlink expands its oracles and Hedera works on enterprise adoption, Cold Wallet is shifting the focus. Its utility-based model and 4,900% ROI potential are linked to an active reward ecosystem. At its current Stage 17 price of $0.00998, Cold Wallet is drawing attention from those seeking the best performing crypto today before the next major market move. Chainlink (LINK) Faces Resistance Near $17 Recent analysis on Chainlink (LINK) shows it is struggling to break past the $17.64 resistance level. The project continues to expand its role in real-time data services and strategic collaborations, but price action remains cautious. LINK has been trading within a set range for weeks, despite strong ecosystem updates. Experts note that breaking above $17.50 with strong trading volume could push LINK toward the $20 level. Until then, movement is likely to stay limited. This slower pace may encourage traders to explore other options for faster gains, with projects like Cold Wallet offering stronger early-stage ROI setups. Hedera (HBAR) Holds Support but Lacks Price Drive Hedera (HBAR) is holding its weekly support zones but has not shown significant upside recently. Price movement has been mostly flat, which some see as a pause before potential action, while others see it as reduced market interest. Technically, HBAR must close above $0.085 to spark renewed momentum. Similar patterns in the past have led to either rallies or declines depending on trading volume. Although Hedera continues to grow its enterprise ecosystem, its market price has yet to reflect these developments. This steady performance creates space for newer projects with higher growth potential. Cold Wallet fits this profile, providing both real-world utility and cashback benefits. Its design strengthens its position among those looking for the best performing crypto today under $0.01. Cold Wallet’s Cashback Approach and Its Growing Appeal Crypto was never meant to feel this costly to use. Gas fees, swap fees, and bridge fees act like hidden charges that make participation expensive. These costs are slowing adoption. Cold Wallet is designed to reverse that pattern. Instead of charging users for being active, it gives them rewards. Every time you use crypto with Cold Wallet, you receive a percentage back in CWT. It works as a simple cycle. Use the wallet, and it sends rewards back automatically. Pay gas? Receive CWT. Swap coins? Earn more. Bridge or move funds? You still get rewarded. This approach shifts the value cycle from being draining to being regenerative. It creates a reason to remain active in crypto without the constant financial hit that most platforms bring. CWT is not an extra feature. It is the core of the model. Cold Wallet’s tokenomics focus on rewarding real activity and scaling in a sustainable way. With its presale price at $0.00998 in Stage 17, the projected ROI is 4,900%, offering an advantage over coins that are stuck in slow price action. With $5.8 million already raised and a total of 150 stages, the early entry phase is still open. As the presale progresses, the price of CWT will increase. Cold Wallet’s framework is not driven by pure speculation. It is built around use, making it a system that stands out. In a market filled with passive holders, it encourages staying active and earning at the same time. Market Position and Potential Ahead Chainlink and Hedera still hold long-term value for those waiting for ecosystem progress to impact price. However, both remain in extended consolidation phases, giving little near-term ROI. This is why more attention is turning toward new utility-driven projects like Cold Wallet. With its cashback reward system and a current price of $0.00998 paired with 4,900% potential growth, Cold Wallet is not only among the best performing crypto today but is also structured to grow alongside its active users. The $5.8M already raised shows that early participants are taking notice of its approach.

Cardano (ADA) now struggles to stay near $0.50, while TRON (TRX) looks like it’s prepping to push past $0.34. Both remain top-tier altcoins in terms of activity, but the real action is happening elsewhere. But BlockDAG is where large buyers are focusing now. It’s not just the $0.0016 entry point that’s drawing attention; it’s the chance to claim a chunk of the platform’s massive 10 BTC pool, active until August 11. The prize? Real Bitcoin, based on how much BDAG is picked up during this round. The sooner buyers get in, the bigger their potential payout. Whales are circling fast, scooping up BDAG before others can claim their slice. BlockDAG’s 10 BTC Giveaway Pulls in Whales Fast Big names in crypto aren’t sitting around waiting for BlockDAG to go live; they’re jumping into BDAG now to lock in their place in the 10 BTC distribution event. This isn’t some typical promo. It’s a direct split of 10 Bitcoin, based on how much BDAG each buyer holds by August 11. The more BDAG is locked in, the higher the share of BTC earned. The longer the delay, the smaller the reward, because whales are stacking up. This offer runs alongside BlockDAG’s $0.0016 GLOBAL LAUNCH release, offering a possible 3,025% return compared to the $0.05 launch price. Already, over $367 million has come in, and 24.8 billion BDAG have been sold. The current price is well below the Batch 29 rate of $0.0276, but that price will return after August 11. That gives current buyers a rare opportunity to load up on BDAG at a deep discount. To push things further, BlockDAG has launched Dashboard V4, a live trading simulator designed to prep users for launch. It features real-time BDAG price charts, wallet balances, and an exchange-style order book. Users can test out trades before things go live. It’s sleek, interactive, and unlike most presales, which only give static dashboards or email alerts. Even among the market’s top trending altcoins, it’s hard to find this mix: low pricing, high ROI potential, and an active BTC payout system. BlockDAG checks all three boxes, and the whale activity proves it. Cardano (ADA) Struggles to Stay Above $0.50 Cardano (ADA) is in a tug-of-war zone near the $0.50 threshold. After making some upward moves, price action now sits near $0.48–$0.50, where bulls and bears are both applying pressure. A close above $0.52 might revive bullish momentum, but volume remains patchy. If ADA dips under $0.47, it could retest the $0.44 area seen earlier this summer. Despite the choppy action, ADA remains a watchlist coin for many traders seeking mid-cycle setups. Developers continue pushing upgrades like Hydra for scaling and sidechain features that could help sentiment long-term. However, for now, traders are reacting more to price patterns than news. ADA needs stronger buying power if it wants to reclaim top-tier altcoin status in this cycle. Breaking $0.52 cleanly would be the first step. TRON (TRX) Bulls Target $0.45, But Caution on RSI TRON (TRX) has seen a bump to around $0.332 after gaining 3%, with healthy trading volume backing the move. Buyers are pushing toward the $0.34–$0.35 level, and a breakout above could unlock a run to $0.45. On-chain stats remain solid: 323M+ active accounts and over $27B TVL. Derivatives traders are also showing optimism, with futures open interest ticking upward. Still, there’s a warning sign: RSI is now near 75, which is often a red flag for overbought territory. A pullback to $0.318 or even $0.30 isn’t off the table if momentum fades. That said, accumulation trends and consistent CVD data suggest buyers are still in control, provided support levels don’t break. TRX remains one of the few large-cap coins holding technical strength, and a clean break above $0.35 could bring in another round of volume. Looking Ahead Cardano (ADA) is stuck just shy of $0.50, with eyes on $0.52 as the next key test. TRON (TRX) remains technically strong but needs a clean push past $0.35 before RSI overheats. Both are still among the Top trending Altcoins, but neither has the traction right now that BlockDAG’s presale is seeing. With the 10 BTC distribution active and BDAG priced at just $0.0016 during the GLOBAL LAUNCH window, big buyers are stacking fast to maximize returns. Over $367M raised and 24.8B coins sold show just how aggressive the buying has become. The BTC pool is real, it’s running until August 11, and those who buy more now get a larger share. Wait too long, and whales will scoop up most of it. BDAG buyers aren’t just looking for returns; they’re playing for Bitcoin.

The executive order which is set to be signed this week, Trump is pushing to allow 401(k) retirement accounts to invest in crypto, private equity, and other non-traditional assets. The decision marks a major shift away from decades of conservative financial planning, potentially unlocking trillions in sidelined capital. This action builds on Trump’s growing embrace of digital assets. Over the past few months, he has hosted blockchain innovators at the White House, proposed a federal crypto advisory role, and even called for the U.S. to build a national Bitcoin reserve. With lawsuits against key platforms like Coinbase and Uniswap dropped, it’s clear that crypto policy under Trump is entering a friendlier phase. And now altcoins are gaining traction. The broader crypto market cap sits at around $3.76 trillion, and while Bitcoin still leads, its dominance has dropped to 60.7%, a clear signal that altcoins are starting to take the spotlight. Signs of Early Altseason Ethereum overshadowed Bitcoin’s performance with its Q2 2025 performance. Ethereum’s outperformance is often an early sign of capital rotating into altcoins—something that historically precedes full-blown altseasons. Altcoin-related metrics also support this narrative. According to CryptoQuant, weekly altcoin deposits on Binance have surged past 45,000, the highest in nearly a year. Technical signals are flashing green as well—the altcoin market cap just printed a golden cross, and the Altseason Index has climbed from 26 to 37, indicating a growing appetite for higher-risk assets. Current conditions are quite similar to the pre-bull market phase of 2021, where many altcoins created fortunes for a lot of investors. The Altcoin That Was Rated the Top Early-Stage Gem With the early signs of the altcoin season, MAGACOIN FINANCE has come out as a great opportunity for investors looking to gain an exposure to a project before it becomes mainstream. The project’s rapid rise has drawn incredible attention, especially since it offers more than just hype. With an expanding ecosystem, continuous development, and multiple sell-out early rounds , it’s quickly earning a reputation as 2025’s best crypto opportunity. What’s driving this buzz? Investor demand is skyrocketing, and the project is gaining traction across top-tier communities looking for the next 50x+ opportunity . Early supporters have already seen returns up to 7,800%, and with broader altcoin adoption accelerating, MAGACOIN FINANCE is well-positioned to ride the wave. Altcoin Momentum is Surging The numbers don’t lie—Ethereum’s dominance, on-chain flows, and altcoin market activity all point to a rising tide. While a full-scale altseason hasn’t officially begun, the early ingredients are there. Traders and analysts are watching closely, and many are already positioning themselves ahead of a potential breakout. With Trump’s crypto-friendly pivot and new access to retirement capital, Web3 could become a serious contender in traditional finance portfolios—something that would have seemed impossible just a few years ago. Final Words Trump’s executive order may be the biggest policy shakeup crypto has seen in years. By opening up 401(k) access to alternative assets like crypto, he’s creating the conditions for major capital inflows. At the same time, Ethereum’s strong Q3 and a wave of altcoin signals are setting the stage for a major rally. And as excitement builds, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to attract attention as the top altcoin presale to watch —giving early investors a shot at extraordinary gains before the next leg of the bull market kicks in.

Analyst Points To Key Level For A Comeback,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-reclaim-all-time-high/,"The Bitcoin price has been enjoying some form of resurgence over the past week, returning above the significant $115,000 level again. The premier cryptocurrency briefly crossed the $117,000 mark on Friday, August 8, capitalizing on recent bullish developments in the United States. On Thursday, August 7, United States President Donald Trump signed an executive order allowing cryptocurrency investment in 401(k) plans. The Bitcoin price rallied on the back of this positive development and looks set to continue this ascent back to its current all-time high. Why 118,000 Might Be Crucial For Bull Run Resumption In a recent post on the social media platform X, prominent crypto analyst Titan of Crypto put forward an interesting outlook for the Bitcoin price over the coming days. According to the current setup, the flagship cryptocurrency could be on its way back to its record-high price of around $122,800. Related Reading: Analyst Outlines How Production Cost Determines XRP Price, But Is It Better Than Bitcoin? Titan of Crypto highlighted that the Bitcoin price has been on an upward trend since April 2025 and recently just bounced off the ascending trendline. Also, the market leader has filled the Fair Value Gap (FVG), a liquidity void often created by a sharp movement in price. However, the Bitcoin price seems to be approaching a critical level around the Kijun-sen (blue line) from the Ichimoku Cloud indicator. The Kijun-sen, also known as the Base Line, often represents the market’s equilibrium and can act as a key support and resistance level. As shown in the chart setup above, the market leader has climbed back above the Tenkan-sen (red line), which is an indicator of early momentum shift. Meanwhile, the Kijun-sen (hovering around $118,000) appears to be the only obstacle in the way of Bitcoin returning to its all-time-high price within the $123,000 region. However, a sustained close above the “blue line” could suggest a resumption of the bull run for the price of BTC. Moreover, the Chikou Span (orange line), which is a lagging indicator, remains in the bullish zone, supporting a broader uptrend narrative for the market leader. Bitcoin Price Overview As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin stands at around $116,880, with no significant movement in the past 24 hours. This sluggishness does not adequately reflect the coin’s activity over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, the premier cryptocurrency is up by more than 3% on the weekly timeframe.

His time on the council encouraged significant engagement with the crypto industry. According to reports, Hines will be replaced by his deputy, Patrick Witt, who is currently the deputy director of the council and acting director of the Office of Strategic Capital at the Department of Defense. While Hines has shared an intention to return to the private sector , there are indications that he plans to retain an advisory role as a special government employee and will assist White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks with AI-related initiatives. Bo Hines walks away from White House role Hines shared a statement regarding the development on X, expressing how honorable it has been to serve in President Trump’s administration and work alongside AI & Crypto Czar David Sacks as Executive Director of the White House Crypto Council . “Together, we have positioned America as the crypto capital of the world. I’m deeply grateful to the industry for its unwavering support — I love this community and all we’ve built together. As I return to the private sector, I look forward to continuing my support for the crypto ecosystem as it thrives here in the United States,” he wrote. The administration’s AI and Crypto Czar, David Sacks shared his admiration for Hines’ “expertise” in leading the inaugural crypto council and his role in pulling accomplishments like the crypto summit, GENIUS Act, and digital assets report over the finish line. The Trump appointee also said he looks forward to the departing Hines’ “advise” in the future. Acting CFTC head is also on her way out Hines is the latest Trump appointee to reveal his desire to return to the private sector upon resignation. In May, it was revealed that the current head of the CFTC , Caroline Pham, also has similar plans scheduled for later this year. Pham confirmed this is true while delivering a speech at the International Swaps and Derivatives Association Annual Meeting in Amsterdam, saying she’ll step down as soon as Brian Quintenz is confirmed as chairman. “I will be returning to the private sector once Brian Quintenz is confirmed as Chairman,” she said. “While I don’t have any specific plans for what’s next for me personally yet, I hope to make some over the next several months.” Pham’s exit comes after fellow Republican commissioner, Summer Mersinger, departed the agency to become the CEO of the crypto advocacy group Blockchain Association in June.

That pause triggered a coordinated effort led by senior figures in Washington to pressure foreign leaders into signing off on arrangements quickly, even if the final details were left for later. By May, Stephen Miran, a senior economic adviser, traveled to France and Germany to warn officials that if they did not engage in serious talks with the U.S., their countries would face steep tariffs. In June, he repeated the message to the European Commission in Brussels. The campaign, which has since produced a tariff truce with China and agreements with the EU, Japan, and South Korea, also saw the imposition of the highest overall U.S. tariffs since the Great Depression, with higher rates on nearly 100 countries taking effect on Thursday. White House pursued fast-track agreements over lengthy trade deals While Miran was delivering his threats in Europe, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer ran private negotiations. Their focus was securing promises of major investment in the U.S. and tariffs aligned with Trump’s policy preferences. White House spokesman Kush Desai described the team as “delivering one historic trade deal after another” for American industries. Trump’s approach with allies and rivals has been to push for broad, accelerated agreements instead of lengthy, legally binding trade deals. Greer explained after talks with Chinese officials in Stockholm that “this is not like a free-trade agreement” with arbitration processes, but rather an emergency measure under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which Trump can change as needed. Some of the announced deals still lack key details. In Southeast Asia, the administration has warned countries they will face doubled tariffs or more if their exports contain excessive Chinese content. No threshold has been disclosed for what level of Chinese components would trigger the penalty. A senior official said the administration knows “what that rule of origin is going to be” but has not implemented it. Retailers and governments in the Philippines, Vietnam, and Malaysia have not been briefed on the specifics. Elsewhere, agreements are still in progress. The U.S. and U.K. have not finalized terms for U.K. steel exports under their May pact. U.S. and Japanese negotiators met this week to determine how automotive tariffs will be handled, while Tokyo’s promised $550 billion in infrastructure funding remains subject to Trump’s discretion. Personal pressure on European leaders before key announcements The administration faces an August 12 deadline, when tariffs on China will rise to as high as 85% if Trump does not extend the current truce. In late July, ahead of a deal with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Scotland, Lutnick personally called French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and other EU leaders. Officials said he feared von der Leyen could not commit without their backing. Macron resisted a broader agreement, but Lutnick warned that if France wanted Sanofi, its pharmaceutical giant, to stay in the country, it should not push back. At the time, Trump was threatening more than 200% tariffs on non-U.S. pharmaceutical firms, a move that could have prompted Sanofi to relocate. The final agreement imposed a 15% tariff on European pharmaceutical products, left U.S. goods tariff-free, and secured an EU commitment to buy $750 billion in American energy exports through 2028. Just before Trump signed an order on July 31 setting a 39% tariff on Switzerland, Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter called him to argue over the $38 billion U.S. trade deficit with her country. Trump later said she “didn’t want to listen” to his concerns. An aide to Greer told Keller-Sutter to present a strong plan to reduce the deficit. Keller-Sutter flew to Washington but was unable to meet Bessent, Lutnick, or Greer. She instead met with Secretary of State Marco Rubio. A Swiss official said their proposal would cut the trade gap but declined to give details. No agreement has been reached. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

49827076,https://timestabloid.com/?p=77701,1754782222,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Set To Explode. Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-set-to-explode-heres-why/,"XRP could be positioned for another upward movement after its Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio produced a bullish indicator for the third time since November 2024. The development, highlighted by market analyst Ali Martinez, comes as XRP attempts to reclaim its yearly high of $3.66 in the wake of renewed momentum following the conclusion of the SEC vs. Ripple case. Understanding the MVRV Golden Cross The MVRV ratio compares an asset’s total market value with the average cost basis of all tokens in circulation. Analysts use it to assess whether a cryptocurrency is trading above or below its aggregate acquisition price, helping to gauge potential overvaluation or undervaluation. A golden cross in this context occurs when the short-term MVRV surpasses the long-term MVRV, often appearing during rapid price movements. Such a shift can indicate strengthening market sentiment and the potential for further gains. Historical Patterns Since November 2024 Martinez’s data shows that this signal has preceded notable price increases for XRP in recent history. The first occurrence appeared in early November 2024, shortly after the U.S. presidential election. In the weeks following, XRP rose sharply, moving past key resistance levels at $2 and $3. That rally ultimately delivered a gain of approximately 630% from the point of the cross. The second golden cross materialized in early July 2025, following months of sideways trading between February and June. This time, the price appreciation was more moderate, with XRP climbing about 54% before reaching $3.66 by mid-July. Current Market Position and Potential Scenarios The latest golden cross emerged earlier this month, during XRP’s recovery from a decline below $3. As of report time, XRP is valued at $3.32 . If price action mirrors the November 2024 rally, a similar 630% gain would place XRP near $24, a level also suggested earlier this year by trader Davinci Jeremie as a possible target for the current market cycle. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Following the July 2025 pattern would imply a smaller but still significant increase of 54%, which would bring XRP to approximately $5. This aligns with commentary from YouTuber DustyBC, who has argued that any price under $5 should be considered undervalued for XRP. A third scenario considers the average of the previous two rallies, amounting to a 342% increase. Under this projection, XRP could rise to around $14.40 over the coming months if similar conditions develop. While the degree of price movement will depend on broader market sentiment and external catalysts, historical performance suggests that the MVRV golden cross has been a consistently bullish signal for XRP over the past year. Traders and investors will now be watching closely to see if the latest signal delivers another substantial rally.

With total market capitalization surging and on-chain activity heating up, investor sentiment is turning bullish once again. Amid this upswing, smart money is eyeing a new wave of altcoins with long-term growth potential – XRP, Cardano, and one emerging name gaining traction fast: МAGACOIN FINANCE. The renewed momentum follows the passage of the GENIUS Act in the U.S., marking the first comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins. Paired with a more cooperative stance from the SEC and record-breaking inflows into Ethereum ETFs, the market is entering what many see as a more mature, sustainable growth cycle. As institutional adoption deepens and traditional finance merges with crypto infrastructure, top altcoins are primed to benefit. XRP XRP is once again drawing attention as clarity around its legal status gives the token room to breathe. With Ripple’s ongoing expansion into cross-border settlements and partnerships with central banks, the coin is reclaiming its spot among high-utility assets. Analysts are watching closely for a potential retest of $3.2, especially if market conditions hold and demand for real-world tokenization continues to grow. MAGACOIN FINANCE MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly becoming one of the most discussed altcoins of 2025. Following a strong presale phase and increased community engagement, the project’s new round has launched after the previous stage filled in record time. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its aggressive roadmap and ecosystem utility that appeals to both retail and whale investors. With whispers of a potential 42x return, early adopters are scrambling to secure their positions before listings begin on major exchanges. Cardano Cardano continues to push forward with its smart contract infrastructure and real-world use cases, particularly in the education and identity sectors. While it’s seen slower price movement compared to some competitors, ADA’s long-term potential remains intact. The launch of new dApps, partnerships with academic institutions, and its commitment to sustainability keep it on the radar of long-term investors. A clean break above the $0.80 level could signal a fresh leg higher. Conclusion The broader crypto recovery looks to be more than just a temporary bounce. With new regulatory frameworks, rising ETF inflows, and surging DeFi and AI innovation, the foundation appears stronger than in past cycles. XRP and Cardano continue to impress with their expanding ecosystems, while MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a major opportunity amid this next phase of crypto adoption.

Bowman was one of two governors who disagreed with the Fed’s decision last month to keep short-term interest rates between 4.25% and 4.50%, the level they have held since December. While many Fed officials have been reluctant to push for rate cuts because of concerns that tariffs from the Trump administration could slow progress toward lowering inflation to the Fed’s 2% target, recent comments from several policymakers suggest growing support for cuts. Speaking to the Kansas Bankers Association as mentioned in a Reuters report , Bowman said acting at the last meeting would have been a way to guard against more damage to the labor market and a possible slowdown in economic growth. Her comments on Saturday placed even greater emphasis on labor market weakness than her earlier explanation following last month’s policy vote. According to a Cryptopolitan, Bowman had already signaled her openness to supporting a July rate cut if inflation remained low Unemployment rises as job growth slowed The Labor Department reported on Friday that the unemployment rate rose to 4.2%, which Bowman described as “close to rounding up to 4.3%.” The same report also revised past figures, showing job growth over the last three months slowed to an average of 35,000 per month. “This is well below the moderate pace seen earlier in the year, likely due to a significant softening in labor demand,” Bowman said. She added that her own forecast since last December has included three rate cuts for this year, and the latest jobs data strengthens that outlook. As highlighted by Cryptopolitan , Bowman and Waller’s earlier calls for policy easing had already shifted market expectations. The Fed has three policy meetings left in the year in September, October, and December. Economists generally view job gains of about 100,000 a month as enough to keep the labor market steady. That figure may be lower now due to reduced immigration since President Donald Trump began his second term in January. Bowman’s clear backing of rate cuts comes as Trump has repeatedly pressed the central bank to ease policy. The search for a replacement for Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whose term ends in May, is already underway. Among those being considered is Governor Christopher Waller, who, like Bowman, dissented from last month’s decision. Bowman said she began making the case for a July rate cut during the Fed’s June meeting. Trump, meanwhile, has claimed that the latest jobs figures were “rigged” and dismissed the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics shortly after the report was released. Policies expected to offset tariff impact Bowman has often said that large revisions to employment data make her careful about relying too much on a single report. However, on Saturday she noted that the most recent information on economic growth, jobs, and inflation points to higher risks to employment, one of the Fed’s two main goals. She also said that recent inflation numbers make her more confident that the administration’s tariffs will not cause lasting price increases. Without tariff-related goods price rises, underlying inflation is “much closer” to the Fed’s 2% target than the official June reading of 2.8%, which was based on the core personal consumption expenditures price index over 12 months. Bowman said Trump’s policies, including tax reductions and deregulation, are likely to balance out any economic slowdown or price increases caused by import tariffs. With housing demand possibly at its lowest point since the financial crisis and the labor market no longer adding upward pressure on inflation, she said the chances of prices rising too quickly have reduced.

On August 7, 2025 , both parties filed a joint dismissal of appeals in the U.S. Court of Appeals, finalizing the landmark decision that XRP is not a security in secondary market sales . Under the resolution, Ripple will pay a $125 million penalty for past institutional sales but avoids further federal litigation. This outcome solidifies regulatory clarity for XRP and opens the door to potential products like a spot XRP ETF , which analysts say has a 95% chance of approval before October. Following the news, XRP surged more than 12% , reaffirming investor optimism and signaling a broader shift toward altcoin risk appetite. But while XRP may lead the news cycle, many insiders are pointing elsewhere for the next major rally. MAGACOIN FINANCE Rise as Ripple Win Triggers Market Rally As the altcoin market regains strength, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now emerging as a standout. Analysts suggest that in the wake of Ripple’s legal victory, projects that combine community governance , cultural relevance , and narrative strength could see exponential growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE fits that profile perfectly. Described as a decentralized political memecoin , MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t just another speculative asset—it’s a movement powered by ideology, community, and anti-centralisation values. On-chain data shows rising wallet growth, increased whale accumulation, and rapidly growing transaction volumes. With the token still trading below $1, experts believe MAGACOIN FINANCE offers one of the last entry points before a potential major breakout. Forecasts suggest the project could deliver gains as high as 13,900% in the upcoming market cycle. In the eyes of many analysts, MAGACOIN FINANCE now stands as the best altcoin to buy heading into late 2025. Broader Market Signals Turn Bullish After Ripple Win The end of the Ripple case is already impacting broader market dynamics. Confidence is rising across altcoins with strong fundamentals and legal clarity. While XRP continues to rise, attention is shifting toward tokens with strong communities and narrative momentum . Alongside MAGACOIN, other utility-focused tokens are gaining investor interest. But few match MAGACOIN’s combination of memetic energy, ideological appeal, and grassroots support—all factors that analysts say can drive virality and long-term engagement. Outlook: Altseason Momentum Building Fast With Bitcoin holding above $117,000 and Ethereum nearing $3,900 , institutional sentiment is strengthening across the board. President Trump’s recent executive order enabling crypto inclusion in retirement plans has further bolstered market stability. But as analysts scan the landscape for the best altcoin to buy , MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to top their lists. If the current momentum holds, this meme-powered altcoin could be the breakout story of the post-Ripple market.

The FIRE movement (Financial Independence, Retire Early) has found a new ally in cryptocurrency, where explosive returns can significantly outperform traditional portfolios. While the risk is high, so is the potential reward—and that’s exactly what draws a new wave of early retirement seekers to this path. A balanced FIRE plan might typically focus on low-cost index funds, real estate, or dividend stocks. But crypto enthusiasts have flipped the script, betting on digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum to act as growth engines that outperform legacy systems. Within this evolving playbook, emerging altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE are attracting attention as high-upside additions to early-stage portfolios, especially for those looking to maximize gains before broader adoption. Crypto FIRE Strategy: How It Works Rather than relying on slow and steady compounding over decades, a crypto-centric FIRE strategy places calculated bets on faster-moving assets. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) typically form the foundation due to their long-term track records and institutional backing. But for meaningful upside, investors allocate to altcoins with high growth potential and strong communities behind them. Projects in sectors like DeFi, GameFi, and infrastructure tokens round out the strategy, aiming to catch early-stage growth before prices explode. Success depends not just on what you invest in, but how you invest—employing tactics like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) to reduce emotional decision-making and mitigate volatility. Periodic rebalancing is key, especially after sharp market movements. Selling partial gains from top performers and reinvesting in undervalued tokens can maintain healthy risk exposure while banking profits. For U.S. investors, self-directed crypto IRAs can also unlock long-term tax benefits that make early retirement even more achievable. Why This New Altcoin is Gaining Traction With Early Retirees For those chasing big returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being called one of the best altcoins to watch right now. Experts estimate it could deliver a 67x ROI in the upcoming market run, citing its rapidly expanding user base, early-stage growth potential, and structured presale phases that reward early participation. Unlike meme coins with no clear path forward, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building out a full ecosystem of utility, staking, and community-driven development. As momentum builds, comparisons are being made to the early days of breakout tokens like SHIBA INU—but with a clearer roadmap and increasing support from long-term crypto investors. With investor demand rising fast and current rounds selling out quicker each time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming a favorite for those looking to retire early with a bold, high-growth strategy. The Path to Early Retirement Early retirement through crypto isn’t guaranteed—but with the right portfolio, the right mindset, and a commitment to long-term strategies like DCA and rebalancing, it’s more possible than ever. For investors looking beyond the mainstream cryptocurrencies that have already established themselves, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE offer the kind of upside that could supercharge a portfolio and turn calculated risk into real wealth .

Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) has posted steady fundraising alongside rising attention for BTC Layer-2 projects, though it’s still early. Maxi Doge (MAXI) has caught eyes with its meme appeal, but its staying power remains uncertain. Then there’s BlockDAG (BDAG) , surging past $367 million in its presale, holding its price at $0.0016 with a countdown that’s drawing serious attention. With the GLOBAL LAUNCH Release set, the tone feels different. For those tracking crypto presales this year, these three offer a telling picture, but one appears to be sprinting toward something bigger. Bitcoin Hyper Update: Layer-2 Project Building Visibility Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) is seeing increased attention among BTC-related altcoins, with its presale approaching $7 million. Built as a Layer-2 network using the Solana Virtual Machine, the project’s goal is to bring programmability to Bitcoin without changing its core layer. Some analysts have noted the recent rise in presale participation, but long-term adoption is still unclear. The early traction seems driven more by speculative interest and influencer discussions than by proven use cases. The coming months will be the real test of Bitcoin Hyper’s ability to move from concept to sustained growth. Maxi Doge Price Prediction: Meme Appeal Faces Reality Check Maxi Doge (MAXI) has generated excitement in early presale stages, raising over $397K so far. Its branding mixes a fitness theme with Shiba Inu imagery, focusing more on entertainment than utility. Current forecasts remain speculative, with near-term targets suggesting a post-presale price of $0.0002745. Bullish estimates point to $0.001 by 2025, and a highly optimistic $0.02 by 2030. However, without confirmed exchange listings or strong technical foundations, the coin’s future hinges heavily on its ability to keep viral interest alive beyond its launch window. BlockDAG’s GLOBAL LAUNCH Release Approaches: Final Window at $0.0016 Time is running out for BlockDAG’s presale, with the GLOBAL LAUNCH Release locked for August 11. While this isn’t the official listing date, it is a turning point for the project. Buyers still have access to the frozen $0.0016 price, but that window is closing fast. Once the countdown ends, the price will shift to the Batch 29 level of $0.0276, and if that batch sells out early, it could climb again before hitting the $0.05 listing price. From the current entry point to launch, the potential return stands at 3,025%, with gains of 2,660% already locked from Batch 1 to Batch 29. These figures are rare in late-stage presales, adding urgency to the final days. BlockDAG has already raised over $367 million, sold 24.8 billion coins, and more than 19,000 crypto miners, making it the largest presale in the current crypto market. Analysts remain confident in its trajectory, forecasting a path to $1 soon after launch, with longer-term targets of $5 and even $10. For anyone tracking crypto presales in 2025, this is the last major low entry point before prices shift permanently. The GLOBAL LAUNCH Release is not just another milestone; it is the trigger event that will redefine BDAG’s market position and set the stage for its next phase of growth. Which Projects Will Hold Their Ground? Bitcoin Hyper, Maxi Doge, and BlockDAG have each found an audience. Yet, not all are equally positioned for lasting relevance. Bitcoin Hyper benefits from the BTC narrative, but its real adoption remains a question mark. Maxi Doge may attract quick attention, though meme appeal without depth often fades fast. BlockDAG’s track record stands apart. With $367 million raised, 24.8 billion coins sold, and a GLOBAL LAUNCH Release ending the $0.0016 price lock on August 11, it offers the largest upside window in the 2025 presale space. In a market where excitement often outpaces results, BlockDAG’s momentum is supported by both scale and measurable progress.

The Tron(TRX) price forecast leans slightly positive as large wallets collect over 1.3 billion tokens, but a move past $0.34 needs more support. The XRP price drop has drawn more concern. A sharp selloff cleared $358 million in leveraged trades, pushing XRP below $2.92 and revealing fragile positions in the process. These two assets show a sense of uncertainty. Cold Wallet (CWT) , however, is showing different momentum. Its presale has already raised $5.8 million, with more than 691 million tokens sold. From its Stage 1 price to today’s $0.00998, the price has climbed 34.5%. With a confirmed launch price of $0.3517, that points to a return of 3,633%. Many are no longer waiting on the sidelines. Tron(TRX) Price Forecast: Will Momentum Break the Barrier? Tron (TRX) is trading close to $0.33, showing some stability even as the market trends lower. The recent buildup of over 1.3 billion TRX in whale wallets has sparked new attention toward the Tron(TRX) price forecast, adding a layer of interest among analysts. If TRX can push past the $0.34 barrier, it might open a path toward $0.40 and perhaps even $0.48. Still, not everything supports that climb. The Money Flow Index is trailing the price move, hinting that overall market liquidity is still lacking. For the Tron(TRX) price forecast to stay strong, bulls need to hold the $0.32 level and close the week with momentum. Sudden XRP Price Drop Follows Large-Scale Liquidations XRP has seen more downward action this week. A wave of leveraged liquidations caused a quick 3% fall, marking the beginning of a sharp XRP price drop. XRP briefly dipped to $2.80, made a short recovery, then fell again by 4% on Tuesday, staying below $2.92. The selloff was triggered by a long-short imbalance of 7,676%, which resulted in $358 million in liquidations. The XRP price drop broke through key support levels, and even though the price bounced off its 50-day EMA, tools like RSI and MACD still show weak buying pressure. Traders are staying cautious, watching for clearer signals. Cold Wallet Presale Demand Surges as ROI Gap Shrinks Cold Wallet’s presale is drawing rare attention in crypto, where the gains are both clear and trackable. Starting at $0.007 in Stage 1 and now at $0.00998 in Stage 17, the token has climbed 34.5% in just days. But with the launch price fixed at $0.3517, a 3,633% return is still possible. Momentum is only picking up. Over $5.8 million has been raised, and 691 million tokens have been bought already. Each stage brings more participants, cutting the upside with each new entry. Traders are responding quickly to the project’s value-driven design. Cold Wallet goes beyond storage. It builds returns from usage. Swaps, bridges, and even gas fees feed back into the system, rewarding users in CWT, the token at its core. The idea of recovering value from everyday transactions is striking a chord. With presale stages closing fast and the ROI margin shrinking, the longer someone waits, the less room remains to catch the full upside. Which Is the Top Trending Crypto Today? Tension is building in the market right now. The Tron(TRX) price forecast holds near $0.33, boosted by 1.3 billion TRX scooped up by whale wallets, but follow-through is uncertain. Bulls need a strong finish to the week to keep the move alive. Meanwhile, a steep XRP price drop followed a 3% decline driven by $358 million in forced liquidations. XRP now trades under $2.92, and weak buy signals suggest traders remain cautious for good reason. In the middle of this caution, Cold Wallet is standing out as a top trending crypto . It has raised $5.8 million, sold 691 million tokens, and locked in a 34.5% presale price jump. The remaining 3,633% ROI isn’t just a number, it’s one of the last setups with visible upside that’s fading by the day.

Elon Musk’s Net Worth as the Benchmark As of August 1, 2025, Forbes places Elon Musk’s net worth at approximately $401.2 billion, reaffirming his position as the world’s richest individual. This figure serves as the reference point for calculating how much XRP one would require to exceed Elon Musk’s fortune at a $10,000 valuation per coin. XRP Supply and the Market Capitalization Implications XRP’s current circulating supply is roughly 59.3 billion tokens, with a maximum total supply of 100 billion. At a hypothetical price of $10,000 per token, the circulating market capitalization would surge to around $593 trillion. THE #XRP SURGE IS HERE! pic.twitter.com/TUW6f9PDdR — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) August 9, 2025 On a fully diluted basis, the figure would approach $1 quadrillion. For perspective, these amounts are many times larger than the total global GDP, underscoring the sheer economic improbability of such valuations. Breaking Down the Calculation Dividing Musk’s estimated $401.2 billion net worth by $10,000 per XRP results in approximately 40.12 million XRP needed to surpass his wealth. Levi’s cited figure of 50 million XRP, while slightly higher, offers a rounded and rhetorically impactful estimate suitable for social media discussion. Practical and Liquidity Constraints Even setting aside the implausible market capitalization, acquiring tens of millions of XRP at or near a $10,000 valuation would be virtually impossible in practice. The act of purchasing such a vast quantity would cause extreme market slippage, diminish liquidity, and deter market makers from participating. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 In addition, Ripple’s programmed escrow releases regularly inject more XRP into circulation, making the token’s available supply dynamic and unpredictable. These realities further diminish the feasibility of the scenario Levi describes. Final Assessment Levi’s statement—“You would need a 50 million XRP to be wealthier than Elon Musk if XRP hits $10,000 per coin”—is an engaging thought experiment and a testament to the aspirational spirit within segments of the crypto community. However, when assessed through the lens of updated net worth figures, current XRP supply data, and macroeconomic constraints, it becomes clear that the premise is far removed from practical financial reality. While the discussion fuels the imagination of XRP enthusiasts, it ultimately serves as a reminder that sound investment decisions should be grounded in verifiable facts and realistic market conditions.

49829348,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=782085,1754784814,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/49829348.jpeg,Elon Musk’s Tesla seeks to enter UK energy market,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/tesla-uk-energy-market/,"Elon Musk’s Tesla plans to enter the UK household energy market soon, challenging major providers like Octopus Energy and British Gas. Official documents show that on July 25, Tesla submitted an application to the UK energy regulator, Ofgem. According to Telegraph , the company requested permission to supply electricity to domestic customers. The filing, signed by Andrew Payne signals a notable step forward in the company’s expansion plans. If approved, “Tesla Electric” could begin serving customers as soon as next year. The new service is expected to work hand in hand with Tesla’s existing products, such as its electric vehicles and Powerwall battery units, with the goal of cutting household power expenses. Tesla already operates a comparable program in Texas, where customers can benefit from cheaper charging rates for their cars and earn payments for sending unused solar-generated or battery-stored electricity back to the grid. Reports from 2023 indicated Tesla’s intent to enter the home energy market, alongside recruitment campaigns for policy and operational roles. With tens of thousands of Powerwall batteries already installed in Britain, devices that can store energy from solar panels or off-peak charging, Tesla holds an infrastructure advantage. Moreover, Tesla offers residential EV charging equipment and has over 250,000 cars on UK roads. This network could be key to rolling out “vehicle-to-home” systems, where a car’s battery can supply power to the household. Several other providers are trialling this type of technology, which Tesla could incorporate. Tesla is also active in wholesale energy trading, using large-scale battery facilities and its Autobidder platform to buy and sell stored power. The company has held an Ofgem generation licence since 2020. Even so, the brand faces headwinds. UK sales of Tesla’s electric cars have dropped sharply, with July showing a 60% year-on-year decline, a trend echoed in other European markets, such as Germany, where deliveries fell over 55% . The slump reflects stiffer EV market competition and controversies linked to Musk, including his public support for political figures like Donald Trump and Tommy Robinson. Tesla is facing persistent sales slump in Europe Analysts note that even Musk’s recent efforts to distance himself from politics have not reversed the European sales downturn, with Tesla registering five consecutive months of falling deliveries across the continent. In the US, the company offers a fixed-rate plan for unlimited vehicle charging during certain time windows. Powerwall owners can also link their units to the grid, allowing Tesla to tap into stored energy at peak times in exchange for payments. This setup, known as a “virtual power plant,” combines small-scale energy sources to help stabilise renewable supply. Although the company hasn’t yet outlined pricing or specific plans for the UK, job postings point to virtual power plant integration as a key feature. The system would capture excess wind and solar power when available, then release it back to the grid during demand surges. Tesla previously joined forces with Octopus Energy in 2020 for a combined energy tariff but ended that collaboration three years later to operate independently. It still works with Octopus so Powerwall owners can use the latter’s software to sell stored power at premium times. Approval for an Ofgem electricity supply licence can take up to nine months, though in some cases the process is quicker.

While the crypto market remains unpredictable, those who identified breakout projects early in the past cycles saw life-changing returns. With the rise of institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and emerging sectors like AI and modular blockchains, the stage is set for a new generation of crypto leaders. While many will come and go, a handful of projects show the right mix of utility, innovation, and momentum to deliver massive potential by the end of the decade. Among these rising stars, MAGACOIN FINANCE has also drawn attention as a bold newcomer, with market watchers comparing its trajectory to some of the most explosive altcoins in history. Lets have a look at five cryptocurrencies that experts say could surge more than 20x by 2030, based on current momentum and forward-looking potential. 1. XRP XRP continues to be one of the most polarizing but promising cryptocurrencies on the market. Its main value proposition – enabling fast, low-cost cross-border payments – remains a major use case in the evolving financial system. What Could Drive Growth by 2030: Regulatory Win: The long-awaited conclusion of Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC could unleash new institutional capital flows into XRP. ODL Expansion: Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) services could become essential for global finance, positioning XRP as a bridge asset between major fiat currencies. Tokenized Finance Boom: As tokenized assets gain ground, XRP’s speed and low fees may make it a top pick for RWA transfers. Some conservative models place XRP in the $5–$10 range by 2030, but a scenario involving full institutional adoption and widespread utility could push it far beyond those levels. 2. Cardano Built on peer-reviewed research and a strong academic foundation, Cardano has steadily grown into one of the most respected Layer 1 platforms. Key Factors for Long-Term Potential: Hydra Scaling : Hydra, Cardano’s Layer 2 solution, aims to drastically improve throughput – essential for large-scale dApp deployment. Use Cases in Developing Nations: Cardano’s partnerships in Africa and other emerging markets could lead to real-world adoption across education, identity, and finance. DeFi and Governance Expansion: A robust ecosystem of DeFi projects and a community-driven governance model position ADA for steady long-term value growth. If Cardano captures just a fraction of global enterprise and government applications, ADA’s price could surge well past its previous highs – and potentially achieve the 20x target. 3. Celestia Celestia is pioneering a new way to build blockchains through its modular architecture, and it’s already become a favorite among developers looking to launch rollup-based systems. Why It’s a Game-Changer: Modular Design: Separating consensus from execution allows developers to build faster, cheaper, and more flexible chains. Rollup Ecosystem: As Ethereum and other blockchains move toward rollup-centric models, Celestia could become a foundational layer for data availability. Early Mover Advantage: Being one of the first major players in the modular blockchain space gives Celestia a potential lead similar to Ethereum’s early dominance. With the entire industry leaning toward modular scaling, TIA could be one of the few infrastructure tokens to achieve a 20x+ return, especially if it becomes the default data layer for rollups and app chains. 4. MAGACOIN FINANCE MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly establishing itself as one of the most promising altcoins for forward-looking investors. With growing hype and multiple sell-out rounds, it’s drawing comparisons to early-stage breakout stars like SHIBA INU and DOGECOIN – but with a far more structured ecosystem behind it. Unlike typical meme coins, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building long-term utility and tokenomics aimed at rewarding early holders. Analysts now project up to a 12,700% return for early MAGACOIN investors as the next bull cycle picks up momentum. The project’s strong presale performance, continuous development, and viral growth on social media suggest it’s far from a short-term trend. If MAGACOIN hits centralized exchanges at the right time and continues building its ecosystem, it could outpace traditional large caps like XRP and SOL – giving early participants a rare opportunity to get in before the wider crypto market catches on. 5. Virtuals Protocol As artificial intelligence continues to dominate tech headlines, Virtuals Protocol is emerging as a key intersection point between AI and blockchain. What Makes It Stand Out: AI Agent Platform: Virtuals allows developers to build and monetize AI agents on-chain – one of the most exciting new frontiers in crypto. Ethereum Layer-2 : Built on Base, it benefits from Ethereum’s security while offering cheaper, faster transactions. Rapid Ecosystem Expansion : If it can become the leading AI agent platform in crypto, VRS could ride both the AI and Web3 waves simultaneously. While still early-stage, the protocol’s vision and positioning have drawn attention from developers and early investors alike. If AI becomes as integral to crypto as many predict, Virtuals Protocol could easily become a 20x winner by the end of the decade. Conclusion The path to 2030 will be filled with volatility, but also opportunity. From legacy projects like XRP and Cardano to newer infrastructure plays like Celestia and Virtuals Protocol, the crypto space is rich with long-term potential. And for those seeking early exposure to a rapidly growing ecosystem, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out with its ambitious vision and projected 1 2,700% upside , making it a serious contender in the race to define the next generation of altcoins.

With millions of Americans contributing to this plan every two weeks, even a small allocation to Bitcoin could create a steady, long-term inflow of capital far exceeding the impact of spot Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). Related Reading: Crypto Is Here To Stay—Even The SEC Can’t Do Anything About It, Analyst Says Bitcoin To Break Into 401(k) Retirement Market Bitcoin’s possible entry into the US $12 trillion 401(k) investment options could represent one of the largest structural inflows in the asset’s history. Tom Dunleavy, the Head of Venture at Varys Capital and a former senior analyst at Messari, declared in an X social media post on August 7 that cryptocurrencies in the 401(k) retirement plan are much bigger and more bullish news than the ETFs. Dunleavy explained that the US currently has around 100 million Americans participating in the 401(k) plan, where a fixed portion of each paycheck is automatically invested into preselected portfolios of stock and bonds. These allocations are typically reviewed annually at most, creating a steady and predictable stream of capital into financial markets. Additionally, over the past two decades, this 401(k) plan has been a critical driver behind the resilience and long-term upward trajectory of US equities. According to Dunleavy, the total value of assets in the 401(k) plans stands at approximately $12 trillion, with around $50 billion in fresh contributions added every two weeks. The analyst suggested that even a small portfolio allocation to Bitcoin would represent significant and recurring inflows. He estimated that a 1% allocation translates to roughly $120 billion in continuous buying, 3% would equate to $360 billion, and 5% would reach a whopping $600 billion. Unlike one-time purchases, Dunleavy notes that these allocations could continue indefinitely once set, creating a persistent demand floor for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. He also compared the 401(k) plan to ETFs, claiming that cryptocurrencies within the investment pool could have a greater long-term impact than the launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Regulatory Backdrop And BTC’s Path To Adoption Dunleavy has indicated that the possible integration of Bitcoin into the 401(k) investment menus is closely tied to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). He noted that ERISA establishes fiduciary standards designed to protect participants’ interests and ensure they receive promised benefits. Under this framework, most fiduciary risk is borne by consultants, who advise plan sponsors on asset allocation and investment options. Related Reading: Ripple-SEC Legal Drama Ends; XRP Skyrockets 13% For over a decade, these consultants have been researching the cryptocurrency market, building the knowledge base and compliance structures necessary to justify a modest crypto allocation—typically ranging between 1% and 5% for pensions and potentially 401(k) participants. Until recently, structural and regulatory constraints meant crypto could not be directly offered as an investment choice. With those barriers potentially shifting, consultants now have both the regulatory cover and the research credibility to recommend adding Bitcoin to retirement plans.

While Betway, bet365, and Ladbrokes focus on revamping interfaces and expanding their bonuses, they still miss the mark on what matters most: fast access, open terms, and borderless features. Betway has improved cash-out tools, bet365 offers football bonuses, and Ladbrokes is upgrading its look, but all three platforms still operate within traditional boundaries that frustrate today’s global user base. In contrast, Spartans is reshaping how players engage with betting sites. With 5,963 games, fast crypto withdrawals, and clearly defined 35x wagering rules, it skips the noise and delivers results. There’s no need to install apps, no locked regions, and no fine print during withdrawals. While older brands like Betway, bet365, and Ladbrokes count on brand familiarity, Spartans makes performance the main attraction. This direct approach is what positions Spartans as a strong force in the race for the top gambling sites in 2025. Betway Has In-Play Strength but Slows Down on Early Payouts Betway has maintained its place in the UK’s betting sector thanks to consistent sponsorships and quality in-play tools. Its live cash-out feature is reliable and particularly useful for real-time football wagering. Bettors who enjoy tweaking their wagers during a live match will appreciate the control Betway provides. Yet, when it comes to early payout options, Betway falls behind its competitors. Its once-popular “You Lead, You Win” campaign across football and golf is currently unavailable, and there’s no word on when or if it will return. Betway typically revives these features seasonally, but for now, users will need to wait. The platform still offers competitive odds and a user-friendly mobile setup. However, its promotional offers don’t keep pace with crypto-first sites, and its slow banking withdrawals are outdated. In contrast to top gambling sites in 2025 like Spartans, which prioritize fast and borderless payouts, Betway hasn’t evolved fast enough to retain speed-focused users. bet365’s Features Are Solid, but Withdrawal Speed Lags bet365 continues to dominate with its betting variety, early payout promotions, and high-quality livestreams. Its “Two Goals Ahead” feature is especially appealing; if your football team leads by two goals, your bet gets settled as a win instantly. This early cash-out tool is one of the best, and it adds real value to football wagers. The site also boasts partial and full cash-out features, hundreds of football markets, and match streams weekly. It’s a platform made for scale and is reliable in its offerings. Yet, it misses out in areas where newer platforms excel. bet365 still leans on conventional withdrawal systems, which means users wait days to receive their winnings. The lack of crypto options and promotional limitations based on location frustrate modern players. When compared to top gambling sites in 2025 like Spartans, bet365’s strength in features is undermined by slower, outdated payout mechanisms. Ladbrokes Keeps the Basics but Fails to Advance As one of the oldest names in the UK betting scene, Ladbrokes continues to offer standard betting features such as football odds, live betting, and accumulator boosts. Its app interface is smooth and easy for both new and returning users. Yet, when judged against other platforms in 2025, Ladbrokes is missing key upgrades. It doesn’t offer early payout options, and there’s no sign that this will change. While welcome offers and occasional price boosts exist, they fail to stand out amid more competitive promotions elsewhere. Ladbrokes also sticks with bank transfers and debit cards, which are slower and less appealing compared to instant crypto options. Top gambling sites in 2025, like Spartans, are leaving platforms like Ladbrokes behind by making crypto payouts standard and eliminating delays. Spartans Builds Its Edge on Speed, Access, and Clarity Spartans has gained a top spot among the top gambling sites in 2025 by cutting out all the delays and delivering what players truly want. The site features 5,963+ games, a full sportsbook, live odds, and an upfront 35x wagering policy valid for 7 days. It removes all regional blocks, ensures no unclear bonus terms, and runs smoothly without any app installation. Its instant crypto withdrawal support, covering BTC, ETH, ADA, BNB, DAI, USDC, and USDT, is a major shift from standard banking delays. This feature alone pulls in users who value time and privacy. Spartans even adds unique promotions like its Lamborghini giveaway, boosting player excitement without relying on flashy tricks. Designed for mobile and desktop without compromising on speed or features, Spartans caters to modern betting expectations. While Betway, bet365, and Ladbrokes work on catching up, Spartans already delivers. No fluff, no clutter, just direct service. Among the top gambling sites in 2025, Spartans is shaping up as the go-to for crypto-friendly, clarity-driven play. Final Takeaway While Betway scores with live options, bet365 brings strong early payouts, and Ladbrokes holds legacy value, none of them provide the full package like Spartans. From 5,963 games to instant crypto withdrawals and honest bonus terms, Spartans addresses exactly what today’s bettors expect. In a year where speed, fairness, and global flexibility matter most, Spartans is setting the bar. For those seeking function over flash and instant access over drawn-out procedures, Spartans easily ranks among the top gambling sites in 2025 .

Instead of focusing only on trading volume or dominance, many are analyzing real value delivery and consistent returns. While Cardano keeps its positive trend and Polkadot shows technical strength, a different project is moving ahead quickly. Cold Wallet , now available on CoinMarketCap, brings cashback features and potential 4,900% returns for presale users, features that established coins currently lack. The question now is about value, not just reputation. Cold Wallet positions itself as the best crypto right now by offering actual benefits at a price below $0.01, showing a clear edge over slower-moving competitors. Cardano Maintains Positive Momentum Despite Recent Decline Cardano remains one of the key assets to watch in 2025. Despite a 5% price dip recently, ADA continues to hold steady above major support lines. Analysts note that the Cardano bullish trend still holds firm, supported by its growing fundamentals. Its DeFi sector shows consistent TVL growth, and updated staking data confirms ongoing user engagement. Though current market sentiment brings short-term selling, the broader trend remains encouraging. ADA price expectations range between $1.10 and $1.30, based on market stability and ongoing ecosystem development. This points to a 3x return potential from current price levels. Yet, interest is clearly rising in newer entries offering quicker returns. When placed next to Cold Wallet’s early-stage pricing and cashback benefits, ADA appears more conservative. For those targeting faster gains, Cardano may no longer qualify as the best crypto right now. Polkadot Charts Indicate Moderate Upside Toward $8 Polkadot’s current price is just over $4, showing resilience after recent turbulence. Latest Polkadot technical analysis places DOT at a key support range, with MACD and RSI indicators showing stable-to-positive trends. If it maintains this zone, analysts anticipate a possible move toward $6.50–$8 soon, suggesting a possible 2x return. Its network development continues at a steady pace, especially in cross-chain functions and parachain operations through XCM. Still, price growth remains modest, with rising competition from newer layer-1 networks limiting attention. Despite strong infrastructure and community, significant upward movement hinges on increased market activity. This steady pace is pushing some retail users to look elsewhere. Many are favoring options with immediate user benefits and strong growth outlooks. Cold Wallet’s cashback utility and its 50x projection now make it one of the top choices for those focusing on usability and fast gains. Cold Wallet: Transforming User Experience in Crypto Most crypto systems today create friction, charging users just to access their funds or interact on-chain. Cold Wallet is removing that barrier. Now listed on CoinMarketCap and priced at only $0.00998, it rewards user activity instead of penalizing it. Whether users transfer assets, pay gas or swap, they receive CWT rewards in return. The idea is simple: make self-custody not just secure, but also rewarding. Cold Wallet’s model offers up to 100% cashback in CWT along with a presale structure that favors early adopters. This makes each action on the network feel beneficial, not like a cost. Its framework is designed to expand: featuring 150 presale stages, currently in Stage 17, with an entry price still under $0.01 and a listing price projected at $0.3517. That means a 4,900% return is still within reach. With over 694 million coins already sold and presale funding now exceeding $5.8 million, momentum is undeniable. In contrast to the cautious tone of Polkadot technical analysis or the slow climb seen in the Cardano bullish trend, Cold Wallet is building pace rapidly. That’s why it’s increasingly seen as the best crypto right now for those prioritizing strong functionality and high upside. Final Takeaway Cardano maintains solid positioning, defending its support range and showing a potential 3x growth path. Polkadot also shows strength, with technical signs pointing to a climb toward $8. While both continue delivering, their growth is slow and steady. Cold Wallet introduces a different pace entirely. With a cashback model, simple self-custody, and verified listing on CoinMarketCap, it’s offering what others don’t. The possibility of a 50x ROI from current pricing, alongside a live presale still below $0.01, makes it a standout. For anyone seeking the best crypto right now that offers utility, growth, and momentum, Cold Wallet is setting the pace.

49830731,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=173999,1754787655,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/49830731.jpeg,Utility + Scalability = 7 Explosive Long-Term Crypto Picks,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/utility-scalability-7-explosive-long-term-crypto-picks/,"As the crypto market matures, investors are moving past hype and focusing on projects with real-world value. Tokens that offer long-term utility — whether through fast, scalable infrastructure or game-changing applications — are catching the attention of smart money and institutional players. Below are seven standout picks that analysts believe will dominate the next cycle, not just because of the narrative, but because of function. From household names to quietly rising stars, these tokens are poised for growth through real-world usage and technical strength. 1. Ethereum (ETH) – The King of Smart Contracts Ethereum continues to be the foundation of decentralized applications. With the success of Ethereum 2.0’s transition to Proof-of-Stake and a thriving Layer-2 ecosystem, ETH remains the top long-term utility asset for developers and institutions alike. 2. Solana (SOL) – Blazing-Fast & Growing Stronger Solana has shaken off its past outages and proven itself as a high-performance blockchain with incredibly low fees. With its adoption in real-world applications (like Visa payments), SOL is becoming the go-to chain for speed and scale. 3. Chainlink (LINK) – Data Feeds Powering DeFi Without Chainlink’s oracle network, DeFi would collapse. LINK’s real-world integrations with banks and legacy systems make it a top utility coin for 2025–2030. Its role is foundational for blockchain to connect with external data securely. 4. Polygon (MATIC) – Layer-2 With Mass Adoption Goals Polygon’s partnerships with companies like Starbucks, Reddit, and Nike prove it’s ready for mainstream use. As a Layer-2 on Ethereum, MATIC enables faster, cheaper transactions while keeping security high. 5. MAGACOIN FINANCE – Expert Forecasts Signal 65x Return Potential Analysts are increasingly watching MAGACOIN FINANCE — a rising altcoin currently in its presale phase. What makes it stand out isn’t just its meme-like energy, but its focus on building a utility-backed ecosystem from day one. Unlike most early-stage tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE has laid out a roadmap centered on long-term usability: staking, governance, and real-world integration. Whale tracking platforms have even flagged high-volume MAGACOIN wallet activity in the past 14 days — a strong early signal that smart money is positioning early. With experts projecting up to 65x ROI for early investors, MAGACOIN FINANCE is shaping up to be a breakout utility coin, not just another meme. 6. Avalanche (AVAX) – Enterprise + DeFi Hybrid Avalanche offers near-instant transaction finality and customizable subnets, making it a favorite for enterprises and DeFi builders alike. Its unique consensus mechanism positions it as one of the most scalable platforms available. 7. Cosmos (ATOM) – Interoperability Pioneer Cosmos is quietly enabling a more connected blockchain world. With its Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, ATOM is helping diverse blockchains work together — a feature that could be critical in the next crypto cycle. Conclusion: Betting on Utility Is the Smart Play This isn’t 2021 anymore — investors are no longer chasing hype alone. As we approach Q4 2025, more crypto holders are looking at utility, scalability, and real-world application as long-term indicators of success. From dominant players like Ethereum and Solana to emerging forces like MAGACOIN FINANCE, these 7 projects offer more than just price action — they offer relevance, adoption, and real value. If the bull market momentum holds, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be this cycle’s surprise success story. With expert forecasts predicting a potential 65x surge, it’s one for every long-term watchlist.

While DOGE continues to face unpredictable swings driven largely by hype and market sentiment, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a fundamentally strong project with real utility and steadily growing investor interest. Currently in Phase 6 of its presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised over $14.25 million, attracting more than 15,000 holders worldwide. Only 15% of its tokens have been sold so far at the attractive price of $0.035, making this an ideal moment to consider MUTM as a more stable and promising DeFi opportunity compared to DOGE’s rollercoaster ride. Dogecoin (DOGE) Tanks 16.7% to $0.20 Dogecoin (DOGE) plummeted 16.7% to ~$0.20, down from $0.24, as part of a broader crypto market sell-off, with $758 million in liquidations, including $23.16 million in DOGE positions, per Coinspeaker data. The drop, reported on August 1, 2025, follows a stronger U.S. dollar and unchanged Fed rates (4.25%-4.5%), prompting traders to exit risky assets. DOGE fell below its 200-day SMA ($0.212), with trading volume spiking to $2.48 billion, per CryptoRank. Technical indicators show a bearish MACD and RSI at 38, with support at $0.194 and resistance at $0.212. Despite whale accumulation of 310 million DOGE ($62M), macro pressures like U.S.-China trade tensions and a weak jobs report fuel bearish sentiment. A rebound above $0.212 could target $0.25, but a break below $0.194 risks $0.18. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s Beta Launch to Transform Speculation Into Utility What sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart from typical meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) is its imminent beta platform launch, expected to coincide with the token’s listing on exchanges. This event will convert MUTM from a speculative asset into a fully functional DeFi ecosystem, enabling users to directly experience the platform’s lending, borrowing, and staking features. Unlike DOGE, which primarily thrives on community hype and limited real-world use cases, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers tangible financial tools that generate ongoing demand for its token. The beta launch will allow users to stake mtTokens in the designated smart contracts to earn MUTM rewards, engage in Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending by depositing assets like BTC, ETH, and earning stable APYs, and explore Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending arrangements with flexible terms with highly volatile assets used as collateral. This shift toward utility-based growth means that as more people interact with the platform, demand for MUTM tokens will grow sustainably, supporting strong price momentum well beyond speculative cycles. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s two-tier lending system offers an appealing contrast to DOGE’s one-dimensional token model. For example, in the P2C lending model, users can borrow USDT stablecoins by pledging ETH as collateral with a conservative 60% loan-to-value ratio, providing lower risk and steady interest returns. On the other hand, the P2P model caters to borrowers and lenders willing to negotiate terms using altcoins like PEPE, SHIB or TRUMP, capturing higher yields and offering greater flexibility. This versatility enables MUTM to appeal to a broad spectrum of DeFi participants, increasing its growth potential beyond the reach of meme coins tied purely to market sentiment. Layer-2 Upgrade and Roadmap Milestones Position MUTM for Long-Term Growth Another powerful driver behind Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s expected rise is its Layer-2 integration, which will significantly reduce gas fees and increase transaction speeds on the platform. This enhancement will create a cost-efficient and user-friendly environment, addressing two major barriers that limit adoption on many existing Layer-1 blockchains. By cutting costs and speeding up operations, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will attract more DeFi users looking for practical lending and borrowing solutions, strengthening MUTM token demand in the process. Meanwhile, the project’s well-structured roadmap is progressing steadily, with Phase 1 mostly complete and Phase 2 already in development. These milestones build confidence among investors that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will deliver its promised features on time. Furthermore, the upcoming token listings on major exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, KuCoin, Kraken, and MEXC will expose MUTM to a wider audience, including institutional investors who prefer projects with proven roadmaps and audit-backed security. The platform’s recent CertiK audit, which scored 95 on token security and 78 on its advanced Skynet monitoring, confirms that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is serious about protecting investor assets and maintaining transparency. This level of security will likely attract cautious investors who have been burned by volatile meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and are seeking a safer, more utility-rich alternative. Adding to the appeal, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is running a $100,000 giveaway event where ten lucky winners will each receive $10,000 worth in MUTM tokens. This generous incentive encourages early participation and rewards the growing community of supporters. However, with only 15% of Phase 6 tokens sold, this opportunity is limited. The token price is set to increase by 15% to $0.040 soon, making now one of the last chances to buy MUTM at a favorable price before the presale moves forward.

According to multiple analysts, three tokens stand out during this correction: XRP, Shiba Inu (SHIB), and MAGACOIN FINANCE, a rising star among political crypto projects. XRP Eyes $11–$37 Targets Based on Historical Cycles XRP continues to attract bullish outlooks from analysts despite macro headwinds. Market expert EGRAG recently identified a key ascending resistance trendline, dubbed “The Chasm,” that has historically limited XRP’s rallies. In past cycles, a breakout from this level triggered explosive gains. If XRP merely “touches” the Chasm line, projections place it around $11. Meanwhile, a full breakout similar to its 2017 move could push it as high as $37, according to EGRAG. Supporting this outlook, other technical analysts point to XRP’s recent breakout from a bull flag formation. Chart Nerd, a prominent analyst, highlights XRP’s $2.60 support zone and sets near-term targets at $8 and $15. He emphasized whale accumulation and renewed social momentum as key drivers during this dip. These developments make XRP one of the best altcoin to buy during this dip. Shiba Inu Targets 156% Rally as Technical Setup Strengthens Shiba Inu (SHIB) also enters the spotlight as one of the best altcoin to buy during a dip, following a confirmed bullish divergence on the two-day chart. According to analyst Javon Marks, SHIB could rally over 156%, aiming for a target near $0.000032, if it maintains support at the current consolidation level around $0.0000125. Further backing the bullish narrative, SHIB recently broke out of a descending channel, with analyst Jonathan Carter identifying key resistance levels at $0.00001400, $0.00001750, and beyond. High-volume zones and whale activity continue to suggest that the memecoin could be preparing for its next leg up. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Best Altcoin to Buy for 700% Potential? Likewise, MAGACOIN FINANCE is standing out as the most promising altcoin among emerging projects. With a politically charged narrative, meme utility, and strong anti-centralization messaging, the token has gained ground across analyst reviews and community discussions. Several presale rounds have already sold out, and analysts are forecasting an easy 700% gain based on early momentum, viral engagement, and strategic roadmap execution. MAGACOIN FINANCE is particularly attractive to retail traders seeking alternatives to institutional products stalled by regulatory uncertainty. As traders pivot away from slow-moving ETF approvals and into trend-driven opportunities, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become the best altcoin to buy now, not just during this dip, but for the broader 2025 cycle. Conclusion While the broader crypto market remains under pressure, savvy investors are using this dip as a strategic buying opportunity. Analysts are placing XRP, Shiba Inu (SHIB), and MAGACOIN FINANCE at the top of their watchlists. This is thanks to strong technical setups, growing community momentum, and significant upside potential. While all three altcoins present compelling opportunities, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s early-stage momentum and unique narrative could offer the most significant upside for risk-tolerant investors.

Yet, maintaining its stance at the $3.3000 resistance level is notable following the strong bullish rally seen yesterday. Daily Candle Stalls, But XRPBTC Pair Shows Strength Cryptowzrd provided a detailed breakdown of XRP’s current market setup, noting that the daily candle closed indecisively. Despite this, the XRPBTC pair ended the session with a somewhat bullish tone. According to the expert, a decisive move above 0.0028750 BTC could spark a rapid and impulsive upside rally, adding significant momentum to XRP’s bullish prospects from its present position. Related Reading: Analyst Warns XRP Investors Not To Let Fear Dictate Moves As Long As Price Holds This Level He pointed out that XRP was hovering near the $3.23 resistance level, a key zone that has the potential to unlock further gains. Should this level give way, the price could advance toward the next major resistance at $3.65. The momentum from such a breakout could be amplified if paired with strength in the BTC market. Beyond the $3.65 threshold, Cryptowzrd foresees the possibility of XRP surging toward a new all-time high near $4.60. He stressed that such a move would likely be driven by a strong, impulsive rally fueled by increased buying pressure and market enthusiasm. This scenario would mark a significant milestone in XRP’s current recovery phase. On the downside, $2.80 remains the critical daily support level to watch. Maintaining this support is vital for preserving the overall bullish market structure. A breakdown below it could alter the current outlook, potentially inviting deeper corrections and cooling bullish sentiment. Looking ahead, Cryptowzrd confirmed that his attention will remain on lower time frame chart formations in the coming sessions. He is particularly focused on identifying the next viable scalp opportunity, as the current secured position continues to work in favor of the broader strategy. Volatility Persists As Traders Eye $3.23 Retest Wrapping up the analysis, the analyst highlighted that XRP’s intraday chart experienced significant volatility on Friday and is likely to maintain that intensity in the near term. Such choppy price action presents both risks and opportunities for short-term traders. Related Reading: XRP Price Poised for Fresh Upward Move Amid Renewed Bullish Pressure The analyst pointed out that a retest of the $3.23 level as support, followed by a bullish reversal, could pave the way for another promising long position. Conversely, a decisive breakout above the $3.23 intraday resistance would likely propel XRP toward the $3.65 resistance zone, offering a clear upside target. For now, Cryptowzrd stressed the importance of patience, emphasizing that the next move should come from a healthy and mature trade setup.

With Solana holding steady and Ethereum under heavy sell pressure near resistance, analysts now point to MAGACOIN FINANCE as the alternative for high-growth investors. Dogecoin Whales Accumulate 1 Billion Tokens Dogecoin (DOGE) is back in the spotlight after crypto whales snapped up over 1 billion DOGE, worth nearly $200 million, within just 24 hours. According to analyst Ali Martinez, these high-volume purchases now account substantial portion of DOGE’s total circulating supply. The massive accumulation centers on the potential approval of a spot DOGE ETF in the U.S., with approval odds surging from 56% to 74% in recent days. Such a product would open the floodgates for institutional investment and help DOGE challenge top-tier altcoins. Solana and Ethereum Show Stability, but Limited Upside While DOGE builds momentum, Solana continues to shine with strong fundamentals. Trading at $163.51 with a market cap of $88.04 billion, Solana is praised for its fast transaction speeds and low fees. However, its price movement has been relatively stable, with daily volume down 8.74%, prompting investors to seek faster-moving opportunities. Ethereum, on the other hand, is facing a more fragile setup. Currently priced at $3,651, ETH is struggling against a long-standing resistance zone between $3,600–$4,000. This level previously triggered a 66% drop in late 2024. CryptoQuant data shows a Net Taker Volume outflow of -$418.8 million, the second-largest ever recorded, suggesting panic selling or heavy profit-taking. With technical indicators like RSI cooling off, analysts warn ETH could drop another 25%–35% unless it breaks through resistance with strong volume. MAGACOIN FINANCE Emerges as Top Altcoin Pick As blue-chip tokens like ETH and SOL stabilize, investors are hunting for the next high-upside gem—and many believe they’ve found it in MAGACOIN FINANCE . Top analysts are now singling out MAGACOIN FINANCE as a standout contender for long-term growth, endorsing it as a leading crypto to buy for sustainable gains. The project blends meme-driven virality with a utility-focused roadmap, echoing the early stages of PEPE’s 2022 breakout. MAGACOIN FINANCE remains in an exclusive early-access phase with limited supply, offering a strategic entry point ahead of major exchange listings. Conclusion With DOGE whales betting big, Solana maintaining its DeFi dominance, and Ethereum facing serious resistance, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the most promising crypto for investors seeking early-phase exposure and massive growth potential. Analysts are already ranking it as a top pick for 2025’s most notable project. For investors willing to look early and think differently, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents a high-conviction opportunity in a rapidly maturing meme sector.

This August, three standout projects are commanding investor interest: MAGACOIN FINANCE , Qubetics , and Ravi . Each brings a unique strategy to the table: meme-backed momentum, AI-integrated infrastructure, and SocialFi innovation. But one is clearly leading in metrics, trust, and momentum — and analysts agree it’s MAGACOIN’s cycle to dominate. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Meme Momentum With Real Backing Unlike typical meme coins that lean only on hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting a new standard for trust-first community tokens. MAGACOIN FINANCE has successfully passed rigorous audits and supported by an active, trusted investor network The community is growing rapidly and experiencing increased inflows from ETH and XRP wallets. More impressively, the retention rate is high. Early participants aren’t exiting — they’re staking, referring, and growing the brand organically. Insiders suggest CEX listings are imminent, which could propel MAGACOIN FINANCE into its next phase of visibility. With crypto research groups and alpha communities already calling it one of the most confident bets of Q3 , analysts now project a realistic 20x–35x return window , with further upside depending on listing velocity. Qubetics: AI Infrastructure for Web3 Devs Qubetics is emerging as the go-to solution for developers seeking to integrate artificial intelligence directly into decentralized applications. It’s building a “plug-and-play” AI environment, where models like GPT-4 can be connected to DeFi tools, DAOs, or NFT marketplaces using decentralized compute modules. Early reviews from blockchain dev communities point to strong demand for this use case, especially as app-layer AI gains adoption. With a conservative presale cap and a first-mover advantage in AI x Web3 infrastructure there is a growing expectation.. Ravi: The SocialFi Sleeper With Wallet-Native Utility Ravi is a lesser-known but fast-rising SocialFi project building a content network where embedded smart wallets power every interaction. From tipping and posting to voting and monetising, all actions are handled via a native zkSync-based wallet layer — removing friction and improving speed. What sets Ravi apart is its working prototype, strong UX, and focus on onboarding creators outside the crypto-native crowd. Its tokenomics are lean, and the entry point is low — making it a potential for investors who favor product-first startups with mass-market appeal. Conclusion: Three Narratives, One Clear Leader Qubetics offers AI-powered building blocks. Ravi delivers SocialFi wrapped in smart UX. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is leading August’s presale rankings because of one thing: execution . With audits in hand, a vibrant community, and exchange momentum building fast, MAGACOIN FINANCE is primed not only to deliver — but to outperform every expectation.

The FIRE movement (Financial Independence, Retire Early) has found a new ally in cryptocurrency, where explosive returns can significantly outperform traditional portfolios. While the risk is high, so is the potential reward—and that’s exactly what draws a new wave of early retirement seekers to this path. A balanced FIRE plan might typically focus on low-cost index funds, real estate, or dividend stocks. But crypto enthusiasts have flipped the script, betting on digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum to act as growth engines that outperform legacy systems. Within this evolving playbook, emerging altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE are attracting attention as high-upside additions to early-stage portfolios, especially for those looking to maximize gains before broader adoption. Crypto FIRE Strategy: How It Works Rather than relying on slow and steady compounding over decades, a crypto-centric FIRE strategy places calculated bets on faster-moving assets. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) typically form the foundation due to their long-term track records and institutional backing. But for meaningful upside, investors allocate to altcoins with high growth potential and strong communities behind them. Projects in sectors like DeFi, GameFi, and infrastructure tokens round out the strategy, aiming to catch early-stage growth before prices explode. Success depends not just on what you invest in, but how you invest—employing tactics like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) to reduce emotional decision-making and mitigate volatility. Periodic rebalancing is key, especially after sharp market movements. Selling partial gains from top performers and reinvesting in undervalued tokens can maintain healthy risk exposure while banking profits. For U.S. investors, self-directed crypto IRAs can also unlock long-term tax benefits that make early retirement even more achievable. Why This New Altcoin is Gaining Traction With Early Retirees For those chasing big returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being called one of the best altcoins to watch right now. Experts estimate it could deliver a 67x ROI in the upcoming market run, citing its rapidly expanding user base, early-stage growth potential, and structured presale phases that reward early participation. Unlike meme coins with no clear path forward, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building out a full ecosystem of utility, staking, and community-driven development. As momentum builds, comparisons are being made to the early days of breakout tokens like SHIBA INU—but with a clearer roadmap and increasing support from long-term crypto investors. With investor demand rising fast and current rounds selling out quicker each time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming a favorite for those looking to retire early with a bold, high-growth strategy. The Path to Early Retirement Early retirement through crypto isn’t guaranteed—but with the right portfolio, the right mindset, and a commitment to long-term strategies like DCA and rebalancing, it’s more possible than ever. For investors looking beyond the mainstream cryptocurrencies that have already established themselves, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE offer the kind of upside that could supercharge a portfolio and turn calculated risk into real wealth .

As the market heats up ahead of Q4 2025, four standout presales are drawing serious attention. Each offers real utility, strong demand, and growing ecosystems. But one project stands out as the top pick for early ROI. MAGACOIN FINANCE—Best Bet for Early ROI Hunters MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of the most anticipated presales in the 2025 crypto market. It combines a bold, meme-driven identity with a growing online presence that has captivated early investors. Designed to offer more than just hype, it aims to create lasting impact in the altcoin space through community strength and viral momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE, crowned the best crypto presale for early ROI hunters, has drawn serious attention from analysts and retail buyers. Its explosive presale traction, combined with a dedicated base of supporters, positions it as a front-runner in this cycle’s high-ROI opportunities. While many projects promise gains after launch, MAGACOIN delivers excitement right from its presale stage. Pepe Dollar (PEPD)—Meme Power Meets Real-World Utility Pepe Dollar (PEPD) isn’t just another meme coin. Built as an Ethereum Layer-2 token, PEPD combines humor and utility into a unique ecosystem. It satirizes fiat systems while offering tools for DeFi, token creation, and crypto gaming. The presale is still in Stage 1, priced at $0.004688, with over 90% of tokens already snapped up. Interest surged with a 20% instant bonus promo, making this one of the fastest-selling meme projects of the year. Its blend of satire, serious features, and early-stage pricing gives Pepe Dollar the potential to punch far above its weight in 2025. BlockchainFX (BFX)—The All-in-One Super App for Traders BlockchainFX is quickly becoming a favorite for investors looking for real utility during the presale stage. This token powers a working super app that blends crypto, stocks, commodities, and forex trading. BFX’s ecosystem has passed a CertiK audit and follows strict KYC compliance. Over 10,000 daily users are already generating live revenue. More than $4.68 million has been raised so far, showing massive presale traction. What makes $BFX unique is its ability to offer daily USDT rewards to token holders—up to 7% even before public launch. The current presale price of $0.018 offers over 2.7x gains before its confirmed launch at $0.05. With Visa card benefits and a 30% bonus (BLOCK30), BFX is a standout in presales with working features and actual profits. BlockDAG (BDAG)—A Live Platform Before Token Launch BlockDAG (BDAG) is taking an unusual but effective path. While most crypto presales promote future promises, BDAG offers access to a fully operational trading platform during the presale itself. Users can now test buy and sell functions, track price charts, and interact with real-time data. It’s a functional dashboard—not just a concept. That transparency builds serious trust among early participants. This bold strategy puts BlockDAG in a unique category. It allows presale users to simulate real trading before the token even hits the market. That live experience sets BDAG apart from traditional presale hype. Final Thoughts Each of these four presales—MAGACOIN FINANCE, PEPD, BFX, and BDAG—offers strong ROI potential. However, MAGACOIN FINANCE leads the charge with its unmatched blend of narrative, community, and projected returns. As early buyers prepare for Q4, these tokens are dominating watchlists and analyst picks across the board.

BlockDAG has now raised $367 million during its presale and is offering a $0.0016 token price until August 11, with listings already confirmed on 20 exchanges. That alone puts it at the top of investor watchlists. But it’s not just momentum, it’s delivery. BlockDAG already has live tools like a working trading simulator and widely adopted mining apps. Compared to price action in Sui and XRP, BlockDAG stands out for offering not just upside, but real access. The numbers are growing, and the countdown is on. If you’re looking for the crypto gem of 2025 , it’s time to pay attention. Sui’s Institutional Support & Wallet Explosion Signal Growth Sui is gaining strength with a wave of institutional support. The biggest driver? Swiss-regulated AMINA Bank added SUI to its trading and custody offerings. That single move triggered a record-breaking 1.28 million new wallets in a day, pushing the total above 257 million. That kind of adoption is hard to ignore. Technically, SUI is staying strong at $3.50 and forming a bullish double-bottom pattern. Analysts are pointing toward a breakout past $5, backed by on-chain activity, retail demand, and expanding developer contributions. It’s clear Sui is climbing the ranks, and that’s why many are calling it a rising crypto gem of 2025 . XRP’s Breakout Pattern Could Lead to One of 2025’s Biggest Moves XRP isn’t done yet. Analysts are highlighting a chart setup that mirrors earlier patterns that came just before massive rallies. If XRP can push past current resistance, it could hit $48.90, a move that would be one of the year’s biggest among top-cap tokens. Short-term indicators suggest a 20% run could come by the end of the month. Whale accumulation is up, and fewer tokens are hitting exchanges, pointing to stronger holder confidence. For traders watching for technical setups with explosive potential, XRP’s breakout formation is one of the most exciting right now. Still, while XRP offers momentum, it’s BlockDAG that delivers both upside and entry-level affordability, something large caps just can’t match. BlockDAG Is the Crypto Gem of 2025, & It’s Just Getting Started What sets BlockDAG apart is simple: it’s already delivering. While most presales are just promises, BDAG has launched real products ahead of listing. Its Dashboard V4 simulates a full trading experience with charts, trade orders, and wallet tracking. That’s real utility, already in the hands of users. The X1 mobile miner has pulled in over 2.5 million users, while the X10 hardware miner offers up to 200 BDAG daily when paired with X1. This dual system allows everyday users and serious earners alike to join the network with ease. BlockDAG’s architecture combines blockchain and DAG tech for unmatched speed, between 2,000 and 15,000 transactions per second. It’s EVM-compatible and includes a low-code smart contract builder, opening the door for fast dApp deployment and future cross-chain upgrades. But it doesn’t stop there. Daily Buyer Battles reward top buyers with unsold tokens, while a 10 BTC Auction is live now. Buy before August 11, and you’re in. The higher your purchase, the better your odds. On top of that, 20 exchanges are ready to list BDAG the moment the $600M presale cap is hit. The returns? At $0.0016: Reaching $0.05 = 3,025% ROI Reaching $1 = 62,400% ROI Reaching $10 = 624,900% ROI These are numbers based on fixed pricing, not hype. For anyone chasing returns in 2025, BlockDAG is a true crypto gem of 2025 with the math to prove it. Summing Up Crypto investors are shifting their focus in 2025, from pure speculation to substance. Sui is winning attention for its regulated growth and wallet boom. XRP is exciting traders with breakout potential and whale support. But BlockDAG is doing what others aren’t, delivering real tools, community engagement, and a presale that offers instant exposure and a chance at massive ROI. With over $367 million already raised, a live ecosystem, and 2.5 million+ users onboard, BDAG is no longer just promising, it’s executing. At $0.0016, the upside is massive, and there’s no token vesting. With 20 exchanges lined up, liquidity is ready the moment the presale ends. For anyone looking for real value, scale-ready architecture, and one last chance before the price resets, BlockDAG leads as the most complete crypto gem of 2025 , ready for liftoff.

New Bullish Pattern Has Traders Loading Up Fast,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/xrp-double-bottom-breakout-new-bullish-pattern-has-traders-loading-up-fast/,"XRP is back in the spotlight, and this time, technical traders are leading the charge. A classic double bottom formation is taking shape on the 4-hour chart – a signal widely recognized as bullish . XRP has bounced twice off support and is now approaching the critical $3.00 neckline. If buying momentum continues, many believe this could open the door to a short-term rally targeting $3.15 and possibly even $3.31. But there’s a growing conversation among seasoned investors: while XRP remains one of the most important names in crypto, is its most explosive era already in the rearview? With its market cap already towering above $175 billion, and years of price action behind it, many wonder if opportunities for massive gains now lie elsewhere. And increasingly, that “elsewhere” is pointing toward earlier-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP’s Double Bottom Draws Short-Term Optimism The technical structure spotted by EGRAG CRYPTO is compelling. With lows near $2.81 and $2.91 and a neckline forming at $3, XRP’s double bottom is a textbook reversal signal. Traders are watching volume and market confirmation closely – if the price convincingly breaks the neckline, XRP could rapidly test resistance at $3.15 and $3.31. Still, there’s an underlying sense that XRP – while strong – isn’t built for the kind of meteoric 50x or 100x moves seen in newer assets. Regulatory wins and institutional flows could boost the price over time, but its maturity and size naturally cap its upside potential in the short term. That’s prompting many to look toward faster-moving, earlier-stage altcoins . MAGACOIN FINANCE Emerges as a Prime Contender For investors actively seeking the next big altcoin breakout, MAGACOIN FINANCE is climbing rapidly to the top of their watchlists. The project just earned top-tier security ratings , a major green flag in today’s risk-aware environment. At the same time, its community is expanding fast , with both everyday crypto users and seasoned analysts joining early . Unlike coins already listed on major exchanges, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in its presale phase, giving new investors a rare opportunity to secure a position before the mass adoption. Analysts are increasingly comparing its trajectory to the early days of Avalanche and Cardano, both of which exploded in value after hitting key momentum milestones. As one analyst recently noted, “MAGACOIN FINANCE is following the same playbook – strong foundation, real community traction, and perfect timing .” Same Market, Different Stories XRP will likely remain a central player in crypto for years to come, especially as Ripple expands partnerships and regulatory clarity improves. But the game has changed. Investors today are hunting for flexibility, fast growth, and fresh narratives. And that’s something MAGACOIN FINANCE offers . Unlike XRP, it’s not limited by a decade of price history or regulatory baggage. It’s agile, community-driven, and built with today’s market expectations in mind. For those who missed previous cycles – or simply want to diversify into higher-upside assets – MAGACOIN FINANCE presents a compelling alternative . Conclusion XRP’s double bottom may deliver solid short-term returns, especially if momentum breaks through the $3 neckline. But when it comes to portfolio-defining moves, the best returns often come from early conviction – not late confirmation. That’s why MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly gaining ground with serious investors. With many milestones now surpassed, top security credentials in place, and a thriving presale underway, it’s attracting attention not just as another altcoin – but as a rare opportunity at the right time.

Cardano’s recent breakout has bulls eyeing $1.50, while Chainlink is shaping up for a possible $28 retest. But another name is quietly gaining traction, and doing more than just keeping up. Cold Wallet is still early in its presale journey but is already generating buzz with a bold 4,900% ROI forecast and a referral model that pays users instantly. While ADA and LINK may be aiming for 2–4x growth, Cold Wallet is eyeing a much bigger leap. With real-time USDT rewards, bonus CWT for referrals, and a presale price still under one cent, Cold Wallet stands out as one of the most talked-about presales in the market right now. Cardano Price Watch: Holding Steady as Bulls Target $1.50 Cardano has shaken off weeks of sideways action and is now showing signs of strength. With ADA pushing past key levels above $0.45, excitement is building again. Analysts are watching for a sustained move toward $1.50, with some long-range outlooks hinting at even higher milestones down the line. Developer activity remains strong, and DeFi TVL continues to rise on the network, adding to the growing optimism. Still, ADA’s growth curve is expected to be slow and steady. It’s built on fundamentals and community strength, but not known for wild swings. Many who hold Cardano are now branching out to newer names with more aggressive upside, and Cold Wallet is landing on their radar thanks to its current low price and high ROI outlook. Chainlink Price Forecast: Bulls Look for a Break Above $25 Chainlink is trending upward as demand for oracles increases. After holding above $16 and recovering from its consolidation near $12, LINK is showing bullish momentum. The current Chainlink price forecast puts $28 as the next big target, with heavy attention on the $25–$28 range. A clear break above this could bring a new leg up, fueled by expanding usage across smart contract platforms. Utility is what sets Chainlink apart. More protocols are leaning on LINK to power real-world data feeds, giving it long-term value. But even if it hits $28, the jump from here is roughly a 2x. Compare that with Cold Wallet’s 4,900% ROI potential, and the difference is clear, Cold Wallet is offering a level of upside that’s hard to ignore, especially at its current Stage 17 presale price of $0.00998. How Cold Wallet Rewards Its Users for Using Crypto! What makes Cold Wallet stand out isn’t just price. It’s how users are rewarded. The in-app referral system is already live and paying users in USDT. Whether you’re completing a swap or inviting someone new, the model is simple, both the sender and receiver earn. Once a $5 balance is hit, rewards are unlocked automatically. It’s instant, clear, and totally user-friendly. But there’s more. During the presale, those referrals are supercharged with bonus CWT. Anyone who brings in new users earns 10% extra in CWT, and the person they invite gets 5%. All of it is distributed with a matching vesting schedule to keep things fair and sustainable. The rewards are pulled from a separate pool, so it won’t affect the core supply. No complicated tiers, no locked dashboards, just clean, one-level rewards that work. Cold Wallet is currently in Stage 17, priced at $0.00998, and has already raised over $5.78 million. The goal? A listing price of $0.3517, which represents a massive 4,900% return from today’s level. That kind of jump is what’s drawing serious attention, not just because of the upside, but because of the timing. Unlike Cardano and Chainlink, which are mature players with limited near-term growth, Cold Wallet still has room to run. It’s not just hype, it’s a chance to ride something early with real rewards already flowing through the app. Final Thoughts Cardano’s breakout is real, and Chainlink’s bullish structure is impressive. But their growth stories are unfolding slowly. Cold Wallet, on the other hand, is taking a more aggressive route, rewarding users instantly and offering one of the highest potential ROIs on the market today. With real-time USDT payouts and referral bonuses in CWT during the presale, it’s doing what many projects only promise, giving back as it grows. In a market full of clones and gimmicks, Cold Wallet is creating a system that’s both easy to join and rewarding to stick with.

Three transfers were logged, totaling 1 billion XRP. The largest single transfer was 500 million XRP, valued at approximately $1.64 billion, to an unknown wallet. Two additional releases attributed to Ripple accounted for 500 million XRP, recorded as 100 million XRP (approximately $328 million) and 400 million XRP (nearly $1.31 billion). Together, these movements represent an approximate total value of $3.28 billion. Xaif (@Xaif_Crypto), a popular figure in the XRP community, shared the news of the Escrow unlocks, as this occurred days after its usual schedule. Massive #XRP Escrow Unlock! 500M XRP ($1.64B) – Unknown wallet 100M XRP ($328M) – Ripple 400M XRP ($1.31B) – Ripple Total: 1B XRP worth $3.28B unleashed in minutes! pic.twitter.com/zfsKBnYYHh — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) August 9, 2025 Unusual Escrow Activity On August 2, Ripple locked 700 billion tokens and did not record any further unlocks. The company often unlocks 1 billion tokens at the start of every month, and this is his daily work. The sudden release of these tokens shocked many in the XRP community. In May, a similar occurrence shocked the market, as the company locked 700 million tokens while the 1 billion token release had not happened . Although Ripple has now released its 1 billion tokens for August, one of the transactions references tokens unlocked from an unknown wallet; the community is left with more questions about Ripple’s escrow activity than usual. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Earlier in 2024, Ripple’s escrow mechanism faced irregularities that also raised questions. The unlock system failed for the first few months of the year, resulting in a smaller amount being unlocked at the beginning of each month. When these errors occurred, Ripple always made up the difference, releasing the remaining tokens later in each of the affected months. However, the current anomaly appears not to have originated from a similar error with the escrow system, and the token unlock, although late, indicates that Ripple is adhering to its release schedule. Market Impact and Next Steps Large and concentrated transfers out of escrow can affect liquidity metrics and influence trader behavior. XRP is currently trading at $3.24, showing a slight decrease of 1.84%. However, the asset has an excited community, as it is up over 16% from last week. Market participants will closely monitor XRP’s short-term movements to determine the impact of the escrow unlock on price activity.

While bulls still aim for $200K, analysts are flagging short-term risks. Ethereum and Litecoin are also nearing pivotal resistance zones. Meanwhile, a new player, MAGACOIN FINANCE, is gaining recognition as one of the top altcoins to buy, with breakout potential that’s drawing comparisons to Shiba Inu’s early phase. Bitcoin: $200K Still on the Horizon, But First, A Correction? Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading around $114,000 after peaking above $123,000 in mid-July. However, key technical indicators have flashed red. The weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dipped below its 14-week simple moving average, a crossover that preceded 25–33% corrections twice in 2024. If history repeats, BTC could fall to $95,000 before resuming its long-term uptrend. Despite this near-term risk, macro sentiment remains bullish. Analysts such as Ash Crypto suggest Bitcoin may still be mirroring its 2017 cycle, which ended in a parabolic move. With institutional support intact and long-term holders still accumulating, the $200,000 target is not off the table, but it may require some short-term pain before another leg up. Ethereum: Heavy Selling Pressure Near Resistance Ethereum (ETH) is also battling a multiyear resistance zone between $3,600 and $4,000, the same level that triggered a brutal 66% decline in late 2024. On-chain data reveals a worrying trend: Net Taker Volume dropped to -$418.8 million this week, the second-largest daily outflow in ETH’s history, with over 115,000 more ETH sold than bought via market orders. This suggests a cooling rally as traders take profits and momentum slows. Still, ETH’s fundamentals remain intact, with the broader Ethereum ecosystem continuing to expand across DeFi and Web3. If bulls can reclaim $4,000, it could open the door to a run toward new highs. But for now, caution dominates the charts. Litecoin: Mining Fatigue and Sideways Action Litecoin (LTC) is down roughly 10% from its July high, now trading near $109. With daily trading volume at $1.4 billion, analysts note that miner sentiment is waning. Institutional mining activity has stalled, and whale wallets have shown signs of redistribution despite retail interest picking up. LTC’s price is currently consolidating between the $106.30 Fib support and the 50-day EMA resistance at $118.60. Social sentiment remains flat, with dominance at just 0.73%. While Litecoin has proven resilient in past cycles, it will need a strong catalyst—perhaps a surprise ETF narrative or Bitcoin’s recovery—to regain upward momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The SHIB-Style Breakout Setup in Early Access While major caps like BTC, ETH, and LTC face headwinds, MAGACOIN FINANCE is stealing the spotlight as one of the most talked-about early-stage altcoins. Analysts are drawing parallels to SHIBA INU’s explosive 2021 rally, citing MAGACOIN’s political theme appeal, limited supply, and strong community traction. What sets it apart is timing; it’s still pre-CEX listing, where the biggest gains tend to occur. Crypto whales and early buyers are positioning themselves now, with top market commentators identifying it as one of the best cryptos to buy for significant growth. As sentiment shifts from large-cap consolidation to narrative-driven plays, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out. Its early-access window is closing fast, and history has shown that breakout setups don’t stay quiet for long. For those looking to outperform in the next wave, MAGACOIN may be the name to watch. Conclusion The crypto market is shifting gears. While Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin reassess their positions near key resistance levels, a new narrative is emerging around low-cap, high-potential tokens. Amid this, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining traction as the best crypto to buy for significant growth.

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with excitement as the Bitcoin price has achieved a significant milestone, surging remarkably above the $118,000 mark. According to recent Bitcoin World market monitoring , BTC is currently trading at an impressive $118,020.83 on the Binance USDT market. This notable BTC surge is capturing the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike, signaling a robust movement within the broader crypto market . For those engaged in Bitcoin trading , this development represents a pivotal moment, shaping the landscape of future cryptocurrency news . What’s Fueling This Remarkable BTC Surge? Many factors contribute to such significant price movements in the digital asset space. The recent BTC surge can be attributed to a confluence of bullish indicators and growing market confidence. Firstly, increasing institutional adoption plays a crucial role. Major corporations and financial institutions are showing greater interest in Bitcoin, viewing it as a legitimate store of value and an attractive investment. Institutional Inflows: Large-scale investments from funds and corporations provide substantial buying pressure. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic uncertainties often drive investors towards decentralized assets like Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. Halving Impact: The recent Bitcoin halving event, which reduces the supply of new BTC, historically precedes significant price appreciation due to supply-demand dynamics. These elements collectively build a strong foundation for sustained growth, drawing more participants into the ecosystem. Navigating the Current Crypto Market Rally: What Investors Should Know The upward trajectory of Bitcoin often sets the tone for the entire crypto market . When Bitcoin performs strongly, it typically pulls altcoins along, creating a broader rally. This current market environment presents both opportunities and considerations for investors. Understanding the sentiment and technical indicators is crucial for informed decision-making. As the market experiences this renewed vigor, it is important to observe liquidity and trading volumes. High volumes accompanying price increases often indicate strong conviction behind the move, rather than mere speculative spikes. However, volatility remains a characteristic of the crypto space, and prudent risk management is always advised. Understanding Bitcoin Trading at These Elevated Levels For active participants in Bitcoin trading , the $118,000 level becomes a new psychological and technical benchmark. Traders are now observing whether this level can transform into a strong support zone for future price action. Identifying key support and resistance levels is vital for strategic entry and exit points. While the current momentum is strong, traders often look for signs of consolidation or potential pullbacks before the next leg up. Monitoring order books on major exchanges like Binance, where BTC is actively traded, can provide insights into immediate supply and demand dynamics. Additionally, derivatives markets often reflect broader sentiment and can influence spot prices. What This Means for Future Cryptocurrency News and Trends? This significant move in the Bitcoin price is likely to dominate cryptocurrency news headlines for weeks to come. It reaffirms Bitcoin’s position as the leading digital asset and could pave the way for increased mainstream adoption and regulatory clarity. As Bitcoin continues to gain traction, we may see more traditional financial products emerging, further bridging the gap between conventional finance and the digital asset world. The long-term outlook appears increasingly positive, with many analysts forecasting even higher targets. However, the path to these targets is rarely linear. Investors should remain informed about global economic shifts, regulatory developments, and technological advancements within the blockchain space, as these factors will continue to influence market trends. In conclusion, Bitcoin’s ascent above $118,000 is a testament to its enduring strength and growing appeal. This remarkable Bitcoin price milestone not only excites current holders but also signals a vibrant and evolving crypto market for newcomers. Whether you are deeply involved in Bitcoin trading or simply following the latest cryptocurrency news , this rally underscores the dynamic nature of digital assets. Staying informed and exercising caution remain key principles in this exhilarating landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Has Bitcoin ever reached this price before? No, the current surge above $118,000 marks a significant new milestone for Bitcoin, setting a fresh all-time high. This achievement highlights its continued growth and increasing valuation in the digital asset space. 2. What does reaching $118,000 mean for Bitcoin’s future? This price level signifies strong positive market sentiment and potentially establishes a new psychological support level for Bitcoin. It suggests growing confidence among investors and could pave the way for further upward movement, although market volatility is always a factor. 3. Is this a good time to start Bitcoin trading? While the current momentum is exciting, entering Bitcoin trading during a rapid surge carries increased volatility and risk. It is crucial to conduct thorough research, understand market dynamics, and implement robust risk management strategies before making any investment decisions. 4. How does this BTC surge affect other cryptocurrencies? Historically, a strong BTC surge often leads to a positive ripple effect across the broader crypto market . Many altcoins tend to follow Bitcoin’s price action, experiencing their own rallies. However, individual altcoin performance can vary based on their unique fundamentals and market capitalization. 5.

This shift may have gone largely unnoticed by the market, according to Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise Asset Management. Market Sleeping On SEC’s Pivot? In a recent investor note, Hougan pointed to the speech delivered by SEC Chair Paul Atkins at the America First Policy Institute, titled “American Leadership in the Digital Finance Revolution.” Hougan described the document as “the most bullish government document I have read in my entire crypto career.” The speech outlined a comprehensive agenda, which is referred to as “Project Crypto.” This, according to Hougan, includes a blueprint to modernize digital asset regulation in a way that boosts innovation and positions the United States as a leader in the global crypto economy. While the broader market has not yet responded, Hougan believes that Atkins’ vision has not been priced into the market. He explained that investors are underestimating how a friendlier SEC stance could catalyze a structural pivot across multiple crypto sectors. “I’ve studied and written about crypto nonstop for the past eight years. I’ve long been bullish about the future of crypto, and I’ve said that all assets will eventually move over blockchain-based rails. But after reading the speech, I’m realizing I have to think bigger – and move to a faster timeline. If it wasn’t priced in for me, I’m going to guess it wasn’t priced in for others.” Based on the content of the speech, Hougan identified three key themes poised to benefit: Layer 1 smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana, public trading platforms such as Coinbase and Robinhood, and decentralized finance protocols, including Uniswap and Aave. Hougan warned that the market’s failure to acknowledge this regulatory inflection point could represent a missed opportunity. The exec also noted that such moves have historically resulted in outsized gains across high-beta sectors. While skepticism remains due to the SEC’s longstanding adversarial stance toward the crypto industry, Hougan’s interpretation of Atkins’ remarks suggests a serious re-evaluation is underway. Calls For Privacy Protections and DeFi Inclusion Adding to this regulatory narrative was a noteworthy speech from another SEC official. Earlier this week, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce called for stronger protection of financial privacy and crypto users’ rights during a speech at the Science of Blockchain Conference. She criticized the country’s financial system’s surveillance practices, while arguing that the Bank Secrecy Act and tools like the SEC’s Consolidated Audit Trail compromise individual freedom. Peirce even went on to highlight the benefits of DeFi and privacy-preserving technologies like zero-knowledge proofs. She urged regulators not to criminalize open-source developers or force reporting in peer-to-peer crypto transactions.

As crypto enters a fresh bull run, analysts are closely tracking the top 10 meme coins in 2025, projects that combine viral energy, community loyalty, and real innovation. For anyone eyeing the top 10 meme coins in 2025, it’s clear: the rules of the game have changed. It’s no longer just about the biggest names. The spotlight is shifting to meme coins with unique stories, powerful utility, and, when it comes to one standout, exclusive early access. Let’s break down the coins catching serious attention as the bulls take over. 1.

Why Scarcity Makes MoonBull the Talk of 2025 The psychology behind MoonBull’s early access strategy is simple yet powerful. Humans instinctively value what’s scarce, and in crypto, being first often means outsized rewards. Analysts note that most of the top 10 meme coins in 2025 saw their biggest returns during exclusive launch phases, and MoonBull’s approach creates a sense of urgency for anyone who doesn’t want to miss out on the next viral project. The rush to be on the inside is more than hype; it’s a proven path to outperformance for traders who move quickly. 2.

While Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to dominate headlines, savvy investors are rotating into mid- and low-cap coins with more room to run. The goal isn’t just safety -it’s upside. That’s why 2025 is being hailed as the year of the underdog, with capital flowing toward projects that combine solid fundamentals, untapped narratives, and real growth potential. Among the most promising? Tron (TRX), Sui (SUI), and a fast-rising presale token called MAGACOIN FINANCE, which some analysts say could deliver returns that put XRP’s early surge to shame . Tron (TRX): quietly expanding while others slow down Tron has spent years flying under the radar, but its consistent growth and expanding ecosystem make it a strong contender for 2025. Originally criticized for lack of innovation, Tron has steadily evolved into one of the most used Layer 1 networks in terms of daily transaction volume—especially in the stablecoin and DeFi space. With USDT flowing across the Tron blockchain at a scale few other chains can match, and an increasing number of dApps being deployed, TRX has quietly become a high – throughput , low-cost blockchain with real-world utility. If sentiment shifts in its favor during the next altcoin wave, TRX could finally break out of its long-term consolidation range, offering strong upside for patient holders. MAGACOIN FINANCE the must-buy presale as traders eye massive 13,800% profits Amid all the speculation about established altcoins, one project is consistently stealing the spotlight among high-reward investors : MAGACOIN FINANCE. Still not listed on major exchanges, MAGACOIN has already generated enormous buzz across trading forums, fueled by its viral branding and active political edge. But beyond the hype lies a project showing real traction. Daily engagement has surged beyond early forecasts , presale rounds are closing in record time , and wallet data confirms that larger investors are moving in early. The latest market models now suggest that MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver up to 13,800% ROI – yes, turning a modest $500 stake into nearly $70,000 if projections play out . While tokens like XRP once offered those kinds of returns in their infancy, analysts argue that MAGACOIN FINANCE is uniquely positioned to replicate that early-stage upside. It combines virality with a roadmap grounded in strategic community growth and early exchange integration. As traders search for that one gem that could define the cycle, MAGACOIN is quickly becoming the must-watch candidate . SUI: scalable Layer 1 with serious developer momentum Launched in 2023, SUI has quickly built a name as a developer-friendly, high-performance blockchain focused on speed, scalability, and low latency. Backed by former Meta engineers and leveraging a parallel execution model, SUI supports Web3 gaming, finance, and NFT infrastructure—all sectors poised to rebound in 2025 . What sets SUI apart is its early-stage positioning combined with high-level infrastructure. While other Layer 1s fight over crowded use cases, SUI is laying the foundation for clean, modular app design and seamless smart contract deployment. As user-facing dApps and partnerships ramp up, many traders believe SUI could mirror the early trajectories of Solana and Avalanche, both of which saw 10X–40X runs once adoption took off. Conclusion: Undervalued doesn’t mean underwhelming TRX and SUI both offer strong narratives heading into 2025. Tron brings network maturity and stablecoin dominance; SUI offers cutting-edge tech with explosive Layer 1 potential. But for those aiming for transformative gains, not just respectable returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out. With analysts projecting a 13,800% profit window and traders treating it like the next big presale breakout, this is one project that can’t be ignored. 2025 may belong to the giants – but the biggest winners, as always, could come from the underdogs .

Solana Aims for $320 While Algorand Struggles,https://thecoinrise.com/cold-wallet-gets-listed-on-cmc-solana-aims-for-320-while-algorand-struggles/,"Crypto traders are shifting focus as market narratives split between growth and practical use. Solana is gaining pace with projections suggesting a breakout could reach $320. On the other hand, Algorand continues to face weak demand and struggles to regain traction. Yet in the background, Cold Wallet quietly secures CoinMarketCap (CMC) validation and introduces a cashback system that adds real value each time users interact with crypto. While price activity grabs headlines, actual functionality is what may drive value long-term. Forecasts show Solana has room to climb, Algorand could stay stagnant, and Cold Wallet may turn out to be a serious contender among upcoming crypto projects in 2025. Solana Builds Momentum with $320 in Sight Solana is triggering bullish signals on many fronts. It has broken through a prominent bull flag pattern, which traditionally signals strong upward continuation if volume holds up. Analysts are closely watching for a climb past $300 and possibly reaching $320. Key contributors to this surge include improved institutional participation, greater network stability, and rising activity in its DeFi and NFT sectors. These aren’t just technical indicators. Solana’s fast processing speed and minimal fees are attracting developers back to its ecosystem. Recent changes to its validator rewards and smart contract tools are also contributing to this momentum. Solana has surpassed multiple resistance points and shows ongoing strength. However, the next phase of growth depends on sustained momentum. For anyone considering which crypto to buy today, Solana brings a strong foundation with visible traction. But chasing a coin after it has already pumped can limit upside, especially compared to lower-entry options like Cold Wallet. Algorand Fails to Break Pattern as Optimism Remains Low Algorand hasn’t kept up. A recent 47% dip in Arbitrum’s price has had ripple effects across Layer-2 and smart contract platforms, impacting ALGO as well. Although there’s no direct link, this downturn in sentiment has weighed heavily on Algorand, which hasn’t seen any major recovery even as the wider market finds some stability. Most Algorand price forecasts remain cautious, as the coin is still trading under key support near $0.20. With declining volume and slower ecosystem development, buyers seem wary. Other blockchains like Avalanche and Solana are expanding at a much faster pace, leaving Algorand struggling to keep up. Connections to broader issues like Arbitrum’s slide only deepen the concern. If Algorand fails to create a new use case or attract users with a strong story, it may keep losing ground. For those checking which crypto to buy today, ALGO lacks clear triggers. On the flip side, Cold Wallet is shaping up with something more tangible: direct user-focused benefits. Cold Wallet’s CMC Recognition and Reward System Bring Real User Value Cold Wallet is now listed on CoinMarketCap, giving it global price visibility and strengthening its credibility. But beyond just being trackable, it stands out by offering a real benefit, a cashback model that gives users rewards each time they engage with crypto. This reward structure is supported by the CWT coin and a flexible cashback tier system. The more CWT a user holds, the better their rewards, without needing to stake, lock tokens, or deal with complicated tools. Users just keep their coins in Cold Wallet, and the system does the rest. Cashback is applied automatically to gas costs, swaps, and crypto-fiat transactions. Bronze-tier users get back 10% on gas, 5% on swaps, and 5% on fiat bridges. At the top Diamond tier, users can receive 100% gas refunds along with 50% returns on swaps and fiat bridges. This turns Cold Wallet into a near-zero-fee tool for frequent users, moving away from the fee-heavy models used by most wallets today. This cashback model reshapes the answer to which crypto to buy today, by providing real use and value beyond price movements. With carefully managed reward limits and tier structures, Cold Wallet is designed for long-term performance. As more users join, demand for CWT rises naturally, creating growth that few base-layer chains can duplicate. The current presale price stands at $0.00998, with a future listing price of $0.3517, reflecting a 4,900% potential return. Over 694 million coins have been sold in stage 17 of the presale, and funding has surpassed $5.8 million. While these numbers draw attention, the cashback mechanics and overall setup are what could give Cold Wallet long-lasting strength. Final Say Solana appears poised for a near-term rally and remains one of the stronger-performing projects. However, its current valuation may already include much of the upcoming movement. Algorand, still weighed down by weak sentiment and external factors like Arbitrum’s decline, is having a hard time regaining support or relevance. In contrast, Cold Wallet presents a fresh model that combines ease of use, meaningful rewards, and CMC transparency. Its cashback setup benefits users who carry out regular actions like bridging, swapping, or paying gas. With a relatively low entry price and a structure built for scaling, it may be one of the most overlooked crypto projects today. If you’re thinking about which crypto presale to buy today , the answer may not be in trending charts but in utility. Cold Wallet offers both a compelling case and a growing community that rewards real activity.

Hedera (HBAR) is pressing toward $0.25 with whale activity building, and Avalanche (AVAX) has held about $22 after a strong July. Both stories look constructive, yet neither puts BTC straight into a buyer’s wallet. BlockDAG (BDAG) does. Right now the sale delivers real BTC in real time. A 10 BTC pool is live, and each BDAG purchase earns a proportional share. There is no lottery and no tricks. Buy more, receive more Bitcoin. Anyone looking to buy cryptocurrency today and lock in immediate upside will notice the difference. BlockDAG’s presale is not just another launch. It is a live route to Bitcoin payouts before the market open, giving buyers something concrete while they wait for the BDAG listing. That clarity matters right now. BlockDAG’s 10 BTC Auction Delivers Real Bitcoin to Buyers Before August 11 What if a presale paid in Bitcoin before launch day? Hedera (HBAR) is holding near $0.25 with whale activity climbing, and Avalanche (AVAX) is steady at $22 after a strong July. Both show promise, but neither is putting BTC directly into buyers’ wallets. BlockDAG is changing that. The project’s 10 BTC reward pool is live, giving buyers proportional Bitcoin payouts with every BDAG purchase. There’s no draw or chance element, rewards are calculated on purchase size, and more BDAG means more BTC. It’s immediate value rather than waiting for launch. BlockDAG’s presale is in Batch 29, with over $367 million raised and 24.8 billion coins sold. Coins are priced at $0.0016 for a limited time via Dashboard V4, with a $0.05 launch price targeting up to 3,025% ROI from this tier. Buyers also get access to a live trading simulator to prepare for launch. The giveaway closes August 11, and all payouts happen on-chain in real time. While other projects talk about future potential, BlockDAG is delivering Bitcoin right now, making it stand out in today’s presale market. Hedera’s Climb Toward $0.27 Gains Strength with Whale Accumulation & Institutional Moves Hedera (HBAR) has seen an 8.9% rise, trading at $0.2513 as of August 6. Whale wallets now control over 77% of the supply, and institutional interest is rising after adopting the ERC-3643 token standard. This could expand regulated asset tokenization on the network, pushing analysts to watch $0.27 as the next key resistance. Some long-term projections even suggest $2 by 2025, though the nearer target is $0.30. HBAR’s adoption is also climbing, with the African Open University using its token service for academic credentials. Its ISO 20022 compliance could draw attention from traditional finance. Trading volumes remain steady, and support has held around $0.23. Technical setups suggest bullish pressure, but liquidations near $0.276 remain a watch point. Whether for short-term plays or long-term holds, HBAR is back in the spotlight with its recent move. Avalanche Holds $22 as TVL Growth & On-Chain Activity Support Strong Outlook Avalanche (AVAX) has been trading sideways since August 3, holding at $22 after peaking near $23.08. Despite a recent plateau, it remains up 30% in 30 days. Technical charts show solid support at $22, with $23.50 as the next resistance and $26 as a breakout zone. Its Total Value Locked has climbed to $1.9B, up 90% since March, with rising on-chain activity and futures interest. These metrics suggest renewed confidence from larger market players. Current forecasts place AVAX between $21.80 and $23.60 in August, with potential to test $32 later this year. While it’s consolidating now, a push above $25 could open the door for stronger gains. Bitcoin Rewards Give BlockDAG an Edge Hedera’s steady climb above $0.25 and Avalanche’s stability at $22 show both projects are holding strong in the market. Yet neither offers immediate payouts to buyers. BlockDAG does. Its 10 BTC reward pool is open until August 11, giving every BDAG buyer a guaranteed share of Bitcoin based on purchase size. With the coin priced at $0.0016 until launch at $0.05, the upside is paired with instant BTC rewards. All transactions are transparent, on-chain, and already active. For anyone seeking a presale with both growth potential and immediate returns, BlockDAG’s offer is unmatched in the current market. Once the pool closes, the chance to earn Bitcoin before launch will be gone.

The latest milestone comes with a retail optimism, which is overshadowing bearish views. Bullish Hashtags Dominate Social Media Ether is currently trading above $4,200, and this surge has sparked optimism among traders. In fact, social media sentiment shows a strong bullish tilt, with hashtags like #buying, #bought, #bullish, and #higher trending alongside ETH. On the other hand, bearish commentary, including #selling, #sold, #bearish, and #lower, is appearing at roughly half the rate. Crypto analytics platform, Santiment highlighted the growing retail-driven enthusiasm but warned that excessive FOMO could temporarily stall the rally’s momentum if sentiment becomes overly one-sided. Meanwhile, institutional activity has also played a major role in Ethereum’s latest climb. Since July 10, over 1.035 million ETH worth approximately $4.17 billion have been accumulated by unidentified whales or institutions, according to pseudonymous blockchain analyst EmberCN. The purchases were made via exchanges and institutional platforms, and coincided with a 45% price surge from $2,600 to $4,000. Most holdings are believed to belong to institutions or US-listed firms with ETH reserves, excluding the known SBET address. The average acquisition price during this period was about $3,546, signaling large-scale strategic positioning. Beyond market mood and accumulation, the altcoin has broken a historical supply record. Another Milestone For Ethereum As of August 9th, Ethereum’s circulating supply has reached a record 121 million ETH, as per network data shared by CryptoQuant. The milestone comes nearly three years after the network hit 120 million ETH on August 22, 2022, following a slow but consistent increase. Ethereum currently issues around 2,500 to 3,000 ETH daily. While new ETH is minted daily, staking continues to play a significant role in shaping net supply growth. Every ETH locked in staking contracts is temporarily effectively removed from circulation, which offsets a portion of new issuance and acts as a check on inflation. In total, Ethereum has minted approximately 157.18 million ETH to date. This figure is achieved after combining the 121 million in circulation and over 36.18 million locked in staking. The dual mechanism of issuance and staking-driven absorption creates a balance in the network’s monetary base. Although the deflationary narrative has softened for now, the long-term price impact will hinge on whether network activity can justify the growing supply. If demand lags, inflationary pressure could weigh on valuation; if it matches or exceeds supply growth, the expansion may support continued price stability or appreciation.

Several new reports point to growing optimism tied to potential ETF approval, increased institutional adoption, and favorable technical patterns forming across multiple timeframes. Bitget’s research division believes spot XRP ETF approval could unlock a powerful wave of inflows – potentially $4–8 billion -with the third quarter of 2025 cited as a likely timeframe for regulatory clarity. Meanwhile, short-term projections from traders like Peter Brandt suggest XRP could rally nearly 60% in the coming months, pushing toward $4.47 if current momentum holds. Against this backdrop, analysts are also identifying under-the-radar altcoins that could outperform top-tier tokens like XRP – one such project now gaining traction is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which some say is tracking toward even larger upside . Technical targets support XRP’s bullish outlook XRP recently broke through the critical $3.28 resistance level – corresponding with the 1.618 Fibonacci extension. If bullish sentiment continues, the next logical technical target is around $5.13 , tied to the 2.618 extension. Machine-learning models factoring in both momentum and Fibonacci zones suggest a ceiling as high as $5.50 , provided XRP breaks above $3.60 and legal conditions remain favorable.Still, risks remain. XRP’s future trajectory depends heavily on a successful resolution to its long-running SEC battle and whether regulators approve an ETF. Without those catalysts, XRP may remain range-bound – a reality prompting some investors to rotate into earlier-stage tokens with higher upside. Analysts forecast 20x for early-stage project One such early-stage token gaining serious attention is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has just achieved a major community milestone : daily active engagement has far exceeded expectations, signaling surging traction ahead of exchange listings. Riding the energy of the altcoin season but backed by structured utility, the project has captured a rapidly growing user base and now stands out among altcoins poised for explosive movement. Leading market analysts have begun projecting that MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver up to 20x gains in the coming months, citing its viral community momentum, early demand, and the repeatable patterns seen in other breakout tokens like SHIBand DOGE. Importantly, these forecasts are grounded not just in hype, but in observed wallet activity, early accumulation from large holders , and rounds that have sold out faster than expected. For traders scanning the horizon for the next high-momentum breakout , MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly climbing to the top of watchlists. Market rotation favors high-upside altcoins with breakout narratives With top-tier assets like XRP and Ethereum entering deeper accumulation ranges, more traders are reallocating capital to early-stage plays with asymmetrical upside. This shift in strategy aligns with prior cycles where newer tokens vastly outperformed blue chips during the early phases of a bull run. In that light, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s rapid growth and active community engagement make it an attractive option for those willing to enter before broader awareness takes hold.That said, XRP remains fundamentally strong. Its payments infrastructure, institutional use cases, and ETF potential keep it in the spotlight. But in terms of raw percentage return, emerging tokens are really hard to ignore. Conclusion: XRP eyes $5, but MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver 20x returns first XRP’s climb toward $5 hinges on legal clarity and ETF approval – both within reach but not guaranteed. As investors await the next move, some are turning toward projects with higher ROI potential. With daily engagement at record highs and 20x returns predicted by analysts , MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a bold but strategic choice for early movers eyeing the next altcoin cycle.

This breakdown was the end of a major market battle. Here’s our analysis of the lead-up . Technical Levels Under Pressure According to Dan Gambardello, Bitcoin dominance recently fell under the 60% psychological barrier and dipped below the green moving average support. It now tests the blue moving average near 59%. The last time this happened was in November 2024, which led to a brief altcoin surge before Bitcoin regained control.

The move follows a clean bounce off the daily demand area around $3.00–$3.10, with spot netflow data showing $2.23M in outflows on August 9, suggesting accumulation by long-term holders.

Appointed in December 2024 by the president to lead the administration’s key crypto advisory group, Hines has played a significant role in shaping the Council’s policy direction over the past eight months. Before joining the Trump administration, Hines worked as a partner at a growth equity firm, bringing a strong investment and strategic background to his position in the White House. While leaving his full-time post, he will remain involved in government as a special employee, collaborating with entrepreneur and investor David Sacks on artificial intelligence initiatives. In his statement, Hines expressed gratitude to the crypto community for its support during his tenure and highlighted the importance of continued dialogue between policymakers and the digital asset industry . His departure marks a notable leadership change in the administration’s crypto policy team, with his deputy, Patrick Witt, expected to assume the role of executive director. Market participants and industry leaders will now be watching closely to see how this transition impacts the White House’s stance on cryptocurrency regulation and innovation in the coming months. Leadership Transition At The White House Crypto Council Hines issued a heartfelt statement marking the end of his tenure. “Serving in President Trump’s administration and working alongside our brilliant AI & Crypto Czar David Sacks as Executive Director of the White House Crypto Council has been the honor of a lifetime,” Hines stated . Hines’ departure comes after nearly eight months of leading the Council, during which he played a central role in advancing policy discussions around blockchain innovation, market structure, and digital asset adoption. His leadership helped foster collaboration between regulators, industry stakeholders, and policymakers, cementing the Council’s influence in shaping the administration’s crypto strategy. According to crypto journalist Eleanor Terret, Patrick Witt — who currently serves as Executive Director of the President’s Council of Advisors for Digital Assets and Acting Director of the Department of Defense Office of Strategic Capital — is expected to succeed Hines in the role. Witt’s appointment would signal continuity in the Council’s direction while potentially introducing new strategic priorities. The leadership transition marks a pivotal moment for US crypto policy. As regulatory frameworks evolve and market adoption accelerates, the incoming leadership will face the challenge of balancing innovation with oversight. Industry participants will be watching closely to see whether Witt continues Hines’ pro-growth stance and maintains the administration’s stated goal of making the United States the global leader in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Total Crypto Market Nears All-Time High The total cryptocurrency market cap is showing strong bullish momentum, currently sitting at $3.87 trillion and edging closer to a potential new all-time high (ATH) near the $4 trillion mark. Price action has been consolidating in a tight range just below this key psychological level, suggesting market participants are preparing for a breakout. The chart shows a clear uptrend supported by the 50-day simple moving average (SMA), which continues to act as dynamic support. Both the 100-day and 200-day SMAs are sloping upward, reinforcing the longer-term bullish structure. After a period of sideways trading earlier in the year, the market cap has recovered sharply, with buying volume increasing in recent weeks. A breakout above the current resistance zone would mark a historic milestone for the crypto market, potentially opening the door for an accelerated rally as investor sentiment strengthens. This bullish setup is further fueled by strong performance from Bitcoin, Ethereum, and select altcoins, alongside rising institutional interest and regulatory clarity in major markets.

Traditional sportsbooks are being matched and often outperformed by agile, crypto-first platforms that provide instant withdrawals, no KYC signups, and bonus offers rarely seen in the conventional market. From UFC and football to cricket and live in-play betting, the top bitcoin sports betting websites now deliver a smooth, fully integrated Web3 experience. These platforms combine technical efficiency with engaging features that keep users active and satisfied. Our review of the leading crypto and Bitcoin sportsbooks of 2025 considered payment speed, betting market depth, bonus value, and overall usability. One platform rises above the rest in this year’s rankings: Spartans , a high-performance betting site redefining decentralized wagering. 1. Spartans: Sets the Standard for Speed and Global Access Spartans has quickly risen to the forefront of the top bitcoin sports betting websites by delivering what many platforms only promise: unmatched speed and accessibility.

It blends a full sportsbook with a feature-rich casino, offering everything from pre-match wagers to live betting on major sports. Unique alt-lines, extensive props, and generous loyalty perks such as rakeback and daily spins keep players coming back. While it currently lacks FIAT onboarding and a standalone mobile app, its browser version is smooth and fast. The 150% welcome bonus and tiered VIP program make it especially attractive to crypto whales and long-term bettors. Even without live streaming, real-time stat visualizers and robust crypto tools ensure an engaging experience. 3. Cloudbet: Retains Prestige with High Limits and Proven Trust Cloudbet remains a leader among the top bitcoin sports betting websites, earning loyalty since its 2013 launch. It delivers sharp odds, high limits, and live streaming for sports like football, basketball, tennis, and esports.

The platform supports BTC and various altcoins, pairing its sleek interface with a fast real-time betting engine designed for today’s digital-native bettors. Its promotions include first deposit matches and recurring tournaments that keep competition fierce. While it does not yet match the extensive features of Spartans or Stake, Thunderpick’s sharp focus on esports and responsive customer service are building a loyal following. For players who prioritize speed, niche markets, and crypto flexibility, Thunderpick is an emerging contender worth watching. Key Takeaways The online betting industry is changing fast, and crypto is driving that transformation.

Starting with just $2,900, they turned it into nearly $3.8 million in just three and a half months – thanks to one token: TROLL. Meme coins like TROLL are known for their explosive volatility, but this case shows just how wild the gains can get when timing, hype, and strategy align. While most of the market has been watching blue-chip altcoins and Bitcoin’s slow grind, stories like this are reminding investors where some of the biggest risks – and biggest rewards – still lie. As this plays out, new low-cap projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are getting more attention from early-stage investors looking for similar breakout potential before listings and mass adoption kick in. The Trade That Shocked Solana According to blockchain data from Solscan, frostx.sol accumulated 20.91 million TROLL tokens earlier this year. Despite the price of TROLL being under a penny at the time, it’s now trading at around $0.16, thanks to a series of powerful catalysts. The trader has sold just 2.55 million tokens so far, realizing $50,700, but continues to hold more than 18 million TROLL, currently valued at $3.73 million. The coin has skyrocketed by 305% in the last 7 days alone, and it’s still gaining momentum. The reason? Smart promotion, strategic timing, and community hype. MAGACOIN FINANCE Price Rising Again As retail investors race to discover the next meme coin rocket, MAGACOIN FINANCE is starting to stand out for its sustained growth and serious community traction. The project’s last presale stage sold out in record time, and the current round is filling up just as fast. Analysts are pointing to its unique combination of early-investor benefits , exchange-ready momentum, and long-term ecosystem plans. With prices already climbing again, some say this could be the next big move for those who missed out on TROLL. Early backers are targeting up to 31x returns , based on current entry prices and projections once it hits major listings. How TROLL Went Viral TROLL’s rise isn’t just a fluke – it’s a masterclass in memecoin marketing. Much of its success can be credited to Pump.fun, a launchpad known for surfacing viral tokens on Solana. Recently, TROLL was granted the highly sought-after Community Takeover (CTO) status by the platform, propelling it into the spotlight. This status unlocks perks like curated social media campaigns, revenue-sharing models, and top billing in promotional spots. In tandem with this exposure, a listing on KuCoin gave TROLL additional legitimacy. Although most of the trading is still happening on decentralized exchanges like PumpSwap and Meteora, the listing signaled a new phase of adoption. The Future of Meme Coin Gains This isn’t the first time we’ve seen a small investment flip into millions—but it’s a reminder that the meme coin cycle is still alive and well. And in crypto, stories like this are more than just entertainment – they influence behavior. Traders are hunting for the next undervalued gem, and platforms that offer early access to such tokens are gaining rapid traction. The question now: can lightning strike twice? Conclusion The jaw-dropping TROLL trade shows what’s possible in the crypto market when risk meets perfect timing. As TROLL’s surge continues to draw headlines, smart investors are already eyeing MAGACOIN FINANCE as the next major breakout . With a new round open and price climbing, it might be the next big name in the meme coin game.

He said the couple, who he called “very average minds,” had beaten “thousands” of professional investors and hedge fund managers. Trump claimed it was all done through “inside information” and questioned why no investigation had been launched. He also reminded followers that Nancy impeached him twice “on no grounds” and lost. Trump’s attack came a few days after he directed sharp criticism at Senator Josh Hawley over his Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Securities and Investments (PELOSI) Act. The bill passed the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in an 8–7 vote last Wednesday, with Hawley siding with every Democrat. Trump accused Hawley of helping Democrats “target” him and described the senator as a “pawn” despite having supported his elections twice. “I don’t think real Republicans want to see their President, who has had unprecedented success, targeted because of the whims of a second-tier senator named Josh Hawley,” Trump wrote. Hawley clashes with Republicans during committee vote The PELOSI Act would bar members of Congress from owning or trading individual stocks. It also covers the president and vice president, but with a phase-in period ensuring Trump and Vice President JD Vance would not be directly affected. The language didn’t stop Trump from questioning Hawley’s motives. He said the bill was “great” for Nancy and Paul but “so bad” for the country, and wondered why Hawley would back something Nancy “is in absolute love with.” During the committee hearing earlier that day, Hawley faced pushback from Senator Rick Scott, a close Trump ally and the wealthiest member of the Senate. Scott argued it was wrong to “attack people because they make money,” but agreed Congress should not be trading stocks. He said Hawley’s bill was “way different” and raised concerns about how to handle illiquid assets under the proposal. Hawley reminded Scott that he had supported the same provision last year. Committee Chairman Rand Paul also opposed moving the legislation forward, but Hawley still advanced it. Trump criticized Hawley for siding with Democrats to block a review into Nancy’s stock trading history over the last 25 years, a review supported by Scott and most other Republicans. Trump calls for Pelosi investigation, Hawley backs prosecution Speaking to reporters hours before his Truth Social post, Trump said he liked the idea of a trading ban “conceptually” but would need to review the details. He said Nancy “became rich by having inside information” and “made a fortune with her husband,” calling it “disgraceful.” He added, “What I do think is Nancy Pelosi should be investigated.” Paul has made millions over decades as a venture capitalist, building an estimated net worth of $262 million with Nancy, according to Quiver Quantitative. Critics, especially Republicans, have argued his trades present a conflict of interest given Nancy’s long-time influence in Congress. Hawley later told Fox News that Nancy “should not just be investigated, but prosecuted,” and said it “needs to be illegal” to profit from trading on nonpublic information.

Bitcoin HYPER has drawn attention through forecasts tied to potential price appreciation. Meanwhile, MAXI Doge has gained early support thanks to impressive presale results and ambitious high-leverage trading plans. By contrast, BlockDAG’s presale takes a more interactive approach. It simulates a live exchange environment where participants can place simulated trades, watch price movements in real time, and analyze order book depth. This hands-on experience, paired with substantial fundraising and a limited-time pricing window, gives BlockDAG (BDAG) a distinctive edge. It offers early access along with valuable market exposure ahead of its official listing. Bitcoin HYPER Price Outlook Reflects Growth Potential Bitcoin HYPER is gaining interest with an entry price around $0.0125 and a planned listing near $0.013. Market projections indicate that, if conditions such as strong exchange listings and sustained Bitcoin momentum hold, the token could reach $0.20 by year-end, representing a potential 16 times gain from listing. A more cautious estimate places the price between $0.03 and $0.04. The Bitcoin HYPER price prediction depends on factors like listing speed, liquidity availability, and Bitcoin’s broader market performance. Some analysts anticipate Bitcoin reaching $150,000 to $200,000 in 2025, which could boost demand for HYPER as a leveraged play. MAXI Doge Rally Potential Based on Market Execution MAXI Doge has attracted attention by raising $350,000 during its first presale week, setting the stage for a possible price rally. With a presale price near $0.00025, projections suggest that, depending on exchange listings and liquidity, MAXI could trade between $0.0003 and $0.0012 in 2025. The project’s main appeal lies in its goal to introduce up to 1,000 times leverage trading, which could attract traders looking for high-risk, high-reward exposure. This also introduces greater volatility, making price movements more significant. The success of the rally will depend on exchange onboarding, trading pair depth, and sustained trading volume. BlockDAG Presale Offers a Real-Time Trading Experience Before Launch BlockDAG’s presale is reshaping how early-stage crypto participation feels by creating an experience that closely mimics a live exchange. Instead of a traditional static buy-and-hold presale, participants can engage with a trading simulator that allows them to place simulated orders, track price movements as they happen, and observe the depth of the order book. This interactive format gives buyers a practical understanding of how the token may perform once it lists. The scale of the presale reinforces this dynamic market environment. BlockDAG has raised $367 million to date and sold over 24.9 billion coins. Currently in batch 29 at $0.0276, the presale offers an impressive 2,660% return from the first batch. At the same time, a limited-time opportunity lets new participants acquire coins at just $0.0016, greatly increasing the potential upside for those entering now. This model merges educational and strategic benefits with strong financial incentives. Buyers gain firsthand exposure to market demand effects on price while experiencing simulated trading conditions before the token hits major exchanges. This hands-on engagement fosters a deeper connection and confidence among early participants. By combining interactive trading features with robust presale momentum, BlockDAG sets a new benchmark for early crypto projects. It offers a live market feel well ahead of launch, ensuring buyers enter with both insight and significant value on their side. This positions BlockDAG as one of the most engaging opportunities in the crypto space today. Key Insights Current presales each bring unique advantages to the table. Bitcoin HYPER’s outlook is closely tied to Bitcoin’s overall market trends, while MAXI Doge attracts attention with its high-leverage trading concept and early funding momentum. BlockDAG stands apart by providing an interactive presale experience that simulates live market conditions. Participants can place simulated trades, monitor real-time price changes, and explore order book depth to gain valuable insight before the token officially lists. Supported by significant fundraising and a limited-time pricing offer, BlockDAG combines engagement with strong potential returns at launch.

Chumba Casino is pulling services from states like New Jersey after stricter gambling rules impacted its dual-currency setup. At the same time, PokerStars is turning toward live casino games and tournament series, shifting its product scope rather than expanding access. While both brands pivot in different directions, another platform is stepping forward with a stronger model. Spartans is gaining recognition as a top-tier betting site in 2025, thanks to its simple 35x wagering structure, instant crypto withdrawals, and affiliate payouts with no hidden limits. No geo-restrictions. No promo confusion. No holding periods. Instead of scrambling to keep pace with changing laws, Spartans are building a cleaner, more rewarding experience: for players, promoters, and anyone cashing out. Chumba’s State Exit Opens the Door Chumba Casino is stepping back from several U.S. states, including New Jersey, as more laws target the dual-currency system used by sweepstakes casinos. Starting July 29, users in New Jersey can no longer collect new Sweeps Coins, and withdrawals will stop by late September. Other states; like Montana, Connecticut, and New York, have already enforced similar rules, making Sweeps Coins unavailable in ten regions so far. Gold Coins are still available for play, but they can’t be redeemed for real rewards. That shift has disappointed users who valued Chumba for its unique earning model. Without the chance to cash out, Gold Coins feel more like a demo mode than a real-money option. The broader picture isn’t encouraging. With more state-level bans tightening, Chumba’s model seems increasingly unstable. For those looking for fast access, real rewards, and low-risk betting, the uncertainty around Chumba makes way for newer, more direct platforms to rise. PokerStars Leans Into Live Dealer Focus PokerStars is adapting too, but in a more focused way. While the WCOOP series still draws poker fans, the platform is shifting toward live casino content through a renewed partnership with Evolution. This move adds popular live dealer games like Lightning Roulette, Crazy Time, and Craps to its offerings across Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Ontario. This helps PokerStars strengthen its live presence, but it also signals a narrow focus. The platform remains centered on poker events and table games, with little flexibility for crypto-based betting or broader sportsbook integration. It’s still a destination for tournament play, but not much beyond that. There’s no doubt that PokerStars holds weight in the poker world. But for casual bettors looking for variety, speed, and wider betting options, the experience still feels somewhat limited. Live dealer titles are a strong addition, but the site’s broader features fall short of delivering daily, all-around betting value. Spartans Delivers What Bettors Actually Want In contrast to platforms adjusting under pressure, Spartans is setting a new benchmark. It gives users a 300% bonus with a clear 35x wagering requirement, valid for 7 days, and the terms are the same for everyone, no region-specific conditions, no loopholes. Crypto bettors benefit even more. Payouts via BTC, ETH, and USDT are processed on the spot. There’s no extra waiting period or hidden verification steps. The platform is built entirely around crypto, so there’s no fiat drama or conversion delays. It’s fast, and it works. Spartans’ affiliate model follows the same logic. Partners can pick from CPA, Hybrid, or Rev Share setups, with straightforward terms and no confusing performance clauses. There are no surprises, just real payouts for actual signups. Along with 5,963 games from 43 studios, a live sportsbook with combo bet options and stat-driven betting, and a Lamborghini giveaway tied to user activity, Spartans gives both players and affiliates the tools they want. No fluff, no confusion, just smooth, reliable betting. Spartans Stands Out in a Shifting Market Chumba’s partial withdrawal and PokerStars’ narrowed approach highlight the changing landscape of online betting. Spartans, meanwhile, is growing by delivering exactly what today’s users expect: fast payouts, real value, and easy terms. There are no legal grey areas to wait out. No limited access due to geography or short-lived tournament hype. Spartans is running daily with full features, offering something steady for players and profitable for affiliates. The platform strips away the clutter and makes room for usability, rewards, and clarity. In a space where most brands are still trying to adapt, Spartans have already arrived. Whether someone’s in it to play, promote, or just cash out faster; Spartans offer the better route.

Dogecoin Turns Bullish & Ethereum Targets $4K",https://thecoinrise.com/cold-wallets-4900-roi-potential-shakes-the-market-dogecoin-turns-bullish-ethereum-targets-4k/,"In 2025, crypto users are shifting their attention from trend-driven assets to platforms that offer real-world usage. While Ethereum remains firm near crucial price zones and Dogecoin pushes to regain positive momentum, users are now leaning toward projects delivering genuine functionality. Cold Wallet stands out in this changing environment. Featuring cashback functionality, strong presale traction, and a forecasted 4,900% return, it is quickly emerging as the best-performing crypto today. Unlike older assets that depend on market trends and hype waves, Cold Wallet provides direct benefits with every interaction. Swaps, bridges, and onboarding actions reward users through CWT, a coin created for practical returns and consistent usage. While Dogecoin price forecast boosts short-term excitement and Ethereum price analysis fuels strategic long-term plans, Cold Wallet effectively brings together high return potential with day-to-day value. Dogecoin Price Forecast Sees Rally Potential Amid Sentiment Shifts After a long phase of sideways movement, Dogecoin is once again flashing signs of strength. Recent Dogecoin price forecast discussions highlight a climb to $0.36 if the coin holds above the $0.243 resistance level. Analysts credit this setup to improving meme coin sentiment, rising trading activity, and a resurgence of community attention. Some speculative models even suggest a surge to $2 in the event of market-wide enthusiasm. Still, there are caution flags. Dogecoin’s movements often follow the pulse of social hype rather than any consistent growth or tech updates. While this offers quick gains to short-term traders, those seeking practical usage continue to question DOGE’s future. Its long-term success hinges almost entirely on external trends and viral triggers. This makes DOGE’s breakout case unstable. Though a rally is possible, the risk remains elevated. For users looking for daily value and more stable gains, Cold Wallet is drawing attention as the best-performing crypto today, rooted not in memes but in dependable features. Ethereum Price Analysis Targets $4K Yet Faces Resistance Headwinds Ethereum continues to hold its place as a critical digital asset, with Ethereum price analysis showing another test of the $4,000 level. Despite repeated rejections near this point, ETH continues to build pressure near the resistance line. A breakout could push the price toward $4,300 or $4,500, supported by buzz around ETFs, large-scale capital inflow, and L2 network upgrades. Ethereum’s foundation remains strong. It leads the charge in DeFi and smart contract sectors, with on-chain growth visible in total value locked and rollup activity. Analysts largely agree that ETH remains a solid asset heading into the next market wave. However, Ethereum’s gains appear more controlled. Most projections offer a 2x or 3x return from here, not insignificant, but modest. In contrast, Cold Wallet is trading at under one cent and projects a 50x return, presenting a quicker route to larger gains. As performance is now measured not just in hype but in function, Cold Wallet is carving out its place as the best-performing crypto today. Cold Wallet: Utility-Powered Rewards System Drives 50x Potential Cold Wallet goes beyond traditional storage; it is designed to reward usage. At its center is the CWT coin, fueling a reward-first design that gives cashback for on-chain actions. When users pay gas fees, part of that cost comes back in CWT. Higher CWT holdings unlock greater returns, with top-tier users able to reclaim up to 100%. But it’s not just gas rewards. Users who swap through the wallet earn CWT too. The system rewards those who hold more with increased returns. Cashback also applies to bridging funds and converting between crypto and fiat. What’s usually an expense becomes a reward, making every action inside Cold Wallet an earning opportunity. These rewards aren’t temporary perks; they’re built into the system. A set reserve of tokens backs this feature, managed through a halving model and designed for longevity. A four-level tiering system ensures everyone has access to benefits while maintaining balance and token value. Cold Wallet is currently in Stage 17 of its presale, with the coin priced at $0.00998. The campaign has already raised over $5.8 million, and its expected launch price of $0.3517 hints at a possible 4,900% increase, translating to a 50x boost for those entering now. With active cashback, user-centric rewards, and real utility, Cold Wallet is clearly more than just the best-performing crypto today; it’s becoming one of the standout projects across the market. Final Thoughts Dogecoin’s possible breakout is linked to crowd sentiment and can shift easily. Ethereum’s path suggests steady growth, but with limited explosive potential. Cold Wallet, on the other hand, gives users daily reasons to stay involved, delivering functional rewards and massive ROI potential. Having crossed $5.8 million in funds raised, with features that offer paybacks on every crypto action and a listing price far above its current value, Cold Wallet fills the gap left by meme coins and older networks. It’s not just about paper value; it’s reshaping the meaning of crypto performance. So, for those wondering which is the best-performing crypto today , the answer lies not in trends but in utility. Cold Wallet shows that when a platform has purpose, the returns follow.

Both networks have unique strengths—Ethereum with its vast developer ecosystem and upcoming upgrades, and Solana with its lightning-fast transactions and growing adoption. But which one offers better upside this summer? As AI platforms sharpen their forecasts, many investors are beginning to expand their radar beyond just ETH and SOL. One emerging name being consistently mentioned in analyst circles is MAGACOIN FINANCE, a presale altcoin that’s rapidly gaining ground for long-term investors seeking early-stage exposure to the next big gainer. Ethereum’s Fundamentals Still Solid Ethereum remains the most dominant smart contract platform, and the upcoming Fusaka hard fork in November is expected to drive renewed interest. With features like PeerDAS and EIP-7934, Ethereum aims to further reduce Layer-2 fees and improve data availability—potentially attracting more dApps and institutional users. Historically, similar upgrades like the Merge in 2022 led to significant price appreciation, and bulls are expecting the same again. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Momentum with Long-Term Investors While blue chips like Ethereum and Solana remain relevant, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing attention for its explosive potential, with crypto experts predicting long-term gains that could outpace both ETH and SOL. The project has secured endorsements from top influencers and continues to trend on platforms like X and Telegram. Its early-stages have already hit multiple milestones, and momentum is building fast. With early-stage prices still available, strategic buyers are eyeing this as one of the most promising altcoin entries of the year. Solana’s Performance and Real-World Adoption Solana, meanwhile, is thriving thanks to real-world use cases. Public companies are turning to Solana for staking rewards and blockchain infrastructure. With daily yields approaching 8% for validators and the successful launch of its Seeker smartphone, Solana is proving it’s more than just hype. This kind of real-world traction gives SOL a strong foundation heading into Q3 and Q4 of 2025. Conclusion Both Ethereum and Solana are poised for a strong summer, backed by institutional adoption, technical innovation, and community support. But for investors willing to take a strategic early position, MAGACOIN FINANCE may offer the biggest upside of all, especially as long-term predictions highlight its breakout potential.

While the crypto market remains unpredictable, those who identified breakout projects early in the past cycles saw life-changing returns. With the rise of institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and emerging sectors like AI and modular blockchains, the stage is set for a new generation of crypto leaders. While many will come and go, a handful of projects show the right mix of utility, innovation, and momentum to deliver massive potential by the end of the decade. Among these rising stars, MAGACOIN FINANCE has also drawn attention as a bold newcomer, with market watchers comparing its trajectory to some of the most explosive altcoins in history. Lets have a look at five cryptocurrencies that experts say could surge more than 20x by 2030, based on current momentum and forward-looking potential. 1. XRP XRP continues to be one of the most polarizing but promising cryptocurrencies on the market. Its main value proposition – enabling fast, low-cost cross-border payments – remains a major use case in the evolving financial system. What Could Drive Growth by 2030: Regulatory Win: The long-awaited conclusion of Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC could unleash new institutional capital flows into XRP. ODL Expansion: Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) services could become essential for global finance, positioning XRP as a bridge asset between major fiat currencies. Tokenized Finance Boom: As tokenized assets gain ground, XRP’s speed and low fees may make it a top pick for RWA transfers. Some conservative models place XRP in the $5–$10 range by 2030, but a scenario involving full institutional adoption and widespread utility could push it far beyond those levels. 2. Cardano Built on peer-reviewed research and a strong academic foundation, Cardano has steadily grown into one of the most respected Layer 1 platforms. Key Factors for Long-Term Potential: Hydra Scaling : Hydra, Cardano’s Layer 2 solution, aims to drastically improve throughput – essential for large-scale dApp deployment. Use Cases in Developing Nations: Cardano’s partnerships in Africa and other emerging markets could lead to real-world adoption across education, identity, and finance. DeFi and Governance Expansion: A robust ecosystem of DeFi projects and a community-driven governance model position ADA for steady long-term value growth. If Cardano captures just a fraction of global enterprise and government applications, ADA’s price could surge well past its previous highs – and potentially achieve the 20x target. 3. Celestia Celestia is pioneering a new way to build blockchains through its modular architecture, and it’s already become a favorite among developers looking to launch rollup-based systems. Why It’s a Game-Changer: Modular Design: Separating consensus from execution allows developers to build faster, cheaper, and more flexible chains. Rollup Ecosystem: As Ethereum and other blockchains move toward rollup-centric models, Celestia could become a foundational layer for data availability. Early Mover Advantage: Being one of the first major players in the modular blockchain space gives Celestia a potential lead similar to Ethereum’s early dominance. With the entire industry leaning toward modular scaling, TIA could be one of the few infrastructure tokens to achieve a 20x+ return, especially if it becomes the default data layer for rollups and app chains. 4. MAGACOIN FINANCE MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly establishing itself as one of the most promising altcoins for forward-looking investors. With growing hype and multiple sell-out rounds, it’s drawing comparisons to early-stage breakout stars like SHIBA INU and DOGECOIN – but with a far more structured ecosystem behind it. Unlike typical meme coins, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building long-term utility and tokenomics aimed at rewarding early holders. Analysts now project up to a 12,700% return for early MAGACOIN investors as the next bull cycle picks up momentum. The project’s strong presale performance, continuous development, and viral growth on social media suggest it’s far from a short-term trend. If MAGACOIN hits centralized exchanges at the right time and continues building its ecosystem, it could outpace traditional large caps like XRP and SOL – giving early participants a rare opportunity to get in before the wider crypto market catches on. 5. Virtuals Protocol As artificial intelligence continues to dominate tech headlines, Virtuals Protocol is emerging as a key intersection point between AI and blockchain. What Makes It Stand Out: AI Agent Platform: Virtuals allows developers to build and monetize AI agents on-chain – one of the most exciting new frontiers in crypto. Ethereum Layer-2 : Built on Base, it benefits from Ethereum’s security while offering cheaper, faster transactions. Rapid Ecosystem Expansion : If it can become the leading AI agent platform in crypto, VRS could ride both the AI and Web3 waves simultaneously. While still early-stage, the protocol’s vision and positioning have drawn attention from developers and early investors alike. If AI becomes as integral to crypto as many predict, Virtuals Protocol could easily become a 20x winner by the end of the decade. Conclusion The path to 2030 will be filled with volatility, but also opportunity. From legacy projects like XRP and Cardano to newer infrastructure plays like Celestia and Virtuals Protocol, the crypto space is rich with long-term potential. And for those seeking early exposure to a rapidly growing ecosystem, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out with its ambitious vision and projected 1 2,700% upside , making it a serious contender in the race to define the next generation of altcoins.

Both parties have filed to dismiss their appeals , closing this chapter of regulatory uncertainty. While the outcome removes a significant obstacle for market sentiment, it does not, according to some experts, guarantee meaningful price appreciation for XRP in the near term. Jake Claver, a financial expert and CEO of Digital Ascension Group , has suggested that the real driver of XRP’s next major move will not be its legal clarity. “XRP’s real move will come from a supply shock during a global liquidity crisis,” he stated, adding that much of the current price activity is speculation and institutional positioning ahead of possible spot ETF products . I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. If the Ripple case has anything to do with XRP price appreciation… it would be a security of Ripple.. XRPs real move will come from a supply shock during a global liquidity crisis. Until then it’s all speculation and institutional… — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) August 8, 2025 Understanding the Supply Shock A supply shock occurs when the amount of XRP available for trading in the open market declines sharply. This can happen if large holders move significant quantities off exchanges into cold storage, institutions accumulate and hold long-term positions, or distribution schedules are slowed. When available liquidity is tight, buyers have fewer options, and even moderate purchasing activity can push prices upward more quickly. In practical terms, a genuine supply shock can alter market behavior by reducing depth in the order books, widening spreads, and increasing slippage. With fewer tokens available, the cost of acquiring XRP at scale rises sharply, making upward moves more pronounced and difficult to reverse until new liquidity enters the market. The Role of a Global Liquidity Crisis While Claver identifies the supply shock as the key catalyst, he also connects it to the possibility of a global liquidity crisis . Such a crisis involves a sharp reduction in available capital and credit across financial markets. With those conditions, XRP could face heightened demand at precisely the moment the circulating supply is constrained. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This combination can create a price environment where even modest inflows have an outsized effect. The global liquidity crisis could amplify the consequences of reduced availability, helping XRP to grow rapidly. Why Market Structure Matters More Than Sentiment Claver’s argument rests on the idea that market mechanics, rather than headlines, will drive the most significant moves. XRP rallied from around $3 to $3.38 following the end of the lawsuit, but its inability to reclaim its all-time high of $3.65 following such monumental news adds credence to Claver’s belief. While ending the legal battle may not cause the surge many market participants want, the positive price impact from a supply shock and liquidity crisis can be swift and substantial.

49843312,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdags-0-0016-presale-is-live-with-10-btc-prizes-sui-secures-support-link-adds-data-streams-2/,1754806564,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/49843312.jpeg,BlockDAG’s $0.0016 Presale is Live with 10 BTC Prizes: SUI Secures Support & LINK Adds Data Streams!,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdags-0-0016-presale-is-live-with-10-btc-prizes-sui-secures-support-link-adds-data-streams-2/,"Missed the early moves on major players like Sui or Chainlink? That is a question many traders are asking as Sui’s latest changes open new institutional access through AMINA Bank and Chainlink’s Data Streams bring real-time tokenized stock pricing to 37 blockchains. Both projects are making impressive progress and attracting serious attention. The bigger opportunity, however, might be unfolding elsewhere. BlockDAG’s (BDAG) presale is locked at $0.0016, offering a live trading simulation that lets participants see exactly how early buying could play out. With the added draw of a 10 BTC auction and competitive dashboard leaderboards, BlockDAG turns buying into an interactive and rewarding experience. While some watch from the sidelines, others are already simulating their potential gains in real time. Sui Gains Institutional Backing and Developer Momentum Sui is making headlines after Switzerland’s AMINA Bank became the first regulated bank to offer trading and custody for SUI, with staking services on the way. This follows the release of 76.27 million tokens, its largest unlock yet, which pushed the price to the $3.39 to $3.46 range. Despite the dip, July DEX volume exceeded $14 billion, and total value locked stayed between $2 and $2.3 billion. Developer activity is also rising, with 3,000 attending Sui’s Summer 2025 events, a 50% jump from last year. Paired with upgrades like passkey and multisig support, analysts see a rebound toward $4.85 to $5.36 if support holds. Chainlink Pushes Forward with Real-Time Data Streams Chainlink’s new Data Streams feature delivers live pricing for U.S. stocks and ETFs such as SPY, QQQ, and NVDA to 37 blockchains. This allows developers to build tokenized stocks, synthetic ETFs, and advanced DeFi tools with near-instant data. GMX and Kamino are among the first to integrate the service. LINK rose about 4% to $17 after the launch but remains in a $13.5 to $17 range. Breaking $20 could target $31 or even $42 to $44. The upcoming Chainlink Runtime Environment will cut development timelines, boosting its role in bridging traditional finance with blockchain. BlockDAG Lets You See and Simulate Your Potential Gains Many traders have looked back at Bitcoin or Solana charts and wished they had bought earlier. BlockDAG is tapping into that feeling with a live trading dashboard that goes beyond static numbers. At the current $0.0016 price, users can simulate what their holdings could look like if BDAG reaches its planned $0.05 launch value. The platform displays live order book movements, updates wallet balances instantly, and visually maps out potential profit curves. It turns the idea of waiting into something you can see and feel. This approach is backed by real traction. Over 24.9 billion BDAG have been sold, with $367 million already raised. The $0.0016 presale price remains available only until August 11, after which it resets to around $0.00276 and is expected to rise further. That gives current buyers the most upside window of the entire presale. Adding more incentive, BlockDAG is running a 10 BTC auction worth over $1.1 million. Every BDAG purchase before August 11 secures a proportional share of the Bitcoin prize pool, offering an immediate and measurable bonus alongside the long-term growth potential. With its interactive dashboard, live leaderboard rankings, and fast-approaching deadline, BlockDAG is positioning itself as one of the top cryptos to buy now. It allows participants to test strategies, track rewards, and see potential gains before the coin even lists. Final Analysis Sui’s latest changes signal growing institutional confidence, with AMINA Bank offering trading and custody while developers roll out meaningful network upgrades. Chainlink is also stepping up with Data Streams, delivering real-time stock and ETF pricing to 37 blockchains and opening the door for large-scale tokenized finance adoption. BlockDAG brings a different kind of opportunity. Its $0.0016 presale price, live trading simulation, and 10 BTC auction that let participants experience potential gains before launch. This turns the presale into an active, rewarding process. While some watch from the sidelines, others are already simulating profits and securing their share.

This recognition highlights Ripple’s philanthropic initiatives and its growing influence in financial inclusion and blockchain innovation. While XRP’s momentum builds and analysts debate whether it could surpass Ethereum or even challenge Bitcoin’s dominance, a different kind of narrative being led by MAGACOIN FINANCE, a presale token projected to deliver outsized returns, is catching fire. XRP Challenges Ethereum’s #2 Spot In Q2 2025, XRP overtook Ethereum in retail trading revenue on Coinbase, claiming 13% of the platform’s retail transaction income compared to Ethereum’s 12%. Analysts attribute the shift to increased retail demand, renewed institutional interest, and growing speculation around a potential XRP ETF. This isn’t XRP’s first brush with second place. In January 2018, its market cap briefly surpassed Ethereum’s. Now, with XRP liquidity surging and forecasts predicting a 500% price increase to $12.50 by 2028, XRP could surpass ETH once again—especially if Ethereum’s momentum slows. Still, while Ethereum boasts deep developer networks and robust Layer 2 activity, its ETF inflows have recently stalled. That could create a window for XRP to reclaim the #2 spot if current trends hold. Bitcoin Still the Mountain to Climb Despite its gains, XRP faces a steep climb to reach Bitcoin’s throne. As of mid-2025, Bitcoin’s market cap stands above $2 trillion, compared to XRP’s ~$138 billion. To catch up, XRP would need to rally nearly 1,500%—an unlikely feat without major institutional adoption and multiple ETF approvals. While XRP has shown strength in specific markets like India—where it briefly overtook Bitcoin in trading volume—it would take a historic shift in demand to dethrone Bitcoin as the industry’s flagship asset. MAGACOIN FINANCE Enters the Spotlight As XRP eyes Ethereum’s market cap and investors look beyond large-cap tokens, a new contender is rising: MAGACOIN FINANCE . Analysts are calling it one of the most explosive presale opportunities in the current cycle. Strategists predict MAGACOIN could outperform Layer 1 giants like Solana and Cardano, forecasting potential gains of up to 15,000%. The project combines DeFi infrastructure, governance utilities, and staking incentives to offer early participants high-risk, high-reward exposure. Online sentiment is surging. Forums, Telegram groups, and X (formerly Twitter) communities are abuzz with speculation. For investors seeking the next wave of market momentum, MAGACOIN is increasingly seen as a serious bet. Conclusion Ripple’s U.S. recognition and XRP’s shifting position in the market spotlight a maturing crypto landscape. As XRP contends with Ethereum and eyes longer-term moves against Bitcoin, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE offer a compelling alternative path for traders looking to capitalize on market rotation. Whether institutional capital continues to flow into XRP—or diversifies into the next Solana or Cardano—remains to be seen, but the crypto leaderboard is more dynamic than ever because MAGACOIN FINANCE is the clear winner of the market.

Over the past days, bullish momentum has pushed many digital assets higher, with price structures showing clear signs of strength. For many traders, this is the moment they’ve been waiting for—the long-anticipated shift where altcoins outperform Bitcoin and deliver outsized returns. Related Reading: Bitcoin–S&P 500 Correlation Hits 80%, Tying Crypto To Stocks Ethereum’s recent breakout above key resistance levels has added fuel to the narrative, with large-cap and mid-cap altcoins following in its footsteps. The market’s renewed optimism has sparked speculation that the altseason cycle, where capital rotates from Bitcoin into the broader altcoin market, may already be underway. However, not all experts are convinced. Some point to Bitcoin’s continued dominance and the fact that most altcoins remain well below their all-time highs as reasons for caution. Historical altseasons have typically seen aggressive outperformance across the board, something the market has yet to fully confirm. Altseason Still Waiting For Its True Breakout According to top analyst Darkfost, the much-anticipated altseason hasn’t truly begun. By examining a comparative chart of Bitcoin, large caps (top 20), and mid/small caps, Darkfost notes that the current cycle is showing the weakest altcoin performance so far. While altcoins have made notable moves in recent weeks, their gains still pale in comparison to Bitcoin’s dominant run. The last instance that resembled a genuine altseason occurred in early 2024, when altcoins—particularly mid- and small-cap projects—outpaced Bitcoin over a short but intense period. That surge marked a clear capital rotation away from BTC into the broader market, delivering outsized returns for altcoin holders. However, the present market conditions suggest that kind of broad-based outperformance has yet to materialize. Even though Ethereum has broken above multi-year highs and several altcoins are posting impressive gains, the rally appears selective rather than widespread. Large caps are recovering steadily, but mid- and small-cap coins—often the hallmark of an explosive altseason—are still lagging. This disparity suggests that institutional and retail capital remains concentrated in more established assets. For a confirmed altseason, analysts will be watching for a sustained breakout in mid- and small-cap performance relative to BTC. Until that shift occurs, the current market may be better described as a strong altcoin rally within Bitcoin’s dominant phase rather than the start of a full-scale altseason.

This rally brings the market close to retesting its 2025 highs around the $1.6 trillion level, a critical resistance zone that has capped altcoin gains in previous attempts. The chart reveals that the market has been in a sustained uptrend since early 2024, with price action consistently holding above the 50-week moving average (blue line) and maintaining bullish structure. Both the 100-week (green) and 200-week (red) moving averages are trending higher, reinforcing long-term support and signaling healthy market conditions. Related Reading: Bitcoin Futures Bias Turns Neutral As OI Net Position Hits Zero – Details If the breakout occurs, TOTAL2 could target the previous all-time high zone near $1.75–$1.8 trillion, marking a potential acceleration in capital rotation from Bitcoin into altcoins. Conversely, failure to clear this resistance could lead to a short-term pullback toward $1.4 trillion support, which aligns with the 50-week MA. The coming weeks will be crucial for determining whether altseason truly ignites.

Maestro anticipates volumes to keep surging as enterprises continue to stack BTC in their treasuries and more idle coins are activated for yield and further uses. “We’re witnessing the convergence of TradFi and DeFi into a Bitcoin‑denominated capital market,” said Marvin Bertin, Co‑Founder and CEO of Maestro.“For the first time since 2009, the critical pieces for on‑chain financial apps on Bitcoin are in place, spanning exchanges, lending, and stablecoins. Bitcoin is evolving from a static reserve asset into a dynamic, productive financial network.” Staking And Lending With over 68,500 bitcoin in TVL ($7.39 billion), staking has become the most widely used application in BitcoinFi. Re-staking has also been steadily on the rise, with $3.32 billion BTC being re-staked, meaning the niche now secures over $10 billion through yield-bearing protocols. Babylon currently leads in scale ($4.79B), but Solv, Lombard, and CoreDAO are advancing the frontier of liquid staking tokens (LSTs), restaking strategies, and dual-token security models. Bitcoin-native lending is being spearheaded by Liquidium, with over $500M in volume. Source: Maestro Another form of staking gaining traction is dual staking, introduced by CoreDAO, with over $615M of BTC staked. The incentives include block rewards from their native CORE tokens and a share of transaction fees, which are distributed to stakers and validators. A few challenges remain, as many staking returns do not align with treasury rates, with yield and liquidity being dispersed across different chains and protocols. It is to be seen whether the durability of BTC-secured networks can continue to deliver sustainable rewards. Programmability Layers Bitcoin scaling and Layer 2 (L2) layers have $5.52 billion (52,000 coins) in total value locked (TVL), hinting at developer and user demand driven by native smart contracts, yield, and asset allocation, whilst keeping self-custody, and having settlement guarantees. The Stacks layer is leading in growth, more than doubling its TVL for Q2 and adding roughly 2000 BTC. Sidechains still hold most of the asset in BitcoinFi, but the architecture is diversifying, with rollups and execution layers looking promising. Source: Maestro Bitcoin’s legacy constraint is slowly peeling away, as the base layer was never meant for programmability. While Ethereum has over $116 billion in DeFi TVL, BTC-aligned infrastructure remains lagging at just over $5.5B in TVL across scaling layers. However, new sidechains, rollups, and various environments continue to emerge, pushing the largest asset per market cap beyond its passive store-of-value role. Metaprotocols Runes, Ordinals, and BRC-20 tokens accounted for 40.6% of all Bitcoin transactions in the first half of 2025, with BRC-20 volume reaching $128 million. Following a pullback last year, Ordinals experienced a strong recovery, with over 80 million inscriptions by mid-2025, generating 6,940 BTC (~$681M) in fees. Runes are rebounding from a sharp decline in minting and trading volume at the end of 2024. Source: Maestro Stablecoins With $860 million in TVL (over 42% Quarter-over-Quarter), this asset class has come to prevalence within the Bitcoin ecosystem, thanks to maturing L2s and growing demand for native primitives. CDP-based (Collateralized Debt Position) stablecoins, such as Avalon’s USDa ($559M), have seen early traction in BitcoinFi. High-yield stablecoins, such as Hermetica’s 25% APY offering, point towards a demand for capital-generating assets. Source: Maestro A few hurdles remain, with fragmented liquidity (the inability to conclude a transaction with one or more participants due to a lack of clearing arrangements) being one of them, as it limits market depth across chains and L2s. The oracle design remains an issue for CDPs (collateralized debt positions), and composability tradeoffs introduce rigidity between performance and decentralization. Venture Funding After a period of declining interest, BitcoinFi funding has surged to $175 million across 32 rounds in the first half of 2025, with the activities focused not only on infrastructure. In the same half of the year, out of the 32 deals, 20 were targeted on DeFi, apps, and custody. Capital is being shifted towards usability and products, with infrastructure now on the back seat. Source: Maestro The beginning of the year saw leading investment firms, such as Pantera Capital, Founders Fund, and Standard Crypto, among others, validating the niche as a popular frontier in the cryptocurrency universe. These notable deals indicate a potent combination of infrastructure depth and application-layer traction, with investor interest coming from both traditional and crypto-native firms.

It frames XRP dominance against historical peaks and troughs, and identifies Fib retracement thresholds that function as potential resistance and confirmation levels. EGRAG CRYPTO emphasized the significance of dominance in assessing price direction, advising followers to keep a close eye on the dominance chart as a leading indicator for the wider market. Levels to Watch for XRP The chart positions Fib 0.5 at 5.92% as the first material barrier that must be surpassed with confirmation before higher targets become plausible. Beyond that, Fib 0.618 is identified at 8.87%; Fib 0.702 is set at 11.61% and is described as the analyst’s optimal target for this cycle. The analyst also outlined more ambitious thresholds, marking Fib 0.888 at 21.58% and Fib 1 at 31.35% as the ultimate targets for the digital asset. #XRP Dominance: Your Key to Price Discovery! Trust me, you'll want to keep a close eye on the #XRP Dominance Chart, it’s a crucial indicator of our price direction! Key Levels to Watch: Fib 0.5 (5.92%): We need to breach this level with confirmation to unlock the next… pic.twitter.com/nH19n5fQL9 — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) August 9, 2025 Can XRP Reach This Target? Analysts have shared bullish expectations based on technical indicators on XRP’s dominance chart, and EGRAG CRYPTO points to historical data to support his prediction. The chart shows XRP falling in 2017 and testing the shakeout zone before going on a remarkable rally to its previous all-time high. The digital asset tested that zone again in 2024 and has outperformed expectations since then. It reached a multi-year peak of $3.39 in January, and after consolidating for months , resumed its climb, reaching a new all-time high of $3.65 . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP’s Path to 31.35% Dominance According to EGRAG CRYPTO, if dominance clears the 0.5 level with follow-through, the path toward 8.87% and then 11.61% will become clearer. The analyst highlighted 11.61% as a key benchmark, suggesting that failure to reach it means XRP underperformed. Conversely, achieving 21.5% dominance would represent a significant structural improvement. The final target is 31.35% dominance, which matches its performance in 2017 and early 2018. These levels would likely attract renewed liquidity and longer-term capital commitments. Risk management is implicit in the chart’s structure. As XRP grows, resistance levels will become potential supply zones, and the velocity of dominance gains will shape how traders adjust their positions.

The MUTM token price in stage 6 of presale is $0.035. A 14.29% increase to $0.04 will happen at stage 7. E arly investors are going to see a 200% return when the token is on the market. Mutuum Finance has already raised over $14.25 million and onboarded over 15000 investors to date. With Ripple facing more pressure in terms of regulatory headwinds and slowing network adoption, sentiment appears to be readjusting. Early MUTM adoption metrics report growing momentum among institutional pilots and retail clients seeking real-world payment interoperability, a market previously dominated by XRP. XRP Sees August Volatility with Shift in Market Liquidity XRP is trading between $2.94 and $3.06 as August gets underway with mixed sentiment. While the token is still a cross-border settlement asset in the XRP Ledger system, recent market flows see a softening of trading volumes in the face of ongoing regulatory scrutiny and slow rate of adoption. Analysts are monitoring whether the changes indicate a short-term adjustment or a bigger-scale re-ordering of capital within the space as new-gen blockchain projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gain popularity. Mutuum Finance Shines in Presale, Achieves 95.00 Trust Score in Audit Mutuum Finance is showing strength within the DeFi realm. The project is audited and certified by Certik with 95.0/100 trust score. It is giving a secure platform to perform DeFi transactions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is bringing innovative lending attributes together with the potential of an ecosystem having a known route to future DeFi. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also developing an Ethereum, fully collateralized USD-backed stablecoin. It will offer long-term stability, trustworthiness, and liquidity to customers of any kind. Giveaway and $50,000 Bug Bounty to Enhance DeFi Security Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has dropped a $100,000 giveaway . 10 lucky winners will get $10,000 MUTM tokens. The project has also launched a top 50 token holder leaderboard who will get bonus tokens based on their rank. In order to further strengthen its platform, Mutuum Finance has also introduced a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program in collaboration with CertiK. It will pay and reward for each bug at four levels, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low. The Next Generation of DeFi Lending MUTM offers consumers a safe and effective double lending channel. Peer-to-Contract model smart contracts offer intermediary-free lending. Smart contracts are enabled with automatic interest rates to shift in such a manner as to automatically produce high interest rates. Peer-to-Peer infrastructure aids in removing intermediaries and providing lenders and borrowers with instant access to each other. Mutuum Finance has already raised more than $14.25 million and attracted more than 15,000 investors, demonstrating its rapid market penetration. At $0.035 during Phase 6, the token will rise to $0.04 during Phase 7, up 14.29%, providing early investors with potential returns of 200% plus. With a CertiK trust score of 95.0/100 on a secure dual-lending protocol and an upcoming stablecoin pegged to the USD, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is well-positioned to capture capital inflows flowing out of legacy assets like XRP. Investors wishing to earn a profit before the next presale price hike should acquire MUTM tokens as soon as possible.

Through this structure, the company will hold its own WLFI tokens and participate in this new trend in the cryptocurrency market. According to sources familiar with the matter, the target fund size under the deal, which has yet to be finalized, is approximately $1.5 billion. Negotiations with major investors in the technology and crypto sectors are reportedly progressing rapidly. Related News: Historic Moment: A Company Listed in the US for the First Time Announces It Will Purchase a Large Amount of Ripple (XRP) Shares World Liberty's website lists US President Donald Trump as an “honorary co-founder.” Last year, the company announced plans for a crypto lending app and began offering a dollar-pegged stablecoin called USD1. While the WLFI tokens were initially designed as non-transferable governance tokens, they will soon be tradable on the open market. Digital asset treasuries, firms that raise capital to acquire cryptocurrencies, have announced plans to raise approximately $79 billion for Bitcoin purchases alone in 2025.

The big push came from heavy buying into Bitcoin ETFs, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust leading the charge by adding $157.6 million. This kind of strong activity shows growing confidence from institutional investors, sending a clear message that the market is backing Bitcoin’s upward run. A new breakout contender stands at the intersection of surging market interest and meme magic: Bitcoin Penguins (BPENGU). Fresh, quirky, and powered by the latest tech, BPENGU is capturing the imagination of a rapidly growing community eager to leave their mark on the 2025 altcoin narrative. But with time running out on the presale, those who hesitate will almost certainly be left behind. Why the Penguin is crypto’s next power symbol BPENGU isn’t just trading on cute branding, though its signature penguin spirit is endearing enough to fuel headlines and hashtags worldwide. Just like penguins, whose strength comes from moving together, BPENGU’s community, known as the “waddle,” thrives on collective energy, support, and purpose. From day one, the project has been about more than fleeting meme status. Real-world collaborations, dynamic campaigns, and cross-platform brand moments are setting the stage for BPENGU to become a lasting cultural phenomenon in crypto and beyond. The penguin isn’t just a mascot; it’s a symbol of resilience, adaptability, and community-driven momentum. The numbers that drive the hype Behind the charm is a lean, scarcity-driven structure that’s fuelling BPENGU’s momentum. The total supply is fixed at 10 billion tokens, with 55% (5.5 billion) devoted solely to the presale.This means the majority of circulating tokens will go straight into the hands of early supporters. Another 20% is set aside for staking rewards, giving holders the chance to earn without selling, building price stability over time. 10% goes into liquidity to ensure smooth market entry post‑listing, while smaller allocations power community airdrops, charity initiatives, and long-term growth. Right now, that presale is closing in on the final stretch with less than 20 days remaining before the waddle pulls up the ladder. Each of the 15 stages lasts just two days, with prices climbing 5% every step of the way. The earlier you join, the more tokens you can secure for the same investment, simple math that’s making latecomers scramble to get in before the next bump. Countdown to takeoff: Be first or be forgotten This is the final lap. With the presale nearing its end, every day of hesitation could cost you a better entry price, and once the $10M hard cap is hit, the doors close regardless of the calendar. The confirmed September 2, 2025 exchange listing means your tokens will go live almost immediately, with no indefinite waiting or uncertainty. BPENGU isn’t just a coin, it’s a moment. One that will be remembered by the people who acted while the clock was still ticking. History in crypto rewards decisive moves, and this is one of them. There’s no second chance at being first. Secure your part of BPENGU before the presale melts away.

After a powerful run earlier in the year, BTC is now consolidating between $114,000 and $120,000, with falling ETF flows and shrinking spot volume pointing to reduced momentum. But what some see as a pause — others view as a window. According to analysts, Bitcoin’s correction is opening the door for altcoins to take the spotlight, and savvy investors are rotating into assets with stronger near-term upside. Top of the list? XRP, Ethereum, and the surging presale project MAGACOIN FINANCE. Each offers a different kind of opportunity — from infrastructure to utility to asymmetric presale gains — but all three are aligned with capital trends shaping August 2025. Ethereum: Quiet Strength, Long-Term Momentum Ethereum may not be making headlines daily, but beneath the surface, it remains the most important infrastructure play in crypto. With Layer-2 rollups expanding, ETH ETF interest stabilizing, and ongoing deflationary mechanics in place, Ethereum is quietly building toward another major leg up. ETH’s price has held steady despite broader market cooling, and institutional interest hasn’t faded. Analysts view this moment as accumulation territory — with many projecting a breakout above $4,000 once macro conditions shift back in crypto’s favor. For those seeking strong fundamentals, Ethereum remains an anchor. XRP: Legal Clarity Meets Whale Activity XRP has regained momentum thanks to renewed legal clarity, growing institutional partnerships, and aggressive whale accumulation. On-chain data shows significant increases in large wallet holdings, particularly after the token pushed past the $3.60 resistance earlier this summer. With ETF speculation building and Ripple expanding into real-world banking infrastructure, XRP is being framed as a utility-driven altcoin with room to run. Some analysts have forecast a 3x–5x move by the end of 2025 — particularly if more jurisdictions greenlight XRP-based financial products. Its mix of legal momentum and payment-based use cases make it a standout rotation target in this phase. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale Power Play While Ethereum and XRP cater to established capital, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting early investors chasing breakout ROI. This presale token isn’t just hype — it’s double-audited by HashEx and CertiK , features a fixed 170 billion token supply , and operates with zero-tax trading , offering clean tokenomics built for mass adoption. The project is gaining rapid traction across Telegram, X, and top presale dashboards, with inflow momentum outpacing many listed altcoins. What’s driving urgency now is the EXTRA50X bonus code , which gives 50% more tokens to the first 500 buyers in this round — a bonus that could disappear fast as allocation fills. Final Take: Correction Sets the Stage As Bitcoin cools, opportunity heats up elsewhere. Ethereum offers long-term conviction. XRP brings legal momentum and real-world relevance. And MAGACOIN FINANCE delivers rare, early access at a massive upside. With the EXTRA50X code still live, this may be the last moment to enter MAGACOIN before retail demand floods in.

49848842,552503,1754812802,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49848842.jpeg,Vitalik Buterin Regains Billionaire Status As Ethereum Hits Multi-Year Highs,https://bitcoinist.com/vitalik-buterin-regains-billionaire-status-ethereum/,"Ethereum has soared to a multi-year high, touching the $4,330 level — its highest price since November 2021. This milestone not only reinforces ETH’s dominant position in the crypto market but also marks the return of co-founder Vitalik Buterin to billionaire status, with his publicly known wallets now valued above the billion-dollar mark. Since April, Ethereum has delivered a staggering gain of over 200%, outpacing most major cryptocurrencies and reigniting bullish sentiment across the market. Analysts attribute the rally to strong fundamentals, including increasing adoption in decentralized finance (DeFi), the rapid growth of layer-2 scaling solutions, and rising institutional interest. The rally comes amid tightening supply dynamics, with exchange balances dropping to multi-year lows, suggesting that long-term holders and institutional players are accumulating aggressively. On-chain data points to sustained network activity and expanding use cases, adding fuel to the bullish outlook. Many market watchers believe Ethereum is setting up for further gains, potentially challenging its all-time highs in the months ahead. As the ecosystem continues to expand and regulatory clarity improves, ETH appears poised to remain at the center of the next major wave in crypto growth. Buterin’s Holdings Cross $1B As Ethereum Rally Gains Momentum According to blockchain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence, Buterin holds approximately 240,000 ETH, alongside other digital assets such as MOODENG and DINU. At current market prices, his ETH holdings alone are worth around $1 billion, cementing his status as one of the wealthiest figures in crypto — at least on-chain. The surge in ETH’s price comes after a series of volatile moves earlier this year that left some questioning the sustainability of the rally. However, the latest breakout above $4,300 suggests strong underlying momentum. Institutional adoption is playing a crucial role, with public companies like Sharplink Gaming adding Ethereum to their balance sheets as part of their treasury strategy. This marks a notable shift in corporate crypto allocation trends, where ETH is increasingly seen not just as a speculative asset but as a core long-term holding. With on-chain data pointing to robust network activity, the supply-demand dynamics appear favorable for continued gains. As institutions, public companies, and long-term holders continue to accumulate, Ethereum’s bullish narrative remains intact — and Buterin’s billion-dollar stake is now riding the wave. Ethereum Price Analysis: Breakout To Multi-Year Highs Ethereum (ETH) has surged to $4,242, marking its highest level since November 2021 and confirming a major breakout on the weekly chart. The rally, driven by strong bullish momentum, saw ETH climb over 21% in the past week, decisively breaking through the $3,860 resistance level that had capped price advances earlier in the year. The breakout is supported by rising volume, signaling robust buying interest. ETH is now trading well above its 50-, 100-, and 200-week moving averages, which are all sloping upward — a classic sign of a strong uptrend. This alignment suggests that the medium- to long-term trend remains firmly bullish. If momentum continues, the next significant target lies near the $4,800–$4,900 range, aligning with the previous all-time highs. However, after such a steep move, short-term consolidation is possible, with $3,860 now acting as a key support level. A deeper pullback could retest $2,852, but this scenario would likely require a broader market correction.

During this period, the leading altcoin has surged past $4,000 for the first time since December 2024 and is also now trading above $4,200, reclaiming a level it last held in 2021. According to on-chain data, the breakout has injected confidence into the market, especially among retail traders. Ethereum’s technical setup and comparisons with Bitcoin are now showing the possibility of a rally on par with the most explosive phases in its history. Related Reading: Ripple-SEC Legal Drama Ends; XRP Skyrockets 13% Ethereum Fractal Structure Signals 1,110% Rally According to technical analysis of Ethereum’s price action on the weekly candlestick timeframe chart, the leading altcoin is about to enter into a 1,110% rally that might take its price above $20,000. This analysis was initially noted by crypto analyst Merlijn The Trader, who identified a repeating cycle that closely aligns Ethereum’s current performance with Bitcoin’s 2018-2021 run. Taking to the social media platform X, the analyst noted that in that earlier cycle, Bitcoin endured an 83% drop from its highs before staging a powerful 342% recovery. This was followed by a secondary correction of around 63%, which ultimately served as the base for a 1,110% surge between the second half of 2020 and the first half of 2021. Ethereum’s weekly chart has been following the same sequence almost step-for-step in the past few years. After a steep 83% decline from its 2021 peak, Ethereum mounted a 342% rebound, only to experience a deep retracement of roughly 63% to $1,500 in April 2025. Since then, however, Ethereum has mounted another rebound, with the latest move being the most recent rally back above $4,200. Image From X: Merlijn The Trader This latest rally shows Ethereum is now in the final phase, where it could be positioned for a comparable explosive run to as high as $20,000 if the fractal continues to play out. In another analysis, Merlijn The Trader also pointed out that Ethereum’s weekly chart is echoing its own 2017 breakout structure. In that cycle, Ethereum reclaimed the 50-week moving average after a prolonged consolidation phase before entering into a sustained and powerful rally. The 2025 chart shows a similar reclaim of the 50 MA, and the price is now breaking above the $4,000 resistance zone that has stood since March 2024. Image From X: Merlijn The Trader Bullish Sentiment Building Above $4,000 Although Ethereum’s recent price rally can be mostly attributed to institutional buys in Spot Ethereum ETFs, the breakout above $4,000 has not gone unnoticed in the broader market. Notably, data from on-chain analytics platform Santiment reflects a dramatic rise in bullish activity across social channels. Mentions tied to buying, optimism, and higher price expectations have surged sharply, now outpacing bearish commentary such as selling or lower price calls by almost two-to-one. Although this can create the conditions in which Ethereum’s rally can sustain momentum, too much FOMO can also put a temporary halt to any rally.

This area coincides with a 4-hour supply block and the upper Bollinger Band, creating strong overhead pressure. The pullback comes after a multi-day rally from the $0.326 low, where buyers staged an aggressive breakout through short-term resistance. What’s Happening With Pi Coin’s Price? Pi Network price dynamics (Source: TradingView) On the daily chart, PI remains in a broader downtrend, with descending trendline resistance still capping upside since May. The recent rally broke above the short-term dynamic levels but stalled precisely at the confluence of the $0.46 supply zone and the daily EMA cluster. The On-Balance Volume (OBV) remains near multi-month lows, suggesting that despite the price spike, broader accumulation is still weak. Pi Network price dynamics (Source: TradingView) On the 4-hour chart, the rally pushed price above the 20 EMA ($0.391) and 50 EMA ($0.384), but sellers defended the 200 EMA at $0.4287. The rejection has sent PI back toward the mid-Bollinger Band ($0.4402), which now acts as immediate resistance. … The post Pi Network (PI) Price Prediction for August 11 appeared first on Coin Edition .",Market|News|Price Analysis|Price Prediction|Pi (PI),EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coin Edition', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/7/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinquora,2025-08-10 08:03:16
49847550,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=408004,1754813287,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/49847550.jpeg,We Asked 3 AIs: Is Ripple’s XRP Heading for a Crash or a Moonshot?,https://cryptopotato.com/we-asked-3-ais-is-ripples-xrp-heading-for-a-crash-or-a-moonshot/,"TL;DR In this article, some of the most popular AI solutions, including ChatGPT’s just-released 5.0 version, will speculate on XRP’s future price movements. Some of the answers might surprise the perma-bulls. Moonshot or Pullback? Ripple’s native token made history in mid-July when it skyrocketed by over 60% within a week or so and blasted through its January 2018 all-time high of $3.4 to mark a new one at $3.65. Somewhat expected, it started to retrace in the following weeks and dipped toward $2.7. However, the bulls are back in town, pushing XRP above the crucial support-turn-resistance and now back to a support level at $3. As of press time, the asset stands well above it ($3.25), which has prompted numerous analysts and full-time XRP bulls to outline some massive predictions . To gain a more neutral perspective, though, we decided to ask ChatGPT’s latest version, Gemini, and Grok about their take on the matter. ChatGPT acknowledged the recent correction, indicating that XRP is now at a “pivotal point in its 2025 price journey.” It believes the asset has strong chances of overcoming the current hurdles, especially if the following factors play out in its favor: The Bullish Case (Moonshot Potential) Strong Institutional Interest – Speculation over a future spot XRP ETF and growing partnerships in cross-border payments could bring major capital inflows. Technical Support Holding – Key levels around $2.70–$2.80 have so far absorbed selling pressure, suggesting buyers are defending critical territory. However, it also outlined a bearish scenario, in which XRP loses some ground and heads for an extended correction. This could be prompted by post-rally exhaustion, given its massive rise since the US elections last year, and overall market uncertainty, such as the aftershock of some of Trump’s controversial global policies. Gemini outlined the recent positive developments in the Ripple-SEC legal case as bullish factors for the underlying asset’s price, and noted that it could open the door for the approval of the much-anticipated XRP ETFs in the US. “The approval of an XRP ETF, following the successful launches of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, would introduce a new class of institutional and retail investors to the asset, potentially driving significant capital inflow and price appreciation.” However, Gemini, alongside Grok, noted that XRP still faces certain risks, such as growing competition and the possibility of whales taking profits following the recent rally. Something identical transpired after the asset reached a new ATH, with whales disposing of massive token portions in just days. Conclusion In general, the three AIs were bullish on XRP’s future price movements, especially given the end of the lawsuit against the SEC, Ripple’s expansion in terms of acquisitions, and the underlying asset’s technical structure. Gemini said: “The current market sentiment, bolstered by the resolution of the SEC lawsuit and the potential for a spot ETF, overwhelmingly favors a bullish outlook for XRP. The token is at a critical juncture, with many analysts forecasting a significant rally if it can break through key resistance levels. However, as with any cryptocurrency, the path forward.” ChatGPT, though, was slightly more cautious: “XRP’s next big move depends on whether it can hold above its key $2.70 support zone and reclaim the $3.40–$3.65 range. A confirmed breakout could set the stage for a moonshot toward $4 and beyond. A breakdown, however, might drag it back toward the mid-$2 range or even lower.” It also advised traders to watch for big whale moves, the overall transaction volumes, and news related to the company behind it.

From unsolicited phone calls to convincing replicas of legitimate websites, scammers are continually refining their methods to extract sensitive information and digital assets. James Rule (@RuleXRP), a cryptocurrency educator with seven years of experience in the industry, recently outlined the most prevalent scams encountered within the community. He reported receiving frequent accounts of victims losing funds to schemes that exploit fear, trust, and social engineering. His cautionary remarks follow a series of incidents in which members of the XRP ecosystem, including high-profile figures such as Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz, have intervened to expose fraudulent actors . VERY IMPORTANT!!!! THE MOST COMMON CRYPTO SCAMS THAT I HAVE SEEN IN 7 YEARS. Believe me, I get messages every week from the community telling me that they were scammed. FEAR SCAMS: Texts, E-mails and Phone Calls from a fake exchange or wallet… — James Rule XRP (@RuleXRP) August 9, 2025 Fear-Based Manipulation Tactics One of the most common scams relies on inducing panic. Targets receive texts, emails, or calls from individuals posing as representatives of major exchanges or wallet providers, such as Coinbase or Ledger, claiming that their accounts have been compromised. These communications often direct users to fraudulent websites designed to harvest login credentials, passwords, and recovery phrases. Some messages even provide a “help” phone number, which connects directly to the scammer. Impersonation scams are a big problem in the crypto space, and according to James, criminals have begun sending physical letters that mimic official correspondence from wallet manufacturers, complete with QR codes intended to lure recipients into compromising their accounts. False Promises of Cryptocurrency Giveaways Another recurring scam involves fraudulent giveaways. James emphasized that Ripple will never distribute XRP for free in exchange for deposits or payments. Scammers often promote these schemes through fake social media accounts or impersonations of public figures, misleading victims into sending cryptocurrency or cash to unverified wallets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Once transferred, the funds are impossible to recover. Ripple has reiterated that it will never ask the community to send XRP , and the same rule applies to its executives, as scams impersonating them are prominent. Deceptive Social Media and Self-Custody Risks Scammers often impersonate help desks, advisers, or content creators on social media, contacting users through comments or direct messages. Some offer unsolicited assistance to gain trust. James advises verifying identities independently and remaining “very cautious” online. The rule also emphasized that Self-custody wallets require strict security . Seed or recovery phrases, whether 12 or 24 words, must never be shared as wallets cannot be recovered once compromised. Maintaining vigilance is essential. He advised crypto holders to ignore unknown calls, delete suspicious texts, and avoid clicking links or scanning QR codes from unverified sources. As James stressed, the safest approach is simple: never trust anyone without absolute confirmation of their legitimacy.

A few altcoins have doubled down on their recent gains, including LINK, which has rocketed by almost 7% to trade above $22. BTC Sees August Peak The current month didn’t start all that well for the primary cryptocurrency as it dipped to a multi-week low of $112,000 just three days in. This came amid ongoing political tension between some of the Great Powers, which included the movement of nuclear submarines. However, the asset reacted well to that dip and started to recover almost immediately. Within just a few days, by last Friday, bitcoin was already knocking on the $117,000 door. Although it experienced some resistance there, the bulls were persistent and managed to break through on Saturday. They kept the pressure on in the past several hours as well, helping BTC breach the $118,000 line. As such, bitcoin marked a ten-day high at around $118,500 earlier today. Despite losing some ground since then, it’s still around 1% up on the day.

He argued that the waiver produces concrete operational consequences for the court injunction that followed the agency’s enforcement action. In his post, he explained that the permanent injunction prevents Ripple from violating securities laws. However, if the laws are changed, future sales without registration would not violate the law or the injunction. He noted that “Ripple was found to have violated the law as it existed at the time of its misconduct.” Fagel explained that this scenario, where the law is changed, would “render the injunction largely moot.” He also says that the SEC’s recent waiver has the same effect. 2/ ..wouldn't violate the law (or, thus, the injunction). It wouldn't change the fact that Ripple was found to have violated the law as it existed at the time of its misconduct, but it would render the injunction largely moot. (Though yesterday's waiver arguably does the same.) — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) August 9, 2025 Immediate Regulatory Effect The waiver removes a regulatory disqualification that had prevented Ripple from relying on a key exemption under Regulation D. With that barrier removed, Ripple can pursue private capital from accredited investors without submitting to full SEC registration where the exemption applies. The administrative relief, therefore, reduces a discrete compliance obligation tied to the injunction and restores a practical route for capital formation and corporate funding. Impact on Ripple’s Operations and Legal Standing While the waiver does not erase the court’s finding that Ripple violated securities laws in its past institutional sales of XRP, it has significant implications for the company’s ability to operate. For Ripple, the development arrives at a time when it is seeking to expand both its product suite and its geographic footprint using XRP . Access to capital under less restrictive conditions could accelerate those ambitions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 By reinstating access to Regulation D exemptions, the company can once again raise funds through private offerings, which could support expansion plans, product development, and potential strategic acquisitions. Legal Clarity for Ripple and XRP Fagel’s interpretation also clarifies that the injunction remains in place for as long as the underlying law remains unchanged. However, in practice, the waiver neutralizes a key operational restriction. The company can now engage in certain transactions that were previously off-limits without risking a violation of the injunction. The SEC’s decision to grant relief to Ripple after the prolonged lawsuit shows the pro-crypto stance of the current administration and marks the end of the war on crypto that lasted for years. The legal battle between Ripple and the SEC is now over , and for XRP holders and market participants, the decision further reduces legal uncertainty around Ripple’s future activities.

The nightclub Hi Ibiza, ranked top in the world, opened what its owners called the first permanent art gallery inside a club. The development is seen as an effort to mix nightlife with digital art. According to reports, the nightclub was launched this summer, unveiling its gallery alongside Ibiza-based nightlife group The Night League. The nightclub, which has been voted as the world’s best in the last four consecutive years, also unveiled London digital art collective W1 Curates. The exhibition blends digital, physical, interactive installations, and custom-built display technology. In-club art gallery launches with works from famous artists According to the organizers, the gallery presents a selection of works from the best artists across the world. “From cinematic design to surreal architecture and cyberpunk storytelling, the gallery presents a curated selection of today’s most influential digital artists,” the organizers said in a statement. In addition, it is also seen as a broader push to bring digital and NFT art into physical locations. This is not the first time that such a blend has been witnessed across the world, with Bright Moments launching its NFT gallery in Venice, California, in 2021. Web3 NYC Gallery also followed in the same path the next year, launching its Genesis NFT exhibition in New York. The in-club gallery space features a mural work created by a British graffiti artist, Mr Cenz, at the entrance of the club. Visitors are allowed to scan the mural with the W1 Curates smartphone application, revealing an augmented reality animation. Inside the art gallery, several works are lined up, including two sculptures made by British graphic designer and album cover artist KidEight, known to have collaborated with 2 Chainz, French Montana, Gucci Mane, and Fabulous. He also collaborated with American street artist WhIsBe to create a six-foot green gummy bear. Other artists featured inside the in-club gallery include Annibale Siconolfi, Mad Dog Jones, Shiro, Ash Thorp, Six N. Five, and Beeple, who is popular for selling one of the biggest digital artworks—Everydays: The first 5,000 Days. Beeple sold the artwork in 2021 for $69.3 million at an auction, with the sale coming at a time when the NFT sector was just trying to penetrate the mainstream market. Other artists have since gone on to sell more digital artworks. According to the organizers, the lineup is expected to rotate every two weeks during the summer. The main in-club gallery space was designed by W1 Curates, creating a space to adapt to each artist’s color palette using large-scale projection and immersive lighting. The gallery launch will include talks by W1 Curates, Seedphrase, Bitcoin historian and artist Smashtoshi, Trevor Jones, and Farokh, president and co-founder of DASTAN. The in-club art gallery is also expected to have a Wild Corner featuring a DJ set to entertain the guests. The exhibition features “cutting-edge digital artists alongside additional physical works, encouraging guests to explore, pause, and connect with the art beyond the dance floor,” the organizers said. Meanwhile, the hype around NFTs has seemed to have cooled down in the last few years, with trading volumes dropping drastically. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Mutuum Finance is in presale Phase 6 and is presently valued at $0.035. The next price increase will bring the token to $0.04 in phase 7.

Cardano Holds Steady as August Price Forecast Unfolds Cardano (ADA) is trading at $0.7989, showing resilience within its intraday range of $0.7409 to $0.7991 as market participants assess its near-term price trajectory for August. The network’s development roadmap remains anchored in gradual, research-driven upgrades, with recent governance decisions, such as the approval of significant treasury-funded initiatives, highlighting its structured approach to ecosystem growth. As broader crypto market sentiment shifts between established and emerging assets, Cardano maintains a steady presence alongside newer entrants like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Unveils Phase 6 of Its Presale Mutuum Finance has concluded Phase 5 of its presale and advanced into Phase 6, where its tokens are priced at $0.035. Its next price increase will drive the price of its tokens up 14.29% to $0.04. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has already raised over $14.25 million and attracted over 15000 holders.

The program shows the vision of Mutuum Finance to establish community-driven, secure and sustainable ecosystem. The project has also been rigorously audited by Certik on user fund security and security of the blockchain.

Mutuum Finance Launches MUTM Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched a $100,000 giveaway where 10 lucky participants will be rewarded with $10,000 in MUTM tokens.

Markets moved fast, and so did headline writers, but the numbers behind the noise are plain. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Still King Of Capital Inflows, According To Michael Saylor Arkham Valuation And Wallets According to Arkham, wallets linked to Vitalik Buterin now hold about 240,042 ETH, giving him an on-chain value near $1.04 billion at recent prices. Those wallets also show smaller stakes in tokens like AETHWETH, White, Moodeng and WETH. This is a price-driven snapshot of holdings that are visible on public ledgers, not a full accounting of any off-chain assets or tax liabilities. Based on reports, Ether climbed as much as 6.20% on Saturday and breached the $4,300 level for the first time since December 2024. Nansen data put Ether around $4,250 at the time of reporting. Traders pointed out that a move to $4,500 would put roughly $1.35 billion of short positions at risk, according to CoinGlass, which feeds talk of a potential short squeeze. Fast moves like this can trigger big liquidations and amplify swings. ETFs And Flows Driving Demand According to Arkham, ETF activity sent $461 million to ETH compared with $404 million to BTC. Over five trading days, US-based spot Ether ETFs recorded net inflows of $326 million, compared with $253.2 million for Bitcoin, based on Farside data. Those steady flows add another channel of demand for spot ETH and help explain why institutions and traders are watching price action closely. A History Of On-Chain Wealth Vitalik first crossed the on-chain billionaire threshold at age 27, in May 2021, when Ether traded above $3,000 and holdings were roughly 333,500 ETH — then worth about $1.029 billion. That rise came after ETH moved from around $700 at the start of 2021 to much higher levels later that year. What’s different now is that the figure is again a simple product of visible token holdings and a higher ETH price. Related Reading: Ripple-SEC Legal Drama Ends; XRP Skyrockets 13% In a recent interview, Buterin warned against a heavy reliance on large treasuries and borrowing in the ecosystem. He said that if treasuries ever caused major damage to ETH, it would be because some players turned the market into an over-borrowed setup. That kind of caution from a founder matters to investors who are weighing long-term structural risks against short-term price moves.

He told his nearly 6 million followers that seeing Ethereum shorts “get smoked” put a smile on his face and warned that anyone shorting Bitcoin or Ethereum “will be run over.” At the same time, Bitcoin pushed past $117,000 and Ether climbed back above $4,200. Policy Move Sparks A Fresh Rally According to market reports, a recent executive action signed by President Trump helped spark the move. The order was tied to retirement account rules and stirred talk that 401(k) flows could become more crypto friendly, which pushed funds and traders to rethink bearish bets. Price swings followed quickly, and traders who had bet against the rally found themselves under pressure. It puts a smile on my face to see ETH shorts get smoked today. Stop betting against BTC and ETH – you will be run over. — Eric Trump (@EricTrump) August 8, 2025 Reports have pointed to heavy buying from US spot ETFs and a handful of treasury buyers that are grabbing up Ether. That clearing of supply on exchanges is making it harder for sellers to keep the price down. Ether’s jump above $4,200 was the first time it hit that level since December 2024, and market players said it helped spark a wave of short covering that amplified the gains. Shorts Took The Brunt Based on trading-data summaries, about $208 million of Ethereum positions were liquidated in a 24-hour window, which made up over 56% of nearly $370 million wiped from the futures market during that span. Of the Ether losses, around $184 million came from short positions and $24 million from longs. That flood of forced exits pushed the rebound to be sharper than many expected. Eric Trump’s post added fuel to the social side of the move. He’s been vocal about buying every Ether dip, and his message was one of glee as bears were squeezed. Traders watching the tape said the mix of policy headlines, ETF inflows, and social media heat created the perfect setup for quick, volatile moves. Analysts Offer Wildly Different Paths Analysts are split on how high Ether could go if the momentum holds. Some put a bullish scenario that reaches toward $16,000 by year-end under favorable conditions. Other market voices have sketched even more aggressive paths, with one analyst suggesting a near sevenfold rise toward $25,000 in an extreme case. Those calls sit beside more cautious takes that warn the ride could reverse just as fast. Eric Trump believes those betting against Bitcoin and Ethereum could face heavy losses, adding social heat to a rally driven by policy moves and ETF inflows.

Key Takeaways: World Liberty Financial aims to raise $1.5B to launch a NASDAQ-listed treasury company for WLFI. The WLFI token has generated $550M in sales since its launch alongside the USD1 stablecoin. Analysts warn the treasury company model is highly exposed to crypto market volatility. Investor materials indicate Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. are expected to join the board, according to a Friday report from Fortune . If completed, the venture would mark another expansion of the Trump family’s growing presence in the digital asset sector. World Liberty’s WLFI Token Sales Hit $550M Since Launch Since unveiling World Liberty last fall, the group has rolled out a stablecoin (USD1) and the WLFI token, which has reportedly generated $550 million in sales. Neither World Liberty nor representatives for Eric and Donald Jr. responded to requests for comment. The proposed treasury company would join a recent wave of “digital asset treasury companies” — public firms structured to hold large cryptocurrency reserves on their balance sheets. The model was popularized by Michael Saylor, who transformed MicroStrategy into a Bitcoin acquisition vehicle in 2020, later rebranding it as Strategy in 2025. Strategy’s market value soared to nearly $113 billion as it amassed over $72 billion in Bitcoin, despite quarterly revenue of just $115 million.

Similar strategies have attracted significant attention from traders who view these companies’ stocks as proxies for the underlying crypto assets they hold. The trend has broadened beyond Bitcoin. This year has seen the emergence of treasury companies for Ethereum, Litecoin, Sui, and Ethena. Even Trump Media joined the movement earlier this summer, acquiring $2 billion worth of Bitcoin for its own balance sheet. Advocates say these structures allow traditional investors, including those limited to brokerages like Vanguard, to gain crypto exposure without directly buying tokens. However, some analysts caution that the model carries risk, warning that valuations could collapse if the crypto rally falters. Critics argue that these firms’ fortunes are overly dependent on volatile token prices, making them vulnerable to downturns. Trump Nets Over $26M in Crypto Donations This Year As reported, the crypto industry has donated over $26 million to Donald Trump this year, according to newly released campaign finance filings. Campaign finance records show that contributions to the pro-Trump super PAC, MAGA Inc., came from some of the biggest names in crypto. Blockchain.com led the list with a $5 million donation. Venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz each gave $3 million, while Gemini Trust added nearly $3 million. Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss also contributed $500,000 each personally. Other major donors include Ondo Finance with $2.1 million and Paradigm, which gave $1.2 million. Trump’s crypto-linked holdings are also a substantial part of his personal wealth . Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index estimates that TMTG stock represents $2.2 billion of Trump’s $6.6 billion fortune. His broader cryptocurrency investments are believed to have gained at least $620 million in recent months. Notably, nearly 70 nominees and officials in the Trump administration reportedly hold crypto or investments in blockchain companies , with holdings ranging from modest sums to over $120 million.

The Binance coin price prediction for 2028 projects a maximum price of $3,648.58 and a minimum price of $3,192.51. By 2031, BNB’s price could surge to $5,928.95 with broader acceptance in mainstream finance. After notable changes in its executive team, Binance has shown resilience and prospects for recovery. The departure of Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s CEO, who was also embroiled in legal challenges, initially caused a decline in the value of Binance coin (BNB). Despite this initial setback, the cryptocurrency has shown a positive trend. What’s next for BNB in the remainder of 2025 and beyond? What can be the future price movements? Let’s get into the BNB price prediction and technical analysis.

Cryptocurrency gained 0.51% of its value. BNB coin targets resistance at the $818 level. On August 9, 2025, Binance Coin price analysis revealed a bullish trend. The coin’s value surged above $803 in the past 24 hours. According to an overall analysis, the cryptocurrency gained a minimal 0.51 percent of its worth. The coin has been reporting significant gains since August 3, 2025, when it started to attract investors again. The BNB price is now preparing to maintain its momentum around its all-time high. BNB/USDT price analysis on the daily timeframe The one-day price chart of Binance Coin confirmed an upward trend in the market. The cryptocurrency’s value has surged above $803. Green candlesticks on the price chart signify a continuous buying momentum in the market. The distance between the Bollinger Bands defines the volatility. This distance is widening, leading to increased volatility. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, indicating resistance, has shifted to $833.6, whereas its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $735.4. BNB/USDT Price Chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is trending in the neutral area. The indicator’s value has increased to index 62.04 in the past 24 hours. This increase confirms rising buying activity in the market. BNB price analysis on a 4-hour chart The four-hour price analysis of Binance Coin also confirmed an increasing trend for the cryptocurrency. The BNB/USD value has jumped to $802.8 in the past few hours. A downswing was also observed a few hours back, but currently, the bulls are trying to maintain their lead. The Bollinger Bands are slowly converging, resulting in decreasing volatility. The decreasing volatility signifies a lesser chance of an upcoming reversal. Moving ahead, the upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $817.8, indicating the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band has moved to $769.9, marking the immediate support level. BNB/USDT 4-hour price chart. Source: TradingView The RSI indicator is in the neutral area for now. The indicator’s value has increased to 58.76 in the past few hours. However, this placement of the indicator leaves further room for buyers to exert their influence.

Binance Coin price analysis gives a bullish prediction regarding ongoing market events. The coin’s value has increased to $803 in the past 24 hours. If buyers continue to push the price upward, a strong increase toward $818 might emerge. On the other hand, if sellers defend the immediate resistance at the $816 level strongly, BNB price might see a correction, and the next target could be $794.4. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $5,928.95 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB up? BNB found support, and the price moved toward $803. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has gained up to 0.51 percent of its value if looked at from an overall view. Will BNB reach $800? Most crypto analysts, including WalletInvestor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $800 mark in 2025, which would be higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2026. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes it a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2028, according to Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $5,928.95 by 2031.

It is important to consider that the predictions are not investment advice. Professional consultation is suggested before investing in the volatile market. Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coingecko Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May, while it marked a new ATH of $858.34 on July 28. Heading into August, BNB is trading at approximately $767.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB|MARKET|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-10 10:00:00

For XRP holders, the latest projection suggests a steady but modest growth curve, with values of $3.49 in 2026, $4.24 in 2030, $5.41 in 2035, and $6.90 in 2040. It is a respectable climb, yet for many traders seeking faster compounding gains, the slow-and-steady pace is starting to feel more like a Sunday stroll than a bull run sprint. That is where investor attention is shifting. While XRP may hold its ground as a long-term, lower-volatility option, a different conversation is heating up, one focused on high-growth potential, AI-driven rewards, and market-ready liquidity. At the center of that discussion is Bitcoin Swift, also known as BTC3, which has rapidly become the most talked-about presale of the season. XRP’s Place in the Forecast To be clear, XRP remains a foundational asset for many portfolios. Its projected price milestones reflect a solid performance, especially for those prioritizing stability. The utility of its payment network and its regulatory positioning give it a strong case for long-term relevance. Still, its gradual appreciation means that traders looking for sharper short-term ROI may be tempted to diversify into projects with more aggressive growth strategies, and that is exactly where BTC3 enters the scene. Why Bitcoin Swift is Pulling in Investors Bitcoin Swift (BTC3) is designed as a decentralized financial operating system, not just another speculative token. It integrates programmable PoY rewards, AI-powered smart contracts, a privacy-first decentralized identity framework, and a hybrid PoW plus PoS consensus model. This combination delivers scalability, compliance readiness, and adaptive governance. Its PoY system is a standout feature, dynamically adjusting rewards based on network activity, sustainability metrics, and governance decisions. AI agents inside smart contracts can adapt and optimize without manual updates. Quadratic voting tied to decentralized identity ensures governance power stays with engaged participants, not just deep-pocketed whales. Security and Investor Confidence BTC3’s credibility is supported by multiple verifications, including the Solidproof Audit , the Spywolf Audit , and team KYC . According to internal sources, a third audit with a well-known blockchain firm is already underway, further strengthening protocol integrity and investor trust. Influencer Spotlight A wave of respected crypto voices has been covering BTC3: Crypto Sister has analyzed its adaptive PoY reward system. Bull Run Angel discussed its potential for building sustainable wealth. Token Galaxy broke down its technical and governance strengths. Technical Highlights That Matter Some of the most investor-attracting features include: AI Energy Efficiency : AI oracles track environmental impact and reward low-carbon participation. Governance Architecture : AI-assisted proposal screening, DID reputation scoring, and quadratic voting ensure fair governance. Bitcoin Swift also integrates privacy-preserving zk-SNARK technology, allowing compliance checks without revealing sensitive personal data. Stage 4 Presale Momentum BTC3’s Stage 4 presale is showing serious traction: Price at $4, with a planned launch at $15 Stage 4 APY at 106% Over 2,100 investors and $580k+ raised PoY rewards distributed at the end of each presale stage for immediate benefits Insider chatter suggests the team is already in talks with major exchanges such as MEXC, KuCoin, and LBank. Adding to its appeal, BTC3 has one of the highest liquidity levels seen at this stage, which is crucial for smooth post-launch trading and reduced volatility. Referral Program Driving Expansion BTC3’s referral system doubles the reward potential. Anyone referring a new participant earns 10% instantly, and the referred buyer gets the same bonus. This straightforward approach fuels organic network growth while rewarding active community members. Roadmap Overview Q3–Q4 2025: Presale launch and PoY reward activation on Solana Q1 2026: AI-powered smart contracts and oracle integration Q2 2026: zk-SNARK ledger and privacy-focused DeFi beta Q3 2026: AI-driven governance rollout Q4 2026: BTC3 mainnet launch and institutional onboarding Final Verdict: Why Bitcoin Swift Is Dominating Headlines While XRP’s steady rise to $6.90 by 2040 makes it a reliable long-term hold, Bitcoin Swift’s rapid innovation cycle, high liquidity, and AI-driven economic model position it as the breakout story of the year. For investors willing to embrace new tech and adaptive governance, BTC3 offers a growth profile that is hard to ignore.

49852094,https://timestabloid.com/?p=77512,1754820037,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Before You Double Down on XRP or SOL, You Might Want to See Why This Altcoin Is Gaining Ground At This Pace",https://timestabloid.com/before-you-double-down-on-xrp-or-sol-you-might-want/,"XRP and SOL have long been favorites for many crypto investors looking for relatively stable, well-known projects. They’ve earned their reputation as solid picks. But smart investors today are increasingly seeking out emerging altcoins with smaller market caps that boast real-world utility, clear roadmaps, and strong growth potential. One such rising star is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , an innovative DeFi platform making waves with its unique lending models and rapidly growing community. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out because it is building to blend traditional crypto lending with a fresh approach that opens up opportunities often missed by giants like XRP and SOL. Its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending pools will enable users to deposit blue-chip assets and earn passive income, while borrowers gain liquidity without losing exposure to their holdings. Unlocking New Possibilities with Dual Lending Models Take the P2C system as an example: a user who deposits $2,500 worth of Binance Coin (BNB) at a conservative 65% Loan-to-Value (LTV) will be able to borrow $1,625 USDT against that collateral. Meanwhile, the lender supplying funds to the pool will earn a robust 10.8% annual percentage yield (APY), which will translate to $270 in yearly earnings. This arrangement will allow borrowers to maintain their position in BNB, benefiting from any future price appreciation while accessing liquid funds. It’s a win-win scenario not commonly available on XRP or SOL platforms, which typically won’t focus on lending mechanics with such flexibility. Beyond this, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending model will tap into higher-risk, higher-reward segments by enabling loans secured by memecoins like FLOKI and TRUMP. These markets will remain largely untapped by the larger platforms, offering investors the chance to engage with assets that have explosive growth potential but were previously sidelined due to risk or regulatory concerns. This dual lending framework will position Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a versatile platform catering to conservative and speculative users alike, expanding its reach well beyond what many established altcoins will offer. Presale Momentum and Clear Growth Path Fuel Investor Confidence Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale, priced at $0.035 per token, and has raised a remarkable $14.25 million to date. With 15% of the total token supply sold and over 15,100 holders onboard, the project’s community is gaining strength. Investors are eagerly anticipating the upcoming Phase 7 price increase to $0.040, which is driving excitement and a sense of urgency among presale participants. The potential upside for early adopters is exemplified by a confident investor who shifted $1,000 out of SOL into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) during Phase 1 when the token was priced at just $0.01. Today, that initial stake is valued at $3,500. As the token approaches its planned listing price of $0.06, the holding’s value will climb to $6,000. Looking further ahead, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s ambitious roadmap projects a post-listing price exceeding $3 per token, translating that same investment into an astonishing $300,000. What fuels this confidence is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s focus on delivering tangible utility. Upcoming milestones such as the launch of its decentralized stablecoin, integration of Layer-2 scalability solutions, the beta release of its platform, and listings on major exchanges will create multiple catalysts for value appreciation. Unlike many tokens that rely solely on market hype, MUTM’s growth is grounded in clear, practical advancements that will enhance user adoption and platform sustainability. Security and Giveaways Additionally, security and community trust are priorities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has undergone a rigorous CertiK audit, earning a score of 95 and a Skynet rating of 78—figures that highlight strong code quality and security standards. The platform is also launching a $50,000 Bug Bounty program with tiered rewards ranging from $200 to $2,000 for vulnerabilities found, incentivizing continuous improvement. Coupled with a $100,000 giveaway campaign, these initiatives foster community engagement and broaden appeal. While XRP and SOL remain solid pillars in the crypto ecosystem, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is carving its own path as a utility-driven altcoin with a compelling narrative. Its dual lending system will unlock new financial possibilities, and the growing presale traction signals investor confidence in its long-term vision. For those seeking to diversify beyond the usual names, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents an accessible opportunity with the infrastructure and momentum to deliver meaningful returns. As the crypto market grows, the time to explore emerging projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now—before the market fully recognizes their potential and prices reflect what investors already see.

Both parties have agreed to drop pending appeals, providing regulatory clarity that could smooth the ETF approval process. Following the development, industry analysts are increasingly confident about XRP’s ETF prospects. For instance, Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas has maintained a 95% approval probability, dismissing recent drops in prediction market odds as insignificant. Notably, data from crypto prediction market Polymarket indicates that the odds for an XRP ETF approval in 2025 have fallen below the 80% mark to the current 77%. On the other hand, Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, believes major asset managers like BlackRock are now more likely to file for an XRP spot ETF , arguing it makes “zero sense” to limit offerings to Bitcoin and Ethereum alone.

The suspect, Abishek Sharma, is an Una resident and one of the key accused in the crypto scam that duped about 80,000 investors in Himachal and neighboring states. While dismissing his bail plea, the judge considered the severity of the offense and its impact on society. “The investigation, prima facie, revealed that the petitioner was a close associate of the main accused, Subhash Sharma, who absconded and moved out of India,” the bench, headed by Justice Sushil Kukreja, said while dismissing the bail petition. The court noted that even though Article 21 of the Constitution of India guarantees a speedy trial and a suspect on trial cannot be detained or held for an indefinite period, the fact of the matter is that the trial is not likely to be concluded in the near future. The court added that this does not qualify the petitioner for bail as he is prima facie found to be involved in an economic offense on an extensive scale. Indian high court denies suspect linked to crypto investment fraud bail Justice Kukreja also pointed out that even though the petitioner Sharma has been in custody since October 2023, his counsel has failed to provide a substantial change in the details surrounding his circumstances after the dismissal of an earlier bail application, which would have seen Sharma being released on bail. The court also held that the offenses are grave, as they affect the country and are taken seriously. According to the Indian police, the multi-million dollar fraud started in 2018, but came to the attention of authorities when one of its investors, Arun Singh Guleria, registered an FIR in September 2023 at the Palampur police station in Kangra district. The complainant mentioned that a group of individuals, including Subash Sharma, Hem Raj, Sukhdev, Milan Garg, and Abishek Sharma, were involved in fraudulent activities related to digital assets in Himachal Pradesh. On the advice of Subash, the complainant and others invested funds in a website called voscrow, allegedly being run by the individuals. He mentioned that they were offered digital assets in return for their investments. Sukhdev, along with other promoters of the platform, allegedly cheated the public through the platform, using another one called Hypenext to also promise investors that their funds would be doubled. Investigations reveal the modus operandi of the group Reports noted that over 1,000 state police personnel were among the victims who lost funds to the fraudulent platform. On September 26, 2023, a special investigation team, headed by DIG of the northern range, Dharamshala, was created to investigate various cryptocurrency-related fraud transactions across the country. The Indian police were able to apprehend all the other suspects in the case, except for Subhash, who they said had left the country. The investigation revealed the modus operandi of the group, noting that they played on the innocence of their victims by offering them high rewards for their investments. They also created a network of people who recruited new investors, keeping a chain that made the investment look like a Ponzi scheme . In addition, the group was said to have given them crypto prices that they had manipulated, causing the investors several degrees of losses. The Indian police also said that during the investigation, they discovered that Abishek, the petitioner, was in charge of hosting several gatherings with investors across the state.

The collaboration will see new lending capabilities take root on Pharos, adding greater utility to RWAs and giving them DeFi-like powers, strengthening the incentives for holding these tokenized assets. Morpho knows a thing or two about lending, having accrued more than $9B in user deposits, but its move onto Pharos’ Layer 1 will mark fresh territory for deploying its best-in-class infra. The idea behind the initiative is to enable asset originators and LPs on Pharos to enjoy greater capital efficiency through being able to access lending markets on demand. Morpho will take care of the infra, with the Pharos ecosystem onboarding the sort of professionals who stand to benefit from this arrangement. RWAs Come of Age Now a $25B sector, tokenized real-world assets may have taken their time in gaining traction, but they’re making up for it now, having been posting an average of 5% monthly growth all through 2025. Pharos has been doing its bit to expedite this process, its EVM-compatible chain providing the scalability and compliant framework institutions need to access the thriving RWA onchain economy. But while tokenizing assets such as equities and bonds is the starting point, it’s certainly not the endgame. The next step is to add greater utility to these assets over and above the ability to trade them 24/7, which is where Morpho comes into the picture. “Deploying natively on Pharos allows us to keep extending Morpho's most trusted lending infrastructure to the real-world asset space following initial success like private credit and tokenized stocks,” explains Morpho’s Kirk Hutchison, adding: “Pharos’ vision for RWAfi aligns with our commitment to transparent and scalable credit systems. Together, we are creating a powerful infrastructure for structured lending products, better risk pricing, and more accessible yield opportunities across both institutional and retail markets.” The phrase “RWAfi” is significant here. It’s an attempt to combine the best bits of DeFi – global access; composability; money markets – with the compliance and professionalism that characterizes TradFi. Once assets have been tokenized and made tradable onchain, there’s a lot more that can be done with them than simply swapping them. Lending is the most obvious DeFi-native use case to give the RWA treatment, allowing institutions and pro investors to use their assets as collateral and borrow against them or lend them to counterparties. DeFi Dressed Up There’s an array of DeFi protocols out there offering yield and novel financial primitives galore, but the majority are unsuited to institutions, who are required to tread carefully when transacting onchain. While recent legislation such as the GENIUS Act has made it safer for Wall Street firms to enter the onchain economy, they are obliged to do things by the book – which is why solutions such as that being developed by Morpho and Pharos hold so much promise. Pharos is preparing to deploy a number of institutional-focused vault launches and capital deployment frameworks, and this is where Morpho will be involved initially by helping refine the vault designs. The integration of Morpho's lending infrastructure expertise will support composability with Pharos’ existing infrastructure. In the process, it will showcase the sort of financial primitives that RWAs can support, allowing LPs and asset issuers to generate yield and efficiently put their capital to work.

Key Takeaways: Bo Hines is stepping down as executive director of the White House Crypto Council. During his tenure, the council advanced US crypto policy but fell short on its strategic Bitcoin reserve plans. Hines proposed revaluing US gold holdings to fund Bitcoin purchases without increasing public spending. Hines, appointed in December 2024, confirmed the move on Saturday , expressing gratitude to the crypto community and crediting his collaboration with AI & Crypto Czar David Sacks for helping “position America as the crypto capital of the world.” A successor has yet to be officially named, though independent reporter Eleanor Terrett suggested deputy director Patrick Witt is the leading candidate. Hines-Led Council Shaped US Crypto Policy With July Regulatory Plan Under Hines’ tenure, the council played a key role in shaping US crypto policy, including a July report outlining a regulatory action plan for digital assets. However, the group faced criticism for falling short on its strategic Bitcoin reserve initiative. In January, President Trump signed an executive order establishing both a national crypto stockpile and a strategic Bitcoin reserve. The order prevents the government from selling its BTC holdings and requires “budget-neutral” methods to acquire more, meaning no additional public spending. New BTC can only be obtained through asset seizures or other non-budgetary avenues. Hines proposed one such method in March, suggesting the US revalue its gold holdings, currently on government books at $42.22 per troy ounce, closer to the spot market price of around $3,400. He argued that a portion of the revaluation gains could be converted into Bitcoin, expanding the reserve without increasing public expenditure. “As I return to the private sector, I look forward to continuing my support for the crypto ecosystem as it thrives here in the United States,” Hines wrote. Serving in President Trump’s administration and working alongside our brilliant AI & Crypto Czar @DavidSacks as Executive Director of the White House Crypto Council has been the honor of a lifetime. Together, we have positioned America as the crypto capital of the world. I’m… — Bo Hines (@BoHines) August 9, 2025 Trump Administration Pushes Pro-Crypto Agenda The Trump administration advanced its pro-crypto agenda this week with a series of policy and regulatory moves. President Trump signed an executive order urging regulators to remove barriers that prevent 401(k) plans from including alternative assets such as cryptocurrencies. If implemented, the reforms could allow millions of Americans to allocate retirement funds to Bitcoin and other digital assets through regulated channels. Trump also nominated economist Stephen Miran , a digital asset advocate, to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, signaling continuity in his administration’s pro-crypto stance. The announcement coincided with Bitcoin climbing back above $117,000, highlighting the link between policy developments and market sentiment. In a separate executive order, Trump moved to end “debanking” practices that target lawful crypto firms. The Blockchain Association praised the measures as a “historic shift” that would expand consumer choice, empower wealth-building, and reduce operational barriers for blockchain businesses. The SEC added to the positive momentum by clarifying that certain liquid staking models, such as those involving receipt tokens like stETH, are not securities. SEC Chair Paul Atkins reinforced his commitment to keeping crypto innovation in the U.S., pledging a proactive approach to regulation and a shift away from enforcement-led policymaking.

The asset’s price is trying to finally break $4,200. Fresh ETF inflows and a nine-year low in exchange balances point to further gains, though an RSI above 70 signals the possibility of a short-term cooldown. Whales Filled Their Bags The price of Ethereum (ETH) has been on a significant uptrend in the past month, rising by almost 50% to just south of $4,200. The resurgence was aligned with a massive accumulation from whales (investors who hold between 10,000 and 100,000 coins), who bought more than 1.8 million tokens during that timeframe. The USD equivalent of the stash is over $7 billion, while this cohort of market participants now controls 28.5 million assets, or roughly 23.6% of ETH’s circulating supply. Purchases of this type leave fewer coins available on the open market and could propel a further price rally (should demand remain steady or head north). The whales’ activity is also closely monitored by smaller players who might decide to mimic their move and distribute fresh capital into the ecosystem. Shortly after revealing the size of the accumulation, the popular X user Ali Martinez made a highly bullish price prediction. He argued that $6,400 becomes “a magnet” if ETH breaks above $4,000. Other optimistic analysts include CryptoELITES and Crypto GEMs. The former set the next target at $4,500, whereas the latter envisioned a price increase beyond $5,000 this summer. Observing These Factors At the start of the month, spot Ethereum ETFs experienced significant outflows; however, over the past three days, capital has begun flowing back into the funds. This suggests that investor interest remains solid. Spot ETH ETF Inflows, Source: SoSoValue Next on the list is the amount of ETH stored on crypto exchanges, which recently dropped to a nine-year low. This development suggests that many investors have shifted from centralized platforms toward self-custody methods, which reduces the immediate selling pressure. ETH Exchange Reserve, Source: CryptoQuant On the other hand, ETH’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) has climbed to bearish territory of 70. The technical analysis tool measures the speed and magnitude of recent price changes, and traders use it to spot potential reversal points. Readings above 70 indicate that the valuation has soared too rapidly in a short period and could be a precursor to a pullback. Anything below 30 is considered a buying opportunity.

The update confirmed that after nearly five years of litigation, both Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have withdrawn their respective appeals, formally concluding the long-standing lawsuit. According to Uphold, the resolution leaves in place the 2023 federal court ruling that determined XRP sales on secondary markets do not constitute securities transactions.

Key contributing factors identified by Uphold include recent U.S. policy developments, such as the new rule for 401(k) retirement accounts crypto exposure , and the nomination of a new Federal Reserve official who has expressed criticism of the dollar’s current strength. These policy shifts, according to the exchange, appear to have influenced investor sentiment toward digital assets, with XRP leading gains. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Current Price Levels and Technical Indicators As of the report’s release, Uphold noted XRP trading at approximately $3.31, showing resilience after briefly dipping from mid-week highs. The weekly trading range was recorded between a high of $3.33 and a low of $3.18. Uphold’s technical analysis pointed to a constructive market structure, with the asset maintaining an ascending channel pattern. The exchange also reported a notable increase in on-chain transaction volume following news of the SEC case resolution, interpreting this as a sign of renewed market interest. The report advised market participants to monitor the $3.30 to $3.35 range for potential breakout activity, suggesting that August could bring continued momentum if current trends hold. Uphold concluded its analysis by raising the question of whether the legal resolution will be sufficient to drive XRP into its next phase of adoption and price growth, or if broader macroeconomic pressures will continue to influence the market’s trajectory. While the end of the Ripple-SEC case marks a significant legal milestone, the exchange noted that market behavior in the coming weeks will be critical in determining whether the momentum can be sustained.

Technical indicators suggest the asset has moved above the bullish cup and handle formation, which now points to SOL reaching $1,315, according to crypto analyst Ali Martinez in an X post on August 9. A cup and handle is a bullish chart pattern where a rounded bottom (cup) signals accumulation, followed by a short dip or sideways move (handle) before a breakout that often continues the uptrend, with targets based on the cup’s depth. SOL price analysis. Source: TradingView In Solana’s case, the cup began forming after the token’s steep decline from its 2021 highs, bottoming out around $8 in late 2022. Over the following months, SOL steadily recovered, completing the cup by mid-2024 and then forming the handle, a descending channel that capped the price below $200. The recent breakout above this handle has activated the bullish target, with Fibonacci extension levels supporting the possibility of a run toward $1,315. The analysis highlighted key intermediate resistance levels at $380, $752, and $1,048 before reaching the projected target. Currently trading near $180, Solana would need to rally over 630% to hit the $1,315 goal. If it were to reach this target, the asset would command a market cap of about $710 billion, potentially ranking as the second-largest cryptocurrency if Ethereum saw minimal growth over the same period. Solana price analysis By press time, SOL was trading at $179.37, down about 1.7% in the last 24 hours. Over the past week, however, the asset has gained 11%. Solana seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Notably, at its current price, Solana is well above its 50-day SMA of $166.04 and 200-day SMA of $156.12, signaling strong bullish momentum. The 14-day RSI at 57.16 shows the asset is in a healthy range, leaving room for further gains without immediate overbought risk.

According to blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs, the group, which is still relatively new, has become a key player in the underground cybercrime world. TRM Labs revealed that Embargo operates under a ransomware-as-a-service model, hitting critical infrastructures across the United States. The report revealed that the group has hit hospitals and several pharmaceutical networks in numerous states. Some of its victims include American Associated Pharmacies, Georgia-based Memorial Hospital and Manor, and Weiser Hospital in Idaho, noting that the ransom demands have reached upwards of $1.3 million. TRM Labs investigations uncover Embargo’s operations According to TRM Labs , its investigations uncovered that the group might have sprang up as a rebranded version of the infamous BlackCat (ALPHV) operation. The said group disappeared earlier this year after it was involved in an exit scam. An exit scam is a kind of rug pull where individuals in charge of a project disappear with user funds without any traces. Using the Rust programming language, operating similar data leak sites, and exhibiting on-chain ties through shared wallet infrastructure, TRM Labs noted that both entities share a technical overlap. According to reports, about $18 million of illegal proceeds belonging to Embargo still lie dormant in unaffiliated wallets. Analysts believe that this tactic is used to delay detection or seek better exploit opportunities in the future. Embargo uses a network of intermediary wallets, exchanges that pose high risks, and sanctioned platforms, including Cryptos.net, to hide transaction trails and obscure funds. From May through August, TRM Labs said it traced at least $13.5 million stolen by Embargo across various virtual assets service providers, with more than $1 million moved using Cryptex alone. While Embargo does not use the aggressive tactic deployed by groups like LockBit or Cl0p, the group has adopted a double extortion tactic. It uses system encryption and threats to leak sensitive data to coerce its victims into paying the ransom. In some other instances, the group has leaked names of individuals involved or the stolen data to show its seriousness and increase pressure. Emargo goes after high-stakes targets The group always targets sectors where downtime proves costly to their operations, including industries in sectors like healthcare, manufacturing, and business services. It has also been shown that it has a preference for victims based in the United States, considering the fact that they tend to have the capacity to pay on time, as the downtime may prove costly to their operations. Meanwhile, the United Kingdom has announced plans to ban ransomware payments for all public sector bodies and critical national infrastructure operators. These sectors include energy, healthcare, and local councils. The proposal will introduce a prevention regime that will require the victims outside the ban to report any intended ransomware payments to the authorities. The plan also includes a mandatory reporting system where the victims are required to submit an initial report to the government within 72 hours of an attack and a detailed follow-up in the next 28 days. According to a previous Chainalysis report, Ransomware attacks dropped about 35% last year. The report claimed that it was the first time since 2022 that revenues from ransomware dropped that much. The report, which was released in February, mentioned that despite the drop, users still lost more than $800 million to the criminals. Chainalysis claimed that the causes of the drop included increased law enforcement actions, improved international collaboration, and a growing refusal by victims to pay.

As investors await the fallout for blockchain ecosystems, Remittix is quietly preparing to launch its beta wallet — a move that will ruffle the crypto payment sector. Hyperliquid Beats Solana in Monthly Revenue July also saw Hyperliquid surpass Solana in revenues, a sign of growing demand for decentralized high-performance exchanges. Hyperliquid trading volume exploded as liquidity suppliers opted for platforms offering deeper order books and less slippage. Solana, on the other hand, continues to lure developers but lost over 12% of its trading volumes in July. The action has most speculating whether the altcoin’s dominance of DeFi is under threat from newcomers like Hyperliquid. With speed of transactions, scalability, and gas fees determining factors in a market, traders are increasingly looking to low gas fee crypto options, especially for DeFi and crypto staking. Remittix Beta Wallet – Revolutionizing International Payments While exchange wars rage, Remittix (RTX) is cutting a different path. At $0.0895, the token underpins a cross-chain DeFi project that aims to bridge mainstream finance and crypto. Its beta wallet launch in Q3 2025 is set to compete against current giants like Coinbase, Metamask, and Binance. The Remittix wallet will support direct bank-to-crypto payouts in 30+ countries, encompassing over 40 cryptocurrencies and 30 fiat currencies at its launch. Real-time FX conversion and clear fees make it a crypto that is addressing real world use cases, not speculation.

Over 15000 investors have already invested in the project’s ongoing presale, and over $14.25 million has been raised. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already in Presale Phase 6 at the price of $0.035, which is up 16.67% from the last phase. Phase 7 will include a 14.29% price increase to $0.04. While Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to draw headlines as a meme-turned-mainstay, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly building traction with its decentralized credit protocol. Dogecoin’s Forecast: Navigating Meme-Coin Momentum in 2025 Dogecoin (DOGE) currently trades at $0.223, reflecting a recent surge driven by significant whale accumulation and heightened trading volume. Analysts observe a bullish setup for DOGE in August, including technical indicators like golden cross formations and strong support near the $0.19–$0.21 range, with forecasts suggesting a possible rally toward $0.25–$0.30 if sentiment holds. Longer-term projections vary broadly, from conservative averages near $0.25–$0.30 by year-end to more optimistic targets of $0.52 or higher, though such outcomes would likely require sustained momentum or new catalysts. As the broader crypto market pivots toward functional DeFi offerings, DOGE remains in view, even as utility-first platforms like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) begin drawing growing attention. Mutuum Finance Phase 6 Presale is Live Now Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has progressed to the sixth stage of its presale at $0.035 after stage 5 sold out early. The price will spike to $0.04 in the next phase, a 14.29% price jump. Mutuum Finance holders could get over 400% profit as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gains traction in the market. The presale itself has already surpassed $14.25 million and attracted over 15000 individual investors as of today, highlighting the project’s accelerating velocity. Secured by CertiK and a $50K Bug Bounty Program Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is launching a USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum. In addition, the project has a 95.0 trust score from a CertiK audit. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty. The bounty is classified into a four-severity model: critical, major, minor and low.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised over $14.25 million and brought in more than 15,000 investors, proving strong market traction ahead of its launch. Priced at $0.035 in Phase 6, the token will increase 14.29% to $0.04 in Phase 7, positioning early buyers for potential gains exceeding 400%. Backed by a 95.0/100 CertiK audit score, a $50K bug bounty program, and a USD-pegged stablecoin in development, Mutuum Finance combines security, innovation, and real-world DeFi utility.

Amid this surge, other digital currencies are also gaining traction, hinting at potential explosive growth. This article delves into the promising cryptos poised for a breakout, offering insights into the next big opportunities. Ethereum Market Trends: Past Gains and Strategic Price Levels Ethereum recorded a 50.88% rise over one month and a 58.99% gain over six months, highlighting strong performance. A weekly increase of 19.87% underscores the coin’s strength and growing investor interest. Price swings reflected solid momentum, marking this period as one of sustained upward movement. The data indicate that Ethereum has consistently attracted attention, with price variations signaling both opportunity and the impact of market dynamics. Current trading data places Ethereum’s price between $2737 and $4302, with nearest resistance at $4904 and support at $1774. Price action suggests a market split, where bulls show strength in pushing prices upward while technical signals advise caution. A high Relative Strength Index near 72 indicates buying pressure but also overbought conditions. Resistance at $4904 could stall upward movement, while support at $1774 provides a safety net. Traders might consider entering on pullbacks or securing gains if momentum fades, with short positions being potentially profitable if prices fail to overcome the $4904 challenge. Solana Price Shifts: Short-Term Gains Amid Longer-Term Setbacks Solana ’s price increased by 15.31% over the past month and surged 11.41% in the last week, even as a 6-month trend showed a decline of 9.67%. Recent short-term gains contrast with the longer-term drop, highlighting volatility over different timeframes. The market has seen a mix of momentum and weakness over these periods, with recent price actions indicating an uptick in buying interest despite earlier losses. The current trading range for Solana sits between $142.76 and $204.07, with support at $113.22 and resistance at $235.84. A second support appears around $51.91 while a more distant resistance is near $297.15. Indicators show bulls are pushing prices upward short term, with a Momentum Indicator of 3.5 and an RSI of 56.98. The market lacks a clear trend, with price oscillating within boundaries. Traders might consider buying near support and targeting immediate resistance, while keeping stop-loss orders tight against sudden downturns. Hyperliquid Rally and Range Dynamics Past movements show HYPE that has made steady progress over the last month with a modest gain of 2.57%, while the half-year performance indicates a significant 81.65% increase. A recent rise of 10.81% in just one week reflects quick bursts of upward action within a generally stabilizing market. Price levels have been trading within a defined range, indicating consolidation after a considerable long-term rise. Current trading has Hyperliquid moving between $35.17 and $48.23, setting key levels for short-term positions. Resistance is noted at $55.58, which challenges upward movement, while support at $29.46 acts as a base for buyers. The indicators show a slight downward trend, with the RSI at 51.83, suggesting a neutral stance. Bulls and bears appear balanced, prompting trading strategies that focus on short-term moves within these established levels. Traders may consider entering near support and targeting resistance while maintaining stop-loss orders due to moderate volatility. Conclusion Ethereum is on track to reach its ambitious milestone of $5k. Those looking to diversify might also consider Solana (SOL) and HYPE . Solana continues to gain traction for its speed and low transaction fees. HYPE, though newer, shows promising potential due to its innovative features. Both could experience significant growth in the near future, building on the momentum seen in the market. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Investors and traders are watching closely to determine how high Arbitrum and Uniswap can climb during today's session. The excitement around these digital assets is palpable, sparking curiosity about their potential for growth. Uptrend Sparks Interest in Arbitrum Despite Mixed Longer-Term Growth Arbitrum 's performance over the past month has been strong, with a surge of nearly 28% as prices climbed from the low at $0.3043 to the mid-range of $0.5008. In the last six months, the coin has seen a modest gain of around 1.6%. Notable volatility during the monthly period indicates short-term bullish energy, though this enthusiasm is less pronounced when viewed over a longer timeframe. Recent indicators display moments of optimism, contributing to the price spike, yet longer-term momentum remains subdued. Current levels position Arbitrum with support at $0.2108 and resistance at $0.6039. Bulls are currently in control, as indicated by an RSI near 61, although the momentum indicator is only mildly positive and the Awesome Oscillator shows slight negativity. This situation suggests that while buyers are active, there is caution in the market and a clear trend has yet to emerge. Traders could consider testing the resistance around $0.6039 for potential breakouts or looking for buying opportunities near support levels if the price retraces. The second resistance at $0.8005 and the second support at $0.0142 are important boundaries to watch during trading sessions. Uniswap Price Surge Reflects Bullish Technical Setup Uniswap ’s price climbed 36.23% over the past month and increased 23.28% in the last six months, with weekly gains of 25.03% showing strong upward momentum. Price action remained within a comfortable range, allowing traders to build confidence as technical indicators tracked the shift. During this time, momentum indicators and oscillators showed modest strength, indicating steady interest without extreme overextensions. This growth has highlighted a phase of positive accumulation and regular trading activity, seen by many as a signal for potential further gains. Currently, Uniswap is trading between $6.68 and $11.87, with key technical levels influencing the market. The nearest resistance at $14.37 targets bulls, while strong support at $4.00 provides a safety net against dips. Trading within these boundaries allows for breakouts if bullish pressure persists, though caution is warranted near the second resistance at $19.56 to avoid overextension. Technical indicators, such as the Awesome Oscillator at 0.636, a momentum reading of 1.32, and an RSI of 65.64, suggest a bullish market trend, albeit nearing overbought territory. Traders may find opportunities in ranged entries and exits, utilizing these support and resistance levels for effective risk management. Conclusion ARB and UNI have shown strong potential for gains. ARB could hit $1.50 if the current momentum holds. UNI might reach up to $7.50 during the session. The market's positive sentiment supports these targets. Traders are closely watching these levels. Both coins offer interesting opportunities today. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Prominent players such as Chainlink , Optimism , and Arbitrum are making significant moves. How far can these coins ascend in value? This article delves into the potential growth and future prospects of these rising digital assets, promising key insights for keen investors. Chainlink's Strong Performance Fuels a Potential Breakout LINK recent performance reflects a striking surge in value with monthly gains nearing 50%, showcasing a swift upward movement over the last few weeks. The six-month growth of roughly 17% indicates a more gradual advance, with recent momentum accelerating sharply. Price movements have been dynamic, characterized by notable weekly increases that punctuate a steady upward trajectory. Current price levels span from $13 to just above $20, with immediate resistance at $24 and solid support around $9. Bullish pressure is evident, as momentum has driven prices higher in a short time, although the relative strength index approaching 70 suggests possible overheating. Traders may find opportunities near the lower end of the range, setting stop-loss orders just below support, while watching for a breakthrough past initial resistance. Oscillators indicate bullish dominance, but the absence of a clear trend necessitates careful position scaling amid market volatility. Optimism Price Action: Recent Surge Amid Long-Term Setback Last month OP showed a strong surge with a 35.51% gain, accompanied by a notable one-week jump of 23.11%. Over the last six months, the coin experienced a decline of 26.33%, marking a period of volatility and uneven performance. These price swings reflect a market that has seen rapid upward bursts countered by longer-term downward pressure. Historical figures point to dynamic investor sentiment and shifting market conditions that have alternately favored quick rallies and extended corrections. Current levels place significant focus on a support zone at $0.34, with immediate resistance at $1.04 and further pushback at $1.39. RSI stands at 63.48, hinting at moderately positive momentum but not overbought. Momentum and oscillator readings are soft at 0.09 and 0.01 respectively, suggesting buyers have room to grow yet should exercise caution. Bulls have some footing as prices rebound from lower levels, but the lack of a clear upward trend means price action will oscillate between key levels. Trading ideas suggest entering near support and targeting exits at primary resistance zones while monitoring for breakout or reversal signals. Uptrend Sparks Interest in Arbitrum Despite Mixed Longer-Term Growth Arbitrum 's performance over the past month has been strong, with a surge of nearly 28% as prices climbed from the low at $0.3043 to the mid-range of $0.5008. In the last six months, the coin has seen a modest gain of around 1.6%. Notable volatility during the monthly period indicates short-term bullish energy, though this enthusiasm is less pronounced when viewed over a longer timeframe. Recent indicators display moments of optimism, contributing to the price spike, yet longer-term momentum remains subdued. Current levels position Arbitrum with support at $0.2108 and resistance at $0.6039. Bulls are currently in control, as indicated by an RSI near 61, although the momentum indicator is only mildly positive and the Awesome Oscillator shows slight negativity. This situation suggests that while buyers are active, there is caution in the market and a clear trend has yet to emerge. Traders could consider testing the resistance around $0.6039 for potential breakouts or looking for buying opportunities near support levels if the price retraces. The second resistance at $0.8005 and the second support at $0.0142 are important boundaries to watch during trading sessions. Conclusion LINK , OP , and ARB are showing significant movement today. LINK has seen a steady rise, indicating increasing interest and potential. OP has demonstrated strong growth, reflecting user confidence and its expanding use. ARB is also on the rise, suggesting a positive sentiment in its community. The performance of these coins today suggests ongoing momentum. Their upward trajectory indicates a strong potential for further growth in the near future. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

HYPE - Which Cryptocurrency Will Deliver Higher Returns In September?,https://bitzo.com/2025/08/sui-vs-hype-which-cryptocurrency-will-deliver-higher-returns-in-september,"As September approaches, the spotlight is on SUI and HYPE , two cryptocurrencies with strong growth potential. Investors are keen to identify which digital asset will outperform the other in this competitive market. Anticipation builds around their potential returns, sparking curiosity about the factors that could influence their success. This article explores the dynamics driving both coins. Sui Price Trends and Key Levels Signal Future Opportunities Over the past month, Sui climbed 28.28%, with a solid 31.70% gain over the last six months. Price movements ranged between $2.70 and $4.49, showing steady upward activity with manageable fluctuations. The asset’s performance has attracted investor attention through gradual yet meaningful gains over these periods, indicating growing interest and resilience in its trading behavior. Currently, Sui sits within the $2.70 to $4.49 range, facing nearby resistance at $5.36 and a secondary hurdle at $7.16 while finding support at $1.78. Weekly performance shows a 14.18% increase, with a momentum reading of 0.1884 and an RSI near 58.02, suggesting moderate strength. The slightly negative Awesome Oscillator at -0.0277 indicates cautious sentiment. Bulls and bears appear evenly matched, with no clear trends developing. Traders might consider buying near support, targeting lower resistance levels while monitoring price behavior around $5.36 and $7.16 for potential short-term opportunities. Hyperliquid Rally and Range Dynamics Past movements show a coin that has made steady progress over the last month with a modest gain of 2.57%, while the half-year performance indicates a significant 81.65% increase. A recent rise of 10.81% in just one week reflects quick bursts of upward action within a generally stabilizing market. Price levels have been trading within a defined range, indicating consolidation after a considerable long-term rise. Current trading has Hyperliquid moving between $35.17 and $48.23, setting key levels for short-term positions. Resistance is noted at $55.58, which challenges upward movement, while support at $29.46 acts as a base for buyers. The indicators show a slight downward trend, with the RSI at 51.83, suggesting a neutral stance. Bulls and bears appear balanced, prompting trading strategies that focus on short-term moves within these established levels. Traders may consider entering near support and targeting resistance while maintaining stop-loss orders due to moderate volatility. Conclusion Both SUI and HYPE have strong potential for delivering returns in September. SUI's technology and growing community make it a contender for steady growth. HYPE, with its aggressive marketing and innovative features, might attract quick gains. Each has its strengths, appealing to different types of investors. While SUI offers a more stable approach, HYPE could provide higher but riskier returns. Investors should consider their own risk tolerance and investment goals when choosing between these two.

49856253,552604,1754826480,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49856253.jpeg,Best Crypto to Buy as El Salvador Welcomes Bitcoin Investment Banks,https://bitcoinist.com/best-crypto-to-buy-as-el-salvador-welcomes-bitcoin-investment-banks/,"El Salvador has passed a new Investment Banking Law allowing private investment banks to hold $BTC and other digital assets on their balance sheets. These firms can now offer crypto services to ‘sophisticated investors’ and even obtain a Digital Asset Service Provider (PSAD) license, which would enable them to operate as full-fledged Bitcoin banks . This could be a historic milestone for the country, opening the door for high-net-worth individuals to access regulated crypto investment opportunities. It’s also set to attract foreign investors from countries with rigid crypto laws, positioning El Salvador as a safe crypto haven. An influx of foreign Bitcoin would boost liquidity and give the nation the financial stability it needs. Read on as we explore how El Salvador is forging strategic international partnerships to cement its position as a global crypto hub. And we’ll also highlight the best crypto to buy now to ride this wave. El Salvador Doubles Down on Bitcoin Leadership El Salvador was quick to turn to crypto in an effort to avert its financial crisis. It became the first country to make Bitcoin legal tender in 2021 , mandating businesses to accept $BTC as a form of payment. Today, it ranks as the sixth-largest Bitcoin holder among nations, with 6,246 $BTC valued at $737M . President Nayib Bukele recently met with Bilal Bin Saqib, Pakistan’s state minister of crypto and blockchain, to discuss how countries under the IMF program can leverage the crypto boom to overcome internal financial challenges. Bolivia has also signed an MOU with El Salvador for crypto policy collaboration to accelerate adoption. Notably, Bolivia lifted its crypto ban in June 2024, allowing banks to deal in both crypto and stablecoins. All in all, El Salvador’s proactive approach proves that governments and institutions worldwide are actively working to normalize crypto, paving the way for mass adoption. For investors, the message is clear: momentum is building fast. If you want to get in before the crowd, here are 3 altcoins positioned to deliver outsized gains in this new era of digital finance. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – New Bitcoin L2 for Speed, Scalability & Web3 Compatibility Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is naturally the #1 choice for the best altcoins to buy now thanks to its unique mission of turbocharging the Bitcoin ecosystem with Solana-like performance. $HYPER is building a new Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin, which will act like a fast side lane assisting a busy highway, helping the OG blockchain pick up pace and shed some of its high costs. This will be achieved via Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration, which will allow developers to build smart contracts and decentralized applications on top of Bitcoin, bringing high speeds, low costs, and full Web3 compatibility. Moreover, a decentralized, non-custodial canonical bridge will enable $HYPER users to convert their native $BTC into Layer 2-compatible $BTC seamlessly. These ‘wrapped’ tokens can then be used to interact with the SVM-powered Web3 environment on Hyper’s Layer 2, including DeFi trading apps, NFT marketplaces, lending and staking protocols, DAO and governance platforms, and gaming dApps. Buying $HYPER now could yield potential gains of up to 2,400% in just the next few months, with the token is predicted to hit $0.32 by the end of 2025, according to our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction . Much of this eye-popping growth potential comes from the fact that $HYPER is currently in presale, meaning prices are at some of their absolute lowest. Right now, one $HYPER is available for just $0.0126, and the project has in total raised over $8.1M in early investor funding so far. Visit Bitcoin Hyper for more information. 2. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) – Revolutionary AI-Powered Crypto Subscription Platform SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is the native cryptocurrency of the SUBBD platform, a new crypto-run subscription ecosystem breathing new life into the $85B online content industry. Right now, creators can lose up to 70% of their hard-earned income to platform fees, while receiving little to no real support, let alone access to cutting-edge tech. SUBBD changes that by becoming the first major platform to offer creators modern AI tools, including image, video, voice, and profile generators, designed to help automate content production. Even better? This frees up creators to spend more time engaging with their fans. A true win-win for both sides. Speaking of fans, they can use $SUBBD tokens not only to unlock premium content on the platform but also send personalized content requests and tip their favorite creators. Holding $SUBBD also grants exclusive discounts on content and subscriptions, early access to beta features, and voting rights on key platform decisions, from creator onboarding to determining which features should be prioritized. Best of all, staking $SUBBD unlocks an entirely new tier of exclusive perks, including a fixed 20% APY, access to creator livestreams, daily BTS drops, and in-house content from SUBBD’s top talents. According to our SUBBD Token price prediction , it could reach $0.301 by year-end, delivering a staggering 400% return. The project has already amassed over $977K in presale funding, and here’s how you can buy $SUBBD for just $0.056125 apiece. Visit $SUBBD’s official website for more information. 3. TROLL ($TROLL) – Viral New Meme Coin Poised for Another Breakout TROLL ($TROLL) has been the top trending crypto of the last month, gaining a stupendous 880% during this time , showing just how wild meme coin rallies can be. The best part? It doesn’t look like it’s done yet. The token has just had a very healthy correction, dropping to the all-important 50% Fibonacci level, drawn from the low of $0.13416. Simply put, $TROLL has taken the much-needed breather after last month’s sprint, and according to this trading pattern, it could be well on its way to reclaim – and then even smash past – its all-time highs. It’s currently trading at $0.20953. So, what is $TROLL? Is it a treasury company that just mined a gazillion $BTC? Or cutting-edge technology that can break AI? Nope. It’s just a meme coin. Plain and simple. Based on the rampant internet phenomenon of trolling, which is the act of provoking or mocking others online, often for humorous or satirical effect, $TROLL has a natural hook, something that instantly drew crypto degens toward it. Wrapping Up With El Salvador now allowing private investment banks to hold Bitcoin and offer crypto services to sophisticated investors, it’s a clear sign that the big players are going all-in on $BTC. So, if you want to fully capitalize on this momentum, consider loading up on low-priced, high-upside tokens like $HYPER and $SUBBD , aka projects poised to ride the next big wave in the crypto market. That said, kindly note that none of the above is financial advice. Crypto investments are inherently risky, and you must always do your own research before investing.",Crypto News,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|REGULATION|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-10 11:48:00

Algorand - Which Cryptocurrency Will Create Superior Returns In September?,https://bitzo.com/2025/08/near-protocol-vs-algorand-which-cryptocurrency-will-create-superior-returns-in-september,"August is here, and September is on its way, two cryptocurrencies are sparking interest among investors. Near Protocol and Algorand are both competing to deliver impressive gains. This article explores which of these digital assets holds more promise for creating significant returns this month. Stay tuned to discover the factors that could drive their performance and elevate one over the other. NEAR Protocol: Short-Term Gains Amid Long-Term Volatility NEAR past month performance shows a notable increase as prices climbed by around 19% and the weekly change reached 15.77%. Over the past six months, however, the coin has seen a decline of roughly 12%. These movements indicate a period of strong short-term recovery combined with a longer-term pullback. Price action suggests that despite recent gains, the coin has struggled to maintain its higher levels when viewed on a broader timescale. The historical trend reflects volatility, with rapid rallies being offset by more extended downturns, emphasizing the coin’s sensitivity to market cycles and investor sentiment. Currently, the trading range is between $2 and $3.08, with the nearest resistance at $3.63 and the next hurdle at $4.71. The nearest support is at $1.47, with an additional cushion at $0.39. Price indicators show a moderate momentum reading at 0.135 and an RSI near 57.9, suggesting buyers are active despite slight bearish hints from the oscillators. There is no clear trend, with bulls making inroads within the established range while bears impose pressure from previous lows. Traders might consider buying near the support level and looking to take profits as resistance is approached, monitoring short-term movements and the potential for a breakout or reversal in sentiment. Algorand Price Dynamics: Past Trends and Current Market Signals Algorand experienced a strong surge over the past month with a price gain exceeding 41%, but over the last six months, it registered a slight decline of about 1.37%. A week's increase of 15% set early positive momentum that led to brisk buying interest, followed by volatile swings as traders reacted to shifting market sentiment. Price behavior suggests that short-term catalysts have spurred a recovery while longer-term performance remains mixed. Indicators point to the coin benefiting from recent buyer enthusiasm even as mixed signals persisted in the broader timeframe. Current trading activity for Algorand shows prices ranging from $0.1637 to $0.3307, with defined support at $0.0833 and resistance at $0.4172, plus an additional resistance at $0.5841. Bulls have pushed the asset upward in recent days, indicated by a favorable monthly gain of over 41% and a weekly surge of 15%, while bears remain present. Although short-term momentum appears positive, the half-year performance of a slight decline of 1.37% hints at underlying caution. The Awesome Oscillator at -0.0025 reflects a balance between buying and selling pressure. Some traders may consider buying near support while waiting for a breakout above resistance, while others might opt for short-term trades to exploit volatility as bulls and bears contest market control. Conclusion NEAR and ALGO both offer unique features and potential for growth. NEAR stands out with its user-friendly interface and strong developer support. ALGO is known for its quick transactions and low fees. Both coins have active communities and ongoing developments. September may see fluctuations, but both have potential for significant returns. Investors could benefit from keeping an eye on updates and partnerships for both NEAR and ALGO. Each coin has its strengths, making them worthy of consideration.

Prices can skyrocked and tumble just as quickly, testing even the most experienced veterans. When a crash hits, portfolios can bleed value overnight – but that doesn’t have to mean disaster. With the right mindset and strategies, it’s possible not only to protect your capital but also to turn volatility into opportunity. Many analysts say that in times like these, the most prepared investors are the ones who walk away stronger. Interestingly, some experts are pointing to upcoming listings – including MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is forecast by crypto analysts to have up to 68x ROI growth potential after its debut – as examples of how downturns can set the stage for extraordinary gains. 1. Keep a Cool Head During Sell-offs The worst thing you can do in a market crash is panic. Selling assets out of fear often means locking in losses at the bottom, only to watch prices rebound soon after. Instead, stick to your long-term investment plan and remember that downturns are a normal part of any market cycle. Emotional trading rarely ends well. 2. Diversification Diversification is a safety net when markets turn sour. Don’t concentrate all your capital in a single token or asset type. In crypto, this can mean holding blue-chip assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, mixing in DeFi tokens, and keeping a portion in stablecoins. Outside crypto, some investors also keep positions in stocks, bonds, or cash to balance risk. 3. Use Stablecoins as a Shelter When volatility surges, stablecoins can help you protect your assets without cashing out of crypto entirely. Pegged to the US dollar or other stable assets, they protect capital while keeping funds in the ecosystem. You can also put them to work through lending platforms or yield farming, generating passive income while waiting for market conditions to improve. 4. Make the Market Work for You With DCA Trying to buy at the exact bottom is mission impossible – it can happen but it is pure luck. Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) takes the guesswork out by investing the same amount at regular intervals. 5. See Opportunity in the Downturn Crashes can be clearance sales for quality assets. Investors who identify strong projects with solid teams, real-world use cases, and healthy funding often find themselves rewarded when markets recover. Advanced traders might explore short positions or derivatives – but these strategies carry higher risks and demand experience. Why This Hidden Crypto Is Getting Attention Now During volatile periods, projects with momentum and strong community backing tend to stand out. MAGACOIN FINANCE has been building significant buzz ahead of its upcoming listing, with analysts projecting as much as a 68x upside for those who position early. With limited access in the initial phases and a growing investor base, it’s emerging as a high-potential opportunity for those seeking big returns in the next bull cycle. Final Thoughts A crypto crash can shake your confidence, but with discipline, diversification, and a long-term view, it doesn’t have to destroy your portfolio. Market slumps often lay the groundwork for the next bullish wave – and those who stay prepared are ready to seize the moment. Just as many are watching MAGACOIN FINANCE for potential breakout gains, staying alert and strategic ensures you’re positioned for the rebound rather than sidelined by fear.

The legislation, passed on August 7, classifies investment banks separately from commercial lenders, giving them broader powers to hold Bitcoin and other digital assets on their balance sheets. BREAKING: El Salvador approves Investment Banking Law. A new legal framework will allow specialized investment banks to operate in the country — regulated, supervised, and focused on complex financing and digital assets like #Bitcoin . #ElSalvador #DigitalAssets … pic.twitter.com/9ourGCt5d3 — NODEMAN (@nodemanbtc) August 9, 2025 Under the new framework, licensed institutions can operate in legal tender, foreign currencies, and digital assets — including BTC — but only with “sophisticated investors,” a category similar to accredited investors in the U.S. These banks will require at least $50 million in capital and will serve clients with market knowledge and a minimum of $250,000 in investable assets. Juan Carlos Reyes, president of El Salvador’s Commission of Digital Assets, said the law enables banks to operate entirely as Bitcoin-focused entities. This opens the door to tokenized bonds, stablecoin services, and even large-scale project financing through crypto-based instruments. Government allies believe the law will attract significant foreign capital, while critics argue the benefits will favor big business over everyday citizens. Strategic Partnerships Drive Crypto Adoption The pro-Bitcoin stance is not limited to domestic reforms. President Nayib Bukele recently met with Bilal Bin Saqib, Pakistan’s state minister of crypto and blockchain, to explore nation-level adoption strategies and energy policies to support mining. Regional cooperation is also expanding. On July 30, Bolivia’s central bank signed a memorandum with El Salvador’s regulators to promote cryptocurrency usage amid a severe dollar shortage. According to Tether (USDT) CEO Paolo Ardoino, such conditions are pushing Bolivians toward dollar-backed stablecoins as a viable medium of exchange. These developments suggest El Salvador’s strategy is as much about positioning itself in global financial networks as it is about internal market growth. The Investment Banking Law could act as a gateway for institutional-grade products, making the country an appealing entry point for global investors seeking regulated Bitcoin exposure. Bitcoin Technical Outlook: Eyes on $130K Bitcoin price prediction seems bullish as BTC is trading at $118,059 after a 0.28% daily gain, breaking out from a bullish flag pattern that formed over weeks of consolidation. The move is supported by an upward trendline that has consistently delivered higher lows since late June, with the 50-day SMA at $113,732 acting as a key dynamic floor. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Momentum indicators are pointing higher. The MACD has turned positive after a bullish crossover , while the RSI sits at 57, signaling room for further upside before overbought levels. The decisive break above $117,350, the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement, sets the stage for a test of $123,250. A close above that level could open the path to $127,000, with $130,000 as a medium-term target if buying pressure holds. #Bitcoin Technical Update BTC breaks out of bullish flag above $117,350, holding trendline + 50-SMA support. RSI at 57 leaves room to run. Next key levels: $123.25K → $127K → $130K. Pullbacks to $115K–$117K could be prime buys. #BTC #Crypto #Trading pic.twitter.com/Pfuhg2c2uU — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) August 10, 2025 If price retests support, $113,678 and $110,721 — corresponding to the 38.2% and 50% Fibonacci retracements — may attract accumulation. For traders, a potential setup could involve entering on dips between $117,000 and $115,000, placing stops below $110,000, and targeting $130,000. If macro tailwinds and ETF flows align with El Salvador’s institutional push, Bitcoin could be setting the stage for a much larger advance into year-end, potentially marking the start of another parabolic leg higher.

In his post, he pointed out that many Bitcoin millionaires achieved their status by purchasing the asset at around $1,000 and holding it for many years despite market volatility, major price drops, and prolonged uncertainty. These investors, he said, avoided the urge to take profits during downturns, even when the asset’s value declined by as much as 70%, ultimately seeing returns exceeding 100 times their initial investment. Van Code questioned why some investors struggle to maintain a similar approach when it comes to assets that he believes have even greater potential, such as XRP. According to him, an investor who purchased XRP at $0.01 would have achieved better percentage gains compared to early Bitcoin holders, reinforcing his view that patience and discipline are crucial for long-term success. BTC millionaire stories happened because people purchased at $1k and held for many years. The held through turmoil, major dumps, uncertainty. They held and avoided greed, they didn't ""take profits"" despite BTC dropping by us mach us 70%. These folks 100x their money. So… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) August 9, 2025 Viewing XRP as a Long-Term Fundamental Play He likened holding a solid cryptocurrency token to investing in a blue-chip stock, using Boeing as an example. In his analogy, Boeing’s stock experiences both growth and setbacks, including occasional significant declines, yet remains a strong long-term performer in its sector. Applying this reasoning to cryptocurrency, Van Code emphasized that his strategy is based on evaluating fundamentals, specifically identifying what real-world problem a token aims to solve. Regarding XRP , he stated that it is designed to address a significant liquidity problem in global finance. While acknowledging that the issue has not yet been resolved, he projected that XRP could reach its potential by 2030. At that point, he said, he would consider selling. Until then, his position remains unchanged. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Maintaining Discipline and Avoiding Emotional Decisions Van Code also stressed that once he makes a purchase, he does not engage in buying dips or adjusting his position based on short-term market movements. He described his investment plan as fixed at the time of entry, ensuring that emotional responses to market conditions do not interfere with his long-term vision. He mentioned that while he continues to look for other promising crypto projects, he has yet to find technology that excites him as much as XRP’s underlying capabilities. He attributed this confidence to his research methodology, which involves reading documentation, technical notes, and API interfaces to assess a token’s real-world application potential. He contrasted this with what he sees as a common reliance on YouTube personalities or paid trading signal services, which he considers a less reliable approach. Avoiding Endorsements but Recognizing Opportunities Van Code clarified that he does not endorse any token, including XRP , and has never advised others to buy it. While most of his commentary centers around XRP due to his assessment of its fundamentals, he said he would not buy at its current price of $3.30. Instead, he maintained that the best entry points were between $0.30 and $0.50, during which time he and others publicly identified it as a favorable range. Through his detailed explanation, Van Code reinforced his commitment to a disciplined, research-driven investment approach, prioritizing fundamentals and long-term problem-solving potential over short-term market sentiment.

While it has lost some of its gains, it remains in the green. Analysts attribute the rise to the launch of the KCS Loyalty Program, KuCoin's strong market share growth in the first half of 2025, and positive market sentiment towards the new mining product. The new KCS Loyalty Program allows users to lock up KCS through KuCoin's KCS Staking product, granting them access to exclusive privileges across the platform. These benefits include trading, earnings, payments, withdrawals, GemPool, and more.

While the token is approaching the $200 mark, another token, Remittix (RTX) , is building momentum before its first centralized exchange (CEX) listing. Priced at $0.0895, Remittix has already raised more than $18.5 million, having sold more than 586 million tokens. Solana Momentum Builds Solana has been one of the top performers of the current market cycle. Its quick transactions, low fees, and growing developer base make it more and more a destination platform for DeFi, NFTs, and other blockchain use cases. Investor sentiment for Solana Price Prediction has improved as the network continues to gain momentum in institutional and retail adoption. Its robust bullish trend is generating discussion regarding the potential to break the $200 ceiling in the short term. Remittix: Linking Crypto to Real World Payments While Solana takes center stage, Remittix is leaving its mark. The project’s purpose is to address one of the crypto space’s most significant problems — how difficult it is to move money from blockchain assets to regular bank accounts. Remittix enables users to remit cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, and XRP to bank accounts in more than 30 nations, with real-time FX conversion and openly disclosed rates. This positions it as an outlier among the emerging DeFi project landscape, particularly for freelancers, businesses, and cross-border remitters. Beta Wallet Launch & Presale Surge The latest reveal of the Remittix beta wallet — set to launch in Q3 2025 — has generated a tremendous buzz. The mobile-first wallet will feature instant transfers, fiat cashouts, and cross-chain interaction. The presale has been an absolute momentum-builder, with over $18.5 million raised and a 40% token bonus already active. RTX also offers 20% referral bonuses, building growth through communities. The $250,000 Remittix Giveaway has given another level of flair as the project is nearing its $20 million milestone. Why Remittix Is Taking Off Send crypto to bank accounts in 30+ countries 40% token bonus live now Over $18.5Million raised in presale Wallet beta goes live in Q3 2025 The Bigger Picture For those looking at the next big altcoin in 2025, Remittix checks all the boxes — practical real-world utility, low gas fee crypto transactions, and a strong roadmap to widespread adoption. Being a cross-chain DeFi project, it places it on the same level as some of the strongest new altcoin opportunities in the market today. While the Solana Price Prediction is a controversial topic, initiatives like Remittix show how early-stage investments in cryptocurrencies can offer strong potential — especially when they tackle real issues at scale.

Analyst Ali Martinez’s projections point to targets as high as $11. On-chain data like the bullish MVRV signal supports continued upward momentum. XRP has surged above a key technical pattern on the weekly chart, with analyst Ali Martinez identifying a bullish flag breakout that could pave the way for a significant rally. The formation, which took shape between late 2024 and mid-2025, followed an earlier price surge and represents a consolidation phase before the next leg upward. The breakout occurred near the $2.25–$2.30 range, just above the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level. Following the move, XRP climbed toward $3.40 before entering a short consolidation. At the time of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at around $3.23, holding above the breakout zone and maintaining its bullish structure. XRP Fibonacci Extensions Point to Double-Digit Target Using Fibonacci extension levels, Martinez projects two key upside targets: $5.75 at the 1.272 level and $11.20 at the 1.618 level.

Related Reading: Ethereum Hits $4,300, Restoring Vitalik Buterin’s Crypto Billionaire Status Though both assets have registered growth, US President Donald Trump’s long-time crypto skeptic, Peter Schiff, made it plain which one he would retain in case he were forced — and it isn’t Ethereum. ETH Pushes Past $4,000 Amid Strong Activity Ethereum moved past $4,000 in recent trading sessions, reaching a high for 2025. Whale transactions and heavier derivatives trading have been the fuel to this price action, according to reports. Volumes and open interest have also gone up, indicating healthy speculative demand. ETH even surpassed Bitcoin’s percentage appreciation in the previous week, further pushing eagerness up among its fans. Well Ether is up a bit since I recommed switch it into Bitcoin, but I still think the trade will work out. If fact, it was woring well initially, until Ether just rallied late last week. I have no interest in owning either, but if you put a gun to my head, I’d chose Bitcoin. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) August 9, 2025 Schiff, who is an economist and gold advocate, said Ether’s surge came after he had been recommending investors to transfer their ETH to Bitcoin. Though that tack apparently paid off at first, Ethereum’s late-week surge closed the gap. “I have no interest in owning either, but if you put a gun to my head, I’d pick Bitcoin,” Schiff said on X. Bitcoin Above $100k But Lags Behind In Terms Of Market Share Despite the ETH rally, Bitcoin has kept its position as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and the most widely adopted by institutions. It is still above $100,000, buoyed by spot Bitcoin ETF inflows and corporate treasury buying. Market share statistics from CoinMarketCap, however, indicate that Bitcoin’s dominance had dropped to 59%, which is 4.90% less from last month. Ethereum’s share has grown to 12%, up 3.25% in the same period. Altcoins combined have increased their slice to 25%, a gain of 1.50%. Abrupt Shift From June Peaks Bitcoin dominance hit an annual high of 65% on June 27, 2025, then retreated during the following weeks. Dominance was at 61% a week ago. The year low hit 53% during December 2024, which means current levels are still much higher than that low but still trending downwards. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Still King Of Capital Inflows, According To Michael Saylor Ethereum, for its part, has continued to consolidate more, nearing the top of its yearly range. Whether it holds there or not will be a function of institutional positioning, macro trends, and continued trading momentum.

Reports from Koi Security reveal the group is running a coordinated campaign that mixes malicious browser extensions, malware, and scam websites — all under one network. Extensions Turned Into Wallet-Stealing Tools Instead of focusing on just one method, GreedyBear has combined several. According to Koi Security researcher Tuval Admoni, the group has deployed more than 650 malicious tools in its latest push. This marks a sharp rise from its earlier “Foxy Wallet” operation in July, which involved 40 Firefox extensions. The group’s tactic, called “Extension Hollowing,” starts with publishing clean-looking Firefox add-ons such as video downloaders or link cleaners. These extensions, released under fresh publisher accounts, collect fake positive reviews to appear trustworthy. Later, they are swapped for malicious versions impersonating wallets like MetaMask, TronLink, Exodus, and Rabby Wallet. Once installed, they grab credentials from input fields and send them to GreedyBear’s control servers. Malware Hidden In Pirated Software Investigators have also tied nearly 500 malicious Windows files to the same group. Many of these belong to well-known malware families such as LummaStealer, ransomware similar to Luca Stealer, and trojans acting as loaders for other harmful programs. Distribution frequently occurs through Russian-language websites that host cracked or “repacked” software. Targeting those seeking free software, the attackers reach far beyond the crypto community. Modular malware was also found by Koi Security, in which operators can add or swap functions without deploying completely new files. Fake Crypto Services Created To Swipe Data Based on reports , in addition to the browser attacks and malware, GreedyBear has established fraudulent websites that fake themselves as genuine cryptocurrency solutions. Some of these are said to offer hardware wallets, and others are fake wallet repair services for devices such as Trezor. Also on offer are fake wallet apps with good-looking designs that trick users into inputting recovery phrases, private keys, and payment information. Unlike standard phishing sites that copy exchange login pages, these scam pages look more like product or support portals. Reports added that some of them remain active and are still collecting sensitive data, while others are on standby for future use. Investigators found that nearly all domains tied to these operations lead back to a single IP address — 185.208.156.66. This server acts as the campaign’s hub, handling stolen credentials, coordinating ransomware activity, and hosting scam sites.

Notably, BTC has rebounded from its 50-day moving average ( MA ) near $111,000, holding support for three straight days. This recovery has pushed prices toward the upper boundary of a descending channel, with resistance around $118,500, according to TradingShot in an August 8 TradingView post . Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Therefore, a decisive move above this level would confirm a bull flag pattern, similar to one seen between May 20 and June 20 that triggered a sharp rally. That breakout coincided with a bullish cross on the daily MACD, now close to repeating. TradingShot cautioned, however, that not all such setups have led to lasting gains. If confirmed, the breakout could send BTC to $140,000 in the short term, a roughly 25% gain from the breakout point. At the same time, the medium-term target, based on the 2.0 Fibonacci extension, is $148,000 by late September 2025. Bitcoin’s key price levels to watch Furthermore, analyst Michaël van de Poppe has noted Bitcoin’s momentum strengthened after breaking above $116,973, a key level for re-entering its prior trading range. This followed a rebound from the crucial $114,753 support, where liquidity was swept before buyers stepped in. His August 10 analysis pointed to the next upside test near $119,200, a key resistance that could open the path toward retesting all-time highs if cleared. However, he warned Monday could see a retracement to close the CME gap before further gains. Great move of #Bitcoin .

These bad actors typically use them to move the proceeds of criminal funds without their knowledge. Indian police recently apprehended 24-year-old waiter Ajay, who said he stumbled on an easy way to make money. In his testimony, Ajay said he thought he had found a way to make money on the side to supplement his income. Ajay, who lives in the winding lanes in Lucknow, said a friend introduced him to a crypto trader who offered him Rs. 20,000 (approximately $240) to allow him to use Ajay’s bank account for a day’s transaction. Ajay noted that after serious consideration, he felt tempted by the offer and accepted it. The next morning, the crypto traders sent several lakhs of rupees into his account, giving him instructions on how to withdraw them and how to meet up with the people who would take the cash. Indian authorities issue warnings to youths According to Ajay, within weeks of carrying out these kinds of services, the Indian police knocked on his door and demanded to see him. It was at that point that the police told him that the money he had been helping the crypto trader move was part of an elaborate international financial crime. They told him that the criminals were routing the funds through his account to mask their trail. After being apprehended by the Indian police, Ajay started helping them, pointing them in the right direction. Investigators said they were able to identify other account holders and middlemen involved in the syndicate that shared a link from Chowk, Indira Nagar, and Sushant Golf City to handlers out of Cambodia , Laos, Vietnam, and Thailand. Investigations carried out by the Crime Branch and Cyber Cell division of the Indian police in the past three months have uncovered dozens of mule accounts. These accounts, typically belonging to young boys and girls in the area, have been turned into tools to move illicit proceeds. Many of these account holders are regular people, with most of them working in restaurants, small shops, and contractual jobs. Others are college students who were hired with the promise of Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 30,000 in commission to lend their accounts to facilitators, who move cyber fraud proceeds into them. Some of these funds are moved to digital assets, especially USDT, using peer-to-peer networks. Police say operations are carried out on Telegram According to the Indian police, the operations are carried out on encrypted Telegram channels run by Chinese handlers. Local recruiters are often charged with collecting accounts, bypassing proper KYC . On the days of transactions, mule account holders are taken to the bank to withdraw these funds before handing them over to brokers who convert them into crypto. Most of the funds are from different kinds of cybercrime carried out across India. In the past month, police in Lucknow said they have tracked as much as Rs. 5 crore ($570,000) being laundered through such accounts. The networks avoid legal routes, disguising their activities as crypto trading so they can go under the radar without being noticed by authorities. Police said it has already detailed around 60 young men because their accounts were used as mules in cases involving crores of rupees. “These young people aren’t hardened criminals, but their actions enable large-scale fraud,” Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (Lucknow South) Rallapalli Vasanth Kumar told PTI. “Several youths have confessed regret, admitting they underestimated the legal risks,” he added.

MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of the fastest-growing crypto launches this year, and with its presale allocation now nearly sold out, analysts are calling this the final opportunity to enter before a potential breakout. The numbers speak for themselves: with daily growth across every major on-chain and social metric. But it’s not just about momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE is combining meme coin virality with real technical structure, smart tokenomics, and early exchange readiness — making it what many call 2025’s most complete early-stage token. Supply Is Capped, Interest Is Rising MAGACOIN FINANCE is built on scarcity. With a hard-capped token supply, the project avoids the endless inflation that often plagues meme coins. This cap is paired with a zero-tax trading model, removing barriers for volume while keeping the token liquid and attractive to both swing traders and long-term holders. The presale uses a tiered pricing system, where each allocation round fills at a higher price. That structure has added urgency — and it’s working. Allocation rounds are selling out faster each week as Telegram communities, referral links, and on-chain influencers continue to push awareness. This is no longer a quiet presale. It’s a live sprint — and those entering late may end up buying in at a significantly higher entry point post-listing. Built on Trust, Not Hype Security and trust are at the core of MAGACOIN FINANCE’s strategy. The project has already completed a comprehensive smart contract audit by HashEx, one of the industry’s most respected firms. A secondary audit by CertiK is also completed, reinforcing the protocol’s commitment to transparency and safety. Unlike many meme projects that rely purely on viral tweets and celebrity mentions, MAGACOIN FINANCE has built a thriving grassroots community . Engagement rates across X and Telegram have outpaced several launchpad darlings from earlier in the year. MAGACOIN FINANCE fully audited, trusted, and supported by a thriving community Investors aren’t just speculating — they’re staying. That level of retention signals deep trust, a rare metric in the presale space. Why This Might Be the Last Window As listing rumors begin to swirl, the remaining MAGACOIN FINANCE presale allocation is becoming scarce. Analysts tracking early inflow trends and wallet movements suggest that the project could be among the first major meme-to-infrastructure breakouts of the 2025 cycle. And for those chasing potential 20x, 35x, or even 50x returns — the presale window is likely the only chance to capture that kind of asymmetry before retail buyers flood in post-launch. Final Word: Don’t Miss the Rotation Crypto markets are cyclical — and presales often deliver the biggest moves when the timing aligns. With smart tokenomics, high-trust infrastructure, and accelerating momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now firmly positioned as 2025’s best presale opportunity.

BlockDAG is leading this push as it approaches the final stage of its presale. Alongside it are Mantle (MNT), Cronos (CRO), and Litecoin (LTC), each offering distinct strengths. This list looks at why these names are making waves this year, starting with the one driving the most attention. BlockDAG (BDAG): Rare Price Window, Trading Tools, and $1.1M Bitcoin Auction BlockDAG has taken a leading spot among the highest potential cryptos in 2025. Its closing presale phase blends rare pricing advantages with interactive tools and high-stakes events. Right now, it offers a $0.0016 entry, far below its current batch price of $0.0276. This gap points to an ROI potential of over 2,660% when compared with earlier batch growth. On top of pricing, BlockDAG (BDAG) gives access to a live trading simulation dashboard. Users can test strategies, see how trades execute, and simulate market activity before the coin is listed. This hands-on preview is uncommon in most presales. A further draw is its 10 BTC Auction, valued at about $1.1 million. Each presale purchase before August 11 raises a participant’s share in the pool. With $366 million raised and more than 24.8 billion coins sold, BlockDAG’s presale feels more like a complete market event than a standard launch. These combined factors place it firmly among the highest potential cryptos this year. Mantle (MNT): Modular Scaling with Strong Developer Base Mantle (MNT) holds its place among the highest potential cryptos with its modular Ethereum layer-2 infrastructure and deep ties to BitDAO. Built for performance at scale, Mantle uses an optimistic rollup design that enables high-throughput and cost-effective dApps to run on Ethereum. Its separation of execution, data availability, and settlement layers gives it scalability and flexibility, allowing upgrades without a full system rebuild. This structure appeals to developers and large-scale projects aiming for sustainable growth. Recent months have seen MNT gain attention through ecosystem grants and active community involvement. Major exchange listings and a growing developer network help maintain its visibility. While it does not offer the event-driven features seen in BlockDAG, Mantle remains a high-utility asset with lasting network relevance. Cronos (CRO): Bridging Exchange Use and Real-World Utility CRO, the native asset of the Cronos Chain and Crypto.com platform, is a steady contender among the highest potential cryptos due to its dual role. It drives transactions on the EVM-compatible Cronos blockchain while also delivering trading discounts, card perks, and cashback in the Crypto.com ecosystem. Its appeal comes from blending centralized and decentralized finance in one environment. Users can trade, earn yield, stake, and spend CRO directly, linking digital and real-world use. The brand’s high-profile sponsorships with sports events and arenas keep CRO in public attention. While CRO does not match the rapid presale momentum of BlockDAG, it benefits from trust, accessibility, and a strong network of integrated services across exchange, wallet, and payment features. Litecoin (LTC): Steady Performance with Halving Influence Litecoin (LTC) remains relevant in 2025, boosted by its recent halving event that reduced mining rewards and lowered inflation pressure. Historically, these events lead to notable price movement, and this year follows that trend. LTC’s strength is in its straightforward and reliable design. It delivers quick transaction speeds, low fees, and broad acceptance. Often called Bitcoin’s lighter counterpart, it is frequently used to test protocol changes before wider adoption. While it lacks the innovative features of Mantle or the presale-driven excitement of BlockDAG, Litecoin continues to offer consistent performance. It remains widely accessible, keeps a healthy hashrate, and stays supported by both development teams and its community. Closing View For those looking at the highest potential cryptos this year, BlockDAG offers a distinct mix of high ROI prospects, interactive trading simulations, and a $1.1 million BTC auction, while still available at $0.0016. MNT, CRO, and LTC each add value in their own ways through scalability, ecosystem reach, and long-standing reliability, yet BlockDAG combines early access features and presale incentives in a way the others do not. With over $366 million raised and 24.8 billion coins sold, its presale drive remains strong. As the August 11 global launch approaches, the limited chance to enter at a fraction of its listed batch price is nearing its end. In the race for the highest potential cryptos , timing and functionality both matter, and BlockDAG currently holds the lead. .

Among them, Cold Wallet, TOKEN6900, BTC Bull, and Snorter are grabbing attention for their unique features, potential, and community appeal. While some focus on short-term hype, Cold Wallet stands apart by creating a sustainable ecosystem built for real, everyday use. Here’s a deeper dive into what each presale has to offer and why Cold Wallet is leading the charge in 2025. 1. Cold Wallet: Earn Cashback Every Time You Use Crypto Cold Wallet is revolutionizing the crypto experience by rewarding users for their activity rather than penalizing them. This self-custody wallet provides real cashback in CWT tokens for every transaction, whether paying gas fees, swapping, or moving funds on-chain or off. The more CWT you hold, the higher your rewards, with Diamond-tier users earning up to 100% back on gas fees and 50% on swaps or ramps. The best part? No staking or locking up is required. Just hold the tokens, use them, and get rewarded. Currently priced at just $0.00998 per CWT, Cold Wallet ’s presale has already raised over $5.9 million, with 40% of the total token supply up for grabs. Early supporters also benefit from a referral program that offers up to 20% in CWT bonuses. Cold Wallet’s approach, where every transaction generates value for users, positions it as the top crypto presale in 2025. 2. BTC Bull: Airdrops Linked to Bitcoin’s Price Movements BTC Bull offers a unique reward system tied to Bitcoin’s price. Every time Bitcoin hits major milestones, such as $150K or $200K, holders of BTC Bull tokens receive airdrops. Currently priced at $0.002425, this presale has raised over $4 million, with expectations to hit $8 million before listings begin. The project also incorporates deflationary mechanics through token burns. For every $25K Bitcoin gains after $125K, BTC Bull tokens are burned, reducing supply and potentially increasing the token’s price. This connection to Bitcoin’s price action gives BTC Bull a solid utility angle, although its success depends heavily on Bitcoin’s performance. 3. TOKEN6900: Meme Potential with Built-In Virality TOKEN6900 is capitalizing on meme culture with its branding and viral appeal. Having raised over $1.69 million in its presale, this token launched at around $0.0064, with the price set to rise to $0.007125. Built on Ethereum, TOKEN6900 doesn’t offer much beyond community-driven excitement, but it taps into the same energy that propelled PEPE and DOGE into the spotlight. While it doesn’t provide the same utility as Cold Wallet, TOKEN6900 still catches the eye of meme enthusiasts and those betting on the power of internet culture. Analysts predict that if the hype continues, it could see returns up to 10x post-launch, making it one to watch for those looking to ride the wave of meme-based crypto. 4. Snorter: Telegram Tools for Solana Traders Snorter is designed for Solana traders, offering a Telegram-native bot that lets users trade, snipe, and copy strategies directly within the chat app. Raised over $2.6 million, Snorter is priced between $0.099 and $0.105, and focuses on providing faster trading access with safety features like honeypot detection, blacklist scanning, and mint trap alerts. With an 85% success rate in beta testing, Snorter has attracted Solana-based traders looking for a more efficient trading experience. By holding SNORT tokens, users unlock lower fees, some as low as 0.85%. Snorter’s focus on real utility for traders gives it a unique spot on the top crypto presale list in 2025, offering more than just meme value. Choosing the Top Crypto Presale Each of these top crypto presales brings something distinct to the table. TOKEN6900 plays on viral internet culture, BTC Bull ties rewards to Bitcoin’s price movements, and Snorter provides essential tools for Solana traders. However, Cold Wallet leads the pack due to its focus on rewarding users for participation, not just attention. Its innovative reward system for gas, swaps, and referrals without requiring staking sets it apart in 2025’s competitive presale landscape. With 150 presale stages and a starting price of $0.007, Cold Wallet offers the most significant potential upside for early adopters. It’s more than just a token; it’s the foundation of a model that’s already live and generating real value. If you’re looking for a crypto presale that rewards real action, Cold Wallet is the one to watch closely before its price increases again.

Let’s dig deeper. Business: Ripple has announced plans to acquire stablecoin payment platform Rail for $200 million to expand its global digital asset payment capabilities and strengthen its enterprise stablecoin offering. Web3 Stablecoins’ role in the shift from centralized lending to decentralized, Bitcoin-backed finance is unlocking capital efficiency by letting holders retain BTC exposure while accessing liquidity in a non-custodial, permissionless manner. As the crypto world holds its breath, Bitcoin Swift is racing toward the end of Stage 3, and the price has already surged past $4. BlockSack is a newly launched Layer 2 meme coin on the Base blockchain that's gaining serious attention as it blends bold storytelling with real tools like staking, NFT minting, and a trading bot, all powered by the BSACK token. BlockSack has become a magnet for projects building high-performance dApps without losing decentralization. $BSACK taps into that strength. In a year when many tokens struggled to maintain relevance, FUNToken ($FUN) has reached around $0.0188 at the time of writing after climbing from under $0.007 in early April. One of the most powerful forces behind FUNToken’s recent surge is its predictable, revenue-backed deflationary model , a system that rewards real usage with measurable scarcity. Decentralized perpetuals exchange gTrade has released version 10 (v10), its most significant upgrade to date, introducing a funding fee model that replaces the previous borrowing fee structure. The AI and gaming-focused blockchain infrastructure provider DAR Open Network is unlocking the full benefits of its expansive GameFi ecosystem with DAR Citizenship. RWA-focused Layer-1 blockchain (Mavryk), a global derivatives giant (MultiBank), a Dubai real estate company (MAG Group), and an institutional-grade custody leader (Fireblocks) have teamed up to make property ownership accessible to all by ambitiously targeting tokenizing $10 billion of property in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Aurora Labs has introduced the first cohort of startups to emerge from its six-week Aurora Blocks Incubator program to showcase what’s possible with its simple, no-code blockchain development platform. Bitcoin.com Casino has leveled up its community engagement with a social presence on Telegram, X, and Discord, as well as a streaming experience on Twitch and Kick to allow gamblers to share strategies, tournament updates, and gameplay clips. Security The team behind the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol CrediX Finance has disappeared just days after a $4.5 million exploit compromised the platform with the protocol’s official X handle and website going offline since August 4. Regulation The CFTC has launched a new initiative to allow spot crypto trading on federally registered exchanges, marking a key step toward unified federal oversight of digital assets. President Trump has signed an executive order allowing 401(k) retirement plans to include crypto and other alternative assets, opening the $12.5 trillion market to digital investments while raising concerns around investor protection and fiduciary responsibility. Dubai has officially approved its first regulated crypto options trading license , marking a significant regulatory milestone in its ambitions to position itself as a global hub for digital assets. China is set to approve its first fiat-backed stablecoin through Hong Kong’s new licensing regime, marking a significant policy shift aimed at expanding the renminbi’s global influence and reducing dependence on the US dollar. The SEC has clarified that staking receipt tokens issued under specific administrative conditions are not securities, offering key regulatory relief to liquid staking platforms. Former President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order that would direct federal agencies to crack down on banks allegedly denying services to crypto firms and politically conservative entities based on ideological grounds.

This is the biggest rally in nearly three years and is driven by retail enthusiasm, institutional accumulation and a supply backdrop shaped by staking. With sentiment so bullish, traders are now looking at $5,000 as the next big target. $ETH IS ON FIRE Up 42% in the past month and smashing through $4.2K This isn’t just a pump… this is a statement. The bull run is here. #ETH #Bitcoin #Crypto #BullRun #Solana #Ethereum #Trump #BREAKING #WLFI #Altseason #Bullish #XRP pic.twitter.com/mlIDRr1iFk — M̷̷O̷̷O̷̷N̷̷S̷̷H̷̷O̷̷T̷ S̷̷CO̷U̷T̷ (@Moonshot_scout) August 9, 2025 Retail is in Charge Social media sentiment is pointing to a retail-led rally. Hashtags like #buying , #bullish and #higher are appearing almost twice as often as their bearish counterparts #selling and #lower . According to Santiment, the bullish tone suggests strong retail participation but analysts warn that too much optimism can sometimes precede short term pullbacks. Key points driving retail sentiment: ETH prices breaking multi year resistance Increased coverage and hype in trading communities Fear of missing out (FOMO) driving new entries Institutions are Buying Large investors have also played a big role in the Ethereum rally . Blockchain data from EmberCN shows that between July 10 and early August, whales and institutions accumulated 1.035 million ETH worth $4.17 billion at an average price of $3,546. Just a slight adjustment for ETH We can see that ETH has broken through almost every previous resistance, like 4K ETF approvals and major network upgrades are fueling the rally On chain data shows whale accumulation at record levels Institutional inflows hit multi month… pic.twitter.com/FNPK8juZOx — Phuduc Dx (@DxPhuduc) August 10, 2025 This buying coincided with a 45% move from $2,600 to $4,000, showing the scale and timing of institutional positioning. This kind of accumulation is long term confidence with many of these buyers looking to capture upside as the Ethereum ecosystem grows and staking yields remain attractive. Ethereum Technicals: Bulls Eye $4,533 and Beyond Ethereum price prediction continues to be bullish even if ETH is consolidating at $4,192 after breaking out above $3,872 earlier this month. On the 4-hour chart, price action has formed a series of higher lows within an ascending channel, supported by the 50-period SMA at $3,768. The latest move has broken the 1.618 Fibonacci extension at $4,193, which is now acting as support. Ethereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Candlestick patterns show small bodied bars with long upper wicks, a sign of profit taking without structural breakdown. The RSI is 70.6, slightly overbought and increasing the chance of a pullback to $4,088 or $3,972 before continuing higher. The MACD is bullish and momentum is increasing. Fibonacci targets: Initial resistance: $4,391 Secondary target: $4,533 Extended target: $4,712 A daily close above $4,391 on good volume could trigger breakout buying and accelerate the move to $4,533. If ETH holds $3,972 on closing timeframes, the bigger picture trend is still intact and $5,000 is in play for the next few months. Supply Growth and Staking Ethereum’s supply reached 121 million on August 9, nearly three years after 120 million. The network mints 2,500-3,000 ETH daily but staking is absorbing most of it. 36.18 million ETH is currently locked in staking contracts, reducing liquid supply and inflation pressure. If demand and adoption keep up with supply growth, Ethereum’s rally could continue into year end if macro remains risk on.

Despite Nvidia clarifying that its products don’t have a “backdoor” or other security concerns, the company continues to receive criticism and scrutiny from defense-sensitive countries. China’s state media criticizes Nvidia’s H20 chips A Chinese state media-affiliated outlet has sharply criticized Nvidia’s H20 artificial intelligence chips, labeling them unsafe, technologically unimpressive, and not environmentally friendly. In an article posted Sunday on WeChat, Yuyuan Tantian, a social media account affiliated with the state broadcaster CCTV, claimed the H20 chips pose security risks, including the possibility of “remote shutdown” through a hardware “backdoor.” Prior to the latest post, China’s cyberspace regulator and People’s Daily, another influential state media outlet, also raised concerns and criticisms. “When a type of chip is neither environmentally friendly, nor advanced, nor safe, as consumers, we certainly have the option not to buy it,” the Yuyuan Tantian article stated . Nvidia has repeatedly denied that its products have backdoors or any similar remote access or hidden control mechanisms. The American chipmaking giant designed the H20 chips specifically for Chinese customers in response to U.S. restrictions on exporting advanced AI chips imposed in late 2023. The Trump administration banned sales of the H20 chips in April 2025 as trade tensions worsened, but it reversed that decision in July. On July 31, China’s Cyberspace Administration announced it had summoned Nvidia to discuss potential backdoor security risks. The administration pressed Nvidia to clarify whether or not such vulnerabilities existed. Soon after, the People’s Daily urged Nvidia to provide “convincing security proofs” to restore market confidence and address Chinese users’ concerns. Stakeholders make coordinated push to lift chip export controls According to reports earlier today, China wants the United States to relax restrictions on high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips. These chips are key components for data-intensive AI applications, and the restrictions would be relaxed as part of a potential trade deal ahead of a possible summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Unnamed sources familiar with the discussions told FT that Chinese officials have conveyed this request to stakeholders in Washington. The reports claim that Beijing is concerned that U.S. restrictions are hindering Chinese technology companies, including Huawei, from producing their own AI chips. The White House, the U.S. State Department, and China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the report. Successive U.S. administrations have maintained a strict hold on the export of advanced chips to China for national security and strategic competition concerns. These measures aim to slow Beijing’s progress in AI and defense technology development, while also limiting China’s access to cutting-edge semiconductor manufacturing capabilities. While these restrictions have constrained U.S. chipmakers from fully meeting the strong demand in China, despite it being one of the world’s largest semiconductor markets, the country remains a major source of revenue for American semiconductor companies.

His post draws on on-chain activity, banking connections, and emerging identity projects to paint a picture of a coordinated institutional build-out that extends far beyond a single ETF launch. The Core of Pumpius’ Claim Pumpius alleges that whale wallets displaying patterns consistent with “ETF seeding” have been moving hundreds of millions of XRP through RippleNet-linked custody hubs. He points to corridors involving Citi, BNY Mellon, and Standard Chartered—banks with documented links to BlackRock—as potential pipelines for this accumulation. He believes these transactions follow BlackRock’s typical strategy: accumulating assets over-the-counter (OTC) while retail investors are unaware, securing custodianship through reputable banking partners, and then filing for an ETF, which would drive market demand and increase the value of their holdings. BLACKROCK IS ALREADY INSIDE THE #XRP LEDGER. Everyone’s waiting for the “XRP ETF announcement.” They’re missing the real story: BlackRock has been accumulating quietly for months, long before they tell the peasants what’s coming. pic.twitter.com/yXcQOYpOEB — Pumpius (@pumpius) August 9, 2025 Verifiable On-Chain Activity Blockchain data reveals a surge in large-scale transactions on the XRPL since late 2024, with single transfers of hundreds of millions of XRP. Such movements can precede market-shifting announcements, but the identity of the parties behind these wallets is not publicly confirmed. While these transactions indicate substantial institutional activity, they don’t necessarily confirm BlackRock’s direct involvement. Institutional Custody Links One fact is clear: major custodians are increasingly present in the XRPL ecosystem. Ripple’s U.S. dollar stablecoin, RLUSD, launched in December 2024 with BNY Mellon as its reserve custodian. This is a major signal that traditional financial institutions are willing to hold XRPL-linked assets in regulated, institutional-grade custody. For large asset managers, this infrastructure is essential, as it bridges the compliance gap between traditional finance and blockchain-based assets. The BlackRock Question Publicly, BlackRock has not announced an XRP ETF and has stated it has “no plans at this time” for certain digital asset ETFs . While Pumpius’s scenario echoes the firm’s past ETF playbook—seen with gold in 2004 and Bitcoin in 2023, there is no publicly available evidence tying BlackRock to specific XRPL wallets or OTC trades. Until such evidence surfaces through regulatory filings, custody disclosures, or reputable blockchain forensics, the connection remains speculative. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRPL’s Strategic Positioning What is beyond dispute is the growing institutional utility of XRPL. The ledger is natively ISO 20022-compliant , aligning it with the messaging standards that global banks are expected to adopt in full by late 2025. Additionally, projects like DNA Protocol are building identity and genomic metadata anchored on XRPL, expanding its scope from cross-border payments to tokenized real-world assets, such as real estate, carbon credits, and government treasuries. This diversification could make XRP the “neutral bridge asset” Pumpius describes—capable of serving both public ETF flows and private institutional corridors. The Bottom Line Pumpius’s post connects confirmed events—whale transfers, banking custody partnerships, and XRPL’s ISO-ready infrastructure—with speculative conclusions about BlackRock’s immediate role. The verified facts suggest that institutional-grade plumbing for large-scale XRP integration is already in place, but the claim that BlackRock is actively accumulating remains unproven. For now, the prudent approach is to monitor three concrete indicators: an official SEC filing for an iShares XRP ETF, regulatory or custodial disclosures linking BlackRock to substantial XRP holdings, and independent wallet attribution by reputable on-chain analytics firms. Until those emerge, the story remains a compelling hypothesis—one that blends observable blockchain activity with the tantalizing possibility of a much larger institutional strategy quietly taking shape.

Despite this strong price level, key data points indicate that its momentum is cooling, which could lead to a pause before any further upward movement. One such indicator is CryptoQuant’s Bull Score Index, which fell from 80 to 60 following the recent peak. The drop suggests the market has entered a bullish cooldown phase, where overall optimism remains but momentum has softened. Signs of a Cooling Market This slowdown aligns with seasonal trends, as summer months often bring lower trading volumes and reduced enthusiasm. According to a CryptoQuant report , traders appear to be taking profits after the rally, which has weakened immediate buying pressure. The observation is supported by on-chain indicators like stablecoin liquidity. This metric, which tracks new capital flowing into crypto, has stalled and even shifted negative, indicating fewer fresh funds entering the market. While USDT liquidity increased by $9.6 billion over the past 60 days, its growth rate has slowed and now falls below average levels. This means capital inflows remain, but at a much slower pace than before. Another sign of weakening momentum is the traders’ unrealized profit margin, a measure of gains held but not yet realized, which has also declined. Many holders have taken profits, lowering unrealized gains and signaling reduced momentum. Currently, this margin stands at about 7.4%, declining and below its typical trend. Together, these factors suggest a potential short-term consolidation or mild price corrections. Valuation Metrics and Market Outlook Valuation indicators show the market balanced near a critical point between bullish and bearish zones. The Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator remains slightly positive but is close to turning negative. If bitcoin’s price weakens further, the indicator could drop below zero, pushing the Bull Score Index under 40. Such a move would mark the first formal bearish market since April 2023. Given these signals, the analytics firm sees bitcoin entering a cautious phase characterized by slowing momentum instead of a definitive reversal. Market participants need to stay alert for new developments that could spark renewed buying interest and trigger the next price surge.

This success resulted from a well-thought-out profit distribution model and the active work of bots. How was this achieved? Payouts were made possible thanks to Mevolaxy’s liquidity pool investment model. Users deposit their crypto assets into a common pool, allowing the platform to use them for high-frequency MEV operations, such as “sandwich” trading and other algorithmic strategies. The daily fixed payout system (averaging up to 0.87% per day) enables investors to see their actual return on investment. June was an especially successful month. Market volatility and activity provided the bots with numerous earning opportunities, and investors received stable, high returns. What does this mean for investors? Record payouts confirm that Mevolaxy is becoming a powerful tool for generating passive, stable income. Investors help the platform maintain liquidity and receive generous rewards for participating in the system. Mevolaxy’s ease of entry, transparent settlement model, and lack of need for trading experience make it an attractive choice for a wide audience. Additionally, all payouts are made in the cryptocurrency of the user’s choice. What’s next? After an impressive June, the Mevolaxy team has no plans to stop. Plans include expanding the liquidity pool, increasing the profit share for investors, and launching additional tools, including new MEV strategies. As interest in mevstake grows, Mevolaxy will continue to evolve and offer investors favorable conditions, strengthening its position as a leader in innovative DeFi income.

In 2027, it will range between $124.52 and $147.87, with an average price of $136.20. In 2031, it will range between $280.18 and $303.53, with an average price of $291.85. Hyperliquid is a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) . It has its own Layer 1 blockchain, and HYPE is its native token, which is used for staking, governance, and payments within the ecosystem. One of the key features of Hyperliquid, along with its high-speed platform, is that it offers crypto perpetual futures for trading by its users without the need to own the asset. The platform supports a number of cryptocurrencies, including but not limited to BTC, ETH, SUI, AVAX, and SOL, to name a few. Technically, the Hyperliquid blockchain is based on two protocols, namely HyperEVM and HyperBFT; combined, they help provide high-speed trading and Ethereum-based smart contracts with reliability. The Hyperliquid platform revolves around community participation, as token holders have voting rights to govern and influence developments taking place on the platform. On November 29, 2024, Hyperliquid conducted an airdrop of its native token, HYPE, but unlike other players, it was selective in allocating the airdrop to only 94,000 users with an average value of $45,000 to $50,000, making it one of the most worthy airdrops in crypto history. Let’s take a deep dive into what the future holds for the HYPE token in Cryptopolitan’s Hyperliquid price prediction for 2025 and beyond.

From a larger picture, the HYPE price increased to $43.66, gaining 1.53% of its total value in the last few hours, as it is still trending near its ATH. Is Hyperliquid a Good Investment? HYPE has growing utility, and its Ethereum compatibility helps it steal a share of DeFi industry. While the technical analysis can change from bullish to bearish, price predictions paint a different picture. However, a risk analysis is recommended. Will Hyperliquid reach $50? The current price action does not justify predicting a $50 target. However, in the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, and if the token maintains its price levels, a recovery can be initiated. It can be expected that HYPE will reach above $50 by October 2025. Can Hyperliquid Coin reach $100? According to Hyperliquid price prediction, HYPE price might surpass $100 in 2026. The highest price HYPE could attain that year is expected to be above $108.96. Will Hyperliquid reach $500? According to crypto analysts’ price predictions, Hyperliquid may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like far target. Will Hyperliquid reach $1000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, Hyperliquid is unlikely to reach $1000 before 2031. How high can Hyperliquid go? The highest expected price for Hyperliquid is $303.53, which it will achieve in 2031. Does Hyperliquid have a good long-term future? Hyperliquid is trading higher than its December 2024 price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current price and a favorable future valuation of $303.53 by the end of 2031, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment.

Hyperliquid Historic Price Sentiment Hyperliquid price history: Coingecko The native token of Hyperliquid, called HYPE, was launched on November 29, 2024, through an airdrop targeted at a limited number of only 94,000 users. This was one of the most lucrative airdrops, with an average allocation of value of $45,000 to $50,000. Hyperliquid kept away from venture capitalists, who usually get most of the tokens in usual airdrops; rather, 76% of the supply was slated for user-centric initiatives. Usually, tokens dump after airdrops until the market momentum picks up, but Hyperliquid’s approach helped garner trust, and the token jumped from $4 to $35 from November 2024 to December 22, 2024. Hyperliquid’s market cap improved significantly during this period, reaching above $8 billion, as it received super positive market sentiment. In late December and early January 2025, the HYPE token corrected down to $20.24, shedding significant value as per crypto market data. Price stabilized through February as it traded in a range of $19.92 to $27.42 before taking a dive at the end of February. HYPE stumbled to $12.34 by mid-March, and it touched a low of $10.21 on April 7, 2025. The token saw nothing but improvement in the remainder of the month of April, and its price surged to $18.57 by the end of the month. On June 16, 2025, HYPE reached an all-time high of $45.57. A month later, on July 14, it marked another all-time high of $49.75, and at the start of August, it is trading near the $38 range.",Crypto Price Predictions|HYPE|Hyperliquid,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|AIRDROP|ETH|ALTCOIN|USDC|ZRX,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-10 13:27:18

Shiba Inu’s price moves on burns and community pushes, while BONK coin trades on Solana-driven speculation. Unilabs stands out with its UNIL token, which has doubled from $0.0041 to $0.0097. Over 30% of platform revenue goes to holders, creating steady income and lowering sell pressure. This rewards long-term commitment and separates it from meme coins that rely on short-term momentum. With automation, advanced analytics, and consistent returns, Unilabs is building a solid base for sustainable growth, making it a serious player in the 2025 market. Shiba Inu’s Price Might Profit From the New Burning Mechanism Shiba Inu is launching a gaming rewards system that pays players in SHIB while burning tokens through Shibarium transactions. The goal is to boost long-term value and strengthen Shiba Inu’s price. Marketing lead Lucie calls SHIB “the people’s coin,” built on trust and community loyalty, but says growth relies on revenue-driven products since there’s no central treasury. Shiba Inu’s Price Movement | Source: CoinMarketCap The burn rate has dropped 89.17%, with 276,576 tokens destroyed in the past day, yet analysts remain bullish. Javon Marks sees Shiba Inu’s price potentially rallying 156% to $0.000032 if momentum holds. Shiba Inu’s price sits at $0.00001367, up 6% today. Decentralization efforts are also moving forward. Lead developer Shytoshi Kusama confirmed that community elections will soon pick an interim president and DAO councils. These leaders will oversee SHIB’s multi-DAO structure and guide future growth, marking another step toward a better Shiba Inu price movement. BONK Coin Rallies After a Prolonged Consolidation Phase BONK coin has dropped 42% from its July high of $0.00004074, now sitting near key support at $0.00002345. This zone aligns with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, a high-timeframe daily support, and a major volume node – creating strong technical confluence for a possible rebound. BONK Coin’s Price Movement | Source: CoinMarketCap Holding here could form a higher low and keep the broader bullish structure intact, with a potential move toward $0.00002739. A close below support risks a fall to $0.00001971 for BONK coin. Sentiment is cautious, with Open Interest down 47% from July highs and funding rates falling sharply. On the four-hour chart, a Death Cross and bearish MACD keep sellers in control. Looking ahead, BONK coin’s long-term upside may depend on gaining utility. For now, $0.00002345 remains the key level to watch. This marks the battleground that will decide whether BONK coin bounces back or continues its slide. Unilabs Reshapes the $500 Billion Asset Management Market Unilabs Finance is changing asset management with automation that reduces mistakes and improves decisions. Its EASS algorithm scans new crypto projects, spotting strong performers and filtering out weak ones. This helps investors avoid chasing random pumps and act with more control. The platform manages over $30 million across four different funds, letting investors choose allocations that fit their goals. Its Cross-Chain Trading Hub links multiple blockchains in one secure flow, cutting the need for risky bridges and speeding up transactions. For advanced users, the Flash Loan Accelerator offers high-yield strategies with no upfront collateral. It gives traders more power to act fast and profit from quick market shifts that are usually hard to catch. With smart filtering, cross-chain efficiency, and sector diversification, Unilabs offers a faster, more precise system for live markets. It helps investors find high-potential projects early and keep an advantage as DeFi grows. Can UNIL Outperform BONK Coin and Shiba Inu? While Shiba Inu’s price holds steady and Bonk slows, Unilabs Finance is quietly gaining ground. Priced at $0.0097, it stands out for real value, not hype. Its dividend model sends over 30% of Unilabs Finance’s revenue to holders, creating steady income. This sets it apart from meme coins that rely only on speculation. Investors here earn as the project grows, not just when the price moves.

Currently in Stage 4 of its presale, $OZ tokens are available at just $0.005 each. With over $1.6 million raised and more than 80 million tokens sold, early investor interest continues to accelerate—driven by projections that this low entry price could turn into massive profits once the token hits exchanges. At the current rate, a $1,000 investment gives you 200,000 $OZ tokens. If the token launches at $1 as projected by some analysts, that investment could explode to $200,000, delivering a 200x gain—or a staggering 200,000% return. These numbers are attracting attention not just from small retail investors but also from early-stage crypto whales looking to enter before broader exposure sends prices soaring. Analysts Are Already Calling It the Top Presale of 2025 What separates Ozak AI from dozens of other presales is not just the token price or marketing—it’s the project’s compelling fundamentals. The platform is being built as a full-scale AI and blockchain integration hub, focusing on real-world tools like predictive analytics, DeFi automation, and AI agents that assist in trading, research, and decision-making. Analysts have noted that this combination of utility and innovation places Ozak in a unique league—one that could mimic the success trajectories of early breakout tokens like The Graph or Injective. Because of its focus on AI—arguably the hottest theme in both traditional tech and crypto— Ozak AI benefits from a strong narrative. Its potential launch around $1 is not just speculation. Several research reports suggest that given the low token supply, utility, presale traction, and increasing demand for AI-driven Web3 solutions, such a valuation at launch is plausible—and potentially conservative. The Path from $0.005 to $1: Not Just Hype, But Momentum Skeptics may be quick to dismiss a 200x return as hype, but the reality is that crypto has repeatedly produced similar stories during strong market cycles. Ozak AI’s tokenomics are designed for scarcity, with a limited supply and a significant portion locked for development and community incentives. Once the presale closes and $OZ hits major exchanges, scarcity combined with demand could push prices up sharply. Importantly, Ozak AI is already listed on major data aggregators like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko and has undergone audits by Certik as well as internal security teams. These signals suggest the project is gearing up for a legitimate public launch—not a fly-by-night operation. With more CEX listings expected to follow, the post-launch environment could be highly favorable for early holders. Branding That Bridges Culture, AI, and Real-World Experience Ozak AI’s appeal isn’t only technical—it’s cultural. As part of its broader community engagement strategy, the team has begun rolling out branding elements that connect crypto with real-life experiences, including its signature cocktail range and Vietnamese cà phê campaigns. These elements help create a lifestyle identity around the token, making it more than just a digital asset. In a space crowded with look-alike projects, this type of creativity can drive organic adoption and build a loyal following beyond the presale. By embracing a multi-layered approach that blends technology, culture, and investor incentives, Ozak AI is building a holistic ecosystem—one that’s designed to last and evolve well past the launch. For anyone wondering whether it’s too late to get in, the answer is a clear no. Ozak AI’s presale is still active, and the current entry price of $0.005 offers one of the most favorable risk-reward ratios in the market right now. A $1,000 entry could theoretically become $200,000 if $OZ reaches $1, and higher still if the token sees continued growth post-launch. Even more conservative projections—such as a $0.50 or $0.25 listing—still offer incredible upside. In a market where timing is everything, Ozak AI stands out as a project that combines momentum, innovation, and affordability. If the $1 launch target becomes reality, early believers could indeed find themselves part of the next wave of crypto-made millionaires.

It is approaching the crucial $4,400 resistance level. The altcoin is now facing conflicting exchange trends, as its macro bullishness is being challenged by rising Binance inflows ahead of major resistance. Long-Term Bulls vs. Short-Term Bears In its latest analysis, CryptoQuant revealed that momentum indicators, including the MACD and buying volume, remain positive, but the price is nearing a historically significant supply zone. On-chain data presents a mixed picture. The Exchange Supply Ratio (ESR) across all exchanges has been in steady decline since 2022. It is currently hovering near 0.16, which means that investors are withdrawing ETH from exchanges and reducing sell-side liquidity. Such a trend is a structurally bullish signal for the long term. Binance-specific metrics, on the other hand, tell a different short-term story. The Binance ESR has been climbing since early 2025 and reached about 0.04, which indicates some holders are moving ETH onto the platform, possibly for selling, arbitrage, or participation in exchange programs. Recent netflow data also shows significant positive inflows into Binance, which, given the proximity to major resistance, may signal readiness for selling. This divergence points to two possible scenarios. A breakout above $4,400 could occur if Binance inflows subside or ESR stabilizes. This move could potentially push ETH toward $4,800 and a retest of its all-time high. On the flipside, continued heavy inflows and a rejection at $4,400 could lead to a pullback toward the $3,950-$4,000 support zone before another breakout attempt. Zooming out, the broader downtrend in the all-exchange ESR supports a bullish macro outlook, but short-term traders should monitor Binance ESR and netflows closely for signs of near-term selling pressure. CryptoQuant added that long-term investors may focus on the structural trend, which remains favorable despite potential short-lived corrections. Retail Hype and Institutional Positioning Ethereum’s latest surge is driven by a mix of retail enthusiasm, institutional accumulation, and record supply growth. As recently reported by CryptoPotato , social media sentiment strongly favors the bulls, with hashtags like #buying and #bullish trending at nearly double the rate of bearish tags. Santiment revealed that while optimism is high, excessive FOMO could briefly cool momentum. Meanwhile, institutional interest has been equally impactful – between July 10 and early August, over 1.035 million ETH, worth roughly $4.17 billion, were acquired by large players at an average price of $3,546. These purchases were made through exchanges and institutional channels, have aligned with a 45% rally from $2,600. To top that, Ethereum’s circulating supply also hit a record 121 million ETH on August 9, nearly three years after crossing 120 million.

49860927,552625,1754833714,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49860927.jpeg,$DOGE’s Bullish Momentum Is Heating Up – But $MAXI’s Presale Could Deliver Even Wilder Gains,https://bitcoinist.com/doge-bullish-momentum-maxi-presale-could-deliver-wilder-gains/,"Dogecoin has never really left the headlines since its sensational 100% rally in June-July, which saw the token blast past its long-standing resistance at $0.25952. Now, with a fresh 22% gain in just the past week , fueled by both fundamental and technical momentum, $DOGE looks primed for an even more explosive rally. A key catalyst behind this surge is the recent 5% jump in the odds of a Dogecoin ETF being approved in 2025 , according to prediction platform Polymarket. The odds now stand at 66%. An ETF approval would be a game-changer, opening the doors for mainstream institutional investment and potentially driving massive new demand for $DOGE. Keep reading to discover more reasons the market is on fire for $DOGE right now, what its price chart is signaling, and why getting in early on Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , a $DOGE-inspired meme coin in presale, could be the best way to ride this wave. Key Drivers Powering Dogecoin’s Momentum According to CoinGlass, open interest in Dogecoin futures jumped 13.16% on Saturday (August 9) to $3.82B . Rising open interest means more capital is flowing into $DOGE derivatives, which is a strong sign of growing trader confidence and potential for higher volatility in the token’s favor. Another catalyst is Dogecoin’s upcoming integration with a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) verification system , a cryptographic method that allows transactions to be verified while keeping sensitive details under wraps. This upgrade will boost privacy, security, and scalability, making $DOGE more attractive for real-world use cases and, therefore, potentially increasing its demand. From a technical analysis standpoint, Dogecoin’s current push, which began in July, stems from a bounce off a major upward-trending support line. The last time $DOGE rebounded from this same trendline, in November 2024, it launched into a 400%+ rally. With the current run-up only about 60% complete based on this pattern, there’s still significant upside potential ahead. Dogecoin’s potential upside notwithstanding, even if it climbs back to its 2024 highs from here, that’d be nearly a 100% gain if you got in now. Of course, those are returns Harvard-trained investment bankers would give a kidney for, but we’re talking about wild meme coins here. So, if you’re looking to give your portfolio a degen twist – and a potentially explosion-worthy edge – consider watching Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , a Dogecoin-inspired meme coin currently in presale. Who Is Maxi Doge? Built on the philosophy of ‘lift, trade, repeat,’ Maxi Doge is a pure meme coin fronted by a fierce, vengeful Shiba Inu mascot. Tired of being ignored at family gatherings, where his distant cousin Dogecoin hogged all the limelight, Maxi hit the gym, lifted heavy, chugged protein shakes, downed caffeine like water, and forged a rock-solid will to surpass Dogecoin as the best meme coin on the planet. Is $MAXI Your Spirit Animal? Buying $MAXI isn’t just an investment it’s a “locked-in” mindset; a lifestyle built on green candles, heavy lifts, and relentless hustle. You can’t be a slacker and a $MAXI holder at the same time. You must be someone who loves gym-bro memes and trades like they’re permanently on 1000x leverage. Why? Because that’s the only way you stand a chance against whales swinging 8-figure positions. Because life’s too short. Because fear is death in crypto. And because you’re a $MAXI holder. Going Viral Is the Game Plan Currently in presale, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) knows exactly what it takes to thrive in the wild world of crypto. Go viral! That’s why the devs have allocated a massive 40% of the total token supply to PR and marketing. Expect holder-only competitions like weekly trading leaderboards and the “Max Ripped, Max Gains” challenges, offering lucrative prizes to reward the most loyal $MAXI holders. In addition to targeting CEX and DEX listings, the team is also gunning for futures listings. This would hand degen $MAXI traders the perfect chance to crank up the leverage and go full beast mode in chasing insane returns. Right now, one $MAXI is priced at just $0.0002515, and the project has already raised over $610K from early investors, despite being one of the newest crypto presales on the market. Want in? Check out $MAXI’s whitepaper , follow the project on X , and join its Telegram channel to pledge your allegiance. Visit the official Maxi Doge website for more information.

Harvard University recently revealed its $116.6 million allocation to BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF. Meanwhile, El Salvador is welcoming Bitcoin-focused investment banks, while regulatory delays have put Japan’s first crypto ETF on hold. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Still King Of Capital Inflows, According To Michael Saylor El Salvador Opens Door To Bitcoin Investment Banks El Salvador has passed a landmark Investment Banking Law that allows regulated investment banks, which are distinct from commercial lenders, to hold Bitcoin and other digital assets on their balance sheets. These institutions will cater exclusively to sophisticated investors and are required to have a Digital Asset Service Provider license and at least $50 million in starting capital. The law, which was approved on Thursday, effectively paves the way for banks to choose to operate entirely as Bitcoin banks. Government officials say the framework is designed to attract foreign capital and cement the country’s status as a crypto finance hub. Critics, however, warn that the benefits may largely favor wealthy institutions over everyday Salvadorans. This move comes as Japan’s entry into the Bitcoin ETF market is being held back. While US-based Bitcoin ETFs are making ground with inflows and jurisdictions like El Salvador move forward, Japan is yet to be home to a Spot Bitcoin ETF. There were multiple reports this week about Japan’s SBI Holdings filing for spot crypto ETFs. However, the company has clarified that it has not yet submitted any applications for crypto-related ETFs. Nonetheless, the company did note in its Q2 2025 earnings report that it is planning to launch crypto-asset-linked investment trusts and ETFs upon regulatory approval. Harvard University Commits Over $116 Million To Bitcoin ETF Institutional confidence in Bitcoin received a major boost with Harvard University’s decision to invest $116.6 million into BlackRock’s IBIT spot Bitcoin ETF. This interesting investment was revealed in a recent filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission by the Harvard Management Company. This sizable position elevates Bitcoin to a prominent role within Harvard’s equity portfolio, which is a notable shift in its investment choices, particularly following its decision last quarter to scale back exposure to several major Big Tech stocks. According to the filing, the endowment purchased 1.9 million shares of iShares Bitcoin Trust, valued at $116.6 million. This value places Bitcoin as the fifth-largest holding in Harvard’s equity portfolio behind Microsoft, Amazon, Booking Holdings, and Meta. Harvard’s allocation aligns closely with investment trends in the US, as US spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted more than $54 billion in inflows since their launch in early 2024.

49861411,552496,1754834437,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49861411.jpeg,Fed’s Bowman Backs 3 Rate Cuts By Year-End – Another Crypto Catalyst?,https://bitcoinist.com/feds-bowman-three-rate-cut-year-end-crypto-catalyst/,"Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman has publicly called for the US central bank to implement multiple interest rate cuts before 2025 ends. Michelle’s statement comes amid a monetary policy stalemate between US President Donald Trump and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. Rate Cuts Will Reduce Labor Market Erosion – Bowman In the past few months, the US Federal Reserve has opted to hold interest rates steady between 4.25% to 4.50% despite opposing calls by Trump and White House personnel for a rate cut. Both parties have continually voiced their arguments with the majority of the Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), targeting to keep inflation down, while the US government pushes for a lower borrowing rate to stimulate the economy. According to a Bloomberg report on August 9, Fed Governor Bowman publicly supports a reduction in interest rates, even advocating for three rate cuts before 2025 runs out. In a speech at the Kansas Bankers Association in Colorado Springs, the US attorney bases this proposal on recent labor market data, which showed an increase in unemployment from 4.1% to 4.2%, as new jobs created were lower-than-expected, 73,000. Bowman is pushing other policy makers in the FOMC committee to join her and Fed Governor Chris Waller , who were the only dissenting votes in the last meeting in July. She advocates beginning interest rate cuts in September and sustaining this dovish stance with additional reductions in October and December. The Fed Governor believes this measure would help avert any “further unnecessary erosion in labor market conditions” while maintaining economic stability, as Trump’s tariff would likely yield no catalyzing effect on inflation. The Fed Governor said: As I gain even greater confidence that tariffs will not present a persistent shock to inflation, I see that upside risks to price stability have diminished; With underlying inflation on a sustained trajectory toward 2%, softness in aggregate demand and signs of fragility in the labor market, I think that we should focus on risks to our employment mandate. Notably, three additional FOMC officials, namely Governor Lisa Cook, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, have also voiced concerns over the latest jobs data, setting the tone for rising anticipation ahead of the next policy meeting. Catalysts Stack Up For The Next Crypto Surge In addition to a potential rate cut, a historical driver of capital flows into risk assets like crypto, the market is buoyed by regulatory tailwinds and institutional pathways. Recent moves toward digital asset-friendly legislation, such as the GENIUS Act, and initiatives such as the SEC’s crypto project highlight progress under President Trump’s crypto-friendly administration. Meanwhile, industry momentum also rests on the growing promise of altcoin spot ETF approvals with underlying assets such as XRP, Solana, Dogecoin, etc. Together, these factors set the stage for an exciting few months ahead for the crypto industry.

Patrick Witt, former deputy, takes over as council chief executive. Major achievements include co-authoring a Senate crypto market bill. President's Council on Digital Assets (Crypto Council) CEO Bo Hines has announced his resignation, returning to the private sector after being appointed by Donald Trump in December 2024. Hines, who previously worked at a growth equity firm, will remain as a special government advisor and continue working alongside AI ”crypto czar” David Sacks on key initiatives. His deputy, Patrick Witt, now becomes the council's chief executive. “Serving in President Trump’s administration and working alongside our brilliant AI & Crypto Czar @DavidSacks as Executive Director of the White House Crypto Council has been the honor of a lifetime. Together, we have positioned America as the crypto capital of the world,” Hines stated. During his tenure, Hines co-authored a landmark bill with Senators Cynthia Lummis and Tim Scott shaping federal crypto market structure, confirmed the administration’s interest in building a national Bitcoin reserve, and coordinated strategic actions for digital asset innovation. Witt, a Pentagon veteran, is tasked with continuing these efforts and guiding the council’s legislative priorities through the coming months. Conclusion Bo Hines’s legacy as Crypto Council CEO includes major legislative advances and strategic infrastructure for U.S. digital assets. As Patrick Witt steps up, stakeholders can expect the council to maintain its focus on forward-looking crypto and AI policy, working to keep America at the forefront of the global digital economy.

Open-Source Features Announced at the Rare Evo blockchain conference and shared to CryptoPotato via a news release, COTI, the EVM-compatible, privacy-focused Layer 1 (L1), unveiled the next step in DJED’s development. Recall that the algorithmic stablecoin was introduced in 2023 alongside IOG (now IOHK), an infrastructure, research, and engineering blockchain company founded by Charles Hoskinson and Jeremy Wood. Three major upgrades are designed to propel DJED into a new type of digital asset, introducing a new class of use cases and further bolstering its position as core infrastructure for Web3. It has consistently held its peg since inception, outperforming its peers and making it one of the more robust stablecoins on the market. COTI is now open-sourcing key parts of its infrastructure (order API, chain indexer, frontend) to encourage developers and communities to build around it. Software engineers will be able to build custom front ends for it, integrate the stablecoin’s functionality into wallets or decentralized applications (dApps), and run secure backend services to interact with it. IOG noted the following: “Open sourcing DJED gives Cardano developers the ability to inspect, extend, and build directly on the protocol, with transparency, driving faster innovation and deeper trust. This is a complex system engineered for uniquely high assurance: it’s grounded in formal methods, backed by extensive testing, and has been running reliably on mainnet for 2.5 years.” DJED, Private, And On Multiple Fronts COTI will also introduce Private DJED, the first enterprise-ready, private stablecoin, which will launch across several blockchains. By open-sourcing DJED, the privacy layer will provide a wrapped version of it on its infrastructure. The private iteration will be suitable for companies, institutions, and users who value privacy alike. Sending and receiving, as well as interacting with it, will be confidential; however, COTI’s capabilities extend beyond the coin’s current capacity, allowing it to be incorporated into more complex dApps and DeFi flows. The secure and private computation-focused Layer 1 is powered by garbled circuits (an encryption method), which provide reliable and scalable privacy-oriented infrastructure that will help DJED lead the way for privacy-first financial primitives. Currently, the Cardano chain is the home of DJED’s infrastructure; however, the private version will ensure that its foundation is prepared for the next wave of adoption. The layer’s programmability will ensure that users can decide how, when, and with whom they will transact. Additionally, they will be able to send and receive the stablecoin privately, ensuring that only the parties they select will be aware of the amounts sent and their respective addresses, while remaining compliant.

While some cooling-off is likely, the broader trend still favors further upside. ETH Price Analysis: Technicals By Shayan The Daily Chart After sweeping liquidity beneath the $3.5K region, ETH attracted strong buying interest, igniting a sharp rally. The upward move propelled the price above the $4K threshold, a level which is significant both psychologically and as a previous swing high on the daily chart. This breakout underscores sustained market demand, but with price now trading firmly above $4K, a short-term pullback to retest this area remains a possibility. Such a retracement could serve as a healthy reset before continuation toward the next key resistance at $4.5K. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart Zooming in, ETH’s price has cut through multiple resistance levels with strong bullish conviction, reflecting increased buying momentum. However, the current position suggests the market may be ready for a corrective phase to absorb fresh demand before resuming its climb. The 0.5–0.618 Fibonacci retracement zone, aligned with Ethereum’s established multi-month uptrend, represents a probable support area if a pullback unfolds. Holding this region would strengthen the case for another leg higher, potentially driving the price into uncharted territory toward a new all-time high. Source: TradingView Onchain Analysis By Shayan The ETH Liquidation Heatmap suggests a relatively clear path toward Ethereum’s all-time high, with no major liquidity clusters obstructing the advance. However, a significant pocket of liquidity is positioned near the $3.6K level, likely reflecting the liquidation points of long positions accumulated during the recent rally. This area marks a dense concentration of leveraged futures exposure, making it an attractive target for market makers and large players seeking to trigger liquidity events. Given this setup, a retracement toward the $3.6K zone remains a plausible scenario, potentially flushing out these positions before the market resumes its upward push. Traders should monitor this level closely, as liquidity hunts in such areas often result in sharp, fast price movements and heightened volatility once the zone is engaged.

It struggles to hold the $3.3 level amidst bearish impulses and shifting sentiment, leaving some investors questioning its short-term strength. Meanwhile, a rising crypto with clear utility is getting investors’ attention as it readies for its first major product launch. This newcomer isn’t pretending to be the next meme token but is geared for real-world use. As XRP tests critical support levels, a new utility-first token is standing out by delivering actual technology. XRP Price: Weak Signals—Critical $3.3 Must Hold XRP is showing unstable behavior around the $3.3 mark, oscillating between bullish and bearish phases, which risks pushing it toward lower Fibonacci support levels. Analysts note that reclaiming the $3.32 level would signal potential recovery, while failure to do so might pressure downside toward $2.75—but that level could also act as a possible bounce zone.

This substantial movement, valued at approximately $220 million, originated from Coinbase Institutional and landed in an unknown wallet , as reported by the vigilant blockchain tracker, Whale Alert. Such large-scale movements often spark intense curiosity among market participants, prompting questions about their underlying motives and potential market implications. Understanding these colossal crypto transactions is crucial for anyone following the dynamic digital asset space. What Does a Massive ETH Transfer Signify? When an Ethereum whale moves such a large amount of digital assets, it often sparks intense speculation across the cryptocurrency community. Coinbase Institutional , a service specifically designed for large entities and corporations, facilitates these significant crypto transactions for various strategic reasons. These are not typical retail transfers; instead, they represent carefully considered decisions by major players in the market. Such a considerable ETH transfer can indicate several possibilities: Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deals: Large blocks of crypto are often traded privately to avoid impacting exchange order books, and institutional wallets facilitate these. Cold Storage Transfers: An institution might be moving assets from hot wallets (connected to exchanges) to more secure cold storage for long-term holding. Internal Rebalancing: Companies or funds frequently adjust their asset allocations across different internal wallets or custodians. New Fund Allocation: A new fund or investment vehicle might be receiving its initial capital, requiring a large influx of Ethereum. Each of these scenarios points to strategic institutional activity, underscoring the growing maturity of the crypto market. Unpacking the Mystery of the Unknown Wallet The destination of this substantial ETH transfer to an unknown wallet adds a layer of intrigue to the situation. While blockchain technology inherently offers transparency in recording transaction details, the identity behind a newly created, unlabelled address remains private. This anonymity is a core feature of decentralized networks, but it also fuels speculation about the true nature of the recipient. Who could be behind this unknown wallet ? It could be: A new institutional custodian setting up a fresh address for a client. A large private investor opting to move their significant holdings off-exchange for personal custody. Preparation for a major over-the-counter (OTC) trade, where funds are moved to a specific address for settlement. A new project or protocol receiving funding directly from an institutional investor. The lack of immediate identification keeps observers guessing, emphasizing the balance between blockchain transparency and user privacy. How Do Large Crypto Transactions Impact the Market? Large-scale crypto transactions , especially those involving an Ethereum whale , can certainly influence market sentiment, even if indirectly. While this specific 52,809 ETH transfer doesn’t necessarily signal an imminent sell-off or buy-up, the sheer volume can make other traders and investors either cautious or optimistic, depending on their interpretation of the move. Market participants diligently monitor these significant movements. Tools like Whale Alert provide real-time updates, allowing analysts to gauge potential shifts in supply and demand dynamics. For instance, if an institution moves assets onto an exchange, it might suggest an intention to sell. Conversely, moving assets off an exchange, as seen in this Coinbase Institutional case, often implies holding or long-term investment rather than immediate liquidation. Actionable Insights from Institutional ETH Transfers For individual investors, monitoring significant Coinbase Institutional movements offers valuable insights into the broader market landscape. It highlights the continued and deepening institutional interest in Ethereum and the overall cryptocurrency market. This kind of activity signals that major financial players are actively engaging with digital assets, legitimizing the space further. However, it is crucial to avoid knee-jerk reactions based on single large crypto transactions . One substantial ETH transfer does not dictate the entire market direction. Instead, use this information as a valuable data point for broader market analysis and strategic planning. Consider these actionable insights: Stay Informed: Follow reliable blockchain analytics and news sources to understand significant on-chain activities. Differentiate Signals: Learn to distinguish between a transfer to an exchange (potential sell) and a transfer to an unknown or cold wallet (potential hold or OTC). Focus on Trends: Look at cumulative institutional activity over time rather than isolated incidents to identify genuine market trends. Risk Management: Never let a single whale movement influence your entire investment strategy. Maintain a diversified portfolio and stick to your long-term goals. Understanding the context behind these transfers empowers you to make more informed decisions. Conclusion: The Enduring Significance of Large ETH Movements The recent 52,809 ETH transfer from Coinbase Institutional to an unknown wallet vividly underscores the dynamic and evolving nature of the crypto landscape. It reminds us of the substantial capital flowing through institutional channels and the constant vigilance required to understand these large-scale crypto transactions . While the exact intentions of this particular Ethereum whale remain private, such movements are integral to the ongoing evolution and maturity of the digital asset space, signaling continued confidence from major players. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Coinbase Institutional? A1: Coinbase Institutional is a platform provided by Coinbase designed for large financial institutions, hedge funds, and corporations to facilitate their significant cryptocurrency trading, custody, and prime brokerage needs. Q2: Why do large ETH transfers occur to “unknown wallets”? A2: Transfers to “unknown wallets” often indicate movements to new cold storage addresses, private over-the-counter (OTC) trade settlement addresses, or newly established wallets for institutional clients or funds, where the specific owner is not publicly identified. Q3: Does this ETH transfer mean Ethereum’s price will go up or down? A3: A single large ETH transfer does not directly dictate price movement. Its impact depends on the context: if it’s moved to an exchange, it might suggest selling pressure; if to cold storage, it could indicate long-term holding. This particular transfer off an exchange is generally seen as neutral to bullish for long-term sentiment. Q4: How can I track large crypto transactions like this? A4: You can track large crypto transactions using blockchain analytics services like Whale Alert, Etherscan, or other on-chain data platforms that monitor significant movements and provide alerts. Q5: Is an “Ethereum whale” always an institution? A5: Not always. An “Ethereum whale” is any individual or entity holding a very large amount of ETH. While many are institutions, some are early investors, founders, or very wealthy private individuals. Share Your Insights! Did this significant ETH transfer spark your interest?

Active users grow 1,280.6%, transactions exceed 9.8 billion annually. Launch of Base App fuels SocialFi growth; ZORA token price surges 800%. Ethereum-based layer-2 network Base, which is affiliated with Coinbase, celebrated its second anniversary with notable achievements in core metrics. According to onbase, the total value of funds locked (TVL) on the network has reached nearly $4.5 billion over the past year, while transaction fees decreased by 97.7% compared to the previous year. Meanwhile, the number of active users grew by 1,280.6%, reaching 1,256 million, and the total number of transactions rose by 2,049.6%, hitting 9,869 million. Key Events and Controversies Throughout the year, Base repeatedly attracted attention for major events. In April 2025, the network launched the memecoin “Base is for everyone,” describing it as a “public experiment.” However, it was later discovered that three wallets collectively earned $666,000 on the token, prompting suspicions of insider trading within the crypto community. Later, Base founder Jesse Pollack entered a public debate with blockchain detective ZachXBT. The confrontation centered on the ”viral” tokens of the Zora platform, which Pollack supported. ZachXBT criticized the assets, stating that none had achieved “capitalization over $5 million,” and questioned their value for creators. Pollack responded by arguing that most digital content is worth little; only a small percentage accrues substantial value, likening the model to TikTok and Instagram, where only rare posts reach high valuations. The debate highlighted disagreements about speculation and cultural worth in crypto circles. New Developments and Platform Growth Another notable milestone occurred on July 17, 2025, when Coinbase released the new Base App, replacing Coinbase Wallet. The revamped app focuses on not just asset storage but also broad participation in the Web3 economy, integrating social, trading, payments, and mini-app features. This launch catalyzed growth in the SocialFi niche; the ZORA token price nearly increased by 800%, and user activity surged dramatically.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-10 14:29:35

This statement — made the day after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs jointly asked an appeals court to dismiss their respective appeals, signaling an end to their nearly five-year legal battle — has left investors questioning why BlackRock remains on the sidelines. While several asset managers, including ProShares, Grayscale, and Bitwise, have filed for XRP ETFs since late 2024, BlackRock’s absence is notable, especially given its dominance in the bitcoin and ether ETF markets. Here are five reasons why BlackRock appears in no hurry to launch a spot XRP ETF, despite the XRP community’s anticipation of a demand-driven price surge. First, BlackRock has cited limited client interest in cryptocurrencies beyond BTC and ETH. Back in March 2024, Robert Mitchnick, the asset manager's head of digital assets, said that there's a misconception that BlackRock will have a ""long tail"" of other crypto services. ""I can say that for our client base, bitcoin is overwhelmingly the No. 1 focus and a little bit ethereum,"" he said during a fireside chat at the inaugural Bitcoin Investor Day conference in New York on March 22. Second, BlackRock’s strategic caution around regulatory uncertainty plays a role. Although XRP sales on public exchanges are deemed non-securities, the broader regulatory framework for altcoins remains murky. BlackRock may be waiting for clearer SEC guidelines before entering the altcoin ETF space. The firm’s conservative approach contrasts with competitors like ProShares, which filed for a spot XRP ETF in January 2025 alongside leveraged and futures-based XRP ETFs, the latter tracking XRP futures contracts rather than the token’s spot price. Third, BlackRock may see diminishing returns in pursuing a spot XRP ETF given the crowded field. As of August 2025, at least seven firms, including Grayscale, Franklin Templeton and 21Shares, have a pending spot XRP ETF application. Fourth, the XRP community’s expectations of a price surge may not align with BlackRock’s data-driven strategy. Polymarket odds for the SEC approving a spot XTP ETF in 2025 stand at 77%. BlackRock's tokenized money market fund on Ethereum and Solana shows blockchain interest, but XRP’s smaller market footprint may not justify the operational costs of a new ETF. Finally, BlackRock’s global perspective prioritizes markets where XRP demand is less pronounced. While the XRP community, active on platforms like X, anticipates a spot ETF driving demand, much of XRP’s trading volume comes from Asia, where BlackRock’s ETF presence is less dominant. At press time, XRP was trading around $3.1852, down 3.92% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk Data.",Markets|XRP|Ripple|SEC|News,EN,0,0,XRP|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BTC,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-10 14:34:22

The rally comes as the DeFi-focused blockchain breaks out of key technical structures, raising the question of whether buyers have the strength to push SOL back toward its all-time high near $260 — and potentially beyond. A bullish “cup and handle” pattern, identified by crypto analyst Ali Martinez on August 9, now projects a potential move to $1,315 — a 630% surge from current levels. Solana $SOL targets $1,315 after breaking out of a textbook cup & handle pattern! pic.twitter.com/MmOcoNPwK2 — Ali (@ali_charts) August 9, 2025 This pattern began forming following SOL’s abrupt descent from its 2021 peak, bottoming at $8 in late 2022. Over the next year, prices steadily recovered, completing the rounded “cup” structure by mid-2024. The “handle,” a descending channel below $200, acted as consolidation before this week’s breakout. If Solana reaches the $1,315 target, its market cap could approach $710 billion, potentially overtaking Ethereum as the second-largest cryptocurrency should ETH see limited growth. The major resistance levels on the way up include $380, $752, and $1,048. Cup and Handle Signals Long-Term Upside The cup and handle is a widely recognized bullish chart formation in technical analysis. It reflects strong accumulation, a brief consolidation, and a breakout continuation. For SOL: Cup depth: $8 low to $200 high Handle: Descending channel under $200 Breakout trigger: Move above $200 on strong volume Targets: $380, $752, $1,048, and $1,315 Historically, such patterns can lead to extended rallies, but success hinges on sustained buying volume and broader market support. Solana (SOL/USD) Technical Outlook and Trade Setup On the 4-hour chart, Solana price prediction seems bearish. SOL faces a key downward trendline resistance intersecting at $186.22. The 50-period SMA at $169.71 has supported the rally from early August lows, with price printing higher lows inside an ascending structure. Solana Price Chart – Source: Tradingview RSI: 62.5, showing bullish momentum without overbought extremes MACD: Positive crossover above zero line, though histogram growth is modest Candlestick behavior: Small-bodied bars with upper wicks at resistance — profit-taking signs Trade setup: Bullish scenario: A confirmed daily close above $186 could open the way to $195.42 and $205.92, aligning with Fibonacci extensions. Bearish scenario: A rejection at $186 may see pullbacks toward $177.40 or $167.00, with the 50-SMA offering bounce potential. Risk management: Stops below $177 for breakout longs, or above $187 for short rejections.

Key Takeaways: Vitalik Buterin’s onchain portfolio has surpassed $1B as ETH rallies past $4,000. Traders eye a potential retest of ETH’s $4,878 all-time high. Ether ETFs are seeing stronger inflows than Bitcoin ETFs, signaling growing institutional interest in ETH. Blockchain intelligence firm Arkham reported on Saturday that Buterin’s onchain portfolio is now valued at around $1.04 billion, with 240,042 ETH as its core holding. The Ethereum mastermind also holds smaller allocations in tokens such as Aave Ethereum (AETHWETH), WhiteRock (WHITE), Moo Deng (MOODENG), and Wrapped Ethereum (WETH). Ether Surges to $4,332 After Breaking $4K Barrier Ether extended its rally over the weekend, climbing another 6.38% on Saturday to hit $4,332 after reclaiming the $4,000 mark on Friday. At press time, ETH is trading at $4,244. The price momentum has coincided with Bitcoin’s declining market dominance and renewed optimism from traders. Some, like crypto analyst Ted, believe a retest of the November 2021 all-time high of $4,878 is imminent, describing it as “just a matter of days now.” I told you that the $ETH breakout is coming. And it happened exactly as predicted. Ethereum has smashed through its resistance and is now heading higher. It feels like a new ATH is just a matter of days now. pic.twitter.com/XCxetoP0Ku — Ted (@TedPillows) August 9, 2025 Market data indicates that a move to $4,500 could trigger a significant short squeeze. CoinGlass estimates that around $1.35 billion worth of short positions could be liquidated if that level is reached. Arkham also pointed to an emerging shift in ETF flows favoring Ether over Bitcoin. On Friday, ETH-focused ETFs recorded $461 million in total flows, outpacing Bitcoin ETFs at $404 million. Over the last five trading sessions, US spot Ether ETFs have logged $326.6 million in net inflows, compared to $253.2 million for Bitcoin ETFs, according to Farside data. Buterin first entered the billionaire bracket in May 2021, when ETH crossed $3,000 for the first time. At the time, he held roughly 333,500 ETH, worth about $1.029 billion, after the asset had quadrupled from $700 at the start of that year. However, he disclosed in 2018 that he had never controlled more than 0.9% of the ETH supply and his net worth had “never came close” to $1 billion until that 2021 rally. Buterin Warns Against Risks Behind ETH Treasury Boom While ETH’s latest run has been bolstered by institutional inflows and corporate treasuries holding Ether, Buterin has voiced caution over the trend. In a recent interview, he warned that excessive leverage within ETH treasuries could pose long-term risks. “If you woke me up three years from now and told me that treasuries led to the downfall of ETH… my guess would basically be that somehow they turned it into an overleveraged game,” he said. Last week, BitMine Immersion Technologies, chaired by Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, added 208,137 ETH to its growing crypto reserves , boosting its total holdings to 833,137 ETH, now worth over $3 billion.

49863880,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/2025-best-altcoins-shortlist-magacoin-finance-battles-xrp-sui-for-top-analyst-spot/,1754838000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/49863880.jpeg,2025 Best Altcoins Shortlist — MAGACOIN FINANCE Battles XRP & SUI for Top Analyst Spot,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/2025-best-altcoins-shortlist-magacoin-finance-battles-xrp-sui-for-top-analyst-spot/,"XRP, SUI, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are emerging as key players in the altcoin market as August 2025 unfolds. Analysts have narrowed down the shortlist of best altcoins to buy before the next breakout. All three tokens are showing strong momentum, but only one is earning top billing from crypto insiders. While XRP rebounds after a major legal win and SUI pushes deeper into institutional adoption, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now leading as the best presale altcoin for early investors seeking strong returns. XRP Clears Final Legal Hurdle and Rallies Past $3 XRP has made headlines with a sharp 11% daily surge that has pushed its price to $3.34. The rally comes after the end of the legal battle with the SEC. Both sides have dropped their appeals today, ending a four-year lawsuit that weighed heavily on the performance of XRP. With the case now fully resolved, investor confidence has returned. The trading volume has spiked by over 170% in a single day. In addition, XRP has seen a 13% gain on the weekly chart. Its market cap now stands at nearly $200 billion. The resolution of regulatory uncertainty is helping XRP regain its standing in the market. As investors return, many see the new development as a fresh start for the token. SUI Advances With Real-World Tech and Institutional Backing SUI has also gained attention with an 8.53% price jump in the past day to $3.81. Its continued growth comes from major tech upgrades and rising institutional support. The recent integration of zkTunnels allows instant, fee-free interactions between smart devices, showing that SUI is focused on real-world blockchain utility. Major institutional investors are taking notice. Mill City Ventures made a $450 million investment in SUI tokens. In addition, AMINA Bank in Switzerland has begun offering regulated trading and custody. These moves show rising institutional confidence in the Layer-1 blockchain. The expanding developer base position has placed it as one of the most utility-focused altcoins of the year. MAGACOIN FINANCE Chosen as the Best Crypto Presale Opportunity While XRP and SUI bring strength, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly earning the title of the best altcoin presale in 2025. Analysts are closely watching this project because of its early-stage entry point and massive upside. The presale offers a chance to get in before the incoming major rally. The MAGACOIN ecosystem merges meme coin energy with serious investor appeal. It focuses on community growth, real use cases, and early backer incentives. Unlike XRP and SUI, which already have significant market caps, MAGACOIN gives small investors a chance to get in early and ride the next wave from the ground floor. Conclusion XRP is now ready to reclaim its former momentum after the conclusion of the lawsuit. Meanwhile, SUI is making major strides in utility and gaining institutional trust. However, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers an early entry point with high-growth potential. For crypto investors who missed previous cycles, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the top altcoin presale for August 2025 and beyond.

Positioned as a next-generation decentralized lending and yield platform, Mutuum Finance is drawing investor attention for its innovative approach to on-chain credit markets and its ambitious 2025 growth roadmap. Priced at $0.035, the new DeFi project has managed to attract attention in presale. Early investors are positioning for at least a 300% rally when MUTM goes live. Mutuum Finance has hit over $14.25 million raised and more than 15000 investors. While ETH’s price action reflects broader market stability, analysts suggest MUTM’s disruptive utility and rapidly expanding community could offer a far greater millionaire-making potential in the coming year. Ethereum Gains Momentum Amid Broader Market Rotation Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $3,892.84, showing a notable recovery this week that reflects renewed optimism in its on-chain activity and growing institutional demand. Daily transactions have surged to record levels, signaling increased engagement across DeFi platforms and NFT markets. As analysts track whether ETH’s current trajectory can sustain a breakout toward the $4,000 mark, the broader narrative includes emerging DeFi utility platforms like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stepping into the spotlight. Mutuum Finance Launches Presale Phase 6 Mutuum Finance has launched phase 6 of its presale with tokens priced at $0.035, a 16.17% increase from the last round. The next price pump will drive the token up another 14.29% to $0.04. Presale alone has already enticed over 15000 investors and raised over $14.25 million, showing the faith that the market has placed on the prospect of MUTM. Dual-Lending: Future-Proof DeFi Mutuum Finance adopts a twin-model approach towards optimizing flexibility and efficiency in Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending marketplaces. Peer-to-Contract involves self-executing smart contracts that carry out the lending automatically without human intervention whatsoever. They have been programmed to operate on dynamic rates in the market with an unspecified rate of interest based on the current demand and supply of an in-real-time interest. Peer-to-Peer model reduces intermediaries and allows market to directly communicate with lenders and borrowers. Mutuum Finance Enhances Stability Emphasis Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will introduce a USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum network. It will be sound and secure investment product to eradicate risk and uncertainty that could be traced back to algorithmic stablecoins. It is audited with a 95.0 trust rating by Certik. Mutuum Finance Launches $50K Bug Bounty to Enhance Protocol Security Mutuum Finance has introduced its Bug Bounty Program with the reward pool value being $50,000 USDT. It has a total of four severity levels. These include critical, major, minor, and low. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised over $14.25 million and brought in more than 15,000 investors, reflecting strong confidence ahead of launch. Priced at $0.035 in Phase 6, the token will climb 14.29% to $0.04 in Phase 7. Early buyers are positioned for at least 500% gains as MUTM grows. With a 95.0/100 CertiK audit score, a $50K bug bounty program, and a USD-pegged stablecoin in development, Mutuum Finance blends security, innovation, and long-term DeFi utility. As momentum builds and presale supply runs out quickly, investors seeking millionaire-making upside in 2025 should secure MUTM tokens now before the next price increase, growing hype, and accelerating demand push valuations even higher.

According to a report , the gang, which has engaged in different cybercrime activities, varies their approach and have been known to target pharmaceutical networks, hospitals, and key infrastructure in the U.S. The new group has also moved over $34.2 million linked to crypto ransom payments between April 2024 and now. Embargo uses high-risk crypto exchanges to launder payments received from victims. Embargo’s Cybercrime Tactics Target Critical Infrastructure Some notable victims of the Embargo include healthcare facilities in Georgia and Idaho, as well as American Associated Pharmacies. The group’s demand from these sets of victims totals $1.3 million. They have also targeted other sectors besides health. Notably, the pattern has involved business services, manufacturing, and other organizations in charge of critical sectors where disruption of operations is likely to cause panic. In the healthcare sector, their attacks usually pose a threat to patient care, leading to a quick response from the targeted victims. Another noticed trend with Embargo is that, although they have struck in Europe and Asia, they have concentrated more in the U.S. Some analysts believe the preference for the U.S. could be a result of organizations to quickly fulfill their ransom demand. Laundering Millions Through High-Risk Crypto Exchanges Embargo’s ransom-as-a-service (RaaS) model has yielded a lot of funds for the group. As per the report, approximately $19 million of the group’s crypto proceeds remain dormant in unaffiliated wallets. Cybersecurity experts believe this is to avoid detection or delay until they discover better ways to launder the funds. So far, Cryptex.net has remained one of its favorite laundering platforms. Embargo has channeled $1 million via Cryptex alone between May and August 2024. Meanwhile, about $13.5 million has also been moved across different virtual asset providers. Is Ransomware Attacks to Surge Again? There are speculations that the Embargo gang might be a rebranded version of BlackCat (ALPHV). Both groups share similarities in the use of the Rust programming language and share technical overlap. Embargo’s operation, it appears, is trying to increase ransomware attacks, which declined by a significant 35% last year. According to Chainalysis, ransomware gangs raked in $1.25 billion in 2023, but the figures dropped to $813 million in 2024.

49863887,https://timestabloid.com/?p=77773,1754838310,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Price Prediction On 3-Day Timeframe,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-price-prediction-on-3-day-timeframe/,"Egrag Crypto has outlined a clear technical roadmap for XRP on the 3-day chart, identifying key price levels that could define the asset’s next major move. According to his analysis, a 3-day close above $3.30 would confirm a bullish shift in momentum, while a close above $3.45 would mark a “super bullish” breakout. On the flip side, a close below $3.13 would signal a bearish turn, and slipping under $3.03 would indicate a “super bearish” breakdown. Current Market Position As of report time, XRP is trading between $3.20, hovering within the critical range Egrag highlighted. The asset briefly pushed above $3.30 last week — even securing a daily close above it on August 7, but buyers have yet to secure a decisive 3-day candle close above that threshold. #XRP On 3 Day Time Frame: 1️⃣ Close above $3.30 is #Bullish 2️⃣ Close Above $3.45 is Super #Bullish 3️⃣ Close below $3.13 #Bearish 4️⃣ Close below $3.03 is Super #Bearish pic.twitter.com/2xzOfpqvgx — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) August 10, 2025 This uncertainty underscores the value of waiting for higher-timeframe confirmation before confirming a breakout. Why the 3-Day Chart Matters The 3-day timeframe is less prone to short-term volatility, filtering out the noise often seen in daily and intraday trading. A confirmed close above $3.30 would suggest a meaningful structural shift toward bullish momentum , while surpassing $3.45 would likely trigger a stronger rally as traders pile in and shorts cover positions. Conversely, a 3-day close below $3.13, and especially under $3.03, would indicate weakening market structure and the likelihood of further downside. Currently, mid-term technical indicators remain mixed, with momentum signals showing neither a clear bullish nor bearish bias. This makes Egrag’s price thresholds even more important as objective markers for trend direction. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Potential Catalysts and Scenarios XRP’s price action remains sensitive to both technical and fundamental catalysts. A confirmed 3-day close above $3.45 could open the door to targets in the $3.60–$3.80 range, as suggested by some analysts. On the downside, losing the $3.13 level could invite a retest of sub-$3 support zones, with $3.03 acting as the last line of defense before deeper retracements. For traders, risk management is crucial. Using Egrag’s thresholds as reference points, disciplined stop-loss placement around $3.13 and $3.03 can help mitigate exposure in case the market turns against a position. Outlook Egrag Crypto’s analysis provides a concise yet highly actionable framework for navigating XRP’s next move. While the recent push toward $3.30 shows that buyers are probing higher, the market still needs to produce a confirmed 3-day close above $3.30 — and ideally $3.45 — to cement a bullish breakout. Until then, XRP remains in a range with clear breakout potential, but also with equally clear downside risks if key supports fail. In this environment, traders should keep a close eye on the 3-day candle closes, trading volume, and major news developments, as these will determine whether XRP follows the bullish or bearish path outlined in Egrag’s forecast.

While SOL Price and XRP Price have impressed traders, RTX’s real-world payment utility is driving stronger momentum. With instant crypto-to-fiat conversions, underbanked market access, and a September wallet beta launch, Remittix is positioning itself as the breakout star of 2025. Solana Holds Key Support As Bulls Defend Gains Solana has staged an impressive recovery, climbing from $140 in July to near $168 at the start of August. Despite the rally, Santiment data shows social dominance up to 4.57% — a sign that smart money is accumulating while hype stays low. The SOL Price remains above the $175–$180 support zone, aligning with short-term EMAs. Indicators like MACD and AO suggest cooling momentum, yet no major breakdown is in sight. If $172.64 holds, the Solana Price could push toward $185–$190 later this month. Meanwhile, while SOL News focuses on consolidation, Remittix (RTX) is drawing attention for its real-world payment utility and rapid growth, positioning it as a contender to outpace both Solana and Ripple in 2025. XRP Price Prediction Remains Bullish Despite Consolidation XRP is trading at $3.27, marking a 7.49% rise in the last 24 hours and continuing a rally that began in mid-July. The XRP Price remains above the 50-day EMA at $2.63 and the 9-day DEMA at $3.16. This signals strong buying interest. Key support also sits at $3.22. This is a level analysts say is crucial for keeping the bullish setup intact. XRP price could target $4.23 if momentum holds, with the RSI at 61.66 showing room for upside. While XRP News points to potential short squeezes, MACD signals hint that a bullish crossover could be on the way. Remittix Expands Access To Underbanked Regions Remittix (RTX) is emerging as one of the strongest players in the market, even as Solana News and Ripple News dominate headlines. This PayFi protocol goes beyond the limits of XRP and SOL, enabling instant fiat deposits directly from crypto. With over 50 crypto pairs and 30+ fiat currencies supported, it is solving a real global payment problem. Analysts now say Remittix could outpace both Solana Price growth and XRP Price momentum in 2025. Enables direct crypto-to-fiat transfers for individuals and businesses Serves underbanked and emerging markets without traditional banking access Competes with XRP and SOL by focusing on practical, real-world use Launching the Remittix Wallet beta on September 15th, 2025 With exchange listings and potential partnerships on the horizon, RTX is gaining serious traction.

Exciting news echoes across the digital asset landscape! According to recent Bitcoin World market monitoring, the leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), has demonstrated remarkable strength, soaring past the significant $119,000 mark. This impressive Bitcoin price surge captures the attention of investors and enthusiasts globally, signaling robust activity in the BTC market . Currently, BTC is trading at $119,036.9 on the Binance USDT market, a widely recognized benchmark for its value against the US dollar-pegged stablecoin, Tether. What’s Driving This Remarkable BTC Market Momentum? The recent ascent of Bitcoin above $119,000 is not merely a number; it reflects growing confidence and dynamic forces within the digital economy. Several factors often contribute to such a powerful crypto rally . These can include increasing institutional adoption, where large financial entities are allocating capital to Bitcoin, recognizing its potential as a store of value. Moreover, global macroeconomic conditions, such as inflation concerns or geopolitical events, can push investors towards decentralized assets like Bitcoin as a hedge. Institutional Influx: Major corporations and investment funds are increasingly adding Bitcoin to their portfolios, validating its long-term viability. Supply Dynamics: Bitcoin’s fixed supply and upcoming halving events inherently create scarcity, which can drive up demand. Macroeconomic Climate: Global economic uncertainties often position Bitcoin as a digital safe haven, attracting new capital. This collective momentum helps to explain the swift upward movement we are witnessing in the BTC market . Navigating the Current Bitcoin Trading Landscape For those engaged in Bitcoin trading , the current price action presents both opportunities and challenges. While a significant price increase can lead to substantial gains, it also often brings increased volatility. Understanding market sentiment and technical indicators becomes crucial. Investors should always conduct thorough research and consider their risk tolerance before making any decisions in a fast-moving market. The key is to remain informed and adaptable. As Bitcoin continues its climb, traders are closely watching for resistance levels and potential support zones. The breakthrough of $119,000 could establish a new psychological floor, potentially paving the way for further gains if buying pressure sustains. However, swift rallies can also lead to profit-taking, so vigilance is paramount. Key Considerations for Cryptocurrency News Followers Staying updated with reliable cryptocurrency news is vital, especially during periods of intense market movement.

However, the price is expected to face substantial resistance at that level. However, the flagship cryptocurrency has maintained its position above $116,000, indicating that bulls are not ceding ground to sellers. BTC registered a sharp jump over the weekend thanks to bullish policy shifts and rising futures open interest. Robert Kiyosaki Predicts Bitcoin Slump To $90,000 Best-selling author Robert Kiyosaki believes Bitcoin (BTC) could slide towards $90,000 thanks to the “ Bitcoin August Curse.” However, Kiyosaki indicated he would use the decline as an opportunity to increase his Bitcoin holdings. He added that the real problem was the multi-trillion-dollar debt. Kiyosaki stated, “Bitcoin Curse: Will the ‘Bitcoin August Curse’ crash Bitcoin’s price to below $90K? I hope so. If the Bitcoin August Curse hits and Bitcoin crashes, I stand by to 2x my position today. The problem is not Bitcoin. The real problem is our multi-trillion-dollar debt and incompetent PhDs running ‘the SWAMP,’ the Fed, and our Treasury. The Bitcoin August Curse will make most Bitcoin investors richer.” The “Bitcoin August Curse” is a historical pattern where BTC has underperformed or experienced significant downward pressure. Experts have attributed BTC’s muted performance in August to seasonal low trading volumes and profit taking. Kiyosaki also warned his followers about traditional investments, calling financial planners liars and bonds unsafe. “Financial planners lie when they say ‘bonds are safe.’ There is nothing safe in a market crash. The commercial real estate market is crashing. Moody’s downgraded U.S. bonds. Asians are buying gold. I’ve been buying real gold, silver, and bitcoin… oil and cattle… for years… Because I plan on getting richer during the coming crash and the next Great Depression.” Bitcoin (BTC) Traders Brace For Short Squeeze Bitcoin (BTC) is approaching the $120,000 mark as traders expect a strong performance next week. The flagship cryptocurrency roared back into positive territory on Sunday, surging past $117,000 as buyers began a renewed push towards $120,000. Analysts believe that BTC will continue to push higher next week. Popular trader Rekt Capital stated, “ BTC is on the cusp of reclaiming ~$117200 back into support. Bitcoin is hours away from a decisive Weekly Close.” Another trader stated that while weekend prices could typically reverse when traditional markets reopen, BTC could reach new all-time highs next week. “Just a 10% upward move will cause $18B+ in short liquidations, and big money is probably watching it. My guess is that Monday could be a bit bearish with BTC retracing its weekend pump. After that, we could see a move above $120,000.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) could end the weekend on a bullish note as price action picked up, propelling the flagship cryptocurrency towards the $120,000 mark. One popular analyst believes BTC could reach $131,000, basing his prediction on the existence of a volume shelf on the BTC/USDT daily chart. The analyst identified BTC’s current price levels as the launch area, stating that if the price consolidates above this level, it could suggest sufficient buying interest to propel the cryptocurrency higher. BTC started the previous weekend in the red, dropping over 2% to $113,365. Sellers retained control on Saturday as the price fell 0.67% to $112,601. Despite the selling pressure, BTC recovered on Sunday, rising nearly 2% to reclaim $114,000 and settle at $114,307. The price continued pushing higher on Monday, rising 0.69% to cross $115,000 and settle at $115,097. The flagship cryptocurrency plunged to an intraday low of $112,707 on Tuesday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim 114,000 and settle at $114,139, ultimately registering a 0.83% drop. Source: TradingView BTC was back in positive territory on Wednesday, rising 0.80% to cross $115,000 and settle at $115,047. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the price rallied, rising over 2% to cross $114,000 and settle at $117,483. However, BTC was back in the red on Friday, dropping 0.83% to $116,512. Sellers retained control on Saturday as the price fell 0.48% to $115,957. The current session sees BTC up nearly 2%, having crossed $118,000 and trading around $118,180.

Tron historic price sentiment TRON price history Tron, founded by Justin Sun in 2017, raised $70 million through an ICO the same year; it launched its mainnet in May 2018 and migrated TRX from Ethereum to Tron in June, which temporarily boosted TRX’s price to $0.09. TRX reached an all-time high of $0.3004 in January 2018 before dropping below $0.05 a month later; it consistently traded under $0.05 until late 2020, when it began to rise again. In 2021, it reached a high of $0.16. Tron was also reorganized as a DAO as Justin stepped down as CEO of Tron Foundation. TRX was in a bear trend for the best part of 2022. In 2023, TRX maintained a consistent bull run, rising from a low of $0.05. In March 2023, the SEC sued Justin for allegedly selling unregistered securities and promoting Tron and Bittorent tokens. In February 2024, Circle’s announcement to cease USDC on Tron led TRX to correct from $0.1429. TRX held above $0.1234 until mid-May, then dropped to $0.1113. The price rebounded to $0.1398 in July but fell again to $0.1213 in early August. By late September, TRX recovered to $0.166, reaching $0.1691 in October and touching $0.2130 in late November. TRX ended 2024 with a price tag of $0.255. Tron was priced at $0.255 at the start of January 2025 and it was trading in a range of $0.204 to $0.257 in February. In March 2025, Tron (TRX) dipped to $0.212, but it recovered to the $0.23 range in April and $0.278 in May. At the start of August, Tron is trending near the $0.324 range, maintaining its price above $0.31.",Crypto Price Predictions|TRON,EN,0,0,MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TRADING|TRX|ICO|ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|BNB|RESEARCH|LINK|ASIA|USDT|USDD|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-10 15:27:00

The Binance exchange’s native cryptocurrency now trades above $800 and is merely 6% from returning to its all-time high figure. Interestingly, striking similarities between BNB’s current chart structure and Bitcoin’s trajectory in earlier phases of its bull cycle indicate the altcoin could be in the early stages of a major price rally. Related Reading: Cardano Price Prediction: Why A 52% Rally To $1.20 Could Happen Soon Technical Patterns Suggest BNB Could Surge By Over 50% In an X post on August 9, Ali Martinez highlights upside potential in the BNB market after weekly price data from TradingView suggests the altcoin is replicating Bitcoin’s price movement. Notably, the premier cryptocurrency is currently trading at approximately $116,769, having recently broken through multiple key resistances at $82,500, $95,000, and $110,000. From the chart above, the similarities between BNB and Bitcoin’s price are easily seen moving through phases of accumulation, breakout, and rapid expansion. For BTC, traders can observe a prolonged sideways range between mid-2022 and 2023, fluctuating between roughly $15,000 and $25,000, before a steady climb accelerated sharply past the $70,000 and $82,500 resistance in late 2024. Thereafter, the crypto market leader surges towards higher price targets at $95,000, $110,000, and $120,000. Interestingly, BNB’s trajectory mirrors this pattern, with a long consolidation between $200 and $350 from 2022 to 2023, followed by a breakout above $450 and a decisive move past $700 in 2024. Presently, the altcoin finds itself trading at minor resistance at $800, similar to the $80,000 level in the BTC market. If the parallel continues, clearing the mid-cycle resistance at $700 should unleash a strong bullish momentum, which easily pushes BNB towards $950. Thereafter, the cryptocurrency may experience an intense correction, falling to around $777, before climbing towards $1,200 to produce a 50% gain from current market prices. However, while chart similarities offer compelling insights, they do not guarantee identical outcomes. Macroeconomic conditions, regulatory events that affect Binance could impact the BNB’s rally. Alternatively, the potential of an impending altseason may cause BNB to deviate from the observed parallel performance, causing the altcoin to outperform Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Volume Shelf Indicates Possible Launch To $131,000 – Analyst BNB Price Overview At press time, BNB trades at $810 after a slight 1.78% gain in the last 24 hours. On larger timeframes, the digital asset also remains in profit with price increases of 8.57% and 19.04% on the weekly and monthly charts, respectively. This performance suggests that BNB traders are largely maintaining a bullish outlook, with buying interest persisting across both short- and long-term horizons as momentum continues to build. Meanwhile, with a market cap of $112.36 billion, the Binance Coin continues to rank as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency and fourth-largest altcoin in the market.

49865229,552511,1754839852,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49865229.jpeg,Futures-Based SOL & XRP ETFs Take In $1 Billion Capital Since Launch — Spot ETFs Next?,https://bitcoinist.com/futures-sol-xrp-etfs-take-in-1-billion-capital/,"The cryptocurrency industry has been about hitting new milestones in 2025, with the futures-based Solana and XRP ETFs (exchange-traded funds) among the latest to reach new achievements. According to the latest market data, the SOL and XRP ETFs have reached $1 billion in total capital inflows since their launch earlier. This feat comes on the back of rumors that the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, might look to launch a spot XRP-based exchange-traded fund. SOL & XRP Futures ETFs Hit New Milestone In an August 9 post on the X platform, the president of The ETF Store, Nate Geraci, revealed that the futures-based Solana and XRP ETFs have attracted over $1 billion in capital since launch. These crypto-linked investment products started trading in the United States about five months ago—around March (for SOL ETF) and April (for XRP). For context, futures-based exchange-traded funds are a type of investment product that holds the futures contracts of an asset. A futures contract is a financial instrument that allows an investor to buy an asset at a predetermined price on a predetermined date. In March 2025, Volatility Shares launched the first-ever Solana exchange-traded funds in the United States. The firm rolled out two products at the time: Volatility Shares’ Solana fund, which replicates the performance of Solana futures, and the 2x SOL ETF that offers double-leveraged exposure. While Teucrium launched the first US-based XRP ETF (a 2x leveraged fund) in April, Volatility Shares offered the first non-leveraged futures-based XRP exchange-traded fund in May. As shown in the chart below, both the SOL and XRP ETFs had posted only modest monthly performances up until July—where they each posted approximately $350 million in capital inflows. Geraci noted that these figures include REX-Osprey’s Solana staking exchange-traded fund, which boasts up to $150 million in assets under management. According to the ETF expert, this performance proves that there will be demand for spot SOL and XRP ETFs. Expert Doubles Down On BlackRock’s Application For SOL And XRP ETFs It is worth mentioning that a slew of applications from various asset managers are awaiting approval from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch Solana and XRP ETFs. As reported by Bitcoinist , BlackRock has indicated that it currently has no plans to join the race for spot Solana and XRP ETFs.

These entities collectively control more than 3.5 million SOL tokens worth over $591.1 million. Institutional Solana Holdings According to CoinGecko’s recent analysis, the combined stake of the four companies represents nearly 0.65% of Solana’s circulating supply and about 0.58% of the total supply. Leading the pack is Upexi, Inc., which has rapidly built the largest publicly disclosed Solana treasury. It has amassed 1.9 million SOL in just four months. The company began its aggressive accumulation in late April 2025 and has paid an average of $168.63 per token for a total investment of $320.4 million. In second place, DeFi Dev. holds 1,182,685 SOL at an average cost of $137.07. This makes its $198.9 million stake the most profitable among its peers with an estimated $36.8 million in unrealized gains. The firm has continued to expand its position, and most recently added 181,303 SOL on July 29 for $28.2 million at $155.33 per token. It has given no indication of reducing its holdings. Meanwhile, Toronto-based SOL Strategies follows with 392,667 SOL acquired through a steady dollar-cost averaging approach between June 2024 and July 2025, at an average purchase price of $166.86. This methodical accumulation, supplemented by staking rewards, has brought its current valuation to $66.0 million, and a $3.9 million in unrealized gains. Torrent Capital rounds out the list with 40,039 SOL purchased in early 2025 across five transactions at an average of $161.84. Despite being the smallest holder, CoinGecko said that iTorrent’s early entry ahead of Solana’s major rally has yielded a $0.2 million gain, with its stake now valued over $6.7 million. SOL Trades Near Key Level of Resistance Solana (SOL) has climbed over 14% in the past month and is now trading above $180 amidst a broader market surge . Pseudonymous crypto trader XO described the rally as a “strong move up off the recent lows,” though noting that the crypto asset lacked the “rounded retest type structure” typically preferred for building a firm base. XO added that the current zone remains a critical threshold for SOL’s short-term price trajectory.

Network congestion frequently pushes gas fees above 100 gwei. This means that the value proposition of Layer 2 solutions is more compelling than ever. Industry forecasts suggest that Ethereum Layer 2 transaction volume could surge to billions annually by 2027. That positions ETH for a pivotal role in the next bull run. Influencers and analysts are projecting that this environment may catalyze a significant Ethereum price prediction upside. More so as demand for ETH rises amid limited supply. This article examines the likelihood of LayerBrett and Pepe coin to head to the moon. Meme Coin Mania: Pepe Coin, $LBRETT, and the Meme Coin Giants The meme coin sector remains fiercely competitive in 2025. Pepe coin continues to attract significant trading volume with a market cap in the hundreds of millions to low billions. Shiba Inu and Dogecoin maintain their positions as meme coin titans, each commanding multi-billion-dollar market caps. Bonk, while smaller, continues to ride the meme wave with persistent volatility. The surge in popularity of these coins highlights their ongoing appeal, but new entrants like LayerBrett ($LBRETT), now active on secondary markets post-presale, are challenging established hierarchies. LayerBrett and Base: Layer 2 Scaling and Market Potential $LBRETT, built on the Base Layer 2 blockchain, exemplifies the next evolution in meme coin utility and scalability. Users benefit from much faster transactions and substantially lower gas fees compared to mainnet ETH, a decisive advantage as Ethereum congestion persists. It delivers mind-blowing staking APYs (up to 20,000%), while $LBRETT’s integration with wallets like Best Wallet and its seamless purchase process using ETH or stablecoins reflects the ongoing trend toward user-friendly DeFi solutions. Market analysts predict that $LBRETT could exceed its previous all-time highs, with price targets as high as $0.24 by year-end and the potential for a $2–5 billion market cap if adoption accelerates. Community sentiment is buoyant, bolstered by recent centralized exchange listings and escalating social engagement. Comparative Outlook: Meme Coin Performance and Staking When comparing staking options, most top meme coins such as Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Bonk offer limited or no formal staking yields, whereas $LBRETT’s staking presents an innovative alternative on Layer 2. The vibrant performance of Pepe coin, $LBRETT, and Brett (original token) demonstrates the shifting investor appetite toward scalable, utility-driven meme coins. Layer 2 solutions like Base not only empower these tokens with near-instant transaction speeds but also drastically reduce the cost barrier for retail participants. As the market pivots toward efficiency and growth, the next wave of meme coin standouts may be determined by their underlying technology as much as their community buzz. Conclusion With a looming ETH supply shock and the rise of Layer 2 solutions, the landscape for meme coins such as PEPE and $LBRETT looks increasingly bullish. As competition with established giants—Shiba Inu, Bonk, and Dogecoin—intensifies, the market is primed for significant movement, making 2025 a critical year for Ethereum price prediction and meme coin innovation. Don’t just watch ETH, PEPE and the others set trends—join the next wave. With Ethereum’s reliability and PEPE’s meme power fueling the market, $LBRETT is making headlines for its blazing-fast Layer 2 tech and a presale price of $0.004 that’s too good to last. Secure your spot in the LayerBrett presale today and ride the momentum before this opportunity zips by!

The investment banking giant forecasts that the S&P 500, Wall Street's benchmark index, will yield a ""high single-digit return over the next 12 months,"" driven by three key factors. One of the main reasons for optimism is that markets don't care about signs of an economic slowdown. Instead, traders are focused on resilient corporate earnings and the subsequent economic recovery. Since President Trump fired the first tariff salvo on April 2, economists have downgraded full-year U.S. growth forecasts from 2.3% to 1.5%. Still, the S&P 500 has gained over 28% in the four months. The index has held steady despite recent economic data revealing softness in the labour market and consumption , as well as stickiness in manufacturing and service sector inflation . While the macro analysts' warning is concerning and likely playing out in the background, corporate earnings in the U.S. are ignoring the slowdown risks, at least in the short term, making it the second catalyst for JPMorgan's bullish thesis. Over 80% of S&P 500 companies have recently reported their Q2 earnings, with 82% surpassing earnings expectations and 79% beating revenue forecasts—the strongest performance since the second quarter of 2021. The winners and losers According to JPMorgan, while Wall Street analysts initially projected earnings growth below 5%, the index is now on pace for an impressive 11% growth rate. This robust showing supports the ongoing bullish trend in the stock market. ""The full-year earnings expectations for both this year and next have already started to turn higher,"" analysts at JPMorgan's wealth management said in a market note on Friday, adding that the market is increasingly differentiating between the winners and losers of the Trump trade war. Additionally, the market is now figuring out and pricing in which companies are getting hit most by U.S. tariffs. So far, it looks like mega corporations will be just fine. This could bolster the case for further positive sentiment in the markets. JPMorgan analysts explained that consumer-facing and smaller companies with restrained bargaining power against their trading partners and rigid supply chains are facing a stagnant earnings outlook. This ties to JPMorgan's last catalyst: Trump's tariff bark is proving worse than its bite for large firms, which are managing to secure exemptions and even turn the tariff policies, aimed at sparking a manufacturing boom, into a tailwind. ""The latest example is President Donald Trump’s suggestion that imported semiconductors would be taxed at a 100% rate unless the companies commit to relocating production to the United States. Another sign? Apple products are exempted from the latest tariff rates on Indian goods. Indeed, the company also announced an additional $100 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing facilities. The stock gained almost 9% this week. Tariffs are not happening in a vacuum,"" analysts explained. Big firms gain an additional advantage from the One Big Beautiful Act (OBBA), under which firms can claim 100% bonus depreciation for purchases of qualified business property and immediate expense of domestic research and development costs. According to some analysts, the depreciation policy could increase free cash flow for some by over 30%, which could incentivize more investment. The bank added that its investment strategy remains focused on large-cap equities, particularly in the technology, financials, and utilities sectors, which it believes are best positioned to navigate this new economic environment. The crypto angle JPMorgan's positive outlook for stocks could bode well for cryptocurrencies, as both tend to move in tandem. The digital assets market has plenty going on for itself, with the Trump administration appointing pro-crypto officials to key regulatory positions. Recently, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ruled that liquid staking, under certain conditions, falls outside the purview of Securities Law. The ruling has raised hopes for staking spot ether ETFs winning regulatory approval. Ether has rallied over 13% to over $4,200, reaching levels last seen in 2021.

49865636,552681,1754841021,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49865636.jpeg,Bitcoin Hyper Aims to Solve Bitcoin’s Performance Issues to Enable Lighting-Fast Transactions,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hyper-solves-bitcoins-performance-problems/,"Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the Layer 2 solution to Bitcoin’s subpar performance that keeps the network miles behind providers like Solana. Bitcoin’s primary downfall is the protocol’s limitation to 7 transactions per second (TPS), which pales in comparison to Solana’s 1,183 real-time TPS and 2,909 max TPS calculated per 100 blocks. Even Ethereum racks in three times Bitcoin’s performance with an average of 20.04 and a maximum of 63.24 TPS. Bitcoin Hyper aims to address this very problem to bring Bitcoin to modern standards in terms of transaction speed and costs. How Bitcoin Hyper Changes the Bitcoin Ecosystem Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER) Canonical Bridge is the heart of the project, linking Bitcoin’s native ecosystem to Hyper’s Layer 2. Users can deposit their Bitcoins into the Bridge, which then mints their equivalent into Hyper’s Layer 2. You’ll send Bitcoins to a designated address, the Canonical Bridge will lock them and mint wrapped $BTC on the Layer-2 for you to use. The role of the Canonical Bridge is to decongest the Bitcoin network and speed up transaction confirmation with the help of the Bitcoin Relay Program, which verifies and confirms transaction details. The Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) is another useful addition, enabling the ultra-fast execution of smart contracts and DeFi apps, lifting Bitcoin’s performance to Solana-grade levels. These tools turn Bitcoin Hyper into a high-end Layer that enables near-instant finality, scalability, and smooth performance, while benefiting from Bitcoin’s security and brand recognition. Bitcoin Hyper also supports a variety of perks, like swaps, staking, and lending, dev tools for Rust-based smart contracts, and multi-wallet integrations. Presale Status and Performance The $HYPER presale started in May and it just broke through the $8M threshold, marking an outstanding performance and showcasing the investor’s trust in the project. $HYPER is now listed at $0.012625 and comes with a staking APY of 133%. Holding $HYPER qualifies you for several benefits, including staking rewards, voting rights, and developer bounties. As a $HYPER holder, you’ll also get privileged access to upcoming presales and beta features before they hit the public sphere. Coinsult and SpyWolf have audited the presale and deemed it safe for investors. According to the findings, the owners cannot mint new tokens, cannot blacklist addresses, and there’s no risk of a honeypot. If you want to invest, it’s as easy as visiting the official presale page and buying your $HYPER there. Bitcoin Hyper Development and $HYPER Price Prediction What we do know is that Bitcoin Hyper is currently one of the most promising crypto projects of 2025. The project’s roadmap consists of five phases, each with several planned features and upgrades. Bitcoin Hyper is nearing the end of Phase 2 and plans to reach full maturity in 2025. So, we’re not talking about investing in a several-years-long project; it’s happening now. Based on the project’s details and scope and $HYPER’s presale performance, our analysts expect a post-launch boom, likely bringing $HYPER up to $0.32 by the end of 2025. Even accounting for the expected bear movements, which are normal during the project’s developmental process, we should still get a $1.50 $HYPER by the end of 2030. This translates to a 11,781% five-year return rate. An investment as low as $100 could turn into $11,781 in just five years, provided $HYPER doesn’t go even higher. This prediction isn’t a certainty, but an educated expectation based on the project’s long-term potential and scope. Should You Buy $HYPER? Whether you should buy $HYPER or not depends on your risk tolerance and investment strategy. However, given the project’s details and presale performance, we believe that Hyper is on its way to resounding success. If Bitcoin Hyper manages to succeed where the Lightning Network failed, $HYPER could see wealth-building chart performances over the next two to five years. This isn’t financial advice.

Familiar names like XRP, Shiba Inu, and Cardano are showing fresh momentum, but a newer entrant is getting louder by the week. . Pepeto (PEPETO) , now in presale at $0.000000146, has already crossed $6 million raised. Built to blend the shareable spark of meme culture with tools people can actually use, Pepeto is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about memecoins this cycle. Shiba Inu Stays Active as the Stack Grows Shiba Inu hasn’t gone quiet. The community remains busy, and the broader stack keeps expanding. Shibarium, its Layer 2, is live and seeing activity. Price sits around $0.00001182, close to recent levels, with SHIB still among the larger meme coins. Between ShibaSwap, NFTs, and a slow-building DeFi lane, there is more than chatter holding it up. The catch is the giant circulating supply, which makes the classic parabolic bursts tougher. A double or even a triple in the next bullish phase is reasonable, though the 100x story likely needs a full return of retail mania. Cardano Price Outlook: ADA Eyes $2 to $3 by 2026 Cardano ’s reputation comes from years of research and a proof of stake approach rolled out in measured steps. Trading near $0.6986 today, the network keeps pushing into classrooms, government programs, and especially markets across Africa. Hydra, designed to cut transaction times, could give throughput a lift as the next cycle forms. Analysts point to a $2 to $3 window by 2026. The ride is expected to be steadier than XRP or SHIB, so quick-flip traders may not find the adrenaline they want here. XRP in 2025: Post-SEC Momentum and New Holders XRP has been in the conversation for years, and the tone improved after Ripple’s clash with the SEC tilted in its favor. That shift brought new energy, with price hovering near $2.78 after a run of steady buying. Known for fast cross-border payments, XRP is also appearing on corporate balance sheets. Flora Growth noted its position in a recent 10-Q, Ault Capital Group set aside $10 million via Hyperscale Data, and Webus International outlined a $300 million XRP plan in a Form 6-K. With billions already circulating and a large market cap, a 100x leap is unrealistic, but many still map a $3.50 to $4 range by year-end 2025, with a slower climb after that. Ethereum-Based Meme Coin From a Former Pepe Founder Targets Binance After $6M Presale Pepeto comes from one of the original Pepe minds who exited when he disagreed with where that project was headed. He started over with transparency, a dual audit, and a clear roadmap, a mix that has already helped pull in more than $6 million during presale. At $0.000000146, it is still early in a way traders like to see. The team has finished two independent audit s and is building on Ethereum itself, rolling out PepetoSwap and a cross-chain bridge directly on mainnet. While many competitors jump to Layer 2, Pepeto is taking on Ethereum head-on. With talk of a Binance listing in the air, that stance could prove rewarding. Pepeto’s Three Pillars: Utility, Speed, and Culture • Zero-fee swaps on PepetoSwap, so your trades don’t get shaved by charges. • Low-cost, quick token transfers through a streamlined cross-chain bridge. • Smart contracts vetted by independent auditors for added peace of mind. • A built-in e-learning hub to help newcomers stick around and learn the ropes. • A distinct frog brand with PEPE roots and pop culture pull, including the kind of buzz that can snowball fast. Final Takeaway Each headline name brings something different. Shiba Inu’s ecosystem keeps expanding, though the massive float makes the biggest fireworks tougher. Cardano’s base is strong and research-driven, but the arc is gradual. XRP stands out for a different reason. It isn’t only a fast payments token anymore. It is showing up as an asset companies are willing to hold, which points to longer-term stability. Pepeto, meanwhile, is getting attention for being early and ambitious. More than $6 million raised, two audits completed, and ongoing Binance chatter are the sort of signals that pull bigger wallets in. Among memecoins right now, it has one of the clearer paths to a breakout. For balance, holding both can make sense. XRP offers steady, real-world adoption and reliable growth. Pepeto carries the kind of upside that can move a small allocation in a big way. Put together, that mix looks like one of the smarter portfolio plays for 2025 for anyone tracking memecoins and the broader market. $Pepeto could be remembered as one of the defining moves of this cycle.

49866415,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-xrp-hype-hbar-top-trending-crypto-picks-for-2025/,1754841604,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecoinrise.png,"BlockDAG, XRP, HYPE, HBAR: Top Trending Crypto Picks for 2025",https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-xrp-hype-hbar-top-trending-crypto-picks-for-2025/,"In crypto, lasting value comes from more than just holding coins. The top trending crypto projects often build strong systems, real utility, and solid plans before major exchange listings. People now look beyond hype, focusing on platforms that work, reward activity, and can grow at scale. This list features four projects showing clear progress toward growth, strong liquidity plans, and better user experiences, with BlockDAG leading the way. These are the ones to watch well into 2025 and beyond. 1. BlockDAG: Testing Liquidity Before the Official Launch BlockDAG is preparing for launch with a step many projects delay, setting up liquidity early. Its live trading simulator gives users a full exchange-style setup before launch. Features include live price charts, buy and sell functions, instant wallet updates, and an active order book, all interactive in real time. This setup does more than give a preview. It helps users practice handling BDAG coins in realistic conditions while giving BlockDAG (BDAG) data on volume, trading patterns, and wallet use. That preparation is valuable when going live on real exchanges. BlockDAG is also making headlines for its presale figures. It has raised $368 million, sold more than 24.9 billion BDAG, and is in batch 29 at $0.0276, up 2,660% from its first batch. A short-term offer at $0.0016 is still open, offering room for new buyers. With liquidity tools already in motion and a focus on user readiness, BlockDAG is showing why it is among the top trending cryptos to follow for long-term growth. 2. XRP: Driving Efficiency in Global Transactions XRP is built with long-term utility in mind, particularly in cross-border payments. Its consensus protocol is designed for fast, low-cost transfers between financial institutions, addressing issues that traditional systems still face today. What places XRP among the top trending crypto choices is its practical application and steady growth within regulated financial environments. With quick transaction speeds and minimal fees, it is well suited for integration into traditional banking systems. Recent partnerships with banks and fintech firms further point to continued progress. XRP’s long-term strength will depend on achieving regulatory clarity and adapting to global payment system changes. For now, its adoption rate and focused purpose keep it relevant in the market. 3. HYPE: Building Loyalty Through Gamified Engagement HYPE takes a fresh approach to retaining users through its gamified platform and reward-driven system. Unlike projects that rely solely on meme status, it blends viral outreach with features that encourage ongoing participation. Its place as a top trending crypto comes from the way it consistently draws users back through daily missions, community challenges, and timed rewards. The focus is on maintaining engagement among those already in the network, not just attracting newcomers. While its initial visibility was tied to short-term momentum, HYPE’s real strength lies in expanding its gamified design. As long as it continues refining user interaction, its long-term outlook remains positive. 4. HBAR: Advanced Tech Designed for Enterprise Use HBAR is the digital asset of the Hedera network, known for its high processing capacity and unique Hashgraph consensus. This model delivers asynchronous byzantine fault tolerance and fair transaction ordering, enhancing both speed and security. Its role as a top trending crypto is reinforced by its emphasis on enterprise adoption. Major companies and institutions participate in its governing council, offering stability and structured planning for the future. HBAR powers transaction fees, smart contracts, and staking, but its true value comes from its scalable and secure network infrastructure. As industries demand reliable distributed ledger technology, Hedera stands ready to meet that need, giving HBAR lasting relevance. Closing View The success of a top trending crypto depends on more than current price movements. It is about platform readiness, meaningful user interaction, and the early setup of systems that support future growth. BlockDAG is delivering all three with its simulated trading platform, strong presale performance, and infrastructure that prepares users for real trading ahead of launch. XRP is advancing global payment solutions, HYPE is redefining user retention through gamification, and HBAR offers the kind of robust tech that enterprises seek. For those looking beyond short-term opportunities, these projects provide insight into where the crypto market could be heading and which assets may lead over time.

49866088,https://timestabloid.com/?p=77785,1754841615,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Best Crypto Presale Insights on BlockDAG, T6900, SUBBD and BEST with Key ROI Edge",https://timestabloid.com/best-crypto-presale-insights-on-blockdag-t6900-subbd-and-best/,"Early entry stages in crypto often give access to the lowest prices before public exchange listings. This setup can open the door for notable returns. Within the current best crypto presale market, certain projects are gaining attention for pricing strategy, ROI data, and demand levels. Leading this group is BlockDAG, showing a rare pricing gap that sets it apart. Here is a closer breakdown of four key presales drawing strong market focus. BlockDAG (BDAG): Price Gap Creates ROI Potential BlockDAG is showing one of the strongest ROI cases in the best crypto presale space today. The active batch price is $0.0276 (Batch 29), yet a limited-time entry is available at just $0.0016. This is over 94% below the current batch price, creating a return possibility even before public listing. So far, BlockDAG’s presale has reached $369 million in sales, with over 24.8 billion coins sold. It has moved through 29 batches, with each price step reflecting steady demand growth. The ROI since batch 1 now stands at 2,660%, with participation numbers continuing to grow. Those entering at $0.0016 can see an immediate upside when measured against the current presale price alone, without including potential listing gains. BlockDAG’s strength comes from its hybrid setup that blends DAG design with Proof of Work for both scalability and security. Another major draw is its dashboard features and visible simulated trades, allowing users to assess buy and sell activity in real time. This level of clarity and performance makes BlockDAG (BDAG) a leading choice in the best crypto presale market based on ROI logic. TOKEN6900 (T6900): Utility-Centric Presale with Real-World Purpose TOKEN6900 has been drawing attention for its planned utility approach aimed at enterprise-level tokenization and practical applications. The presale offers early access to its T6900 coin at a fixed rate ahead of launching smart contract automation features and governance tools. While it does not match BlockDAG’s ROI margin, TOKEN6900 appeals to those focused on long-term project delivery and the possibility of partnerships in logistics and financial compliance. The presale targets a smaller raise compared to others, using this to enforce a capped supply model. This limit, combined with planned staking features, supports a gradual price growth scenario among early entrants. TOKEN6900’s materials include scheduled lockups, clear tokenomics, and a small, public-facing team. For those looking to join the best crypto presale with an emphasis on practical utility rather than hype, T6900 is becoming a credible contender. SUBBD (SUBBD): Bandwidth-Driven Presale with Gaming Appeal SUBBD positions itself at the intersection of blockchain bandwidth and gaming, functioning as a subnet-powered resource coin. The idea is straightforward: games and dApps can lease bandwidth from node operators using SUBBD as payment, creating demand linked directly to network activity. The presale has gained interest for its gamified staking tiers and performance incentives. Early participants benefit from pricing advantages along with whitelist airdrops and partner NFT rewards. SUBBD’s pricing schedule uses gradual unlocks tied to project milestones, which helps limit volatility in early market phases. Its place in the best crypto presale category is backed by its specialized use case. While it does not match BlockDAG’s capital raise, SUBBD addresses a technical gap in decentralized bandwidth access and already has early agreements with indie game studios to trial its framework. Best Wallet Token (BEST): Presale Focused on Cashback Rewards Best Wallet Token, or BEST, is linked to a crypto wallet platform offering cashback on gas fees, swaps, and on/off ramp activity. It belongs to the growing category of utility-based coins that integrate directly with user actions. In this model, wallet activity is rewarded in BEST according to on-chain engagement. The presale follows micro-stage pricing with small, steady increases. BEST remains priced in the early cents range but builds participation through referrals and staking rewards. The project has allocated a portion of its supply specifically for wallet adoption initiatives, ensuring that utility stays closely tied to real use. Its inclusion in the best crypto presale group is due to the constant demand for secure, non-custodial tools that also reward usage. While the ROI gap is not as sharp as BlockDAG’s, the link between its features and daily crypto activity adds long-term relevance. Closing View: Why BlockDAG Stays Ahead Within the best crypto presale choices currently available, BlockDAG stands out for its clear ROI position. The special entry rate of $0.0016 is far below its active batch price of $0.0276, creating an immediate and measurable ROI gap before public listing. With $369 million raised and nearly 24.8 billion coins sold, it is among the most widely supported presales in the market. While TOKEN6900, SUBBD, and BEST each bring distinct utility cases, BlockDAG’s pricing logic keeps it firmly at the top of this presale cycle’s data-driven selections.

49866418,https://thecoinrise.com/argentina-leads-latin-america-in-crypto-adoption/,1754841624,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecoinrise.png,Argentina Leads Latin America in Crypto Adoption,https://thecoinrise.com/argentina-leads-latin-america-in-crypto-adoption/,"Argentina now stands at the top of Latin America’s crypto adoption chart. The rise is not just about interest in new technology or hype. It is a direct response to years of economic trouble, marked by hyperinflation and strict controls on foreign currency. Recent data shows that nearly one in five Argentines, about 19.8% of the population, own digital assets. This puts the country ahead of Brazil at 18.6%, and El Salvador at 15%. Young People Lead the Way in Crypto Adoption The growth is strongest among young adults. In Latin America, more than 20% of people aged 18 to 35 own cryptocurrency. In Argentina, this trend is stronger. Many people use digital assets to protect their savings from inflation, which has risen to nearly 200% in recent years. A study by Rankings Latam found that six countries, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru, account for 87% of all crypto users in the region. Argentina’s lead is striking because El Salvador, despite making Bitcoin (BTC) legal tender in 2021, has fewer active users by percentage. This increased crypto use is supported by friendly crypto adoption policies. President Javier Milei, who was recently cleared of wrongdoing in the Libra crypto scandal, has openly supported cryptocurrencies. His government is looking at new laws to make Bitcoin transactions legal and easier. If passed, these changes could help Argentina stay a leader in digital finance in the region. Stablecoins Offer Stability A report from Chainalysis shows that Latin America is the second-fastest-growing region for cryptocurrency. Much of this growth comes from countries like Argentina, where people use stablecoins to fight inflation and avoid the limits of traditional banking. One of the biggest drivers of Argentina’s crypto boom is stablecoins like USDT. These digital coins are pegged to the value of the US dollar, helping people keep their savings safe from losing value. In 2024, it was reported that citizens also turned to Bitcoin as a store of value . This demand was fueled by the persistent decline of the Argentine peso (ARS) and a worsening inflation crisis. The surge in crypto adoption has attracted major global exchanges. Crypto firms like OKX increasingly expanding their operations in Argentina . Many view the country as one of the most promising markets in Latin America. Argentina Set to Keep Lead in Latin America’s Crypto Growth Experts think Argentina will stay in the lead, with Rankings Latam expecting crypto use in the region to grow by 18.3% in 2025. Argentina’s rise in crypto use shows how hard economic times can push people toward digital finance. But challenges remain. Many people worry about safety, and only 32% of Latin Americans trust crypto transactions. Scams and hacking have made older people more cautious, with less than 10% of baby boomers owning crypto. Experts say teaching people to use digital currencies safely will be key to future growth.

BetMGM Casino is pushing into Brazil through a NetRefer partnership to sharpen regional outreach, while Bet9ja engages audiences with celebrity-led football carnivals blending entertainment and charity. Yet, in the area of player rewards, neither offers the same upfront value found at Spartans.com. At Spartans.com, the approach is direct: make crypto go further. First-time users can claim a 300% welcome bonus for both casino and sports by depositing just $5. On top of that, daily 25% reload bonuses keep balances boosted across thousands of betting markets and games. For anyone starting in online sports betting for beginners or seeking to enhance casino play, Spartans delivers standout bonus power. Spartans.com: Why the 300% Bonus Stands Out Spartans.com delivers one of the largest first-day promotions in online betting. A $5 deposit unlocks a 300% bonus for both sports betting and casino games, from blackjack tables to football matches, giving users more time in play and better chances to win. Instead of stopping at a one-time offer, Spartans continues with daily 25% reloads. This setup is ideal for those new to online sports betting for beginners, allowing exploration with reduced risk. With access to thousands of games and live sports markets, every deposit works harder. Options include trying in-play wagers, multi-bets, or simple match results, all powered by added bonus funds. Casino fans also benefit, with bonuses covering slots, live roulette, crash games, and more. Transactions are crypto-first, supporting BTC, ETH, USDT, and others, with payouts often processed in under 15 minutes. For users learning the betting process, Spartans offers an easy and rewarding start. There’s no Spartans token presale or marketing gimmick—just deposit $5 and triple your balance instantly, turning crypto deposits into strong gameplay potential. BetMGM Casino Targets Brazil Through Affiliate Expansion The entry of BetMGM Casino into Brazil marks a significant push for Latin American reach. Teaming with NetRefer, a leader in affiliate marketing tools, the brand can enhance user acquisition via automation, tracking, and targeted content. Brazilian users will likely notice localized promotions, language options, and region-focused campaigns from this trusted gaming name. However, the core player bonuses remain modest compared to new competitors. This is where platforms like Spartans.com hold an edge, offering larger sign-up packages, crypto features from the start, and quicker payouts. While BetMGM’s strategy is built for sustained growth, casual users who value immediate benefits, bigger bonuses, and crypto betting options often lean toward platforms delivering more upfront value. Bet9ja Blends Sports, Celebrities, and Charity In Nigeria, Bet9ja’s Football Carnival combined celebrity matches, live music, and charitable giving into a high-energy community event. Popular figures such as Yhemolee, Shank, and Sheggz led teams, with proceeds benefiting causes including Down syndrome, spina bifida, and blindness, raising ₦2 million overall. The event strengthened Bet9ja’s social connection with younger audiences who enjoy both entertainment and social impact. Yet, when it comes to the betting experience, features still matter most to players. Bet9ja remains strong in Nigerian sports markets, particularly local leagues, but is behind newer platforms in bonuses, crypto support, and payout speed. While the carnival boosted its public image, users increasingly seek instant bonus perks, constant withdrawals, and crypto-focused services, where Bet9ja is catching up. Final Thoughts BetMGM Casino is building its Brazilian presence through advanced affiliate systems, while Bet9ja strengthens ties with fans through celebrity sports events and charity. These strategies grow their brands, but neither currently matches the direct player rewards from Spartans.com . With 300% welcome bonuses for both casino and sports, plus daily 25% reload offers, Spartans gives users a head start from day one. Only $5 is needed to activate the deal, valid across thousands of games and sports bets. For those exploring online sports betting for beginners, it’s an easy, high-value starting point. Add near-instant crypto payouts and no banking delays, and Spartans.com consistently delivers more value for every action.

Betway, bet365, and Ladbrokes all offer impressive features like upgraded interfaces, better cash-out tools, and football bonuses. Yet, many players still face common problems. They want quick payouts, clear rules, and access from anywhere. These key demands often go unmet by big names. While each platform focuses on flashy updates, none quite meet all core needs. Spartans stand apart by delivering what matters most: nearly 6,000 games, instant crypto payments, and simple 35x wagering terms. There is no app download needed, no confusing rules at withdrawal, and no regional blocks. Spartans is fast becoming the real best betting platform for players who want clarity and speed over empty promises. 1. Spartans: Leads With Instant Payouts, 5,963+ Games, And Transparent 35x Wagering Spartans has quickly become the top crypto-first platform by focusing on what matters most to players: speed and transparency. It offers an impressive selection of more than 5,963 games along with a full sportsbook that features real-time odds on many sports. The wagering terms are clear and easy to follow. Players must wager 35 times the bonus amount within 7 days, with no hidden rules or confusing clauses. There are no regional limits, making Spartans accessible to users worldwide. This kind of honesty is rare in online gambling. One of the biggest advantages is Spartans’ fast crypto payout system. Withdrawals are processed instantly in popular cryptocurrencies such as BTC, BNB, DAI, USDC, ETH, USDT, and ADA. For those familiar with traditional sportsbooks, where withdrawal times can stretch for days, this is a major improvement. The platform also adds excitement with a Lamborghini giveaway, a high-value promotion that feels genuine and fair, not like a marketing gimmick. Mobile users benefit too, as Spartans require no app download. Whether betting on UFC fights, football matches, or spinning slot reels, the site runs smoothly and quickly across devices. While established platforms like Betway, bet365, and Ladbrokes continue to update older systems, Spartans focuses on delivering a fast, modern, and clear experience. This commitment to performance and player-first features is why many crypto bettors, esports fans, and mobile-first users recognize Spartans as the best betting platform available today. 2. Betway: Trusted For In-Play Depth But Lacks Early Payouts Betway has long been a major player in the UK betting world. It is well-known for football sponsorships and strong in-play betting tools. The cash-out feature is powerful, especially for live bettors wanting control during big games. However, Betway does not currently offer early payout deals. The popular “You Lead, You Win” promotion, which once covered sports like football and golf, is not active. There is no public plan to bring it back soon, though it may return seasonally. Aside from football, Betway provides solid odds and a smooth mobile experience. Still, the promotions section feels weaker compared to newer platforms. Betway could improve by adding faster crypto payments and withdrawal speeds. These are areas where Spartans and other modern sites shine. Overall, Betway is reliable but not the top choice for those who want quick bonuses and clear terms in 2025. For players seeking the best betting platform, Betway has strengths but falls short on speed and crypto options. 3. bet365: Offers Early Payouts But Trails On Withdrawal Speed bet365 remains a leader with the widest betting variety, extensive livestreams, and its early payout offer. The “Two Goals Ahead” feature pays football bets when a team leads by two goals, no matter the final score. This is one of the clearest early payout promos available and gives users a strong edge. Beyond that, bet365 provides both partial and full cash-outs, numerous football markets, and high-quality streams for hundreds of games weekly. It is built for large-scale betting action unmatched by many. However, bet365 lags in how quickly it processes withdrawals. Traditional banking methods take several days. It also restricts some promos based on region, leading to inconsistent user experiences. While it excels in features, its slow payout speed puts it behind agile platforms like Spartans that offer instant crypto withdrawals. For those searching for the best betting platform, bet365’s depth is great but speed and crypto readiness matter more today. 4. Ladbrokes: Holds Tradition As Others Push Forward Ladbrokes is among the oldest UK betting brands and is praised for its user-friendly app and familiar interface. It covers all basics, including football odds, accumulator boosts, live betting, and a popular bet builder tool. Yet, Ladbrokes does not offer early payout promos. Unlike bet365, it has no current plans to add these features. Its welcome bonuses and occasional price boosts remain solid but are not remarkable in today’s competitive market. The platform still relies on traditional bank transfers and debit card withdrawals, which are slower and less appealing to those wanting instant crypto payments. While Ladbrokes stays stable and recognizable, it has not adapted as quickly as newer rivals. In 2025, many players prefer innovation over legacy. This is where Ladbrokes risks falling behind. As Spartans deliver instant withdrawals and straightforward bonus rules, Ladbrokes may lose appeal among those looking for the best betting platform with modern features. Final Thoughts Betway is solid for live betting, bet365 leads with early payouts, and Ladbrokes holds a trusted brand name. Each platform offers credibility and familiarity. However, none match Spartans when it comes to fast, transparent payouts and a seamless user experience.

Solana (SOL) Price Outlook: Will $177 Support Lead to $330? Solana’s price is currently around $184, recovering after a dip from $206. The $177–$190 area is key, with large wallet activity and institutional entries providing a strong base. Data from SolanaFloor reveals Upexi Treasury purchased 83,000 SOL worth $16.7 million, raising their total to $381 million, a clear sign of confidence. On the charts, a cup-and-handle formation is taking shape, often linked to bullish breakouts toward $330–$400 if support holds. Stablecoin usage on Solana is rising fast, with Circle minting $750 million USDC on the network. Maintaining prices above $177 keeps the bullish outlook intact, with $190 as the next pivot to reclaim $206 and beyond. Stellar (XLM) Price Forecast: Recovery Signs After the Drop Following a fall of over 20% to $0.40, Stellar is showing early signs of recovery. Network activity is surging, with transactions up 22% in a week and active addresses climbing 16% to 208,000. Stablecoin volume jumped 40%, reaching $1.8 billion, and supply now stands at $184 million, suggesting the decline may be short-term. Technically, a doji candle has appeared, often viewed as a reversal signal. XLM remains above both the 25-day and 50-day moving averages, indicating its correction may be complete. If momentum sustains, a move toward $0.52 is possible. The outlook stays positive if support holds, with the GENIUS Act expected to channel more stablecoin traffic into Stellar. Final Takeaway Solana’s chart setup and strong buying interest suggest a push toward $330 is possible, while Stellar’s rebound signs hint at a return to $0.52. Away from market charts, Spartans.com offers an immediate way to convert crypto into active rewards. With 300% bonuses on casino and sports betting, $200 from a $5 deposit, daily reloads, and thousands of games, Spartans delivers features that most bitcoin betting platforms can’t match.

Find Out Which Crypto to Buy Today for the Best ROI & Rewards",https://thecoinrise.com/ethereum-solana-or-cold-wallet-find-out-which-crypto-to-buy-today-for-the-best-roi-rewards/,"As market sentiment swings between optimism and caution, investors are asking, “Which crypto to buy today for the most balanced upside?” The Solana price rally shows signs that momentum could be returning, supported by stronger network metrics and cleaner order books. Meanwhile, the Cardano bearish outlook persists, with repeated rejections and heavy whale distribution slowing its recovery. In this uncertain environment, selectivity is key. That’s why traders are not only examining price charts but also considering structural advantages that can thrive in any market cycle. Cold Wallet that rewards its users, instead of taxing them, can significantly change portfolio dynamics. If you’re wondering which crypto to buy today, comparing technical momentum, on-chain activity, and user rewards is essential. Solana Price Rally Builds Credibility for Upside Momentum watchers are closely tracking the Solana price rally, supported by cleaner exchange supply and more stable derivatives positioning. When sell-side liquidity thins, rallies often have more room to run, which is why Solana continues to appear on breakout screens for active traders. Volume clustering near higher lows suggests that dip buyers remain engaged, adding confidence to the rally. Solana’s developers are still active on the chain, with throughput remaining strong and fees staying low. New consumer apps continue to launch, adding to the network’s growth. For anyone wondering which crypto to buy today, Solana’s mix of adoption and efficiency makes its rally more than just a headline. If key resistance levels break, we could see a quick continuation of the rally. However, risk controls are essential. The Solana price rally depends on broader liquidity and market sentiment. During choppier periods, it’s better to scale in gradually rather than chasing price action. For those asking which crypto to buy today, Solana remains a strong momentum play, but it still relies on momentum for its upside. Cardano Bearish Outlook: Patience Required On the other side, the Cardano bearish outlook reflects the distribution from larger holders and a community awaiting meaningful catalysts. When rallies keep failing at similar levels, confidence begins to fade, and the bearish outlook deepens. This has created a discount, but it also means recovery will take time. Cardano’s roadmap remains ambitious, but price action still follows supply and demand dynamics. For those considering which crypto to buy today, the Cardano bearish outlook suggests that patience is necessary. Range trading might be effective, but swing entries require discipline while the momentum remains absent. This doesn’t mean Cardano is uninvestable. The bearish outlook simply calls for caution and longer timelines. If governance decisions and network upgrades start driving on-chain demand, the outlook could change. Until then, Cardano remains on the watchlist, not an immediate buy for traders deciding which crypto to buy today. Cold Wallet Turns Fees Into Rewards for Everyday Usage Cold Wallet is transforming what it means to be a top crypto investment. Rather than just a storage solution with a token on top, Cold Wallet is a rewards engine for everyday crypto activity. Every time you pay gas fees, swap tokens, or transfer funds, Cold Wallet gives a percentage back in CWT tokens. The more you use it, the more you accumulate, and the more you hold, the higher your rewards. At the highest reward tier, users can get up to 100% cashback on gas fees. This model works well in both bear and bull markets, cushioning activity during downturns and compounding it during uptrends. Cold Wallet’s presale is currently at Stage 17, priced at $0.00998, with over $5.9M raised. With a projected 4,900% ROI upon listing, the entry economics are compelling. This is why Cold Wallet shows up when investors ask which crypto to buy today. Low price, clear path, and direct user value make it stand out. Unlike the Solana price rally or Cardano’s bearish outlook, Cold Wallet isn’t dependent on a single chart event. It is designed to reward users for activity, making it sustainable across any market cycle. When cycles shift, Cold Wallet’s incentives will be the competitive edge that many portfolios are missing. Wrapping Up If the Solana price rally continues and clears resistance with strong market breadth, it can be a tactical long position with clear risk management. If the Cardano bearish outlook begins to fade, patience might pay off for those willing to wait for recovery. For traders and investors asking which crypto to buy today , there’s a third option that works in both market conditions. Cold Wallet offers a unique proposition: it pays you to be active. This smoothens returns during volatile periods and accelerates compounding when liquidity returns. With Stage 17 priced at $0.00998, $5.9M raised, and a 4,900% ROI target, Cold Wallet stands out as a clear winner for 2025.

The update, highlighted by prominent XRP advocate JackTheRippler on X, shows the token outperforming all other assets in the top 10, securing the leading position based on short-term returns. XRP Leads Grayscale’s Weekly Rankings Grayscale’s Crypto Snapshot – Assets ranks the top-performing non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by weekly percentage gains. In the latest release covering the July 31 to August 7 period, XRP posted a gain of roughly 9.7%, overtaking other major assets to claim the number one spot. This surge also pushed its year-to-date performance into the high 50% range, reflecting the growing strength of its price action in 2025. The weekly snapshot offers a clear visual of market rotation. Just a week prior, XRP was sitting in the middle of the rankings, but its strong rally propelled it to the summit. Grayscale’s data confirms the short-term momentum shift, with XRP’s rapid rise driven by concentrated buying pressure. BREAKING: #XRP has achieved a remarkable 1-week return and secured the top spot in GRAYSCALE’s weekly snapshot of the top 10 crypto assets! pic.twitter.com/SJt685zlyD — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) August 9, 2025 Price Action and Market Conditions During the period reflected in Grayscale’s rankings, XRP traded largely between $3.10 and $3.30 across major exchanges. The breakout toward the $3.30 region marked a key technical development, as it coincided with a spike in trading volumes and heightened volatility. While these gains have been partially consolidated, the weekly data demonstrates how quickly sentiment can turn in favor of a strong momentum asset. Factors Driving the Surge Two key catalysts appear to have fueled XRP’s standout performance. First, recent developments in the Ripple vs. SEC legal case continue to impact market sentiment. Any step toward legal clarity has historically prompted traders to re-enter positions aggressively. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Second, Grayscale’s role in institutional crypto adoption adds weight to the ranking. Through its Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC), which includes XRP alongside assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Grayscale maintains a strong influence on institutional investor interest. With the broader market also reacting to ETF-related discussions and institutional inflows, XRP’s visibility in Grayscale’s data reinforces its profile as a serious contender among large-cap cryptocurrencies. Outlook and Considerations While topping Grayscale’s weekly list is a notable achievement, traders and investors should remain cautious about assuming it signals a long-term trend change. Weekly performance metrics capture momentum over a short horizon, but sustaining leadership requires consistent volume, favorable macro conditions, and ongoing positive catalysts. For now, XRP’s sharp climb in Grayscale’s rankings highlights its ability to capture both institutional and retail attention. JackTheRippler’s update reflects a fact-backed and market-significant moment — XRP’s remarkable ascent to the top of Grayscale’s leaderboard, powered by a blend of technical strength, institutional relevance, and a favorable news cycle.

49867151,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/dogecoin-explodes-past-0-25-could-0-50-arrive-sooner-than-expected/,1754842740,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/49867151.jpeg,Dogecoin Price Prediction: Dogecoin Explodes Past $0.25 Could $0.50 Arrive Sooner Than Expected?,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/dogecoin-explodes-past-0-25-could-0-50-arrive-sooner-than-expected/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently priced at $0.24419, showing an explosive move as it surges past $0.25. Despite a recent 4% drop, Dogecoin’s long-term potential remains intact. The question on everyone’s mind is whether DOGE can break its key resistance at $0.202-$0.203 and push towards $0.50 sooner than expected. While Dogecoin remains a strong speculative asset, investors may also turn to more stable, utility-driven projects like Remittix (RTX), which offers steady growth through its real-world applications, providing a solid alternative to the volatility in meme coins. Dogecoin Faces Resistance But Long-Term Outlook Is Bullish Dogecoin has recently faced volatility due to macroeconomic uncertainty, including a decline in the global market. This led to a 4% drop from $0.20 to $0.19, but it found strong support at the $0.188-$0.190 level. DOGE’s recent price action suggests that despite short-term corrections, long-term sentiment remains bullish. If Dogecoin can break the current resistance at $0.202-$0.20 3, there is a clear path toward higher price targets like $0.50. To reach this milestone, DOGE needs to hold its support around $0.188-$0.190 and decisively break through the resistance at $0.202-$0.203. Broader market factors, including global trade dynamics and Federal Reserve policies, will continue to influence DOGE’s price trajectory, so macroeconomic conditions should be closely monitored. As Dogecoin faces volatility, investors may look to more stable, utility-driven projects like Remittix (RTX) for steady growth, offering a strong alternative to speculative assets. Why Remittix Could Be a Complementary Investment to Dogecoin While Dogecoin’s speculative nature offers potential for significant short-term gains, investors are also eyeing stable, utility-driven projects like Remittix (RTX) . Remittix focuses on providing cross-border crypto-to-fiat payments with next-day settlement, offering investors a predictable growth trajectory. Unlike Dogecoin, which is largely driven by sentiment, Remittix offers tangible use cases in the crypto space, making it an attractive investment for those seeking real-world utility in their portfolios. Here’s why Remittix (RTX) deserves attention: Global Settlement : Remittix allows seamless and secure crypto-to-fiat conversions across 30 countries, offering immediate settlement solutions. Transparent Fees : With flat pricing and no hidden fees, Remittix ensures greater clarity for investors. Security & Stability : CertiK-audited smart contracts and a robust liquidity infrastructure secure Remittix transactions. Enterprise Adoption : Remittix is steadily gaining traction with its mobile wallet beta and merchant tools driving mainstream adoption. Conclusion: Why Dogecoin and Remittix Are Worth Watching Dogecoin’s speculative nature and growing community sentiment could drive the price to $0.50, with positive momentum from bullish technicals. However, for investors seeking a more stable, long-term growth strategy, Remittix offers the perfect complement to DOGE’s volatility. While DOGE has the potential to explode in price, Remittix’s real-world use cases in crypto-to-fiat settlements make it an ideal investment for those looking for predictable growth in the evolving crypto landscape.

The Windows 10 user is dragging Microsoft before the court over its decision to stop supporting the older operating system software in favor of its newer models. Microsoft faces lawsuit over decision to end Windows 10 support The lawsuit, filed in California by Lawrence Klein, claims that the company’s decision will leave “many millions” of people vulnerable to cyberattacks and data security incidents. Klein owns two Windows 10 laptops that will become obsolete in just eight weeks, and is seeking a court order that will compel Microsoft to continue providing free support until the number of devices running its older operating system falls below a “reasonable threshold.” Currently, Windows 10 PCs account for around 45% of the 700 million Windows devices in use. Microsoft’s decision to end support means that after the October deadline, users will need to either upgrade, buy a new device, or pay for extended security updates. Klein’s complaint alleges that the company is well aware that many users will neither buy new hardware nor pay for support, leaving them exposed to heightened risks. The lawsuit also points to a significant subset of users consisting of an estimated 240 million PCs that cannot upgrade to Windows 11 due to hardware limitations. These users, Klein argues that these users are being effectively “forced” to purchase new devices or pay unanticipated fees for extended support. Allegations of strategic market manipulation Beyond the immediate security concerns, Klein claims Microsoft’s decision is driven by a long-term strategy to push customers toward new devices designed to work with the company’s latest software offerings, including generative AI tools such as Copilot , which comes built into Windows 11. According to the lawsuit, when Microsoft announced plans to end Windows 10, the operating system still held more than half of the Windows OS market share. Klein alleges that by discontinuing support while so many users were still on the platform, Microsoft aimed to accelerate hardware sales and boost adoption of its AI-driven products. The legal filing further argues that this approach will have “the inevitable effect of decreasing trade in generative AI products of Microsoft’s competitors, increasing the barriers to entry in the generative AI market, and dampening innovation and consumer choice.” Currently, Microsoft offers extended support for Windows 10 through two options. Either a paid plan that costs between $30 and $60 annually, or a free extension available under certain conditions. This applies to all Windows 10 users, regardless of whether their devices meet the hardware requirements for Windows 11. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Usually, blue-chip assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum offer steady growth. However, it's low-cap, high-upside tokens have turned pocket change into six- or even seven-figure windfalls. With the 2025 market heating up, a new wave of tokens could offer not just hype, but serious potential. Let's take a look at five tokens that could be life-changing this year. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): From Meme to Millions? Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is storming the meme coin scene with utility, innovation, and serious investor attention. While many meme coins rely solely on hype, Little Pepe is building real infrastructure. That's precisely why it's drawing comparisons to the early days of Dogecoin and PEPE, but with far more upside. Now in Stage 9 of its presale, $LILPEPE is trading at just $0.0018, with over $15 million already raised. Interest is accelerating, especially after the project’s CoinMarketCap listing, which solidified its credibility in the eyes of retail and early whales alike. The token powers its own Layer 2 blockchain, built specifically for the meme economy. This means zero tax trading, sniper-bot resistance, and lightning-fast speeds. Its ecosystem also features a dedicated meme launchpad, giving it an ecosystem that’s light-years ahead of typical meme coins. Adding to the excitement, two top-tier centralized exchange listings are locked in for launch, with confirmed negotiations to list on the world’s largest exchange. Investors are positioning early before this goes mainstream. Analysts believe that if $LILPEPE even grazes $0.50, early buyers at $0.0018 could secure 300x returns within 18 months. The project is also running a $777,000 giveaway , with 10 lucky winners receiving $77,000 each in tokens. To qualify, investors must contribute at least $100 and complete a few simple tasks. This giveaway has added even more incentive to join now. With a powerful blend of meme culture, blockchain tech, and massive upside potential, this is one of the most compelling tokens in 2025 for turning spare change into generational wealth. Turbo (TURBO): AI-Generated Hype with Real Staying Power Turbo (TURBO) is a distinctive meme coin created entirely by AI. It is now listed and trading at about $0.00430, with a market cap of around $297 million. Launched in April 2023 on a $69 budget using GPT‑4 and Midjourney, Turbo quickly earned cult status with its toad mascot “Quantum Leap.” Despite its lack of concrete utility today, it remains one of the top meme coins capturing AI-meme crossover interest. Analysts forecast price potential as high as $0.0105–$0.0119 by year-end. If a macro meme cycle arrives, the upside could be explosive. For investors starting with just a few dollars, it remains one of the rare meme coins still trading under $0.005 with serious upside potential. Wall Street Pepe (WEPE): Meme Finance with Explosive Potential Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) is carving out a unique lane in the meme coin space, blending satire, finance, and viral internet culture. As of early August, the token remains well under the radar with a modest market cap below $25 million. This leaves plenty of room for explosive upside. WEPE's strategic branding, meme-rich narrative, and growing community that thrives on humor and hustle set it apart. It recently secured listings on BitMart and MEXC, sparking fresh interest and widening access. The team has teased an NFT line and DeFi utility in development, adding long-term potential to the hype. With strong meme momentum and clever execution, WEPE could quietly become one of 2025’s most surprising breakout tokens. Popcat (POPCAT): The Viral Cat Token Poised for a Comeback Popcat (POPCAT) is trading at approximately $0.2970, with a market cap of around $286 million. After peaking at $2.06 in November 2024, the token has since retraced about 85%, settling near current levels as meme coin sentiment cools. Market trading volume is healthy at $25–30 million daily, supported by listings on platforms like KuCoin and Kraken. Analysts estimate Popcat could reclaim $1–$2 by late 2025 as meme mania returns and Asia-based virality reignites. Popcat’s combination of cultural clout, steady exchange presence, and reclaimed momentum in a market hungry for explosive returns positions it as a potential high-beta play. Pepecoin (PEP): A Layer‑1 Meme Coin with Real Potential Pepecoin (PEP) trades around $0.00050, commanding a market cap of approximately $57 million. After soaring to an all-time high of $0.00185 in December 2024, PEP has since retraced 70%. But it remains resilient, recently rebounding from its $0.00045 low. Pepecoin distinguishes itself through Layer‑1 decentralization, merge-mining compatibility with Litecoin and Dogecoin. It also has zero pre-mine or VC allocation, traits rare in meme token space. Analysts see a strong asymmetrical upside of 10× to 50×. Conclusion 2025 will be a breakout year for high-upside altcoins, and these five tokens are leading the charge.

Cardano’s (ADA) price drop risk is even sharper, with technicals hinting at a potential 25% loss toward $0.53 as bearish sentiment builds. While both projects wrestle with near-term selling pressure, Cold Wallet(CWT) is taking the opposite path, growing before launch. Its $270M Plus Wallet acquisition instantly onboarded 2M+ users, while a presale at Stage 17 and $0.00998 per token still offers a potential 3,423% ROI to launch. In this market, the token flipping gas fees into rewards looks like the smartest bet. Solana Faces Key Support Test as 10% Price Drop Looms Solana’s price is showing weakness below its June high, forming a descending triangle; a pattern often signaling further drops. Right now, SOL is around $163, teetering just above its $160 support level with bearish indicators building. If it slips past this foundation, it could slide toward $153 in the near term. On‑chain data shows a net outflow of $18.6 million from SOL spot markets, hinting at caution among larger holders. Still, dips can serve as entry points when buying pressure returns. Lower prices may offer a chance to accumulate SOL before any recovery. Watch for renewed inflows, a rebound from support, or a break above $166. Those signs could signal that Solana might be preparing for its next move upward. Cardano Faces a Possible 25% Drop Cardano (ADA) is showing weakness after failing to hold above $0.74, with analysts warning it could slide toward $0.53. On-chain data shows a decline in tokens moving off exchanges, signaling reduced investor confidence. Over 50% of traders are holding short positions, adding to bearish pressure. Technical signals such as the MACD and on-balance volume are trending lower, reflecting fading momentum. While this setup points to a potential 25% fall, it may also create a lower entry point for long-term buyers. Investors should watch for a shift in volume or a price rebound from key support levels before committing. The next move will likely depend on whether buyers can regain control or sellers push ADA into deeper losses. Cold Wallet’s $270M Deal Just Changed the Game for Web3 Wallets Cold Wallet’s $270 million acquisition of Plus Wallet is more than just a big number; it is a calculated, pre-launch growth accelerator. This single move instantly brought over 2 million active users into its ecosystem, a scale that most blockchain projects take years to achieve after going live. By absorbing Plus Wallet’s infrastructure, Cold Wallet supercharges its cashback rewards model from the first day of full operations. Every swap, gas payment, or transfer now becomes part of an earning loop instead of a cost sink, giving users a reason to choose it over MetaMask or Trust Wallet. User frustration with traditional wallets’ complex interfaces is growing, and Cold Wallet is positioning itself as the simpler, more rewarding alternative. With $5.8 million already raised in its presale, Stage 17 pricing set at $0.00998, and the Stage 1 price having been just $0.007, the window for maximum ROI is already tightening. The fixed launch price of $0.3517 represents a 3,423% return for those entering now, before more stages sell out and the upside shrinks. This acquisition is not just a headline; it compresses years of user acquisition, adoption, and utility growth into one decisive move. Takeaway The Solana (SOL) price update warns of short-term weakness as on-chain flows turn negative. Cardano’s (ADA) price drop pressure underscores deeper structural hurdles, with over half of traders shorting the asset. Cold Wallet, in contrast, is building momentum with measurable, bankable growth; $5.8M raised, Stage 17 entry at $0.00998, and a fixed launch price of $0.3517. Stage 1 buyers at $0.007 are already looking at a 4,923% ROI projection. With 2M+ users secured pre-launch, a real cashback utility model, and no reliance on speculative hype, Cold Wallet stands as the best-positioned play for outsized returns before broader market sentiment shifts.

He emphasized key investment concepts such as mispricing and risk, offering a strategic perspective on navigating the crypto space during this unique market cycle.

With increased capital inflows, specific cryptocurrencies have consistently entered the overbought zone, with the Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) readings climbing above the 70 threshold. Such levels suggest buying pressure may be overextended, often leading to consolidation or a reversal as traders take profits. Below are two coins currently in overbought territory that warrant attention heading into the new week. Lido DAO (LDO) Lido DAO (LDO) plays a key role in one of Ethereum’s largest liquid staking protocols, allowing users to stake cryptocurrency while retaining liquidity. The token has surged 15.6% in the past 24 hours to $1.371. Amid this positive momentum, LDO’s RSI readings are elevated across time frames, hitting 79.41 on the four-hour chart and remaining above 72 on the daily, both well past the overbought threshold. LDO RSI chart. Source: Coinglass Much of the momentum around LDO has been driven by increased whale accumulation of the asset. Ethena (ENA) Ethena ( ENA ), which powers a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum, is also trading in the overbought zone. The token has recently enjoyed strong bullish momentum, rising 5.46% in the past day to $0.7749. Its RSI stands at 73.75 on the four-hour chart and 73.41 on the daily, both above the overbought threshold. ENA RSI chart. Source: Coinglass Notably, crypto trading analyst Ali Martinez noted that Ethena has broken out of a bullish flag pattern, signaling a potential continuation of its July rally. The possible breakout points to upside targets of $1 and $1.50 based on Fibonacci extensions, provided momentum holds above the $0.70 support. ENA price analysis chart.

In a market dominated by established blockchain giants, Layer Brett’s innovative blend of meme coin appeal and Layer 2 utility is generating unprecedented FOMO among savvy investors. This comparison unpacks how Layer Brett’s 100x potential and extraordinary 150K% reward narrative set it apart from both meme and utility coins, compelling even the most loyal Solana and Cardano supporters to reconsider their strategies. Layer Brett’s Presale & Tokenomics: Where Hype Meets Utility Launching its presale, now at just $0.004 per token, Layer Brett ($LBRETT) enters the scene with a fixed max supply of 10 billion tokens, instantly drawing eyes from ADA and SOL communities. Over $126,000 USD has already been raised, underscoring massive early demand. Unlike many meme coins, Layer Brett’s infrastructure leverages Ethereum’s Layer 2 for fast transactions and lower gas fees, making it a standout contender for those seeking the best crypto to buy now. Staking is another area where Layer Brett eclipses competitors. Early adopters enjoy staking APYs above 20,000%, a figure that dwarfs what’s available from Shiba Inu, Bonk, or Dogecoin. As more holders stake, the APY will decrease, creating urgency and classic crypto FOMO. The platform’s upcoming gamified staking and NFT integration further amplifies community engagement, signaling utility beyond hype—a feature often missing from both SOL and ADA. Comparison: Layer Brett vs. Solana, Cardano, and Meme Coin Leaders When compared to established blockchains like Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA), Layer Brett’s appeal lies in its hybrid model: Meme coin virality fused with Layer 2 technology. While ADA remains a utility-focused blockchain and SOL dominates in speed and DeFi, neither can currently match Layer Brett’s early-stage APY or FOMO-driven tokenomics. This dynamic positions Layer Brett as the best crypto to buy now for those seeking both rapid growth and innovative rewards. Layer Brett’s zero KYC model and instant staking via MetaMask or Trust Wallet further distinguish it from traditional Layer 1s and even rivals like Polygon or Arbitrum. The ongoing $1 million giveaway and upcoming NFT features only add fuel to the fire, enticing SOL and ADA holders looking for the next major opportunity. Competitive Edge: Outpacing Meme & Layer 2 Rivals Layer Brett’s roadmap includes cross-chain interoperability and future gamified NFT rewards, setting it apart from meme coin peers such as Brett (original), Pepe, and Shiba Inu. No other meme coin currently offers both a Layer 2 backbone and such robust staking returns. With Ethereum Layer 2s projected to hit over $10 trillion in volume by 2027, Layer Brett’s positioning as a meme-utility hybrid is strategic and timely. Conclusion: Why Layer Brett Is Turning Heads The unique blend of 20,000%+ staking APY, low presale price, Layer 2 speed, zero KYC, and a massive community giveaway elevates Layer Brett as the best crypto to buy now. For SOL and ADA holders, the project’s 100x potential and innovative features offer compelling reasons to diversify. As Layer Brett aligns with all trending crypto narratives in 2025, its ability to combine meme hype with substantive utility makes it the year’s most magnetic new entrant. LayerBrett ’s presale is gaining momentum, with steady demand pushing the current $0.004 entry price toward its next tier. Early access at this rate won’t be open for long, and smart money is already moving.

According to the analyst's post, the buyback projects are listed as follows: In the under $50 million market capitalization category, Silo Finance (SILO), Gearbox (GEAR), and Natix Network (NATIX) were included. Projects with a market capitalization between $50 million and $500 million include Kaito (KAITO), DeFi App (HOME), DeBridge (DBR), and Aevo (AEVO). EtherFi (ETHFI), Maple Finance (SYRUP), Raydium (RAY), and dYdX (DYDX) were listed in the $500 million–$1 billion category.

The best performing cryptos now attract attention not only for hype but for how they set up strong entry points. Among these names, one stands out for its unique price setup, BlockDAG. Below is a closer look at the best performing cryptos of 2025 and what makes some offer stronger leverage than others. BlockDAG (BDAG): $0.0016 Window Before GLOBAL LAUNCH Release BlockDAG is turning heads with a special price point of $0.0016, far below its current batch rate of $0.0276. This gap is intentional, giving early participants a chance to secure volume before the August 11 GLOBAL LAUNCH release. The timing makes this window hard to ignore. With $369 million raised and over 24.9 billion coins sold, BlockDAG has moved through 28 batches with a 2,660% ROI since Batch 1. Even in Batch 29 at $0.0276, the $0.0016 access point delivers a near 94% price cut. This isn’t a short-term stunt it’s a calculated move to boost potential returns for those acting ahead of listing. With exchange debuts and network expansion on the way, BlockDAG (BDAG) stands apart in the best performing cryptos list by offering both strategic entry and a measurable ROI advantage. Toncoin (TON): Building Utility Through Messaging Integration Toncoin, the native asset of The Open Network, is gaining attention for its close link with Telegram. Its framework taps into the vast audience of the messaging app, driving adoption across payments, mini-apps, and dApps. With an architecture built for high-speed transactions, Toncoin has recently added on-chain domains and NFT tools, boosting its profile. Many see TON as a bridge to large-scale retail use through messaging channels. While it does not have the same pricing advantage as BlockDAG’s $0.0016 presale access, Toncoin holds its position among the best performing cryptos due to its direct real-world integration. Stellar (XLM): Expanding Reach in Cross-Border Finance Stellar remains a core player in remittance and cross-border payment systems. Built for efficient currency exchange, its XLM coin supports quick, low-cost transfers, making it a strong choice for institutions serving underbanked areas. The project has recently strengthened its network through collaborations with financial groups and central banks exploring digital currency pilots. While XLM’s growth is steady rather than volatile, it is valued for its consistency and infrastructure role. Among the best performing cryptos, Stellar is recognized for delivering long-term utility and dependable demand. Tron (TRX): Driving Growth Through Scale and Transactions Tron’s TRX is in focus for its high transaction count and expanding network. The chain plays a key role in stablecoin transfers and DeFi activity, particularly in Asia. Its combination of fast throughput and low fees makes it attractive for developers building large-scale applications. With strong asset backing and a wide user community, TRX offers a mix of scalability, liquidity, and real-world use. While its price changes are more measured compared to emerging names like BlockDAG, Tron’s depth and established presence keep it in the conversation among the best performing cryptos. Key Insight: What Separates Each Project in 2025 All these projects have notable strengths, but timing and pricing still matter. BlockDAG’s presale rate of $0.0016, compared to its current batch price of $0.0276, creates a rare opportunity to secure volume before the August 11 GLOBAL LAUNCH release and exchange debuts. Toncoin stands out for its messaging-based adoption, Stellar for its institutional and remittance focus, and Tron for its DeFi and stablecoin ecosystem. Yet, when reviewing the best performing cryptos with an eye on entry points and growth potential, BlockDAG’s current pricing setup gives it a clear advantage at this stage.

49868355,552657,1754845204,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49868355.jpeg,From Gold To Bitcoin: Michael Saylor’s ‘Indiana Jones’ Moment,https://bitcoinist.com/from-gold-to-bitcoin-saylors-indiana-jones-moment/,"Michael Saylor, a high-profile Bitcoin backer and co-founder of Strategy, again used a pop-culture image to push a Bitcoin message on X. He posted an AI-generated picture that casts him as Indiana Jones inside what looks like a South American temple, and he captioned it, “I went looking for gold… and found something better.” Short and pointed, the post repeats a long-running theme: Bitcoin over gold . Saylor Channels Pop Culture According to Saylor’s posts, this isn’t a one-off stunt. He recently shared another AI image that styled him like Tyler Durden from Fight Club. The visuals are simple — they grab attention — and they keep Saylor in headlines. Reports have disclosed that the imagery follows a big corporate move, which helps explain why the social posts are more than memes. I went looking for gold… and found something better. pic.twitter.com/ve3ZQaNol6 — Michael Saylor (@saylor) August 9, 2025 Based on reports, Strategy announced on July 29 that it bought 21,021 BTC for roughly $2.46 billion. That purchase brought the firm’s total to 628,791 Bitcoin. At the time of the announcement, those holdings were worth more than $70 billion. Those are the concrete figures here: the BTC counts are stable on a ledger, while dollar values shift with the market. Why The Images Matter The images serve a clear purpose. They signal confidence to investors and followers, and they steer the conversation toward Saylor’s long-held message that Bitcoin is superior to gold as a store of value. Short messages reach a wide audience fast. Longer background posts keep the story alive. A Legal And Valuation Note Reports have raised a second point: AI art that borrows famous characters can touch on rights and image questions. The posts do not appear to be affiliated with movie studios or rights holders. That could lead to debate, not immediate action. Also, dollar valuations tied to Bitcoin will move up and down with the market, so citing BTC counts with a date gives readers a clearer picture. According to filings and public posts, the facts are straightforward: Strategy bought 21,021 BTC on July 29 and now holds 628,791 Bitcoin. The Indiana Jones image is commentary and marketing rolled into one. It’s eye-catching. It’s also a reminder that modern corporate messaging mixes finance and showmanship, while basic accounting — how many BTC and when they were bought — still matters most.

Ethereum is struggling with significant resistance near the $3,800 mark, showing signs of cooling momentum, while XRP is trapped just above $3.00 after an intense surge in its minute-by-minute trading volume. Enter BlockDAG (BDAG) , a presale sensation priced at just $0.0016, quickly catching fire across the crypto world. While Ethereum (ETH) price predictions and XRP’s updates suggest caution, BlockDAG is rising to become the top-trending crypto this August. Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction: Resistance Remains at $3,800 Ethereum recently bounced back from a dip toward $3,369, managing to hold above the $3,550 support level. However, it’s currently trading between $3,600 and $3,750, facing significant technical resistance at the $3,800 threshold. Indicators like the hourly RSI point to a bullish presence, but not one strong enough to drive a breakout, suggesting potential consolidation rather than a sharp rise. Ethereum’s price prediction hinges on whether it can break through the $3,800 level. If momentum aligns, models suggest it could reach $3,880, with long-term targets around $4,120. However, failure to hold above $3,600 could lead to a retreat toward $3,500. Ethereum remains stable but lacks the urgency and drive that traders seek in a market on the move. XRP Update: Major Gains, But Faces Regulatory Hurdles XRP made waves this week by briefly surging past the $3.00 barrier, following an unprecedented $33 million volume spike in a single minute. In just 24 hours, XRP surged from $2.92 to $3.05, marking a 4.45% gain and generating significant buzz. Despite the excitement, the latest XRP update isn’t all bullish. Whale liquidations exceeding $2.1 billion, paired with a TD Sequential sell signal on the three-day chart, suggest possible exhaustion in the rally. XRP is stuck at $3.09 resistance, having failed to break this level multiple times this week. Adding to the uncertainty, the SEC is expected to update its stance on XRP’s regulatory status by mid-August, which could either open the door to a new buying spree or trigger headwinds. For now, XRP remains in a holding pattern, caught between hype and hesitation, making it a speculative bet rather than a definitive buy. BlockDAG: The Top-Trending Crypto Set to Take Off While Ethereum and XRP are struggling to break through their barriers, BlockDAG has emerged as the hottest crypto to watch. Currently in its Global Launch phase, BlockDAG is priced at just $0.0016, far below its original Batch 29 price of $0.0276. This steep discount expires on August 11, after which the price is set to increase by 17x. This limited-time offer is fueling significant momentum, but it’s the project’s robust ecosystem that’s capturing attention. With over $369 million raised, BlockDAG is no mere speculative play. Its hybrid blockchain-DAG infrastructure ensures scalable performance and compatibility with Ethereum’s Virtual Machine (EVM), allowing developers to deploy smart contracts at lightning speed. BlockDAG’s real-world presence is expanding rapidly. As the official blockchain partner of the Seattle Seawolves and Seattle Orcas, BlockDAG powers fan engagement tools and digital collectibles for both teams. The X1 mobile mining app has surpassed 2 million global users, further solidifying BlockDAG’s reach. BlockDAG is also running a 10 BTC giveaway, with anyone purchasing BDAG tokens before August 11 automatically entered for a chance to win. Additionally, a 100 million token airdrop continues, adding to the momentum leading up to listings on MEXC, LBank, XT.com, CoinStore, and BitMart. At a target launch price of $0.05, BlockDAG offers an eye-watering potential return of 3,000% at current prices. While Ethereum (ETH) and XRP are trapped in their current zones, BlockDAG is charging ahead, delivering tangible value to its users at a rapid pace. Final Thoughts Ethereum and XRP may still be big players in the crypto world, but both are showing signs of slowing momentum. Ethereum’s price prediction suggests moderate upside potential, while XRP’s regulatory uncertainty puts a damper on its future. BlockDAG, on the other hand, is not just surviving, it’s thriving. Priced at $0.0016 with just days remaining before its price increases 17x, BlockDAG is poised to be one of the best-performing assets of 2025. For investors looking to take advantage of the next big opportunity, BlockDAG is the top-trending crypto to watch, offering both short-term and long-term upside potential. Now is the time to position yourself for success.

On-Chain Analysis Places Short-Term Target At $4,800",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-price-eyeing-a-breakout-target-at-4800/,"The Ethereum price has roared on with a strong performance over this weekend, reclaiming the $4,200 level for the first time since 2021. According to data from CoinGecko, the “king of altcoins” has now increased in value by more than 25% on the weekly timeframe. Considering its strong momentum, the general expectation is that the Ethereum price will continue to climb over the next few days. However, the latest price analysis shows that the altcoin might currently be trapped within a resistance range. Why ETH Price Could Be Heading Next For $4,800 In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, CryptoOnchain revealed that the Ethereum price might be eyeing a breakout above a key psychological and technical resistance. According to the pundit’s technical analyst, the altcoin would need a sustained breach above this region if it is to retest its all-time-high price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Season Or Altcoin Season? Shiba Inu Exec Outlines What’s Happening Expanding on this technical hypothesis, CryptoOnchain shared that the Ethereum price is within the green zone between $4,000 and $4,400 (from the chart above), which represents a multi-year resistance range with significant historical selling pressure. Nevertheless, the analyst noted that the Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) indicator has flipped positive, signaling the continuation of bullish momentum. From an on-chain perspective, CryptoOnchain highlighted that the Ethereum price could be at risk of selling pressure, as the MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) indicator is nearing its upper historical ranges. The other on-chain metrics, however, suggest the investors are not in profit-taking or euphoria mode—despite the widespread profitability in the market. Notably, the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) metric—which tracks the overall profit and loss status of crypto investors—is in a high, positive region. While the metric signals that the ETH investors are broadly in profit, it also clarifies that the Ethereum price is not yet overheated. CryptoOnchain concluded that a strong break above the $4,400 level could open the door for a run to $4,800 for the Ethereum price in the short term. The on-chain analyst added that the Ethereum market has yet to reach an overheated state, which suggests room for further upside movements in the medium term. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $4,270, reflecting an almost 6% increase in the past 24 hours.

However, amidst the hype surrounding DOGE, a cheaper meme coin priced below $0.004 is quietly gaining traction, with the potential to deliver massive returns, outshine DOGE, and offer investors a rare opportunity to achieve millionaire status. Dogecoin (DOGE) Bulls Eye the $2 Mark Dogecoin has reentered the spotlight. Technical analysis is flashing bullish signals, especially following a double bottom formation and a confirmed breakout above the $0.25 resistance. Whales are quietly accumulating again, with over 200 million DOGE tokens swapped in recent days, implying the biggest wallets are lining up for a serious breakout. With the mood swinging positive, analysts are eyeing a potential climb to $2 by the end of 2025. The optimism is high, but those looking for higher upside potential may want to turn their attention to a rising competitor priced below half a cent. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Meme Coin Under $0.004 with Millionaire Potential Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is making serious waves in the meme coin space. Built as a Layer 2 blockchain focused on speed, affordability, and meme culture, it’s quickly separating itself from the sea of low-effort meme tokens. With a name that draws from crypto's rich meme heritage and a Layer 2 infrastructure that combines fun with functionality, LILPEPE is more than just another joke coin. It’s gaining traction where it counts: community growth, presale success, and early market exposure. Presale Momentum Signals Explosive Potential LILPEPE’s presale has been nothing short of impressive. Stage 8 sold out faster than anticipated, raising $13.775 million. Now in Stage 9 at $0.0018, the token has seen an 80% increase since its presale began, already rewarding early participants. More than 10.72 billion tokens have been sold, and listings are starting to appear, including on CoinMarketCap, giving the project early credibility in the broader crypto space. Community has always been at the heart of meme coins, and LILPEPE is no exception. To celebrate the presale’s success, the team has launched a $777,000 giveaway. Over 181,500 entries have been recorded so far, with 10 lucky winners set to receive $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens each. The Token to Make You a Millionaire The low entry price, well under $0.004, positions LILPEPE as a standout opportunity. Analysts project gains of up to 2,500x, which would turn a $1,000 investment into a massive $2.5 million. Such predictions, while bold, are fueling even more interest from investors hunting for the next big winner. What sets LILPEPE apart is the team and advisory group quietly behind it. While most names remain anonymous, many have proven track records of success with some of the top meme tokens in the market. This level of behind-the-scenes experience gives LILPEPE a major edge. Meme coins may be fun, but serious market players know success requires strategy and execution. With the right people involved, LILPEPE looks primed for a major breakout. Looking Ahead: A Roadmap Built for Momentum Little Pepe isn’t standing still. With each step forward, the coin continues to gain attention from both casual investors and more seasoned crypto holders. While DOGE may be eyeing a solid 8x return if it hits $2, LILPEPE presents a different kind of opportunity: exponential gains from a fraction-of-a-cent entry point. That kind of upside is what turns small investments into massive wins. Final Thoughts Dogecoin’s rally toward $2 is exciting, no doubt. But the spotlight is starting to shift toward fresh contenders that combine viral potential with early-stage access. Little Pepe (LILPEPE), priced under $0.004, is catching fire with a unique mix of meme appeal, blockchain capability, and strong community backing. With over $13.7 million already raised, a growing user base, and industry veterans backing the project, LILPEPE is more than just hype; it’s a serious contender in the next meme coin wave. The current price window might not last long. For those searching for the meme coin with millionaire-making potential, Little Pepe could be the one.

This development marks XRP’s entry into the regulated U.S. derivatives market, opening the door to institutional participation, greater price transparency, and deeper liquidity, effectively moving the asset into Wall Street territory. Regulatory Recognition and Institutional Access Coinbase’s official submission to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) ensures that XRP futures trade within a compliant and transparent regulatory framework. Clearing through Nodal Clear, a registered derivatives clearing organization, further safeguards participants by reducing counterparty risk through margining and novation. Coinbase $XRP Futures = Game Changer CFTC-approved. Institutional-ready. Manipulation-proof pricing This isn’t just trading XRP, this is XRP stepping into regulated Wall Street territory Liquidity? Boosted Trust? Locked in Institutional FOMO? Loading… LETS GO $XRP ! pic.twitter.com/6uNWX4wFEk — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) August 10, 2025 This regulatory structure is a key factor in making XRP accessible to hedge funds, asset managers, and other institutional investors who require high compliance standards. Price Transparency and Manipulation Resistance One of the most notable features of the new contract is its settlement mechanism. The XRP futures settle to the MarketVector Coinbase XRP Benchmark Rate, a rules-based index that calculates an average price using multiple trusted exchanges over a one-hour window, broken into twenty-three-minute volume-weighted intervals. This multi-source pricing method, audited under IOSCO Principles, significantly reduces the risk of manipulation and ensures more reliable valuations for market participants. Liquidity Boost and Market Depth Each contract represents 10,000 XRP and is cash-settled in USD, with aggregate position limits set at 4,000 contracts (equivalent to 40 million XRP). These specifications strike a balance between facilitating high-volume institutional trading and preventing market domination by a few large players. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 By providing a standardized, regulated futures product, Coinbase creates new opportunities for hedging, arbitrage, and portfolio diversification, all of which can deepen market liquidity. Strong Market Protections Coinbase’s rulebook for the XRP futures market explicitly bans fraud, price manipulation, and abusive trading practices. A dedicated surveillance team monitors both the spot and futures markets for suspicious activity. Additional safeguards, including a 10% hourly price fluctuation limit and automatic trading halts, help maintain orderly markets, especially during periods of high volatility. Why This Matters As X Finance Bull noted, this is more than just another trading product; it’s a structural leap for XRP. By introducing CFTC-regulated futures , Coinbase has given XRP a legitimate foothold in large-scale, compliant financial markets. The combination of institutional-grade oversight, transparent pricing, and robust market safeguards not only boosts investor trust but also reinforces XRP’s standing as a serious contender in the global digital asset space. In summary, the launch of Coinbase XRP futures is a game-changer. It strengthens market integrity, enhances liquidity, and invites a new wave of institutional participation — all of which could play a pivotal role in shaping XRP’s long-term position in the evolving crypto-financial landscape.

Once hailed as a top-five titan, ADA faces increasing pressure amid fading momentum, declining dApp traction, and intensified competition from faster, more dynamic blockchains. Investors increasingly turn to new narratives—especially ones combining strong tech with viral appeal. Among them, one standout is Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , a meme-fueled Layer-2 solution currently making waves during its presale phase. Below, we explore three tokens poised to benefit from ADA’s potential fall in ranking. Little Pepe (LILPEPE)—Presale Hype Meets Layer-2 Innovation As of writing, Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is in Stage 9 of its presale, priced at $0.0018, with over $15 million already raised out of a targeted $16.475 million. This Ethereum-based meme coin is more than just a viral joke—it introduces a Layer-2 blockchain powered by its native token, aiming to merge meme culture with real utility: ultra-low fees, blazing-fast speeds, and a developer-friendly EVM environment. LILPEPE’s total supply is 100 billion tokens, and the listing price is $0.003. What sets Little Pepe apart is its deeply strategic rollout and transparency. The project has undergone a smart contract audit , established a detailed vesting schedule to prevent early dumps, and currently boasts a $777,000 giveaway where ten lucky winners receive $77,000 each in tokens. Over 175,000 entries have been recorded, signaling immense community interest. Importantly, LILPEPE is now listed on CoinMarketCap, adding credibility and visibility during its final presale stages. Token distribution is designed for long-term sustainability, with 0% TGE, a 3-month cliff, and 5% unlocked monthly post-cliff for presale participants. These anti-dumping measures indicate a strong commitment to market stability post-launch. For those seeking meme coin exposure with an infrastructure backbone, Little Pepe offers the type of asymmetric upside last seen with early SHIB or DOGE—except this time, it’s backed by functional Layer-2 utility. SUI (SUI)—High-Speed Layer-1 with Strong Developer Traction As of writing, SUI trades at approximately $3.38 and ranks #12 by market cap on CoinMarketCap. Built as a scalable Layer-1 blockchain, SUI has gained traction thanks to its user-centric design, modular architecture, and developer-friendly tools. Recent rumors of a spot-SUI ETF application have only fueled the fire, prompting a 53% rally in recent weeks. SUI’s ecosystem is rapidly evolving, with new DeFi projects, NFT integrations, and staking opportunities drawing retail and institutional interest. As Ethereum congestion and Cardano’s slow rollout of features frustrate developers, SUI is positioning itself as the high-speed, high-potential alternative. Unlike Cardano, which has long been criticized for slow development cycles and a rigid upgrade schedule, SUI’s agile model and growing community increasingly draw comparisons to Solana during its 2021 rise. If ADA falls below the top 15, SUI’s narrative and adoption trajectory could carry it higher in the rankings. Chainlink (LINK)—The Oracle Powering DeFi’s Backbone Priced at around $15.89 as of writing and hovering around #14 by market cap, Chainlink (LINK) is one of the most dependable crypto projects regarding real-world utility. LINK is the go-to solution for decentralized oracles, providing off-chain data to smart contracts across dozens of blockchains. Its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol has already amassed over $24 billion in Total Value Locked, demonstrating the depth of its integration into the DeFi space. As speculative coins come and go, Chainlink continues to anchor vital infrastructure such as lending platforms, derivatives markets, and insurance protocols. If Cardano’s slide continues and investors rotate into assets with fundamental long-term use cases, LINK is a safe harbor—especially for those skeptical of high-risk meme projects. Its sticky utility and consistent development make it a likely contender to maintain or even improve its ranking as ADA falters. What ADA’s Decline Means for the Market Cardano trades at $0.704, clinging to a top‑10 position but increasingly vulnerable. ADA’s struggles stem from delayed technical rollouts (like Hydra), fading dApp volume, and diminishing staking rewards. The broader crypto market is impatient—capital flows with the strongest momentum and returns. As ADA shows signs of fatigue, it could soon be overtaken by projects offering either strong narratives (LILPEPE), technical speed and scalability (SUI), or vital infrastructure (LINK). This potential reshuffling in the top-15 rankings highlights the shifting dynamics of crypto investing. Meme coins with real tech like LILPEPE are getting institutional attention. High-performing Layer-1s like SUI are absorbing developers. And essential DeFi tools like Chainlink are defending their positions. Final Thoughts If Cardano continues to lose steam, these three tokens are poised to benefit from the rotation of capital and attention. Little Pepe is rapidly approaching its final presale stage with overwhelming momentum, a strategic vesting structure, and a full CoinMarketCap listing already in place. SUI offers Layer-1 scalability with growing institutional traction, while Chainlink remains indispensable to the broader DeFi ecosystem. Now is the time to research these rising contenders for investors seeking the next big opportunity—or a hedge against ADA’s continued decline. Whether you lean into meme power with Little Pepe or seek out fundamental infrastructure plays, the window to position early is closing fast.

However, in a follow-up to the recent Ethereum price breakout above $4,000, analysts say the price could hit $7,500 in the next 60 days. Whereas, eyes are now turning to an emerging PayFi at $0.09 that experts also say could deliver over 3,000% in the same time as the Ethereum surge. The crypto market has been moving very fast in the last few days, and the new jump of the Ethereum price could be signaling the start of a bull run. However, here are some factors analysts are discussing for higher profits in the next 2 months. Market Position That Shows Ethereum Price Could Be Ready For A Major Surge in 60 Days Three main catalysts have continued to align in Ethereum’s price favor over the last few weeks, and experts say it could reach 7,500 by the end of September. These catalysts include: ETF sentiment fueling major inflow Rise in Ethereum staking And a recent network upgrade The combination of these factors is realigning the Ethereum price on a bullish track that has seen it hit above $4,000 this week. Institutional demand has taken a new turn lately, with millions recorded in weekly inflow. The ETH ETF inflow even surpassed Bitcoin’s weekly inflow in July after a rise in brands investing in Ethereum for strategic reserve. Rise in staked ETH has also hit a new milestone with a record showing more than 30% now locked in staking. However, a significant factor that has continued to fuel this growing demand and inflow is the pectra upgrade that happened in May. The upgrade is fueling a rise in Ethereum adoption, leading to a recent breakout above $4,000. Why Ethereum Price Could Hit $7,500 by September The recent technical breakout shows the Ethereum price cleared the $4,200 resistance on massive volume inflow. This return to the December 2024 high signals a move fueled by heightened demand amidst dropping selling pressure. As a result, experts say the breakout could see the Ethereum price break the previous ATH by August, and up to $7,500 by the end of September. Price setup now shows the Ethereum price correcting from the high but maintaining a position above $4,000. However, with the price now clearing above the previous supports, we could see a new ATH by next week.

As the 2025 crypto bull run gains momentum, market analysts are watching how this DeFi-powered token could carve out its own historic moment. The project is now priced at $0.035 in phase 6 of presale. Phase 7 will appreciate 14.29% to $0.04. Existing investors are eyeing a 500% profit when MUTM hits the market. Mutuum Finance has already garnered over $14.25 million in funding and has been backed by over 15,000 investors. While SHIB’s 2021 breakout remains a landmark in the market, the next chapter may be written by a project blending meme culture with real-world utility, blockchain-native lending mechanisms, and a rapidly growing community. Investors Eye Huge ROI in Mutuum Finance Phase 6 Presale Mutuum Finance is priced at $0.035 in presale stage 6 after a presale stage 5 sell-out. More than $14.25 million has been raised and over 15000 early investors are in the presale. Token price in Presale Stage 7 will be $0.04, a 14.23% hike from Stage 6. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched an Official Bug Bounty Program with CertiK, its security and transparency partner. Users will be rewarded with 50,000 USDT in value for reporting possible bugs on the project. The purpose of the bounty program is to provide equal protection for all classes of vulnerabilities. It has been divided into four classes of severity; i.e., major, minor, low, and critical.

Mutuum Finance: Decentralized Lending Revolution Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a DeFi decentralized lending protocol that offers the greatest extent of control over assets to users. It is an open double-lending platform built by merging Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C lending pool is accessed through smart contracts. The platform responds based on the market sentiment of the time, minimizing lenders’ revenue volatility and economic lending risk. Middlemen are cut out in the P2P model, paving the way for direct lending, which is ideal for volatile assets like meme coins. Mutuum Finance has already secured over $14.25 million in funding and attracted more than 15,000 investors, signaling strong momentum ahead of launch. Priced at $0.035 in Phase 6, the token will rise 14.29% to $0.04 in Phase 7. Mutuum Finance’s earliest investors are projected to see huge returns as soon as the token launches.

49869699,https://thecoinrise.com/xrp-escrow-release-ripple-cto-clarifies-speculations/,1754847001,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/49869699.jpeg,XRP Escrow Release: Ripple CTO Clarifies Speculations,https://thecoinrise.com/xrp-escrow-release-ripple-cto-clarifies-speculations/,"David Schwartz , Ripple CTO, has responded to lingering questions from users on the release of XRP in escrow. In a post on social media platform X, Schwartz put to rest the constant speculations surrounding escrow release. XRP Escrow Releases Happen First of Every Month Notably, a user Lorrentz had asked the reason for the random XRP escrow releases, which normally happen on the first day of every month. According to Lorrentz, public trackers like XRPScan have been displaying random dates, with the latest being set to August 9. The user, likely a community member, wondered if it was normal for Ripple to change the escrow schedule at will without following the set pattern. “So in theory they could release the whole 36B XRP in the next 5 minutes? “He inquired. Schwartz maintained that escrow contracts always release on the first of every month, as that is how it was programmed. He, however, clarified that once the escrow release occurs, the transaction might not immediately show up on the ledger. He explained that the ledger is not automated to update. Rather, it waits for someone to submit a transaction, which then acts as a trigger to notify of funds movement out of escrow. Ripple cannot Randomly Change the Escrow Schedule This suggests that Ripple cannot randomly move the escrow date or release all XRP from escrow. However, Ripple determines when they use the XRP after it has been released. As such, the “random dates” noticed by users in the space represent the dates that Ripple decided to act on the unlocked XRP. So, if that transaction happens several days after the first of the month, it appears the release was on a random date. However, in reality, the funds have been available since the first as programmed, but just that they were not moved on the same day. Institutional Interest in XRP Surges Post-SEC Case Meanwhile, in the broader ecosystem, institutional interest in XRP has spiked following the end to the Ripple vs. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit. SEC filings show that several firms are adding XRP to their balance sheets. For instance, Digital Wealth Partners Management (DWP Management) says it has been able to secure $200 million in capital that came in the form of XRP. This suggests that the coin might see an uptick in price with the growing interest. As of this writing, XRP has dipped by 2.78% and is trading at $3.19 in the last 24 hours. Trading volume has also declined by 12.07% to $6.1 billion.

Unicoin CEO Alex Konanykhin that several US banks, including Citibank, Chase, Wells Fargo, City National Bank of Florida and TD Bank, have closed accounts for Unicoin and its subsidiaries without explanation. He claims four banks cut ties with the company in 2025 alone, calling it evidence of a “large-scale nationwide operation” against crypto firms. Industry leaders raise alarm over ‘Operation Chokepoint 3.0’ Andreessen Horowitz partner Alex Rampell recently warned that major banks are making it harder for fintech and crypto apps to operate, labeling the practice “Operation Chokepoint 3.0.” This includes higher fees for account data access and fund transfers to platforms like Coinbase and Robinhood. Konanykhin said the campaign is “highly disruptive and damaging” to the American crypto sector, cutting off basic financial services and undermining the country’s position in the global digital asset market. Trump plans executive order to stop debanking Bloomberg reports that Trump will soon sign an executive order instructing federal regulators to identify and penalize banks engaged in debanking. The order is expected to require reviews of complaint data and mandate that SBA-regulated banks reinstate unlawfully denied clients. Konanykhin believes the move could mark a turning point. “Ending the War on Crypto will boost the American crypto industry,” he said, comparing its potential global influence to Hollywood and Silicon Valley. Legal experts caution change may be slow Elizabeth Blickley, a partner at Fox Rothschild, noted that while Trump has called for integrating crypto into mainstream finance, real progress depends on the final wording of upcoming regulations. She cited the newly signed Genius Act, which gives the Federal Reserve’s Stablecoin Certification Review Committee 180 days to propose a framework. Blickley warned that most congressional bills fail to advance and that new laws may still face legal challenges. Until regulatory clarity emerges, she expects banks to remain risk-averse toward crypto. “It’s all about making risk-averse entities and people feel like crypto is less of a risk,” she said.",Blockchain|Sticky|Regulation,EN,0,0,REGULATION|FIAT|MACROECONOMICS|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-08-10 17:41:45

In 2031, the target price for XRP is between $22.83 and $24.74, with an average price of $23.79. XRP has a strong community of supporters and developers and continues to see tremendous potential in Ripple’s technology and products. Despite short-term price fluctuations and a bear market, many analysts believe XRP has a bright future.

Ripple price analysis gives a highly bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. The coin’s value has decreased to a low of $3.17 over the last 24 hours. The coin has lost up to 3.24 percent of its value. Technical indicators give bullish signals, but the price charts continue to project a bearish market scenario for the day, as XRP corrects in its upper price range. Is XRP a good investment? XRP, a cryptocurrency specifically designed for quick and cost-effective cross-border transactions, holds promise in global finance. The easing of regulatory hurdles for Ripple, along with the rising adoption, might boost the XRP price. Additionally, several recent acquisitions and CBDC developments make XRP a good long-term investment option. As with any investment, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious approach and thorough due diligence. It is advised to proceed with caution Why is XRP down? The XRP/USD crypto pair price has decreased as selling momentum took hold, bringing the price down to $3.17 during the day. The RSI decreased to 55.56 at the same time and is in neutral territory. How much will XRP cost in 2025? XRP is expected to trade at an average price of $4.76 by the end of 2025. Will XRP reach $5? For XRP to reach $5, its value would need to increase significantly. Considering the current bullish trend and XRP’s price action, a surge to $5 by the end of this year is not entirely out of the question, particularly if demand for XRP tokens continues to rise and its growth trajectory remains consistent. However, it’s crucial to remember that XRP’s all-time high stands at $3.65, achieved on July 18, 2025. Can XRP reach $20? According to Ripple’s price prediction, XRP has a chance of reaching $20 by 2030. However, it is expected to reach this level if the XRP ecosystem adoption by major financial institutions continues, making it a good option to buy XRP. Will XRP reach $100 dollars? Though there are rumors of XRP reaching $100 in the market, and some pro-XRP analysts are also promoting it, many are raising questions about this possibility. XRP may not reach $100 in the near future, at least. Will XRP reach $1000? If one XRP coin is worth $1000, its market cap must be more than $100 trillion. Comparatively, the total global stock market cap is about $110 trillion. Therefore, it is unlikely that XRP will reach $1000, based on current market dynamics. Does XRP have a good long-term future? XRP is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years, giving good yields to XRP holders and institutional investors. The coin is trading at five times its value from last year, and it is expected to reach the highest price of $24.74 by 2031. This makes it a valuable asset for multiple gains after significant market capitalization with continuous efforts by Ripple Labs. However, regulatory uncertainties still linger with the Ripple lawsuit. Considering these factors, investors must carry out their own research. Recent news/opinions on the Ripple Network Teucrium’s XXRP, the leveraged XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) launched in April, has reached $300 million in net flow. With the ETF reaching $323.6 million in inflows, it becomes the first XRP ETF in the US to reach the milestone. The Teucrium Trading CEO says the leveraged ETF product is its most successful ETF ever. Read more about it here .

XRP historic price sentiment XRP price history: Coinmarketcap Before 2017, the asset’s value hovered around $0.01; in April 2017, it rose to $0.05; the gradual climb soon continued as it reached $0.25 in May, showing a positive price action as Ripple continued to excel. Towards the end of 2019, XRP price stabilized at around $0.30 and did not cross the $0.5 mark throughout the year. However, the bullish run of 2020 pushed the coin’s value to a peak price of $0.8, gaining investor interest before finishing the year at $0.66. Early 2021 was supposed to be bullish for XRP, but the SEC announced a lawsuit that derailed investors. Nonetheless, XRP beat the odds and surged above $1.5 during the year, but by 2022, it plummeted significantly to as low as $0.31. XRP started 2023 at $0.335, and on July 13, it almost doubled its value in a steep spike. It shot from $0.470 to $0.814 while swinging towards $0.9 for a few hours. A partial victory against the SEC triggered the price jump, surging the trading volume. XRP closed 2023 at about $0.62. In 2024, XRP has so far ridden the market wave. The bears earlier on and then a bullish price movement by mid-March resulted in a market price of $0.72, according to data from the cryptocurrency market. In July, XRP traded between $0.418 and $0.658, showing a good recovery. However, the coin went under bearish pressure at the start of August, falling back down to the $0.550 range as per crypto market records showing high volatility. In September 2024, XRP recovered up to the $0.642 level, but the price went down to the $0.500 range in October. A tremendous bullish impulse was observed in November when XRP touched the $1.96 mark, and it reached $2.72 on December 2, 2024.

Whether it’s the thrill of high-stakes blackjack, spinning slots, or placing bets on sports, there’s something for everyone. However, not all online casinos are equal. Some are slow to pay out, offer limited games, or lack modern tech. That’s why we’ve handpicked the top platforms worth your attention. From crypto-friendly betting sites to licensed sportsbooks with massive promotions, these are the leaders right now. We’ll take an in-depth look at Spartans, DraftKings, Fanatics, and BetRivers, four top betting platforms that truly stand out. Let’s break down their features so you know where to play next. 1. Spartans: The Crypto-Friendly Casino Offering Instant Payouts And Diverse Games Spartans.com has quickly established itself as one of the best online casinos, particularly for players who seek fast payouts, full control over their gameplay, and an extensive selection of games. With over 5,963 titles from 43 top-tier providers, the platform offers a broad range of options, from classic slots, blackjack, and roulette, to exciting crash games, live casino experiences, and real-time sports betting. What makes Spartans stand out even more is its commitment to cryptocurrency. The platform supports popular coins such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT, USDC, AVAX, and others, allowing users to enjoy faster deposits and instant payouts. No traditional banking methods are needed, ensuring quicker transactions and a more seamless experience. What truly makes Spartans exceptional is its all-in-one platform, which eliminates the need for separate accounts for the casino and sportsbook. Everything is neatly integrated, providing a unified experience for players. The platform offers a generous 300% welcome bonus, 25% daily deposit bonuses, and even a Lamborghini giveaway, making it more thrilling for high-stakes players. Spartans is also mobile-optimized, meaning players can access it easily through a browser, without the need to download any apps. Additionally, it features an affiliate program with competitive payouts, making it a popular choice for influencers and streamers. For anyone seeking a crypto-based, fast, and feature-packed casino, Spartans stands out as one of the top betting platforms in 2025. 2. Draftkings: Designed For Bettors Who Want More Than The Average Casino DraftKings is no longer just about sports betting, it has evolved into one of the best online casinos in the U.S. The platform has invested heavily in its own gaming content, with over 110 in-house games now available. These exclusive titles make up nearly half of the total casino activity on the platform. DraftKings is known for its personalized game lobbies, Netflix-style layouts, and immersive player experience. DraftKings offers not only live dealer games but also a wide selection of blackjack, roulette, and themed slots, alongside a full sportsbook integrated into the same account. Payouts are fast, promotions are frequent, and their responsible gaming tools are highly advanced. The company is also exploring innovative features, such as prediction markets, to expand in states where access is limited. If you’re after a clean, user-friendly platform with a growing library of exclusive games, DraftKings is one of the top betting platforms you should consider this year. 3. Fanatics: Where Collectibles, And Casino Gaming Come Together Fanatics has made impressive strides in 2025 by expanding its casino and sportsbook offerings. Known for its sports memorabilia, the brand has now fully embraced the world of betting with WWE-themed casino games, a robust sportsbook app, and record-breaking promotions. As of late July 2025, Fanatics is offering a $1,000 “no-sweat bet” promotion for new users on both college football and ATP events. On the collectibles side, they recently auctioned Caitlin Clark’s rookie card for $660,000, proving their commitment to blending real-world athletes with gaming. Fanatics has set an ambitious goal of reaching $11 billion in revenue by 2026 and is expanding its reach through new licensing deals, exclusive card sets, and live events like Fanatics Fest. Their app integrates casino gaming, sports betting, and shopping into one seamless account, making it possible to play live blackjack and buy a signed jersey in the same session. With continued product rollouts and a solid credit rating from Fitch, Fanatics has positioned itself as one of the best online casinos, offering something unique: a direct link between gaming and the wider sports world. 4. Betrivers: The Hidden Gem With Exceptional Value BetRivers may not always grab the headlines, but it is quietly becoming one of the best online casinos, especially for poker and prop-style games. In July 2025, BetRivers launched PropPacks for MLB, a unique trading card-style betting system aimed at baseball fans. They also expanded poker access in Delaware, Michigan, and West Virginia, creating a four-state shared liquidity network that has increased tournament traffic and prize pools. Special promotions, like “Knock Out a Pro,” add excitement to the mix. BetRivers is live in 15 states and offers a $500 second-chance bet for new players in most regions. Features like in-hand summaries, larger bet sliders, and custom player polls show their focus on user feedback. While it doesn’t support crypto like Spartans, BetRivers is still an excellent choice for players seeking fast payouts, solid odds, and responsive customer support. If poker is your game, or if you want to try something new like PropPacks, BetRivers is one of the top betting platforms to start with right now. Final Thoughts Not all online casinos are created equal, but when it comes to actual features, user experience, payment speed, and bonus value, these four platforms stand out. Spartans shine for crypto users with instant withdrawals, thousands of games, and integrated sports betting, all in one place. DraftKings continues to innovate with original games and impressive earnings in 2025. Fanatics connects the worlds of collectibles and gaming in a unique way, while BetRivers is offering poker enthusiasts fresh experiences and VIP perks. These platforms are more than just websites, they’re full ecosystems offering real value. Whether you’re new to betting or a seasoned player, these are the best online casinos to explore right now. Fast payouts, engaging features, and solid promotions make these platforms worth checking out. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

49870715,https://timestabloid.com/?p=77791,1754848830,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Cold Wallet’s 37x Price Edge Beats Token 6900 Buzz and Bitcoin Hyper Hype: Is It the Best Crypto Presale 2025?,https://timestabloid.com/cold-wallets-37x-price-edge-beats-token-6900-buzz-and-bitcoin/,"Buying early is not just about paying less, it is also about being in the right place first. While Token 6900 gains attention for its presale momentum and Bitcoin Hyper builds interest around possible scalability gains, both depend on what unfolds after launch. Cold Wallet, however, already provides clear value before the token even lists on exchanges. Early buyers are entering at a CWT price of $0.00998, well below the $0.3517 launch level, while also receiving cashback on gas, swaps, and ramps. This combination of utility and steep early pricing puts Cold Wallet firmly in the best crypto presale conversation for those planning with a forward view. Early Cold Wallet Buyers Secure an Edge Before Public Trading Cold Wallet’s presale participants are already benefiting from a pricing advantage that many projects take months to deliver. With the presale now in stage 17 and CWT priced at $0.00998, buyers are stepping into one of the year’s best crypto presale chances at a significant discount. The project has raised $5.8 million so far, showing clear momentum ahead of exchange listings. The setup is deliberate. With a confirmed launch price of $0.3517, today’s entry point locks in tokens at over 37 times lower than the expected listing value. This built-in gap provides a cushion for early participants, helping them hold position even before market exposure grows after trading opens. It can also help limit the immediate impact of price swings that often follow a token’s first trading sessions. Unlike projects that hold off on delivering value, Cold Wallet already gives users cashback benefits on gas, swaps, and on/off ramps through the CWT token. This real utility supports stronger holding potential over time, while early adopters gain from both usage and price growth. As the presale advances, each stage increases CWT’s cost, and missing early entries reduces possible ROI. Entering now means being ahead of market listing sentiment and ahead of the token economy’s full development. In the end, Cold Wallet’s model turns early timing into a real advantage, making it one of the best crypto presale opportunities to watch this year. Rising Demand Drives Token 6900’s Early Stage Advantage Token 6900 has gained attention with a strong price rise in its presale, raising $1.6 million from early supporters (coinmarketcap.com). This momentum shows growing confidence as demand moves ahead of supply, suggesting a chance for steady growth. What sets Token 6900 apart is not only the funds raised but also its position before public trading. Those who joined early enjoy a price edge that could work in their favor if trading activity increases. As more people take interest, participation may grow, and with it, both liquidity and price strength, creating a clear advantage for those already involved. From a wider view, the Token 6900 price growth could set the stage for more institutional or retail attention once public awareness increases. With funding in place and early valuations set, the outlook seems built to reward those who acted early. Development Push Strengthens Bitcoin Hyper’s Growth Path The latest Bitcoin hyper HYPER update shows progress in Bitcoin’s plan for Layer-2 scaling. Development is moving forward on Bitcoin Hyper, with its presale raising over $7 million so far. This signals confidence in its ability to improve scalability in the future. Looking forward, this update offers long-term positioning benefits. With launch expected between Q3 and Q4 2025, early participants are securing their place ahead of exchange listings and wider market interest. This timing could bring gains beyond the usual early-stage advantages. Progress continues, funding stays strong, and development is active. The Bitcoin hyper HYPER update marks a move toward real transaction capacity improvements, aiming for faster, cheaper transfers. This positions current supporters to benefit if adoption increases, even before outside sentiment catches up. Final Say While hype can draw attention, practical value keeps it. Token 6900 and Bitcoin Hyper have both built early momentum, but each still depends on what happens after listings or upgrades. Cold Wallet offers something from the start: cashback rewards, full self-custody, and a presale price well under its launch value. This combination of direct benefits and price advantage gives early buyers more than expectations, it gives them a working reason to join now. For those looking at the best crypto presale options, Cold Wallet stands apart because it already delivers on the key elements that matter to participants who think ahead.

Analysts have started tracking altcoins showing strong growth patterns, new innovations, and rising investor interest. With Q4 2025 fast approaching, three altcoins stand out as top picks: Ethereum (ETH), Chainlink (LINK), and MAGACOIN FINANCE. While Ethereum and Chainlink remain favorites for institutional and retail investors, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining momentum in presale rankings. Ethereum Tests Major Resistance Again Ethereum has risen 5.74% in the last 24 hours and is now trading at $3,917. The weekly gain stands at 7.92%, while the monthly chart shows a solid 49.15% increase. Ethereum’s market cap has reached $472.89 billion, with trading volume up 64.82% to $43.12 billion. What matters now is the price level near $4,000. Ethereum has tested this zone six times in the past 4.5 years. Each time, failure to break through led to a sharp drop between 30% and 75%. The only time ETH moved above this level, it surged to its all-time high near $4,800. A confirmed breakout could attract a wave of new buyers. However, if it fails again, the market could correct. Either way, Ethereum remains a top altcoin with strong fundamentals and long-term potential. Chainlink Ecosystem Upgrade Sparks Rally Chainlink (LINK) is trading at $19.40 after a 15.08% gain in the last 24 hours. The trading volume surged by 295.9% to $1.47 billion. Its market cap has reached $13.15 billion. The recent price spike follows several ecosystem upgrades. Chainlink has introduced a new LINK Reserve, funded by on-chain and institutional revenue. This development aims to stabilize the ecosystem while increasing long-term value. The reserve will support LINK buybacks using stablecoins and gas tokens via Uniswap V3. In addition, the Payment Abstraction system has expanded. It now supports more payment types for enterprise and protocol clients. These changes could lead to higher demand and more utility for LINK holders. Chainlink’s roadmap is aligning closely with real-world adoption, making it a strong asset heading into the next market cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Ground as a Must-Buy Presale MAGACOIN FINANCE has become the breakout star of the year. Industry specialists have ranked MAGACOIN FINANCE among the best 5 altcoins to buy before Q4 2025. The token merges meme coin excitement with real-world relevance. Its growing community, viral appeal, and politically charged identity have built strong momentum. The buzz around MAGACOIN is not just hype. The coin is backed by investor enthusiasm and early-stage traction. Unlike many meme coins, MAGACOIN offers lasting engagement through its narrative and cultural position. As crypto markets head into Q4, many investors see MAGACOIN as a rare opportunity for exponential gains and long-term growth. Conclusion Ethereum and Chainlink are established giants and are showing renewed strength through technical levels and ecosystem innovation. MAGACOIN FINANCE, on the other hand, gives early adopters a chance to buy into a fresh presale with serious upside. These three altcoins could be key additions to any breakout-ready crypto portfolio as Q4 2025 approaches.

Strong Technical Setup and Breakout Formation According to Patrick’s chart, XRP has broken out from a consolidation phase, forming what is commonly referred to as a “breakout pole” pattern — a classic bullish continuation signal pointing towards $27 mark, representing a significant upside potential of over 700% from the current price. This projection is supported by historical performance patterns where XRP has experienced explosive rallies following similar chart formations. The steep upward slope of the breakout pole suggests strong buying momentum, while volume analysis indicates increased accumulation from both retail traders and possibly institutional players. If you claim to be ""in crypto"" but aren't bullish on $XRP , you're not a serious person. pic.twitter.com/qJMH0vvGhk — Patrick L Riley (@Acquired_Savant) August 9, 2025 Market Sentiment Tilting Bullish Sentiment around XRP has been steadily improving, partly fueled by increased adoption of the XRP Ledger in various sectors, including payments, tokenization, and remittances. The recent legal clarity following Ripple’s settlement-related developments with the U.S. SEC has also bolstered confidence, reducing the regulatory overhang that has weighed on XRP for years. Community members point out that the current consolidation before the expected breakout is a healthy sign, allowing the market to absorb gains before the next upward leg. This measured growth, combined with strong fundamentals, could position XRP for sustained bullish momentum beyond the $27 mark if market conditions align. Institutional and Strategic Interest Beyond retail enthusiasm, the XRP ecosystem continues to attract attention from high-profile partners and developers building real-world solutions on the XRPL. This includes cross-border payment networks, stablecoin initiatives, and decentralized finance (DeFi) integrations. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Some analysts argue that with global liquidity needs rising, XRP’s fast settlement speed and low transaction costs give it a competitive edge against other cryptocurrencies in scaling international financial infrastructure. This institutional interest could amplify buying pressure o nce XRP breaches key resistance levels . Challenge to Skeptics The “not a serious person” remark is more than just hyperbole. It reflects a growing conviction within the XRP community that the digital asset is on the verge of a pivotal breakout. The analyst emphasizes that ignoring the current bullish setup is akin to overlooking one of the most asymmetric opportunities in the crypto market today. With the price holding firmly above major support zones, market structure favoring bulls, and a clear technical target of $27 on the horizon, the sentiment is simple: XRP is in a prime position for a major rally, and those on the sidelines risk missing a potentially historic move.

Currently in its 4th presale level at simply $0.005 per token, Ozak AI combines effective AI-pushed market insights with blockchain technology, attracting sizable attention and raising over $1.6 million at the same time as promoting more than 90 million tokens. Strong tokenomics, rigorous security audits, and strategic partnerships with innovators like Weblume and SINT have boosted investor confidence, making this presale one of the most promising possibilities for outsized returns because the mission moves towards release. What Sets Ozak AI Apart? Ozak AI distinguishes itself from many crypto projects by using that which specializes in actionable AI-driven trading insights. The platform’s superior AI models examine market facts across cryptocurrencies, equities, and foreign exchange to offer real-time, predictive alerts. This stage of sophistication became historically handiest available to hedge finances and institutional investors; however, Ozak AI aims to democratize this intelligence, empowering retail investors with modern equipment. The $OZ token is at the middle of this space, granting customers the right of entry to premium statistics feeds, permitting participation within the platform, and facilitating transactions. This multi-software aspect strengthens token demand past mere hypotheses, making it a vital element of the platform’s long-term sustainability. Explosive Presale Growth and Investor Confidence Since its inception, the Ozak AI presale has gained remarkable traction. Selling over 90 million tokens and raising more than $1.6 million to date, the project’s 4th presale stage continues to attract a growing base of investors who see the potential for massive returns. This surge is underpinned by well-designed tokenomics that foster confidence. Only 10% of tokens are released at the Token Generation Event (TGE), with the rest vested over a six-month period following a one-month cliff. Such a controlled release reduces the hazard of fee crashes due to big sell-offs, encouraging long-term holding and price stability. Security and Transparency Build Trust In the frequently unstable and risky world of crypto, protection and transparency are paramount. Ozak AI has taken steps to reassure traders via undergoing audits from Certik, a top blockchain safety firm, and conducting thorough inner audits. These opinions verify the protection and integrity of the platform’s clever contracts, decreasing the hazard of vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the undertaking’s listing on reputable aggregators like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko adds an extra layer of visibility and credibility. Investors can assess Ozak AI’s performance overtly, which bolsters market confidence and facilitates enticing a much wider target market. Strategic Partnerships Powering Growth Ozak AI’s ecosystem is expanding rapidly with its strategic partnerships with modern gamers within the blockchain and AI area. One such collaboration is with Weblume, a no-code Web3 improvement platform. This partnership seeks to immediately combine Ozak AI’s real-time market signals into Weblume’s drag-and-drop app builder, making it less difficult for creators to expand information-rich on-chain programs. Another significant alliance is with SINT, a platform offering “one-click AI upgrades” for products across Web2 and Web3. SINT’s voice-activated AI agents enable users to interact seamlessly with trading platforms and decentralized apps without coding knowledge. The synergy between Ozak AI’s predictive data and SINT’s autonomous agents could revolutionize how investors execute trades, combining speed with ease of use. Turning $100 Into $10,000 The mixture of innovative era, robust tokenomics, and strategic partnerships positions Ozak AI as a superb presale possibility. Priced at simply $0.005 per token within the present stage, projections propose the token could attain $1, probably delivering 200x returns. For buyers, this means that a $100 investment ought to balloon to $10,000 or more if Ozak AI meets its increased potential. While such profits come with inherent risks typical of the crypto marketplace, the mission’s basics offer a compelling case for early participation. What the Future Holds for Ozak AI As the broader cryptocurrency market gears up for what many expect to be a bullish phase in 2025, projects like Ozak AI with real-world applications and strong communities are likely to lead the pack. The platform plans ongoing feature enhancements and expanded AI capabilities to keep delivering cutting-edge market insights. Community events, such as recent meetups in Vietnam combining networking with innovative brainstorming over signature cocktails and Vietnamese cà phê, highlight the vibrant and engaged user base that supports Ozak AI’s vision. This active community plays a crucial role in driving adoption and fostering trust. Ozak AI’s presale is more than just another crypto offering—it represents a transformative opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on AI-powered blockchain innovation. With over $1.6 million raised, millions of tokens already sold, and a clear roadmap backed by strong security and partnerships, Ozak AI is making waves. For those willing to act early, the potential to turn a small $100 investment into $10,000 or more is very real. As always, investors should conduct their own research, but Ozak AI’s presale stands out as one of the most exciting and promising entry points in today’s crypto landscape.

Recent data shows SOL dropping almost 10% this week despite apparent ecosystem strength. Capital rotation favors Ethereum strongly now. This shift highlights changing institutional preferences. Consequently, investors are reallocating funds toward emerging opportunities with stronger momentum. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents such an alternative, already delivering 250% gains for early backers. Its presale success underscores this growing interest. Solana Struggles Despite On-Chain Gains Solana displays confusing signals currently. Network fundamentals suggest growth. Total Value Locked increased 2.67% within 24 hours. Stablecoin volume exploded 500% month-over-month. User activity and developer output remain robust. However, SOL prices keep falling sharply. This disconnect reveals deeper market issues. Deleveraging hit Solana hard. Over $4 billion vanished from Solana futures markets recently. Ethereum suffered a larger $10 billion reduction yet showed greater price resilience. Therefore, Solana absorbs downside pressure poorly. The SOL/ETH trading pair plummeted over 50% from recent highs. Institutional interest offers little relief. DeFi Dev Corp increased its SOL holdings 91% monthly. It now holds 1.18 million SOL worth $204 million. Still, Ethereum surged 49% in July while Solana managed only 11.57%. This underperformance questions Solana’s short-term investment appeal. Crypto prices today reflect this bearish sentiment clearly. Mutuum Finance Presale Momentum Accelerates Mutuum Finance (MUTM) attracts substantial capital during its ongoing presale. Phase 6 is currently underway with tokens priced at $0.035. Over $14,250,000 has been raised since the presale began. More than 670 million tokens have already been sold. Total MUTM holders now exceed 15,000 participants. This phase is selling out rapidly. Investors face a closing window to buy at $0.035. Afterwards, Phase 7 commences immediately. Prices will then rise 14.3% to $0.04. The listing price is confirmed at $0.06. Current buyers potentially gain 371.4% after launch. Analysts project MUTM reaching $3 by 2026. This represents an 8,471% return from Phase 6 prices. Such crypto predictions drive accelerating demand. Robust Security Framework Verified Mutuum Finance prioritizes investor safety above all. The project finalized its CertiK audit successfully. CertiK awarded a 95.00 security score, confirming strong protocol integrity. No vulnerabilities existed within the audited smart contracts. Furthermore, no security incidents occurred over the past 90 days. Mutuum Finance also launched an official Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. It allocated $50,000 USDT for vulnerability rewards. This bounty covers four severity tiers: critical, major, minor, and low. Every identified flaw receives appropriate compensation. This proactive approach enhances platform trustworthiness significantly. Community Growth And Incentives Mutuum Finance fosters strong community participation actively. A $100,000 MUTM giveaway is energizing the presale phase. Ten winners will each receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens. Participation requires simple steps. First, submit a valid wallet address for potential prize transfers. Second, complete all designated quests thoroughly. Third, confirm eligibility through a minimum $50 presale investment. Additionally, Mutuum Finance introduced a new dashboard feature. It includes a leaderboard tracking the top 50 token holders. These leading participants will earn bonus tokens for maintaining their positions. This system rewards long-term commitment effectively. Final Opportunity For Strategic Allocation Solana’s fading momentum redirects smart crypto investment toward innovative projects. Mutuum Finance offers tangible utility through decentralized lending. Its presale progress demonstrates strong market confidence. Phase 6 provides final access below $0.04 before the next increase. With Phase 7 starting soon, immediate action maximizes potential gains. Consider participating in Mutuum Finance today.

49871927,552534,1754850607,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49871927.jpeg,Institutions Go Shopping: Whales Scoop Up $4.16-B Of Ethereum Tokens In Past Month,https://bitcoinist.com/scoop-4-16-billion-of-ethereum-tokens-in-past-month/,"Institutional investors have taken center stage in crypto discussions in recent weeks, with emerging treasury companies being the talk of the town. Ethereum—behind only Bitcoin— is one of the cryptocurrencies being accumulated by the new market entrants (mostly institutional players). Interestingly, the latest on-chain data shows that this relevant class of investors has stepped up their purchases in recent weeks, purchasing billions of Ethereum tokens in the past 30 days. Are Institutions Behind Ethereum’s Recent Price Surge? In a recent post on the X platform, EmberCN revealed that multiple unknown whales or institutions have accumulated more than 1.035 million ETH tokens (worth around $4.167 billion) since July 10, 2025. According to the on-chain analytics firm, this buying spree occurred through exchanges or institutional trading platforms, including Kraken, FalconX, Galaxy Digital, Binance, and Coinbase. EmberCN, in the post on X, postulated that most of the addresses that amassed these substantial amounts of Ethereum tokens are likely owned by institutions or US-based public companies building ETH reserves. The analytics, however, excluded SBET (SharpLink Gaming), as its addresses are known and identifiable. SharpLink’s Ethereum accumulation spree has been well documented over the past month, acquiring hundreds of thousands of Ether tokens in the space of a month. As Bitcoinist reported, the marketing company expects to expand its ETH-focused treasury to up to $5 billion. This accumulation trend correlates with a period of positive price action , with Ethereum surging from $2,600 to over $4,000—more than a 45% increase in the last 30 days. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the average acquisition price for these institutional purchases is pegged at around $3,546. As of this writing, the Ethereum token is valued at around $4,260, reflecting an over 5% increase in the past 24 hours. Data from CoinGecko shows that the second-largest cryptocurrency has increased in value by more than 25% in the last seven days. Arthur Hayes Re-Acquires ETH Token At Higher Prices BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes revealed that he has bought back all of his Ethereum tokens after a significant sell-off last week. According to on-chain data, Hayes sold 2,373 ETH tokens (equivalent to $8.32 million at the time of sale) at around $3,507. The price of ETH has increased by more than 20% since then, prompting the BitMEX co-founder to “undo” his trade. On Saturday, August 9, Hayes used $10.5 million worth of USDC to purchase fresh Ethereum tokens at around $4,150. Hayes said on X: Had to buy it all back, do you forgive me @fundstrat? (referring to Tom Lee, the chief investment officer at Fundstrat Capital and head of research at FS Insight).

The most prominent altcoin now trades around $4,200, representing an estimated 180% gain from market lows of $1,500 in May 2025. Looking forward, a market analyst with the username CryptoOnChain unveils a potential price trajectory for Ethereum, detailing both short- and long-term outlooks for the asset. Related Reading: Ethereum Exchange Balances Decline To 18.8M ETH: Smart Money Drains Supply On-Chain Data Shows ETH Long-Term Bullish, Short-Term Vulnerable In a QuickTake post on CryptoQuant, CryptoOnChain shares insights on Ethereum’s future price movement based on recent exchange activity. The digital asset analyst notes that after rallying from the $2,400 zone, ETH has climbed to around $4,215, just shy of the strong $4,400 resistance level that has historically acted as a significant supply barrier. While momentum indicators such as the MACD and buying volume remain positive, the approach toward this resistance is accompanied by potential for near-term selling pressure. Meanwhile, CryptoOnChain also reveals that on-chain exchange metrics reveal a divergence between broader market behavior and activity specific to Binance. Notably, Ethereum’s Exchange Supply Ratio (ESR) across all exchanges has recorded a steady decline since 2022, now standing at approximately 0.16. This development suggests that investors are steadily moving ETH off trading platforms, thereby reducing sell-side liquidity and strengthening the market confidence in the asset’s long-term price outlook. However, Binance’s ESR has been climbing since early 2025, now hovering near 0.04. This localized increase indicates that some ETH holders are moving coins back into Binance, potentially for short-term profit taking, arbitrage opportunities, or to participate in exchange-specific programs. Adding to the cautious tone, Binance’s exchange netflow has recently seen a notable surge in positive inflows, as Ethereum nears key resistance at $4,400, signifying potential intent to sell. The combination of these metrics paints a picture of long-term strength but short-term vulnerability for the Ethereum market. From a macro standpoint, the ongoing decline in the all-exchange ESR points to a healthier supply-demand balance for ETH. However, the localized buildup of ETH on Binance, which is the world’s largest exchange, coupled with heightened net inflows, suggests that sellers may be preparing to take profits in the immediate term. Related Reading: Cardano Price Prediction: Why A 52% Rally To $1.20 Could Happen Soon Ethereum Price Forecast At press time, Ethereum trades at $4,230, reflecting a 4.62% gain in the last day. However, the asset’s daily trading volume has declined by 12.08%. Considering the current ESR report, CryptoOnChain outlines two scenarios. In a bullish scenario, a swift drop in Binance net inflows or a leveling off in the exchange’s ESR could open the door for ETH to push decisively past the $4,400 mark, with $4,800 as the next price target amidst the possibility of revisiting all-time highs. Conversely, if strong inflows into Binance persist and the price fails to clear $4,400, ETH could face a short-term pullback, potentially retracing to the $3,950–$4,000 support zone before mounting another breakout attempt.

This level came almost three years after the network reached a supply of 120 million ETH on August 22, 2022. Ethereum currently generates approximately 2,500–3,000 ETH per day. This indicates a stable issuance rate despite protocol changes and upgrades over time. However, the circulating supply is determined not only by issuance but also by the staking mechanism. Every ETH deposited into a staking contract is removed from circulation, slowing net supply growth and acting as a brake on token inflation. Related News: Unexpected Altcoin Makes a New Surge in the Last 24 Hours: Here's Why It's Rising Currently, the total amount of ETH produced on the Ethereum network is as follows: Circulating supply: 121,000,000 ETH ETH locked in staking contracts: 36,182,039 ETH Total ETH produced: 157,182,039 ETH CryptoQuant notes that this data indicates that Ethereum's monetary base is expanding through a controlled issuance and staking-based lockup model. According to the analysis, while the deflation narrative may weaken in the short term, the balance between supply and staking will remain critical to Ethereum's future valuation. Whether future price pressure stems from inflation or the network's activity level will be the key factor determining this balance. *This is not investment advice.

Operating under a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model, Embargo has attacked critical infrastructure across the United States, including hospitals and pharmaceutical networks. Hospitals and Pharmaceutical Networks Among Victims Confirmed victims include American Associated Pharmacies , Georgia-based Memorial Hospital and Manor , and Weiser Memorial Hospital in Idaho. Ransom demands have reached as high as $1.3 million per incident. TRM Labs suggests Embargo could be a rebranded version of the notorious BlackCat (ALPHV) group, which vanished earlier this year following a suspected exit scam. Technical overlaps include the use of the Rust programming language, similar data leak platforms, and shared onchain wallet infrastructure. Dormant Crypto Funds and Laundering Tactics Around $18.8 million of Embargo’s proceeds remain untouched in unaffiliated wallets, a move experts believe may delay detection or await better laundering opportunities. The group reportedly relies on a network of intermediary wallets, high-risk exchanges, and sanctioned platforms such as Cryptex.net. Between May and August, TRM traced at least $13.5 million through various service providers, with over $1 million routed via Cryptex. Double Extortion and US-Focused Attacks While less publicly aggressive than groups like LockBit, Embargo employs double extortion, encrypting systems and threatening to leak sensitive data if payment is not made. In some cases, individuals have been named or data published to pressure victims. Embargo’s targeting strategy favors sectors where downtime is costly, such as healthcare, business services, and manufacturing, with a preference for US-based victims due to their higher payment capacity. UK Plans Ransomware Payment Ban for Public Sector In related developments, the UK government plans to ban ransomware payments for public sector entities and critical national infrastructure operators. The proposal includes mandatory reporting, requiring victims to file an initial report within 72 hours of an attack and a detailed account within 28 days. Decline in Ransomware Revenues According to Chainalysis, ransomware activity dropped by 35% last year, marking the first revenue decline in the sector since 2022.",Blockchain|Regulation|Web3,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-08-10 18:47:00

Technical analyses for August 2025 reveal that DOGE is projected, at best, to increase by approximately 60% from its current levels, given its prevailing market cap and historical resistance points. Shiba Inu, having undergone extended bearish trends, is forecasted by leading analysts to achieve a possible maximum rebound of 80% within the year, assuming optimal market conditions. While these percentage increases are notable for established tokens, their immense circulating supplies and saturated market capitalization mean their explosive potential is inherently capped. As such, investors seeking dramatic upside are increasingly exploring alternatives beyond the established giants, recognizing that other opportunities may offer superior returns and innovation. When it comes to the best meme coins to buy in 2025, two names come at the top of the list: PENGU and newcomer Layer Brett ($LBRETT) . PENGU & Layer Brett: New Contenders with Higher Upside Turning to the new generation, PENGU and $LBRETT are drawing significant expert attention for their outsized growth prospects. Market sentiment and technical forecasts for PENGU suggest a possible price increase of over 300% in the coming year, driven by its lean market cap and emerging community traction. However, it is $LBRETT that stands out in expert projections: currently in its early presale phase at $0.004 per token, Layer Brett is positioned for exponential growth, with some analysts speculating price gains exceeding 1,000% post-launch, should demand and adoption targets be met. Unlike Dogecoin and SHIB, both PENGU and $LBRETT possess the advantage of low initial valuations and vibrant, engaged communities, setting the stage for a far greater upside in both the short and medium term. Why $LBRETT Leads Meme Coin Potential in 2025 The defining advantage of $LBRETT lies in its innovative staking and community-driven features. Most notably, $LBRETT offers a staggering APY, initially as much as 25,000%. But the number is dropping sharply. This high-yield staking is directly tied to the ongoing presale , reducing as more people join. This enhances early adopter benefits and drives rapid token lockup. With a fixed maximum supply of 10 billion tokens, $LBRETT is constructed to maximize scarcity, a critical factor for long-term price appreciation. Additionally, the project’s headline-grabbing $1 million community giveaway is accelerating adoption and community buzz, amplifying exposure across social channels. These combined features—exceptional APY, fixed scarcity, and robust community incentives—position $LBRETT as one of the best meme coins to buy in 2025, surpassing other newcomers like PENGU and legacy coins like Dogecoin and SHIB. $LBRETT: A Technically Sound Meme Coin While a meme coin, $LBRETT takes an unusual step, and in the right direction. The meme coin hype is real, but built as an Ethereum Layer 2 network, Layer Brett is tech-backed, with a potential for anyone to build dApps on it. Think of DeFi, NFTs, GameFi, and others, all running on a super-fast, cheap, and secure Layer 2 blockchain. And with no KYC or other centralized control. Layer Brett is perhaps the best bet for people looking for a meme coin explosion, without Big Brother oversight. The Next Chapter in Meme Coin Growth While Dogecoin and SHIB have set historical standards, their growth ceilings are now well defined. Emerging players, particularly PENGU and especially $LBRETT, offer far greater upside for those seeking outsized returns. With record-setting staking rewards, strategic scarcity, and aggressive community campaigns, $LBRETT is uniquely situated with its presale to lead the next wave of meme coin expansion in 2025. Secure your spot in the LayerBrett presale today and ride the momentum before this opportunity zips by!

While past performance offers clues, future outcomes depend on a combination of market sentiment, macroeconomic conditions, and institutional adoption. This article explores the viability of that $150K target—and what it might mean for the broader crypto landscape. These insights are backed by Outset PR , whose data-driven market research and campaign strategy provide not only visibility for leading crypto brands but also the kind of trend intelligence that helps the entire industry navigate moments of inflection. Bitcoin's Resilience: A Sign of the Upcoming Altcoin Season? Source: tradingview Bitcoin, often called digital gold, is a decentralized currency. It runs on a technology called blockchain, which ensures secure and transparent transactions. Despite recent market dips, Bitcoin's history shows a pattern of bouncing back stronger. Just like in 2021, such corrections could be the calm before an exciting market rally. Bitcoin's potential as a store of value and inflation hedge remains strong. Its crucial role lays the groundwork for other cryptocurrencies, marking an altcoin season. Current price drops might offer a chance for new investors to enter before the next surge. With growing adoption and institutional interest, Bitcoin still looks attractive in this market cycle.

This bold step hints at bigger plays in the space, especially around stablecoins. Eyes now turn to XYZVerse, as industry watchers speculate whether it will catch the momentum and benefit from the waves stirred by Ripple’s major move. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch. The current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price, far below the expected listing price. Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.005 by Stage 13, with over $15 million already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a target listing price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. The recent partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ underscores XYZVerse’s commitment to expanding its utility. It’s a big move that gives the community something to actually use. As part of the deal, $XYZ holders get a special bonus on their first bet—a nice perk that adds extra value just for being part of the ecosystem. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity XRP: The Fast Coin Racing to Connect the World’s Money XRP is a digital coin that lives on the XRP Ledger. It was built by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz in 2012. The code makes each payment zip across the globe in seconds. Fees are tiny, and no bank account is needed. One hundred billion coins were made at birth. The team gave 80 billion to Ripple, the company driving growth. Ripple locked 55 billion of those coins in escrow and releases them slowly. The name came from “ripple credits,” a nod to smooth money waves. Today traders hunt for coins that move fast and cost little. Bitcoin is sturdy but slow. Ethereum is smart but fees soar when traffic spikes. New chains like Solana promise speed but have paused during overloads. XRP has run for years with few hiccups and settles in four seconds. This edge turns heads in the latest market cycle, where cross-border apps and micro-payments are hot. Fresh releases from escrow add supply, yet clear rules on timing calm shock. If the world keeps pushing for cheap, instant moves of any currency, XRP looks hard to ignore. Conclusion XRP and others show strong potential in current market conditions. However, XYZVerse stands out as the first all-sport memecoin, mixing sports passion and community action, aiming for massive gains and long-term impact.

This fresh move hints at the search for the next big winner. The bold investment has sparked talk about possible huge returns. Many are now watching to see if history will repeat and another impressive profit story will unfold. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.005 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early for Maximum Gains Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Solana: The Fast Lane Coin Racing Ahead of the Pack Solana is a digital chain built for speed and scale. It hosts small apps called dapps, much like Ethereum and Cardano, yet moves data faster. Developers can pick from many coding styles, making building simple. At the heart sits SOL, the coin that keeps everything moving. People use it to pay for tasks, run custom tools, and earn rewards for supporting the network. Every tap of SOL adds power to the system, linking users, makers, and investors in one busy place. The current market cycle favors projects with real use and clear speed gains. Solana ticks both boxes. Its single-layer design avoids the puzzle of side lanes and shards, so growth feels smooth. Daily activity keeps rising, showing demand for quick trades, games, and art tokens. While Ethereum stays the big name and Cardano eyes research depth, Solana offers a middle path of fast action and low fees. If you believe heavy traffic will shift to faster rails, SOL may look like an early ticket. Conclusion SOL and other top coins remain strong choices, but the first all-sport memecoin XYZVerse stands out for its big ambitions, strong community, and huge growth potential in this bull run.

With fresh weekly gains and signs of building momentum, AVAX is once again on traders’ watchlists as a possible breakout candidate. This analysis looks at the critical resistance and support zones, recent performance trends, and the market factors that could define its next move. Avalanche (AVAX) Movement Suggests Potential Rise Source: tradingview Avalanche (AVAX) is currently priced between the high teens and mid-twenties. It's moving towards a key resistance level just shy of thirty dollars. Over the past week, AVAX has seen a growth of over twelve percent, and this momentum could push it higher. Should it manage to break past the resistance near thirty dollars, the next target lies in the mid-thirties range, promising a significant uptick. With crucial support levels in the low teens, the coin shows resilience, even after a slight dip over the past six months. Momentum indicators suggest buyers might gain strength, hinting at a possible recovery and growth phase for AVAX. Conclusion Avalanche’s steady climb toward key resistance shows that bullish interest is returning, even after a challenging few months. A clean break above $30 could open the door to higher targets in the mid-$30s, marking a potential turning point in its price trajectory. While broader market sentiment will be a deciding factor, AVAX’s resilience makes it a token worth monitoring closely as it tests these pivotal levels.

With solid short-term momentum and renewed market attention, Litecoin is positioning itself as a contender for bigger moves ahead. This analysis breaks down the key resistance levels, recent performance trends, and market dynamics that could determine its next breakout. Litecoin Shows Strong Growth Potential as Prices Surge Source: tradingview Litecoin is currently trading between around $104 and $117, enjoying a recent upswing. Over the last week, its price rose over 14%, and in a month, it jumped by over 28%. However, over six months, the change is less than 1%. It faces resistance at about $123 and support near $97. If it breaks the first resistance, it could climb to the next level around $136, which would mean a potential increase of roughly 17%. Litecoin's steady rise shows strong short-term growth potential, even though long-term movements are minimal now. Keep an eye on these levels as they will guide future price directions. Conclusion Litecoin’s recent upswing highlights its resilience and capacity for rapid gains when momentum shifts in its favor. If it can clear immediate resistance zones, a climb toward $150 in the next bull leg becomes a realistic target. Still, market volatility and broader sentiment will play decisive roles in the journey. For now, LTC remains a coin to watch closely, with price action that could set the tone for its mid-term trajectory. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Four names keep rising to the top of that conversation — Bitcoin , Solana , BNB , and the explosive newcomer MAGACOIN FINANCE . Each has a different value proposition, ranging from blue-chip security to early-stage upside. But in a cycle where timing can make all the difference, the right entry today could determine who’s sitting on 10x gains six months from now. Bitcoin (BTC): The Macro Anchor Bitcoin remains the most trusted asset in crypto, especially for institutional investors. With BlackRock’s IBIT ETF now holding over 575,000 BTC , and Larry Fink projecting a possible move toward $700,000 per coin , BTC’s long-term thesis is stronger than ever. However, most analysts agree that while Bitcoin offers a solid 2x to 3x upside in the current cycle, it likely won’t deliver the kind of exponential growth many younger investors are chasing. BTC is your digital gold — stable, dominant, and slow-moving. Best for: long-term holders and risk-averse portfolios. Solana (SOL): The Scalable Challenger Solana has become the go-to ecosystem for high-speed, low-fee transactions. With over 26 million active wallets , booming NFT volumes, and major integration wins (like Visa’s payment pilot), SOL continues to prove it’s more than just an “Ethereum alternative.” Currently trading around $169 , Solana is positioned for a potential 5x to 10x run if it retests its previous highs and expands into more gaming and mobile infrastructure. But like all Layer-1s, it’s also exposed to competition and evolving regulatory scrutiny. Best for: mid-term growth traders and ecosystem users. BNB (Binance Coin): The Utility Titan BNB remains a powerhouse due to its direct ties to Binance — the largest crypto exchange in the world. From launchpads and staking to trading discounts and smart chain usage, BNB’s utility continues to underpin steady demand. But with increased global regulatory pressure on Binance itself, BNB’s price remains somewhat capped by compliance risks. Analysts expect a modest 3x to 5x upside , mostly driven by broader market recovery and product expansion. Best for: exchange users and yield strategists. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The High-Upside Wild Card With Solana and BNB offering strong long-term prospects, many traders are also turning to smaller-cap opportunities for faster gains. One such name generating intense early momentum is MAGACOIN FINANCE. While SOL and BNB might require years to deliver 3x or 4x returns, MAGACOIN is being highlighted by analysts for its explosive trajectory, now projecting as much as a 14,900% potential ROI, given its early presale stage and viral community growth. Experts have identified holding Secure MAGACOIN FINANCE as a top crypto to buy. Whale wallets have recently begun accumulating large positions, and institutional trackers show increasing mention volume across media platforms. For investors who missed the early days of Ethereum or the first XRP breakout, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being quietly positioned as a way to access those same levels of upside – without waiting years. Final Verdict: Balance or Boldness? For safety, Bitcoin is still king. For utility, Solana and BNB offer proven track records. But for those chasing explosive upside, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands alone as the most promising early-stage buy of 2025 .

Cold Wallet’s Stage 17 Surge Outshines Solana’s Rally & Cardano’s Struggles,https://thecoinrise.com/which-crypto-to-buy-today-cold-wallets-stage-17-surge-outshines-solanas-rally-cardanos-struggles/,"The market is balancing between optimism and caution, making this the moment traders ask which crypto to buy today with the right mix of potential and safety. The Solana price rally is hinting at a momentum comeback, supported by cleaner order books and stronger network health. In contrast, the Cardano bearish outlook lingers after repeated rejections and whale-driven selling. In such conditions, being selective becomes essential. That is why many are not only studying charts but also looking for projects with built-in advantages that can work in any market cycle. Cold Wallet is one of them. It is not just a storage app with a coin on top, but a rewards engine that turns everyday crypto activity into value. Every time users pay gas, make swaps, or move funds, a portion comes back in CWT. Rewards scale with holdings, and at the top tier, gas costs can be nearly offset. This cushions activity in bear markets and compounds it in bull runs. The numbers stand out. Cold Wallet is in Stage 17 at $0.00998, with $5.8M already raised and a projected 4,900 percent ROI to its listing target. Those entry economics are why it appears high on the radar when traders ask which crypto to buy today. Unlike the Solana price rally or the Cardano bearish outlook, Cold Wallet is built so that usage itself drives value, creating a sustainable edge when cycles change. Solana Price Rally Keeps Building a Case for Gains Market watchers see the Solana price rally supported by reduced exchange supply and stable derivatives data. When selling pressure is lighter, rallies can move faster with less effort, which is why Solana keeps appearing on breakout scans. Trading volume around higher lows also hints that buyers are still active. Developers remain committed to the chain. Transaction capacity is solid, fees are low, and new consumer applications keep arriving. For anyone deciding which crypto to buy today, this combination of adoption and cost efficiency makes the Solana price rally more than just another headline. If major resistance levels break, follow through could be swift. Still, risk control matters. The Solana price rally depends on broad market liquidity and sentiment to maintain its pace. In unstable weeks, scaling in slowly works better than chasing. For those checking which crypto to buy today, Solana stands out as a strong momentum option, but it is still momentum. Cardano Bearish Outlook Stretches Timelines for Recovery The Cardano bearish outlook shows whales taking profits and a community waiting for clear catalysts. When rallies stall at the same price areas, confidence can fade and downside risk grows. This creates discounted entries but also longer waits for trend shifts. Cardano’s roadmap is still ambitious, but price action follows supply over stories. For those deciding which crypto to buy today, the Cardano bearish outlook means any entry must prepare for a slower climb. Range strategies can work, but swing positions require patience until momentum strengthens. This does not make ADA a poor choice. It just means the Cardano bearish outlook favors a wait-and-see approach. If governance wins and network upgrades start driving activity, sentiment can reverse. Until then, the Cardano bearish outlook keeps ADA on the radar rather than in the immediate buy list for those weighing which crypto to buy today. Cold Wallet Rewards Every Move You Make Cold Wallet is more than a place to store crypto. It is a reward system built for daily use. Each time you pay gas, make a swap, or transfer funds on or off chain, Cold Wallet sends a part back in CWT. The more you hold, the higher your tier, and at the top tier gas fees can be almost fully covered. In slow markets this keeps activity steady, and in strong markets it boosts growth. Because it gives back for every action, activity adds value instead of draining it. That is the key difference. Fees no longer pull down returns. Instead, Cold Wallet sends a share to holders, building habits and keeping users active. A dedicated reward pool keeps the system running for the long term, not just for a quick push. The figures tell the story. Cold Wallet is now in Stage 17 at $0.00998, with $5.8M in sales and a forecasted 4,900 percent ROI to the listing goal. These entry points are why it is mentioned often when people ask which crypto to buy today in any type of market. The price is low, the plan is clear, and the rewards are direct. Unlike the Solana price rally or the Cardano bearish outlook, Cold Wallet is not tied to one big chart event. It works by making normal use valuable, which is what many portfolios lack. When the market turns, steady incentives become the real advantage. Why This Approach Fits Any Market Phase If the Solana price rally pushes through resistance with wide support, it can be a short-term buy with controlled risk. If the Cardano bearish outlook improves with better flows and fewer big sells, waiting could pay later. But for anyone asking which crypto to buy today , there is another choice that works in both cases. Cold Wallet gives rewards for being active. This keeps returns smooth when price swings are sharp and speeds up growth when trading volume returns. With Stage 17 pricing at $0.00998, $5.8M already collected, and a 4,900 percent target ahead, Cold Wallet stands out as the top option right now.

PI network price prediction and Solana price ecosystem updates are drawing attention, yet Cold Wallet is entering the spotlight with a cashback rewards model that challenges traditional crypto economics. Stage 17 of the Cold Wallet presale has raised $5.8M at $0.00998, aiming for a 4,900% ROI at launch. Unlike speculative plays, Cold Wallet uses sustainable tokenomics that reward network usage instead of just trading activity. This gives it a strong position against both PI and Solana. PI Network Price Prediction: Balancing Unlock Impact and Growth Recent PI network price prediction analysis shows cautious optimism after July’s unlock of 268 million tokens. While hopes for a breakout were high, the price remains under selling pressure, slowing short-term gains. Without fresh adoption catalysts, reaching pre-unlock highs could prove challenging. Even so, PI’s long-term vision is still attractive. Its community-driven mining model and growing KYC adoption base offer more than just speculation. Some forecasts expect gradual growth over the next year if promised ecosystem integrations arrive. Still, in the best crypto to buy 2025 race, token unlock risks remain a concern. For now, PI’s recovery depends on adding enough utility to offset its unlock schedule. Until then, it may stay more of a mid-term opportunity than a high-ROI play like Cold Wallet. Solana Price Ecosystem: Opportunity with Caution Signs The Solana price ecosystem remains resilient, staying above key technical levels despite market swings. Analysts mark $150 as crucial support, with a potential move toward $200 if volume strengthens. Solana’s speed, low fees, and DeFi presence keep it in the race with Ethereum, while NFT and gaming projects add momentum. Institutional backing supports liquidity, but some risks remain. Network outages, though fewer, still concern developers, and competition among layer-1s is intense. These factors could limit Solana’s rally even if charts suggest upside. From a fundamentals view, Solana still holds its spot in the best crypto to buy 2025 debate. Yet, its expansion pace may be slower than smaller projects like Cold Wallet, which runs a 150-stage presale with room for larger growth leaps. Cold Wallet’s Cashback Model Shaping 2025 ROI Race Cold Wallet is making its mark as a contender for the best crypto to buy 2025 by offering rewards for real on-chain actions. At Stage 17, priced at $0.00998, it has already raised $5.8M and shows a projected 4,900% ROI. The focus is on growth backed by utility rather than just price speculation. Its CWT tokenomics are built for lasting strength. Forty percent of the supply is set aside for the presale, ensuring broad community reach. A further 25% is allocated to the Rewards Pool, which powers cashback on gas fees, swaps, and on/off-ramp use. This puts users at the center, where wallet activity translates into direct rewards. A 12% share supports liquidity, while 10% fuels ecosystem growth through integrations and partnerships. Team and advisor allocations (7%) are locked with vesting over two to four years, avoiding sudden sell-offs. The remaining 6% in treasury offers governance and strategic flexibility. By turning high transaction costs into value returned to users, Cold Wallet addresses a long-standing adoption challenge. Unlike PI Network, which faces supply pressure from unlocks, or Solana, which operates in a crowded layer-1 market, Cold Wallet ties growth to rewards people can see and use. This gives it a clear edge in the ROI conversation for 2025. Why Cold Wallet Stands Out in 2025 Looking at PI network price prediction, Solana’s market position, and Cold Wallet’s roadmap, the contrast is clear. PI faces unlock pressures, Solana must manage competition, but Cold Wallet scales through incentives that align directly with user activity. At $0.00998, with $5.8M already raised and a forecasted 4,900% ROI, Cold Wallet is not just another presale project. In the race for the best crypto presale , it offers a balance of sustainability, user rewards, and long-term vision that many in the market are seeking.

49873287,https://timestabloid.com/?p=77810,1754852704,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Raoul Pal: XRP is the Moron Trade. Here’s What It Means,https://timestabloid.com/raoul-pal-xrp-is-the-moron-trade-heres-what-it-means/,"Digital Asset Investor sparked lively debate this week after sharing a clip of macro investor Raoul Pal describing what he calls the “moron trade” — a common retail investor behavior — and using XRP as a prime example. The remark, while tongue-in-cheek, sheds light on a well-known market phenomenon where psychology often outweighs fundamentals. Pal explains that many newcomers to crypto gravitate toward the cheapest and most recognizable tokens in the top ten. His scenario is familiar: a first-time investor sees Bitcoin at over $118,000 and Ethereum at over $4,000, and decides those are “too expensive.” Instead, they opt for coins like XRP or Dogecoin because they are affordable per unit and have strong name recognition. Pal also distinguished between large, established Layer 1 networks like Solana and Sui — which are gaining real adoption — and smaller, mid-tier DeFi projects that are harder to assess. He emphasized that while some big Layer 1s can deliver strong returns with relatively lower risk, the “moron trade” tends to be purely price-driven. Importantly, Pal clarified that he wasn’t calling the assets themselves “moronic,” but rather describing a predictable retail buying pattern. According to @RaoulGMI XRP is the ""Moron Trade"". Translation: He didn't get his discount VC allotment. pic.twitter.com/lBmOUQlQA0 — Digital Asset Investor (@digitalassetbuy) August 9, 2025 The Psychology Behind the “Moron Trade” Pal’s point centers on two psychological drivers: price anchoring and the affordance effect. New investors often believe that cheaper coins have more upside potential simply because they can buy more units for the same amount of money. When such coins already have brand recognition — like XRP , Dogecoin, or Cardano — retail demand can push prices sharply higher during bull markets, regardless of whether network usage or adoption metrics justify it. However, this type of rally can be short-lived if it’s not supported by fundamentals. Without sustained adoption, transaction growth, or developer activity, these assets can suffer steep corrections once hype fades. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Reaction Digital Asset Investor’s post quickly went viral, with reactions ranging from amusement to criticism. Some XRP community members took offense at the label, arguing that the token’s use case in cross-border payments gives it far more legitimacy than Pal implied. Others saw the comment as validation that retail enthusiasm for low-priced tokens will continue to drive gains in the next bull run. A few critics even suggested Pal’s remarks might stem from not having access to early venture capital allocations in XRP, a jab that circulated widely among XRP advocates. The Real Takeaway for Investors Whether viewed as an insult or an insight, Pal’s comments highlight an important truth: in crypto markets, narrative and psychology often drive short-term price action. Traders looking to exploit these moves must do so with strict risk management, while long-term investors should focus on measurable adoption and strong fundamentals. By amplifying the clip, Digital Asset Investor reminded the market of a timeless reality: retail behavior can be both predictable and powerful, but without careful research, it can also be costly.

Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is not just another memecoin aiming for virality—it’s a Layer 2 blockchain project that fuses meme culture with actual infrastructure. While Pepe Coin (PEPE) made history with a staggering run in 2023–2024, many investors are now asking: Could LILPEPE not only follow in its footsteps but also outrun them in the upcoming 2025 bull cycle? With a presale price of $0.0018 as of writing, a market-tested vesting structure, and more than $15.3 million already raised, the answer could be a strong yes. Revisiting PEPE Coin’s Legendary Run Pepe Coin launched in mid‑April 2023 at a microscopic fraction of a cent—initially trading for about $0.000000001—before exploding to an all‑time high near $0.00002660 in late 2024, marking astronomical gains despite later retracement into the low ten‑micro‑dollar range. Today, PEPE hovers near $0.000010–$0.000011, which remains among meme-coin heavyweights with a multi‑billion‑dollar market cap and top‑30 CoinMarketCap ranking. That parabolic movement—driven by viral crowd psychology and a low supply floor—makes PEPE a benchmark for memetic excess. However, while it remains a cultural phenomenon, PEPE lacks a broader utility model, raising questions about its long‑term sustainability relative to more ambitious meme tokens. Enter Little Pepe ($LILPEPE): Meme Power Meets Layer 2 Utility Little Pepe isn’t trying to be the next PEPE—it’s building beyond it. As a Layer 2 blockchain on Ethereum, LILPEPE merges high-speed transactions, ultra-low gas fees, and decentralized infrastructure with the cultural weight of internet memes. The project is governed by its native token, $LILPEPE. It aims to offer not just speculative upside but genuine functionality: smart contracts, staking rewards, a meme-based launchpad, and low-cost DeFi tools. The zero-tax model—no fees on buys or sells—distinguishes LILPEPE from other tokens that quietly drain user funds through transaction taxes. From both a utility and UX standpoint, it’s engineered for mass appeal. Presale Uptick and Strategic Tokenomics The LILPEPE presale launched at $0.0010 and has already moved through eight successful stages. As of writing, Stage 9 is active at $0.0018, with over 10.5 billion tokens sold out of the 11.25 billion Stage 9 allocation. The presale has raised an impressive $15.3 million of its $16.475 million goal, with investors rushing to secure tokens before the listing price of $0.003. Token distribution also shows strong long-term planning. Only 20% of the total supply will be in initial circulation, with no presale unlock at TGE (Token Generation Event). Instead, a 3-month cliff followed by 5% monthly vesting ensures gradual release and reduces dumping risk—unlike the chaotic launches seen in many memecoins. Breakdown of $LILPEPE Token Allocation: 26.5% Presale 30% Chain Reserves 13.5% Staking & Rewards 10% each to Liquidity, Marketing, and DEX Allocation 0% Tax Smart Contract Audit and CoinMarketCap Listing Security and legitimacy are top priorities for Little Pepe. Its smart contracts have already passed a full audit , scoring 81.55% as of writing—a rare achievement for a meme project still in presale. This level of technical due diligence signals a serious approach to long-term credibility. Moreover, LILPEPE has already secured a live listing on CoinMarketCap , a notable feat that puts it ahead of 95% of memecoins still seeking visibility. It’s an early sign of traction and institutional recognition. Massive Giveaway and Growing Community Hype To amplify visibility and community engagement, Little Pepe has launched a $777,000 giveaway , with ten winners each receiving $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens. With over 179,000 entries already recorded, the buzz is growing fast. Combined with coordinated influencer campaigns, meme contests, and global marketing pushes, LILPEPE is rapidly establishing itself as the most anticipated presale of the year. Why LILPEPE Might Outpace PEPE in 2025 While PEPE delivered jaw-dropping returns in the past, its future upside may be capped due to its already high market cap and lack of functionality. LILPEPE, on the other hand, is still early—with its $0.003 listing price suggesting ample room for exponential growth. Should it hit $0.10 or beyond—which is mathematically possible given its low float and community fervor—early investors could see 50× to 300× returns or more from current levels. And unlike past memecoins built on hype alone, LILPEPE offers a Layer 2 chain, staking mechanics, meme-powered dApps, and a loyal and growing user base—giving it the legs to run far into the next market cycle. Final Thoughts: Don’t Miss the Meme Bull Before It Runs Little Pepe is positioning itself as the next big thing in memecoins—but with fundamentals and foresight rarely seen in the sector. A working product roadmap, audited security, presale transparency, and viral momentum all point to one conclusion: this isn’t just a coin; it’s a movement. If you missed the early wave of PEPE, LILPEPE may be your second chance—but with even more upside potential. With presale pricing still open and the $777K giveaway in full swing, now is the time to look closely. Visit the official website , review the whitepaper and audit, and decide whether to grab your share before the presale window closes.

By 2028, the price is projected to reach $9.84 By 2031, FIL may reach $27.90. Filecoin is a decentralized storage network designed to securely and efficiently store humanity’s most important information. Launched by Protocol Labs in October 2020, it utilizes blockchain technology to create a peer-to-peer digital storage marketplace. Users can rent unused hard drive space to earn Filecoin tokens (FIL), the network’s native cryptocurrency. The system operates on a proof-of-replication and proof-of-spacetime consensus mechanism, ensuring that data is reliably stored over time and that storage providers hold the exact copies they claim. This approach incentivizes a robust and distributed network of storage providers, enhancing data retrieval speeds and security compared to traditional centralized servers. Filecoin aims to reduce the costs of storage services by leveraging the global surplus of storage capacity. As part of the broader Web3 ecosystem, it supports decentralized applications (dApps) and services requiring secure, decentralized data storage solutions, significantly advancing decentralized internet infrastructure.

The price has broken above the middle Bollinger Band and is testing resistance around $2.85. RSI at 54.82 suggests moderate strength, leaving room for further upside before overbought territory. However, the MACD still trends slightly negative, indicating that momentum is not fully aligned for a strong breakout. If bulls push above $2.85, the next target could be $3.00. Failure to hold above $2.50 may trigger a pullback toward $2.35–$2.20, especially if broader market sentiment weakens in the coming sessions. Filecoin price analysis 4-hour chart analysis FILUSD chart by TradingView Filecoin’s 4-hour chart shows recent bullish progress slowing as the price hovers around $2.60, just below resistance at $2.69. The Bollinger Bands are beginning to tighten, suggesting reduced volatility ahead. MACD remains in positive territory, indicating underlying bullish momentum, though histogram bars are flattening, hinting at a potential consolidation phase. The Balance of Power is firmly positive, showing buyers are still dominant. If FIL breaks above $2.69, the next target could be $2.85. However, rejection at this level could pull the price back toward $2.55 or even $2.42 support, especially if market sentiment weakens in the short term.

A push above the $2.69 resistance could open the path to $2.85, while failure may trigger a pullback toward $2.53 support. On the 4-hour chart, bullish momentum is moderating near the same resistance, with tightening Bollinger Bands hinting at consolidation. MACD remains positive, supporting the possibility of another upward attempt. A confirmed breakout above $2.69 could accelerate gains, but a rejection may see FIL retesting $2.55 or $2.42 if selling pressure intensifies. Is Filecoin a good investment?

The proposal aims to incorporate Stargate into LayerZero as a key ecosystem participant. “This proposal is designed to accelerate the development of Stargate and LayerZero, to provide resources for Stargate to aggressively execute on a roadmap that expands beyond bridging, and to more deeply integrate a powerful revenue-generating protocol that directly touches the end user into the LayerZero ecosystem,” the statement said. Under the proposal, the STG token will be terminated, and investors will be able to exchange their STG holdings for LayerZero's native token, ZRO. The exchange rate is set at 1 STG = 0.08634 ZRO, equivalent to $0.1675 per STG and $1.94 per ZRO. Stargate will be absorbed into the LayerZero Foundation, and the Stargate DAO will be dissolved.

However, the STG token fell from its peak of $4.14 shortly after launch, falling below $0.20. Following the offering, the STG price rose 12% to $0.188, while ZRO rose 15%, bringing the total value of the offering to approximately $127 million.

According to journalist Eleanor Terrett, Bo Hines, the leader of the council, is quitting his job as the Head of the crypto council. Reportedly, Hines will be succeeded by his deputy, Patrick Witt. In a recent X post, the pro-crypto leader confirmed the news. Hines said he will still maintain his presence at the White House. Bo Hines to Take on Advisory Role In December 2024, Bo Hines, a former football player turned crypto investor, was nominated by President Trump to lead the crypto council . Three months into the role, he has made a significant impact in the crypto space. It was reported that by April 2025, Hines had met with more than 150 crypto figures. Hines made the council a main hub for crypto policy coordination, aiming to match federal plans with industry needs. He led talks on policies and gave advice on creating favorable crypto rules and regulations. Despite quitting his leadership role, Hines is set to serve as an adviser, helping with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and crypto-related projects. He will work alongside White House AI and Crypto leader David Sacks. Patrick Witt Brings Government Experience to Crypto Council Patrick Witt, the incoming head of the crypto council, is no stranger to public service. He served as Deputy Chief of Staff at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management during Trump’s first term. He later held senior roles in government after an unsuccessful political run. In 2021, Witt campaigned for Georgia’s 10th congressional district but later shifted his focus to running for Georgia State Insurance Commissioner. However, he was defeated in the Republican primary. Despite these setbacks, he returned to government in 2025. He became the deputy director of the crypto council. Witt was also the acting director of the Department of Defense’s Office of Strategic Capital. Notably, this is a Pentagon office that invests in emerging technologies Witt also has a background in football. He played quarterback for Yale University and briefly joined the New Orleans Saints as a free agent. Unlike Hines, Witt does not have direct experience in the crypto industry. New Leadership Signals Shift in U.S. Crypto Policy Approach The leadership change comes as the U.S. crypto industry is moving away from past tough policy issues . This industry is also experiencing fast technological advancement. Hines was known for working closely with industry leaders. He focused on fostering cooperation and building trust between both public and private sectors. Many fear that there might be a change in leadership style in the council. This stems from Witt’s lack of direct crypto industry experience. Nevertheless, others hope his strong government record may steer the council toward integrating crypto with broader technology policies.

ETH Could Repeat This Bitcoin 2020 Fractal",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-price-to-12000-eth-repeat-this-bitcoin-fractal/,"With the bullish momentum growing in the cryptocurrency market, the large-cap altcoins have been some of the major beneficiaries of the current positive trend. Ethereum price, specifically, has continued to impress, with the second-largest cryptocurrency reasserting its position in the market over the past weeks. The Ethereum price displayed significant bullish impetus going into the weekend, reclaiming the $4,000 mark for the first time since December 2024. Interestingly, the “king of altcoins” appears to only be at the beginning of an extended upward trajectory. ETH Price To Soar By 182% In The Coming Months: Analyst In an August 9 post on the social media platform X, pseudonymous crypto analyst Titan of Crypto shared an exciting layout for Ethereum that could see its price climb as high as $12,000. This positive projection is based on the price fractals of the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Bitcoin, in 2020. Related Reading: Dogecoin To $1 Is Within Reach—Here’s What Must Happen First, Says Analyst In technical analysis, fractals refer to the recurring patterns on a price chart. These price patterns often offer insight into historical price movements and can be used to analyze the future trajectory of a cryptocurrency. Titan of Crypto revealed that the Ethereum price is currently at the same spot that the price of BTC was in August 2020. At the time, the premier cryptocurrency was trading within a converging wedge pattern before breaking out to its then all-time-high price at around $69,000. As shown in the chart above, the Ethereum price is currently trading within a similar converging wedge pattern on the monthly chart. Both BTC and ETH prices recently bounced off the lower boundary of the chart pattern earlier in 2020 and 2025, respectively. Almost identically, the two largest cryptocurrencies almost broke above the trendline with their respective July 2020 and 2025 candlestick. While the price of BTC hovered around the upper trendline in the subsequent two months, the Ethereum price has broken clearly above the wedge pattern with its August candlestick. If history is anything to go by, and a sustained monthly close above $4,000 occurs, the price of Ethereum could be on its way to an unprecedented high around the $12,000 region. This move represents a potential 182% surge for ETH from its current price point. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the Ethereum token is valued at around $4,270, reflecting an almost 6% increase in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the altcoin is up by more than 25% in the past seven days.

In a post on X, STEPH IS CRYPTO shared a long-term monthly XRP chart that reveals a consistent upward channel, a rising trendline, and recurring large-scale price arcs, all signaling that the asset may be entering another major mean reversion phase. Accompanying the chart, the analyst declared, “We’re just getting started,” framing the call as the beginning of a broader multi-year trend rather than an imminent short-term surge. Decoding the Chart The chart highlights three distinct large-scale arcs in XRP’s price history. Each arc begins with a significant rally, followed by an extended period of consolidation that gravitates back toward a central white trendline within a rising regression channel. This channel, spanning more than a decade of price action, shows XRP consistently reverting to and then climbing above its long-term mean. Mean reversion for #XRP We're just getting started! pic.twitter.com/M3v6ka0sJM — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 10, 2025 The current setup positions XRP just above the central trendline, with the projected arc stretching well into double-digit territory as the channel extends toward the latter part of the decade. The Mean Reversion Principle Mean reversion is a time-tested market concept where prices, after deviating significantly, tend to return to their long-term average or trend. In technical analysis, it is used to identify potential entry points and estimate target zones. Applied to XRP’s historical structure, STEPH IS CRYPTO’s chart suggests that the recent consolidation phase could be the launchpad for another move toward the channel’s upper boundary, aligning with the $15 projection. While the concept is widely recognized among professional traders, it is not a timing tool and does not guarantee outcomes. Price could still fluctuate widely before reaching any long-term target. Assessing the Path to $15 As of report time, XRP is trading at $3.20, meaning a move to $15 would require a gain of over 360%. While such a rise is ambitious, it is not unprecedented in the cryptocurrency market. However, achieving this level would require sustained momentum, strong liquidity inflows, and a favorable macro environment. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Any decisive break below the long-term trendline or negative regulatory developments could undermine the bullish scenario. The Broader Market Context Technical patterns alone cannot be viewed in isolation. The XRP market remains influenced by ongoing regulatory and legal developments, particularly the aftermath of the Ripple–SEC lawsuit , which has shaped institutional access and investor sentiment. Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, and ongoing expansion of the XRP Ledger ecosystem could further support liquidity, adoption, and utility — all of which strengthen the long-term bullish case. Final Outlook STEPH IS CRYPTO’s $15 projection is a bold but technically grounded long-term scenario, based on the idea that XRP’s price is set to revert toward the upper range of its historical channel. Whether or not it reaches that level will depend on a combination of technical resilience, market conditions, and regulatory clarity. For traders, the chart serves as both a roadmap and a reminder: the trend remains intact, but patience and risk management are essential if the mean reversion thesis is to play out in full.
