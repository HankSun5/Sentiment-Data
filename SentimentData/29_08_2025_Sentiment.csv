XRP and Ethereum remain central to market positioning, each supported by strong fundamentals and upcoming catalysts. Alongside them, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a breakout presale, drawing interest from both retail and whale investors. XRP — ETF Momentum and Institutional Inflows XRP continues to stand out as one of the most closely tracked tokens in 2025, thanks to its ongoing ETF narrative. Multiple proposals are before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and an approval in October could set the stage for a retest of XRP’s all-time high at $3.84. Bullish projections go even further, with some analysts pointing to a potential surge into the $4.50–$9 range if momentum builds through the fourth quarter. Beyond the ETF narrative, legal clarity has created a supportive backdrop for XRP. Court victories have reduced regulatory uncertainty, and new partnerships — particularly with Japan’s SBI Holdings — are strengthening its global profile. Analysts see this combination of legal progress and strategic alliances as a foundation for long-term adoption. Institutional accumulation has also been notable. On-chain data shows whales buying into dips, while trading desks continue to build exposure ahead of potential ETF approval. Analysts say this layered demand — from both speculative traders and long-term institutional players — could make September a critical month for XRP positioning. Ethereum — Constant Institutional Demand Ethereum remains the backbone of the decentralized finance ecosystem and a perennial analyst pick for presale buyers. The network has been bolstered by the rollout of ETH 2.0 upgrades, which improve scalability and reduce fees, reinforcing Ethereum’s dominance as the default smart contract platform. Institutional demand has been steady throughout the year, with spot ETH ETFs drawing billions in inflows. Analysts consistently describe Ethereum as a “core allocation,” arguing that its developer ecosystem, liquidity depth, and cross-chain integrations provide unmatched resilience. For September specifically, technical dashboards are flashing bullish signals. Rollup adoption and new integrations are driving usage, while DeFi activity continues to lock billions of dollars on-chain. Analysts forecast that Ethereum could trade between $5,000 and $7,000 by the end of 2025, making it one of the most stable yet rewarding long-term plays. While Ethereum does not offer the extreme multiples of smaller-cap tokens, its mix of institutional support and ongoing innovation keeps it firmly positioned as a must-have asset in any presale strategy. MAGACOIN FINANCE — High-Upside Play Analysts say September is shaping up to be pivotal for presales with real fundamentals. While XRP and Ethereum remain strong utility leaders, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining attention for its audited smart contracts, deflationary supply, and fast-growing ecosystem — positioning it as the best speculative presale to buy this month. The project has built momentum as whales and retail investors rotate capital into higher-upside opportunities. Presale allocations are rapidly disappearing, and analysts now describe MAGACOIN FINANCE as the top crypto presale to watch heading into the next market cycle. With forecasts ranging from 50x to even higher returns under bullish conditions, it is drawing consistent comparisons to the breakout performances of past meme-driven tokens. For investors looking to complement the stability of XRP and Ethereum with a high-risk, high-reward position, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being cited as the leading speculative play for September 2025. One of the Most Talked-About Crypto Presales of 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly become one of the most talked-about crypto presales for 2025 . With over 25,000 community members and consistent coverage from crypto analysts , its fundamentals suggest the kind of early-stage strength typically seen in top-tier altcoins before breakout moments. Final Takeaway September’s presale landscape reflects a balance between stability and speculation. XRP leads on ETF-driven catalysts and institutional inflows, while Ethereum remains the dependable core for long-term positioning. MAGACOIN FINANCE , meanwhile, offers the speculative upside that appeals to investors willing to take on higher risk. Analysts say combining these three provides a diversified approach to September’s opportunities, blending fundamental strength with breakout potential.

50838051,567583,1756422048,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50838051.jpeg,Bitcoin Liquidity Weakens As Stablecoin Growth Drops To $1.1 Billion,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-liquidity-weakens-stablecoin-1-1-billion/,"Data shows stablecoin market cap expansion has slowed to just $1.1 billion recently, signaling weakening liquidity for Bitcoin and other coins. Stablecoin Market Cap Growth Is Significantly Down Compared To Earlier Highs According to data from on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant , stablecoin growth has been cooling recently. “ Stablecoins ” refer to cryptocurrencies that have their price tied to a fiat currency, with US Dollars being the most popular option. Investors generally store their capital in the form of these tokens when they want to avoid the volatility that comes with coins like Bitcoin. Many holders who buy into stables, however, eventually plan to venture back into the volatile side of the market. Since stablecoins can potentially be swapped into BTC and other assets, their supply can be looked at as a sort of available “ dry powder ” for the cryptocurrency sector. As such, expansions in this supply can prove to be a bullish sign. Now, here is the chart shared by CryptoQuant that shows the trend in the 7-day change in the market cap of the major USD-based stables over the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the late 2024 bull run was accompanied by a sharp positive change in the market cap of the stablecoins. At the peak, these assets observed weekly net inflows of around $7.7 billion. Another wave of inflows occurred in January of this year, with the metric peaking at $6.6 billion. Since then, the market has seen a cooldown in interest, with inflows into stables staying far from the earlier highs. From the chart, it’s visible that the sharp burst in capital flows earlier this month could only manage a top of $4.8 billion. The interest also lasted quite briefly, and inflows disappeared soon after. At present, the metric is sitting at $1.1 billion, implying the market cap of the stablecoins is still growing, but clearly, the rate at which it’s happening isn’t close to the previous bull rally. “Liquidity tailwinds are weaker, limiting Bitcoin’s upside momentum,” explains the analytics firm. It now remains to be seen how long the muted stablecoin inflows would last and whether a pivot to outflows would follow next. In some other news, the Relative Unrealized Loss held by Bitcoin investors is still quite low even after the latest price decline, as on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has pointed out in an X post . The Relative Unrealized Loss is a measure of the total unrealized loss held by the Bitcoin investors represented as a percentage of the market cap. At present, the metric’s value stands at just 0.5%, which is quite low compared to past bear markets. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $113,400, up almost 2% over the 24 hours.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin liquidity|btc|BTCUSDT|Stablecoins|Stablecoins Growth,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-28 23:00:48

In a statement, the European Commission said that eliminating duties on industrial goods and granting “preferential market access” to certain U.S. seafood and agricultural products would secure U.S. tariff relief for the EU auto sector retroactive to August 1. The provisional arrangement eased tensions between the two largest trade and investment partners, though the terms are not balanced. The EU agreed to reduce its own tariffs and step up purchases of U.S. energy, while the United States continued to apply duties to roughly 70% of EU shipments. In February, Trump said the EU was “formed to screw the United States” and linked the new terms to shrinking the U.S. goods deficit with the bloc, which stood at $235 billion in 2024. Member governments indicated they accepted the arrangement as the less harmful option, pointing out that, without a deal, the White House had been prepared to slap 30% tariffs on almost all EU imports. Brussels agreed to open EU market to U.S. goods In the trade deal , reported by Cryptopolitan, Brussels included two legal measures. One scrapped EU tariffs on industrial goods and extended preferential access for U.S. seafood and selected agricultural items. The second continued duty-free treatment for lobsters, expanding it to include processed products. Together, the EU and the United States make up close to a third of world trade. Trump and von der Leyen announced the pact at the U.S. president’s golf course in western Scotland. “I think this is the biggest deal ever made,” Trump told reporters on July 27th, praising EU plans to invest about $600 billion in the United States and to sharply increase purchases of U.S. energy and military equipment. He argued the pact surpassed $550 billion agreement with Japan and would strengthen relations after years of what he described as unfair treatment of U.S. exporters. Von der Leyen described Trump as a tough negotiator and said the 15% tariff applied “across the board,” later noting it was “the best we could get.” “We have a trade deal between the two largest economies in the world, and it’s a big deal. It will bring stability. It will bring predictability,” she said. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Both Chainlink and Ethereum have seen multi-million-dollar inflows from large holders, highlighting their role as favorites heading into 2025. Yet beyond these giants, investors are starting to talk about a rising name: MAGACOIN FINANCE . With fresh projections and bold community incentives, it is positioning itself as a contender for the best altcoin to buy now . Whale moves raise eyebrows in 2025 Whales have returned to the spotlight in 2025 with massive purchases that signal confidence in crypto’s future. One of the most striking examples came from Chainlink whales , where a major buyer scooped up 938,489 LINK tokens worth $21.23 million across five wallets. Using 4,806 ETH, the whale locked in an average of $22.62 per LINK, showing conviction at scale. X post by SharpLink Meanwhile, Ethereum whales are setting records of their own. SharpLink Gaming recently executed its largest Ethereum buy of the year, spending $601.5 million to acquire 143,593 ETH at $4,648 each. This pushed their treasury holdings to 740,760 ETH, worth more than $3 billion at the time. These moves show whales are preparing for a longer-term cycle. For investors wondering about the best crypto to buy now , watching how whales position their capital provides strong clues. With Ethereum and Chainlink at the center, both tokens remain among the top cryptos for 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE tipped for a Crypto Moonshot 2025 While the spotlight shines on whales, another project is gathering rapid attention: MAGACOIN FINANCE . Analysts are linking whale activity with broader excitement in new coins, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is already being called the best altcoin to buy now before demand explodes. What sets it apart is a bold projection — experts suggest MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver a 99x ROI heading into the 2025 bull run. Early buyers are already locking in their positions with a 50% EXTRA allocation using code PATRIOT50X , an incentive that rewards fast movers. This momentum has sparked conversations about whether MAGACOIN FINANCE could become the next crypto moonshot 2025 . With whales pumping liquidity into major coins like Ethereum and Chainlink, the spillover effect often benefits fresh projects. MAGACOIN FINANCE appears to be one of those breakout opportunities. One of the Best Crypto Presales of 2025 According to Analyst Reports MAGACOIN FINANCE is often featured in analyst watchlists as one of the top crypto presales for 2025 , and for good reason. The team’s commitment to full transparency — including public audits and KYC verification — builds unmatched trust. These fundamentals give investors peace of mind and separate the project from unverified alternatives in the market. A whale-driven cycle with new stars The takeaway from recent whale actions is clear: big buyers are setting the tone for 2025. Chainlink whales and Ethereum whales are reinforcing confidence in established names, while their presence creates room for rising stars to shine. For investors balancing security with growth potential, having exposure to established players like ETH and LINK makes sense. But adding a project such as MAGACOIN FINANCE — a coin already labeled one of the best cryptos to buy now — offers the chance for higher returns. With whale influence steering the cycle and MAGACOIN FINANCE positioned as one of the best altcoins to buy now , the mix of stability and growth could be the formula investors look for heading into 2025.

The Solana-based launchpad has taken more than 70% of market share and pulled in over $13 million in weekly revenue. Lifetime earnings just crossed $800 million. But while the platform is booming, many traders are rotating into tokens with stronger long-term potential. Analysts say XRP and MAGACOIN FINANCE are two of the biggest beneficiaries of this shift. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out is that it’s fully audited, safe, and backed by compliance—giving investors more confidence as they search for the best cryptos to buy now. XRP sees renewed interest On-chain data reveals that the bulk of the transaction inflow into XRP and MAGACOIN FINANCE has come from Pump Fun traders. Interestingly, this rotation comes at a time when Pump Fun is seeing positive energy, which signals that a bigger play is happening elsewhere. Following a strong summer, XRP is trading near $3.29. The majority of the price boost the token saw came from the conclusion of the long SEC case against Ripple. With the court giving the final confirmation of XRP’s securities status, both institutional and retail confidence have gone up. With $3.00 acting as a strong support level, XRP is being called one of the best cryptos to buy now for 2025. Investors show renewed confidence in MAGACOIN FINANCE Meanwhile, the capital infusion from Pump Fun traders appears not to be the only catalyst driving momentum in MAGACOIN FINANCE. An inflow of new investors in the project has also added to the excitement. On-chain data analysis reveals that a growing number of the earliest investors in the project are rapidly accumulating more tokens, especially as speculations of a price increase grow. This comes as analysts who track emerging tokens project gains of up to 5,000% for investors who buy MAGACOIN FINANCE before it lists on exchanges. As a result, many investors now believe the window to get into the project may be closing, and supply is running out fast. Analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE may be the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for investors who missed out on the early days of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. Right now, the project is earning multiple picks as the best crypto to buy now in 2025. Final take Pump Fun may dominate Solana’s launchpad market, but the real action is happening elsewhere. XRP offers utility and institutional adoption. MAGACOIN FINANCE provides early presale growth potential. For traders scanning the market for the best cryptos to buy now, these two tokens show how viral momentum can turn into opportunity.

JPMorgan says the wild swings have cooled off. At the start of 2025, Bitcoin’s volatility sat at 60%. Now it’s around 30%. That’s not just a stat for nerds, that drop could pull big institutional investors back into the space. The kind that dipped the hell out when Bitcoin kept acting like a drunk teenager. Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, a strategist at JPMorgan, said Thursday that if Bitcoin’s volatility keeps falling and starts to match more traditional assets like gold, then investment allocations could follow. “Expect that the allocations to Bitcoin by institutional investors could match those of competing asset classes such as gold if there is convergence in volatilities,” he wrote. Right now, that convergence is real. According to him, the gap between gold’s and Bitcoin’s volatility is “the lowest on record.” Corporate pullback helps tighten volatility There’s a reason this is happening. Over the past year, a lot of corporate treasurers have been yanking their Bitcoin out of circulation. That’s not some small event. According to JPMorgan, this “intense withdrawal” has had a real effect. More coins are being held passively. Less trading. Less panic selling. Less hype buying. That’s been working like a brake on the madness. These treasurers, mostly copycat versions of MicroStrategy, have actually grabbed more than 6% of Bitcoin’s entire supply. They’re also getting added into global equity indices. That gives them even more legitimacy and more eyes. JPMorgan says this trend is “helping to make Bitcoin more attractive from a valuation point of view.” It all comes back to risk. Panigirtzoglou explains it clearly: institutional investors don’t like throwing their cash at anything that sucks up too much risk capital. He said: “The reason is that, for most institutional investors, the volatility of each class matters in terms of portfolio risk management and the higher the volatility of an asset class, the higher the risk capital consumed by this asset class.” Translation: calmer coins mean more comfortable investors. Bitcoin’s current market cap sits at about $2.2 trillion. To match gold’s $5 trillion in private sector investment, but adjusted for volatility, Bitcoin would need to climb 13% from where it is now. That would push the price up to around $126,000. That number isn’t just pulled from thin air. It’s only a little above the record Bitcoin already set last weekend. Right now, though, Bitcoin’s price is lagging behind. Panigirtzoglou said, “The gap between the Bitcoin price and our volatility-adjusted comparison to gold shifted from highly positive territory at the end of 2024,” back when it was around $36,000, “to negative territory currently,” meaning the current price is roughly $16,000 too low. That’s a big gap. According to him, that gap means one thing: “some upside potential for Bitcoin currently.” As of Thursday, Bitcoin was trading about 10% lower than its recent all-time high.

That’s the core of a lawsuit Lisa filed this week in federal court, directly challenging the president’s legal authority to remove her from the Fed Board. The case doesn’t spend much time discussing whether she actually filled out the mortgage application wrong. Instead, it hammers the claim that even if she did mess up, it still doesn’t give Trump the legal right to fire her. One of the filings in Lisa’s lawsuit says the issue might have come from a paperwork mistake. Her legal team insists this does not rise to the level of “cause,” the only justification the Federal Reserve Act allows for firing a sitting board member. That term has no clear legal definition and might now have to be interpreted by the Supreme Court. Lisa says this entire mortgage fraud accusation is just a distraction meant to hide what’s really happening: a push by Trump to stack the Fed Board of Governors with people who will support his demand for rate cuts. Lisa’s lawyers say Trump has no legal basis The lawsuit calls the mortgage fraud claims “pretextual” and says they are based on conduct that allegedly happened before Lisa was even confirmed by the Senate. It argues that no federal agency has ever investigated or proven anything about the claim. “This allegation about conduct that predates Governor Cook’s Senate confirmation has never been investigated, much less proven,” her legal team wrote. “This allegation is not grounds for removal under the [Federal Reserve Act].” The complaint says even if a mistake was made, it wasn’t serious enough to meet the legal bar required to fire a Fed governor. Trump and Bill Pulte, who runs the Federal Housing Finance Agency, have accused Lisa of giving false information about where she lived when applying for federally insured mortgages. But her lawyer, Abbe Lowell, fired back in the complaint, saying that even if the president had tried to hide his real reason for firing her, the excuse he cooked up still doesn’t qualify as valid under the law. “Even if the President had been more careful in obscuring his real justification for targeting Governor Cook,” Abbe wrote, “the President’s concocted basis for removal, the unsubstantiated and unproven allegation that Governor Cook ‘potentially’ erred in filling out a mortgage form prior to her Senate confirmation, does not amount to ‘cause’ within the meaning of the FRA and is unsupported by caselaw.” The filing also points out that neither Trump nor Bill ever claimed Lisa benefited personally from the alleged clerical error, or that it was done intentionally. Her lawyers added, “Even if Governor Cook had committed the infractions that the President alleges, which she did not, the President would lack ‘cause’ to remove her.” Critics question silence as markets stay calm Bill responded in a statement to Scott Wapner of CNBC, saying, “In her filing, Ms. Cook does not deny that these are her mortgage documents, so one has to wonder why she, or [Fed Chair] Jerome Powell, would want this to be a part of the Federal Reserve, which is supposed to have preeminent integrity and which is critical to the safety and soundness of the U.S. Mortgage Market.” His statement questions why Lisa didn’t directly challenge the documents or give an explanation. While all of this unfolds, the markets have mostly brushed it off. But that could shift. Krishna Guha, who leads global policy research at Evercore ISI, warned that the legal drama is distracting from what he calls the “Trumpification” of the Fed. “We have no privileged knowledge of the legal facts,” Krishna said in a note this week, “but believe if it were established Cook committed even accidental mortgage misrepresentation, she would have to go.” If Trump gets his way and Stephen Miran is confirmed by the Senate to fill an open seat, he will hold a 4–3 majority on the Fed board.

The South Korean newspaper Hankook Ilbo reported that the Bank of Korea (BOK) chief Rhee Chang-yong said the payments would be made as part of a new “digital currency pilot project.” Rhee was speaking during a press conference held in central Seoul on August 28 following a Monetary Policy Committee meeting earlier in the day. South Korean CBDC: Back From the Dead? The move has come as something of a surprise in Seoul. The BOK announced in late June this year that it was putting CBDC testing on hold in favor of developing stablecoin -powered alternatives. Rhee said the subsidy move was part of the greater Han River Project, the country’s wider CBDC pilot. The Bank of Korea’s offices in Gwangju. (Source: Neoalpha) The media outlet said that the new CBDC move was the brainchild of the Ministry of Strategy and Finance. The ministry thinks that CBDC-powered subsidies will help prevent fraudulent use and improve fiscal policy efficiency. Rhee explained: “This is part of the second Han River Project pilot. Using digital fiat to pay subsidies will let principal contractors better manage subsidies when entering into agreements with subcontractors.” The BOK and the ministry plan to issue contractors with CBDC tokens instead of bank transfers or vouchers. The parties think that blockchain technology will help trace funds and ensure they are not being misused. Rhee added: “During his recent visit to the BOK, Koo Yun-cheol, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Strategy and Finance, said he thinks this will increase the efficiency and transparency of subsidy payments.” On August 22, Deputy Prime Minister Koo Yun Cheol attended the joint ministerial briefing on the new government’s economic growth strategy and delivered a statement at the Government Complex Seoul. pic.twitter.com/RfSVzp8o0n — MOEF – Korea (@moefkorea_eng) August 22, 2025 We Only Want to Work with Banks That Favor CBDC Biz, Says BOK The BOK was keen to point out that the new project would differ from the “first” pilot, which wrapped up in the first half of this year. While the first pilot focused largely on commercial banks and their customers, the subsidy-focused pilot will be private sector-led. Many of the banks that took part in the first pilot expressed their displeasure with CBDC launch plans. They complained that they thought it unfair that they should shoulder the burden of making infrastructure investment costs. But Rhee left the door open to the banking sector, suggesting the BOK is happy to partner with lenders who are still keen on CBDC business. The Governor said: “Considering the scale of the project, at 110 trillion won, I believe this be attractive for banks. We plan to focus on working with banks with a strong willingness to invest [in the project].” The South Korean won strengthened after Bank of Korea Governor defended its foreign exchange interventions as efforts to stem the decline and said it is part of talks with the US government https://t.co/jUTgYGUiNh — Bloomberg (@business) August 28, 2025 ‘Accelerated’ Plans Rhee also suggested that Seoul’s stablecoin pivot has not sounded the death knell for the BOK’s CBDC plans. Indeed, the Governor explained that once lawmakers have finalized the creation of new crypto and stablecoin legislation, the BOK plans to “accelerate” the Han River Project. Rhee said: “We have discussed upcoming [crypto and stablecoin] legislation with the ministry. The BOK has also exchanged practical opinions with the [regulatory] Financial Services Commission. We hope that the BOK’s views will be well-reflected in these deliberations.” The BOK has previously said that it wants to see a phased CBDC and stablecoin adaptation process. It wants this to begin with traditional financial institutions, such as banks. Institutions like these are that are subject to strict BOK supervision, Hankook Ilbo remarked. South Korean financial and crypto chiefs are growing restless, however. They have complained that progress on stablecoin legislation has “slowed to a standstill.” This is because lawmakers cannot agree on the matter of whether or not tech firms should be allowed to issue KRW-pegged stablecoins. Conservative voices have urged Seoul to restrict issuance to the commercial banking sector. But progressive opponents say such a move would stifle innovation.

It wasn’t because of a new cancer drug. The company said it would buy $100 million of Litecoin for its cash reserves. After that, the share price went from $3 to almost $7. What was odd is that the stock had already risen in the days before the news, even though there were no SEC filings, no press releases, and little social media talk. Other small-cap names also posted sharp gains shortly before unveiling plans to hold crypto in corporate treasuries, a pattern that raises the possibility that some market participants traded on information that wasn’t public. Today’s “crypto treasury” wave traces back to billionaire Michael Saylor. In 2020, the founder and chairman of Strategy, formerly called MicroStrategy, announced the software company would hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Investors began to treat the shares as a stand-in for Bitcoin’s price. Imitators soon emerged. A budget hotel operator in Japan started buying Bitcoin in 2024, and others followed. The pace accelerated this year. Since January, 184 listed companies have disclosed crypto purchases totaling almost $132 billion, according to Architect Partners, a crypto M&A advisory and financing firm. “We’ve kind of hit this point of saturation,” said Louis Camhi in a Fortune’s report .He added that investors are now watching to see whether those positions generate returns. Not all of the gains appear to be going to retail traders In several cases, stocks jumped just ahead of announcements. SharpLink , a marketing firm serving sportsbooks and casinos, traded under $3 through April and early May. On May 27, it said it would add $425 million in Ethereum, sending the shares to nearly $36. Yet in the three trading days before that news, the stock doubled from $3 to $6 despite no filings or press releases. U.S. rules governing “material non-public information” require tight controls . Outsiders granted access to sensitive details are typically “wall-crossed” and logged so regulators can trace who knew what. While crypto treasury deals can take months to assemble, the final marketing push often happens just before the announcement through brief investor roadshows. SharpLink met with investors across three days ahead of its shift; those same days coincided with the stock’s move. Mill City’s two-day outreach lined up with its jump as well. Insider-trading prohibitions cover more than corporate officers; they also extend to anyone who trades after receiving material tips, said Elisha Kobre, a partner at Sheppard Mullin and a former federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York. Who is benefiting remains unclear A handful of executives filed notices of grants or purchases before pivots, but most did not sell, SEC records show. Companies are trying to tighten processes to stop leaks. “It’s a bad look for everyone here,” said Camhi, urging quick fixes. Mackintosh said his team shortened investor outreach on a separate transaction to two trading days. Some firms went further. In late July, CEA Industries said it raised $500 million to hold BNB. To reduce pre-announcement trading, dealmakers withheld the company’s ticker during outreach and disclosed it to investors only on Friday night after markets closed on July 25, said CEO David Namdar. The company, now called BNB Network Company, aimed “to minimize the risk of leaks or volatility” before releasing news the following Monday. A week later, Verb Technology revealed a $558 million raise to hold TON and used the same approach, keeping its ticker back until after the Friday close, according to an investor who asked not to be named. Even with those steps, the stock rose nearly 60% in the four hours before the Monday announcement went live. Get seen where it counts.

Bitcoin Price Forecast – Technical Outlook Bitcoin trades near $112,300, testing the upper boundary of a descending channel. Resistance looms at $116,850, a level that has capped rallies since August. A breakout could unlock $120,900–$124,450. Momentum is firming. The RSI is at 55, recovering from oversold territory, while the MACD has turned bullish. Long lower wicks near $111,000 suggest dip buyers remain active, weakening bearish conviction. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview If BTC fails to stay above the 50-SMA at $111,563, downside risks extend toward $108,695 and $105,150. However, a confirmed breakout above $116,850 with strong volume would mark the first clean trend reversal in weeks. For traders, the playbook is clear: aggressive bulls may target $120K-$124K, cautious investors may wait for confirmation. With ETF inflows back and institutional backing growing, Bitcoin’s structure is tightening up and a breakout is near – one that could propel the long term run to $130K and beyond.

Solana and XRP have both made headlines with game-changing progress, but what’s really catching investor eyes right now is a brand-new meme coin presale — MAGACOIN FINANCE . Memecoins have consistently proven their ability to generate explosive gains when backed by strong communities and viral narratives. With Solana showing massive ecosystem growth and XRP finally securing long-awaited regulatory clarity, MAGACOIN FINANCE emerges as the best crypto presale set to ride the wave of retail excitement. Solana: Strength in DeFi, Institutions, and Memecoins Solana (SOL) has maintained its reputation as one of the most powerful blockchain ecosystems. Currently trading between $186–$202 , SOL is testing the critical $200 level after pulling back from resistance near $213–$215. According to analysts, the area from $210 to $220 will be the next important level that the price will break through, and it could reach the range of $250 to $270 if the rate of movement gets higher.4 What’s fueling this momentum? DeFi Expansion: Solana’s DeFi TVL has soared to $11.3 billion , marking a 30% quarterly increase and positioning Solana as the second-largest DeFi chain after Ethereum. Kamino Finance alone contributed nearly $2 billion in locked value. Institutional Demand: Major players like Pantera Capital, Galaxy Digital, and Jump Crypto are raising over $2 billion combined for Solana treasury funds. This level of institutional backing cements Solana’s credibility. ETF & Regulatory Progress: With a Solana ETF decision due by October 16, 2025 , confidence for approval stands at 95%. The REX Shares Solana Staking ETF has already surpassed $150 million AUM , reflecting strong demand. Memecoin Ecosystem: Solana continues to dominate memecoin activity, with projects like Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) and Dogwifhat (WIF) leading multibillion-dollar markets. Solana’s combination of scalability, institutional adoption, and memecoin culture makes it a strong growth leader in Q4. XRP: Regulatory Clarity and Institutional Breakthroughs For XRP, 2025 will be remembered as the year of ultimate clarity. On August 8, 2025 , Ripple and the SEC officially ended their long-running lawsuit, confirming XRP is not a security in secondary market transactions. This ruling immediately boosted institutional confidence, putting XRP in the same legal category as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Key bullish developments for XRP include: ETF Applications: Seven major asset managers, including Grayscale and Franklin Templeton, updated their XRP ETF filings on August 22, 2025 . Analysts believe approval odds are now above 95%, with mid-October as the decision deadline. Price Growth: XRP is currently trading near $2.93–$2.95 , up almost 400% YTD from Q4 2024 lows. Analysts project year-end targets of $3.70–$5.50 . Utility Expansion: Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service is processing $15 billion annually , while the new Gemini XRP Credit Card offers up to 4% cashback in XRP. Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin is also gaining traction globally, particularly in Japan. With legal clarity, ETF momentum, and real-world utility , XRP is entering a golden era of growth and adoption. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Meme Coin That Could Outshine Them All While Solana and XRP continue to dominate institutional headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is making waves in the retail sector. Riding on the unstoppable force of memecoins, MAGACOIN FINANCE combines viral community culture with real DeFi utility — a powerful formula for exponential growth. Like DOGE and SHIB in past cycles, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building a grassroots movement with strong meme energy designed to attract retail attention.This makes MAGA the best crypto presale for long-term holders. MAGACOIN FINANCE successfully completed a full smart contract audit by HashEx, passing with no problems. This clear approval has boosted investor confidence, showing that the project is safe and reliable. With strong foundations in place, the audit adds another layer of trust to MAGACOIN FINANCE’s growing reputation. With Solana leading memecoin trading activity and XRP unlocking new liquidity via ETFs, the timing couldn’t be better for a fresh meme coin narrative. Traders have also started adopting the PATRIOT50X code as a way to secure a 50% bonus. If history repeats itself, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the next skyrocketing token that defines Q4 2025’s retail bull run. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is One of the Best Crypto Presales to Buy in 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining recognition as one of the best crypto presales to buy in 2025 thanks to its focus on long-term investor safety and transparency . The project’s smart contract has been audited by Hashex , reinforcing trust in its code and structure. Combined with a fully KYC-verified team and growing investor traction, MAGACOIN FINANCE is not just trending — it’s being built to last. Final Thoughts: Best Crypto Presale to Watch The cryptocurrency environment in the 4th quarter of 2025 has a multitude of opportunities to explore: Solana is positioned for further institutional adoption and DeFi growth. XRP has finally achieved clarity, unlocking massive institutional inflows. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands at the intersection of meme power and early presale hype — giving investors a shot at outsized gains. With Solana and XRP paving the way for mainstream adoption, the MAGACOIN FINANCE presale represents the most exciting entry point for investors who want exposure to the next big meme coin success story.

50837901,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=195910,1756425310,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/50837901.jpeg,Crucial Stablecoin Regulation: Fed Governor Waller Sees a Good Starting Point,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/stablecoin-regulation-waller-fed/,"BitcoinWorld Crucial Stablecoin Regulation: Fed Governor Waller Sees a Good Starting Point The world of digital finance is constantly evolving, and at its heart are discussions around how to ensure stability and trust. Recently, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller, a key voice in financial policy, offered a significant perspective on the future of cryptocurrencies, specifically concerning stablecoin regulation . He described a proposed U.S. stablecoin bill, known as the GENIUS Act, as a “good starting point.” This sentiment signals a positive, albeit incremental, path forward for digital assets in the mainstream financial system. Why is Effective Stablecoin Regulation So Important Right Now? You might be wondering, what exactly are stablecoins, and why do regulators like Governor Waller care so much about them? Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar. This stability makes them a crucial bridge between the volatile crypto market and traditional finance. However, their growing popularity also brings potential risks. If a stablecoin were to lose its peg or face a significant liquidity crisis, it could have broader implications for the financial system. Therefore, clear and robust stablecoin regulation is seen as essential for protecting consumers, preventing illicit activities, and ensuring overall financial stability. What Does “Good Starting Point” Really Mean for Stablecoins? When Governor Waller stated the GENIUS Act is a “good starting point,” he implied that while the current proposal is a strong foundation, it’s likely not the final word on the matter. This perspective suggests an adaptive and evolving approach to policy-making. Regulators understand that the digital asset space is dynamic, and legislation needs to be flexible enough to address future innovations and challenges. Here are some key aspects of this incremental approach: Building Consensus: It allows various stakeholders – from lawmakers to industry experts – to refine the rules. Learning and Adapting: As the market matures, regulations can be updated to reflect new realities. Ensuring Robustness: Incremental steps help create comprehensive and resilient regulatory frameworks. This careful consideration aims to foster innovation while mitigating risks, a delicate balance in the rapidly advancing crypto sector. The goal is to ensure that stablecoin regulation supports growth rather than stifles it. Navigating the Challenges of Effective Stablecoin Regulation While the prospect of clearer stablecoin regulation is generally welcomed, crafting effective policy is not without its hurdles. One major challenge involves balancing strict oversight with the need to allow for technological innovation. Overly restrictive rules could push development offshore or stifle the very benefits stablecoins can offer, such as faster, cheaper payments. Other challenges include: Jurisdictional Issues: Cryptocurrencies operate globally, making it complex to enforce national regulations. Defining Scope: Deciding which entities fall under which regulatory umbrella (e.g., banks, money transmitters). Technological Nuances: Understanding the underlying blockchain technology to create appropriate rules. Addressing these complexities requires ongoing dialogue and collaboration between regulators, industry leaders, and technical experts. The aim is to create a regulatory environment that promotes safety and soundness without hindering progress. Governor Waller’s comments underscore a measured and pragmatic approach by the Federal Reserve. It signals that policymakers are actively engaged in understanding and shaping the future of digital currencies. This ongoing effort to establish clear stablecoin regulation is vital for the broader acceptance and integration of digital assets into the global financial ecosystem. As these issues are addressed incrementally, we can anticipate a more defined and secure landscape for stablecoins. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly are stablecoins? Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to minimize price volatility. They achieve this by pegging their value to a stable asset, such as the U.S. dollar, gold, or other fiat currencies, often through reserves. Why is the Federal Reserve interested in stablecoin regulation? The Federal Reserve is concerned about financial stability and consumer protection. As stablecoins grow in popularity and usage, they could pose systemic risks if not properly regulated, similar to traditional financial instruments. What is the GENIUS Act? The GENIUS Act is a proposed piece of U.S. legislation aimed at creating a regulatory framework specifically for stablecoins. It seeks to define stablecoins, establish oversight, and ensure their stability and transparency. How might stablecoin regulation affect me as a crypto user? Effective stablecoin regulation could lead to increased trust and security when using stablecoins. It might also introduce new requirements for stablecoin issuers, potentially affecting how you acquire or redeem them, but ultimately aiming for a safer environment. What are the next steps for stablecoin regulation in the U.S.? Following discussions like Governor Waller’s, the GENIUS Act or similar proposals will likely undergo further debate and amendments in Congress. The process typically involves legislative review, committee hearings, and potential votes, leading to the eventual establishment of new laws or guidelines. Did you find this article insightful?

Experts think that these tokens could go up by as much as 2500% in this bull cycle. Cronos has just broken out with a lot of strength, and a new Layer 2 memecoin called Layer Brett is getting a lot of attention in its presale. In this article, we look at recent changes in the Bitcoin price while some whales are investing significantly in Cronos and Layer Brett. Bitcoin Tests Support Amid Pullback The Bitcoin price has dropped more than 2% over the past week, going below $110,000. The Bitcoin price chart has been displaying lower lows and lower highs since mid-August, which is a hint of a bearish structure after losing its last trendline support. Traders are being careful because the Bitcoin price is having trouble keeping its bullish momentum. Nonetheless, many are keeping a close eye on the next major rise. Even when the Bitcoin price seems bearish in the short term, macro indications are still strong. The global M2 money supply is growing at a record rate, and Bitcoin has always gone up a lot after such expansion. The next four months could be very important, but there is usually a 12-week delay. As more money flows into risky assets, experts think the Bitcoin price might rise to between $180,000 and $220,000 in this cycle. Layer Brett: Meme Energy Meets Real Utility Layer Brett is made to turn meme culture into genuine blockchain power. This project is made for speed, scale, and incentives, unlike the first Brett, which had no use. Layer Brett is fully interoperable and will make it easy for users and developers to move across chains without any problems. It’s easy to set up: just connect your wallet, pick a payment token, buy $LBRETT, and start staking right away. Layer Brett’s Layer 2 design decreases expenses down to cents, while Ethereum gas fees are generally between $10 and $20. The presale for $LBRETT is going on right now for $0.005; however, the price will go up soon. The project has already raised more than $1.5 million within a few weeks, which shows that there is a lot of investor interest. At launch, people will be able to claim tokens through the official site, and they can stake them right away to get incentives. The project combines viral culture with a clear roadmap of social contests, engagement campaigns, and growth incentives. Layer Brett is making its own way by competing with Layer 2 leaders like Optimism, Arbitrum, and zkSync. Many people think it’s one of the best cryptos to buy before the presale ends. Cronos and Layer Brett Set To Yield More Gains Than Bitcoin The Bitcoin price may be testing support, but smart investors are already shifting into assets that are likely to grow quickly. Cronos has been recently strongly bullish, but Layer Brett has taken the focus with its tremendous presale momentum. For only $0.005, $LBRETT gives investors a rare chance to get in on a Layer 2 project that combines meme energy with genuine blockchain use. Prices are going up in the presale, and the project has already raised over $1.5 million. If you wait, you could miss out on gains that could change your life. Don’t miss out—join the Layer Brett presale today to make sure you grab your spot before the next price increase.

Traders are closely watching both, but another project is drawing even more attention: BlockDAG (BDAG). Unlike meme-driven rallies or oracle-focused moves, BlockDAG is built to appeal to large-scale financial adoption. Its hybrid design combines DAG scalability with Proof-of-Work security, enabling 15,000 TPS, which is the type of performance needed for global payments and enterprise networks. The focus now is on what happens if institutions start using BDAG. Large capital inflows could change its price outlook quickly. That is why projections around $7 are gaining traction for 2025. With over $386 million already raised, BDAG is turning heads and setting the stage for long-term momentum. BlockDAG on Road to $7: Presale Crosses $386M! The key factor behind BlockDAG’s growing attention is its ability to meet institutional standards. The hybrid DAG plus Proof-of-Work setup delivers 15,000 TPS with strong security, making it a real option for enterprise payments and financial services. That level of throughput is more than a technical talking point; it is the kind of infrastructure that large banks and payment firms demand. If these players start to adopt BDAG, the liquidity moving in could quickly push it toward that $7 target. The presale itself is a strong indicator of traction. BlockDAG has already raised more than $386 million, selling over 25.5 billion coins across 30 batches. The current presale price is $0.03, and batch one buyers are already looking at paper returns of about 2,900%. Miner sales have added another $7.8 million, with more than 19,400 units sold, building a community that extends beyond just coin holders. Market projections suggest BDAG could list at $0.05, with potential paths toward $1 by 2027 and $5 by 2030. With institutional adoption added to the mix, the $7 forecast starts to look far more realistic than speculative. The presale’s structure adds another layer of urgency, as each batch increase tightens access and rewards early buyers. Combined with confirmed listings on MEXC, LBank, and BitMart, BlockDAG is positioning itself as one of the strongest entries of 2025. For those looking at long-term upside, BDAG’s blend of technology and adoption drivers makes it a prime candidate. Shiba Inu Bearish Momentum Persists The Shiba Inu price chart is flashing clear signs of weakness. A Death Cross confirmed on August 20 has weighed heavily, with SHIB sliding below its 20-day moving average and now testing support near $0.00001252. If this breaks, the next likely zone is $0.0000118. On-chain signals are also negative, with the burn rate collapsing by more than 98% in a single day, showing supply cuts have lost traction. Daily declines of around 0.6% and a 17% drop over the past month point to bearish momentum, while volume has dropped by more than 24%, suggesting thinning participation. Indicators like MACD and Parabolic SAR also align to the downside. Without a clear reversal or stronger support, Shiba Inu remains under pressure, and short-term forecasts lean toward more weakness before stability returns. Chainlink Bullish Momentum Builds Toward $30 Chainlink has shown the opposite trend, with price momentum turning positive. LINK has climbed near $27, and a Golden Cross on August 22, where the 5-day average crossed above the 20-day, confirmed the bullish setup. Analysts are watching short-term targets at $30, with possible moves to $33.75 and even $50 if resistance breaks. Backing this rally, whale accumulation has surged, with over $1.2 billion moved into cold storage in just a week. This aligns with trading sentiment, as the Fear & Greed Index at 68 reflects strong confidence. Volume has tripled in recent days, showing broad support. Technical indicators across multiple timeframes are also positive. Unless LINK drops below $21, the outlook remains bullish, with near-term breakout potential backed by both on-chain and market signals. Final Thoughts Shiba Inu is locked in bearish momentum, with technicals and on-chain data pointing to weakness. Chainlink is moving in the opposite direction, with bullish signals suggesting a breakout toward $30 and beyond. These two examples highlight how quickly sentiment can flip in the market. But the bigger story lies with BlockDAG. Its 15,000 TPS network, $386 million raised, and over 25.5 billion coins sold show both scale and adoption. With miner sales passing $7.8 million and over 19,400 units sold, BDAG has traction across multiple fronts. If institutions embrace it, the $7 projection shifts from speculation to a real possibility. This mix of strong tech, presale momentum, and adoption potential is why many are calling BDAG the best crypto to watch for 2025.

50838082,https://timestabloid.com/?p=80654,1756425645,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Solana Price Prediction 2025 — Analysts Call $1,000 Target One of the Best Long-Term Crypto Bets",https://timestabloid.com/solana-price-prediction-2025-analysts-call-1000-target/,"Solana’s network growth is once again in the spotlight, but analysts and traders are also paying attention to MAGACOIN FINANCE , a legitimate project that combines meme appeal with security-first infrastructure. With Solana forecasts soaring, some investors are weighing whether new altcoins like MAGACOIN can deliver even greater upside. Solana’s DeFi Ecosystem Hits New Highs Solana’s DeFi ecosystem has seen a dramatic surge in activity during 2025. Reports confirm its total value locked (TVL) jumped 30.4% in Q2 to $8.6 billion, reaching multi-year highs. By March, the figure climbed to $13 billion, highlighting a recovery that pushed Solana to the second-largest position in the DeFi sector. Alongside this TVL growth, Solana’s DEX volume reached $100 billion in March alone, eclipsing many rival networks. By April, that number hit $107 billion, doubling year-over-year. Solana teams also captured 57% of all dApp revenue, showing just how much of the activity was staying inside its ecosystem. For many traders, this backdrop has renewed confidence in Solana’s longer-term price trajectory. Institutional Backing and Technology Upgrades Institutional interest is also reshaping Solana’s outlook. VanEck projects the token could hit $520 by year-end 2025, while JPMorgan recently raised its own target to $500. A major driver here is the growing likelihood of a Solana spot ETF approval, which analysts place at around 85%. At the same time, developments like Visa integration, along with Firedancer and Alpenglow upgrades, are expected to expand efficiency and attract new users. Analysts suggest these advancements could fuel adoption at a scale comparable to Ethereum’s earlier cycles. With this foundation, price forecasts from Finbold and others range from $520 to as high as $1,500, with some traders eyeing the round number target of $1,000. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Security, ROI, and Missed Opportunities While Solana gains headlines, traders are also noticing MAGACOIN FINANCE . The altcoin is currently trading under $0.0005 and has already established itself as a legitimate project through security audits and verified transparency. For early entrants, the math is simple: even a move toward $0.02 would represent around a 40x return. This type of upside draws parallels to stories of investors who missed early entries into Solana before it became a household name. But unlike meme coins with no structure, MAGACOIN emphasizes trust with its audited smart contract , community ownership, and KYC-verified team . For traders, it blends relatability with credibility, making it more than just another trend coin. The question many are asking is whether passing on MAGACOIN now could feel like missing Solana at $1 in hindsight. Analysts Rank MAGACOIN FINANCE a Leading Crypto Presale for 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE is often featured in analyst watchlists as one of the top crypto presales for 2025, and for good reason. The team’s commitment to full transparency — including public audits and KYC verification — builds unmatched trust. These fundamentals give investors peace of mind and separate the project from unverified alternatives in the market. Conclusion: How to Position in This Market Solana’s 2025 forecasts suggest it could climb into four figures if institutional demand stays strong. At the same time, altcoins like MAGACOIN present early-stage entry points with audited security and clear upside math. For traders who want to balance established plays with new opportunities, this may be the time to act.

50838046,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=811508,1756425654,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/50838046.jpeg,Crypto Bull Run Dead? Analyst Says The Real Top Isn’t Here Yet,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-bull-run-dead-real-top-isnt-here-yet/,"Top analyst Miles Deutscher says the crypto market’s apparent fatigue is being misread. In a new video titled “Why The Crypto Bull Run Is Far From Over (Data Says This Happens Next),” the commentator—who has more than 630,000 followers on X—argues that both macro and market-structure signals point to an extended cycle, with Ethereum poised to lead even if Bitcoin cools. Crypto Cycle Dead? Deutscher opens by cutting against a swelling narrative that Bitcoin “has potentially put in a top,” acknowledging that spot price action “objectively looks quite weak at the moment.” Yet, he stresses, “I don’t believe the cycle is over,” and lays out what he considers the telltale sign of a real top—one that he says has not materialized. On the shorter time frame, he notes BTC slipped below a channel low but is attempting to reclaim the mid-range, highlighting a near-term “bearish retest at the H4 money noodle.” He calls the $111.5k area a line in the sand, with a push and hold back above ~$114k needed to repair structure. For clarity, he describes his “noodle” as a custom moving-average style trend gauge: “just our custom indicator which is basically a moving average.” Where Bitcoin looks “a little bit toppy,” Deutscher says Ethereum’s daily structure “paints a very different picture.” ETH, he argues, is showing a classic compression beneath major resistance around its prior all-time high while “grinding above the money noodle,” a configuration he believes sets up “the next expansive leg to the upside” if the daily trend base is maintained. Related Reading: Nearly $1B Wiped Out in Crypto Liquidations: Are Whales Turning the Crash Into a Buying Opportunity? A central plank of his thesis is the cycle’s alignment with broader risk indicators. Reading from a post by trader Nik (@cointradernik), he underscores that several risk-on ratios look like they are bottoming, not topping—US micro caps versus small caps, emerging markets versus the FTSE 100, ARK-style growth versus gold—suggesting the business cycle is still advancing rather than rolling over. In that context, Deutscher contends it would be unusual for crypto to peak now unless it consciously decoupled from equities. He further frames a policy backdrop he sees as supportive, pointing to political rhetoric favorable to crypto assets and the prospect of rate cuts later this year; he characterizes the current market “jitteriness” as a function of timing uncertainty rather than a structural turn. Related Reading: This Altcoin Is A 12,500% Crypto Bet Until 2028, Says Arthur Hayes He also revisits Bitcoin’s higher-time-frame rhythm since 2023 as a sequence of “rally-base-rally” phases with recurring retests of a weekly trend marker. In that pattern, he argues, even a drop toward ~$100,000 would be a textbook bull-market pullback, not a terminal break, especially given what he calls today’s comparatively modest extension above long-term averages versus 2021 and late-2024. “Anyone whose view is that Bitcoin has topped for the cycle here at $124,000 will be deeply disappointed in the relative shallowness of this correction,” he says, asserting that distance to key moving averages leaves less room for a deep retrace. The Altcoin Rotation The most controversial—and for crypto traders, arguably the most consequential—part of Deutscher’s analysis is historical altcoin rotation. He says prior cycles show that Ethereum often does its strongest work after Bitcoin tops. “In 2017 Bitcoin topped and traded 47% lower as Ethereum rallied 100% higher in the next 30 days,” he claims. “In 2021, Bitcoin topped [and] went 27% lower as ETH rallied…83% higher in the next 30 days.” While he is not declaring a BTC top now, he argues the crypto market is already exhibiting a “decoupling” in which ETH and other altcoins are grinding higher against BTC even as Bitcoin softens—proof, in his view, that “using Bitcoin as your ultimate bull-market indicator” for alts can be misleading when Ethereum’s structure is this strong. That view informs his positioning. Rather than longing Bitcoin at support, he says he’s increasingly using BTC dips as “confluence to take a trade on Ethereum because I think Ethereum outperforms from here on out.” On camera, he disclosed a growing ETH long in a public “fun trading account,” while emphasizing that “most people would be better off sticking mostly to spot” and that any use of leverage should be small, deliberate and within strict risk parameters. “There were many times where I’ve screwed up by being over-leveraged,” he cautions. Beyond trade setup and crypto cycle theory, Deutscher returns to his original premise: a genuine cycle top generally coincides with a topping business cycle, deteriorating breadth in risk assets, and blow-off dynamics he says are absent today. Summarizing his stance, he concludes that neither Bitcoin nor altcoins have topped “due to where we are in the business cycle,” and even if BTC does mark a high sooner than he expects, “I wouldn’t necessarily take that as the ultimate bear signal for ETH and alts.” At press time, BTC traded at $113,028.

50840157,568083,1756425659,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50840157.jpeg,"115 DeFi, Crypto Companies Tell Senate: Protect Developers Or No Deal On Market Bill",https://bitcoinist.com/115-defi-crypto-companies-tell-senate-protect-developers-or-no-deal-on-market-bill/,"A broad coalition of crypto builders, investors and advocates has asked two Senate committees for clear federal rules to protect software creators and non-custodial service providers working on blockchain networks. According to the letter , 115 groups signed the appeal to the Senate Committee on Banking and the Committee on Agriculture, and they made one demand plain: without explicit protections, they will not back market structure legislation. Call For Federal Protections The signers want lawmakers to make it clear that writing, publishing, or maintaining open-source blockchain software is not the same as running a bank or exchange. Reports have disclosed concerns that developers could be treated as financial intermediaries even when they never hold user funds. The letter asks Congress to shield developers from being prosecuted or misclassified under laws such as 18 U.S.C. § 1960. It also asks that any federal law preempt conflicting state rules so companies and contributors are not left juggling 50 different legal standards. Bills Praised But Not Enough According to the coalition, drafts in both chambers already include two measures that move in the right direction: the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act and the Keep Your Coins Act. But the groups argue those drafts fall short on some points and need clearer, stronger language. Based on reports from the signers, the protections must be explicit and nationwide, not partial or open to varying state interpretations. Without that clarity, the letter warns, developers may choose to work elsewhere. Developer Loss And Talent Flight The group cited data showing a slide in the share of open-source developers based in the US, from 25% in 2021 to 18% in 2025. According to a recent report by the President’s Working Group on Digital Assets , reversing that decline is central to making America a leading hub for blockchain work. The signers say those numbers show how regulatory uncertainty can change where people live and where code is built. Legal Clarity As A Business Need The coalition argues that clear rules are also a practical business need. When the legal line between building software and operating financial services blurs, companies and contributors face possible legal exposure. That creates a cost for startups and volunteers alike. If developers face the risk of civil or criminal action for routine open-source work, projects can slow or stop. The letter asks Congress to state plainly that creating interfaces or tools that let people self-custody their funds is not, by itself, an activity that should trigger money-transmitter rules. Bipartisan Support And Next Steps Signers pointed to past bipartisan moves to protect developers. They noted that 294 members of Congress supported the CLARITY Act when it passed, signaling broad backing for basic safeguards. Based on the letter, the groups want the Senate to strengthen those protections now, and to do so in a way that covers all states uniformly.

While established tokens often get the most attention from analysts, MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the emerging contenders gaining traction and popularity in the market. Why? Analysts tracking MAGACOIN FINANCE say it is one of the rare early-stage projects that combines strong security and a safe environment, making it one of the standout choices. Here are seven altcoins that investors and analysts are closely watching. 1. Bitcoin (BTC) — Still the Market Leader Bitcoin’s price continues to see volatile movement, which is not surprising considering that the token has experienced multiple rallies in 2025. With the recent pullback taking its price to around $110K, analysts have spotlighted the drop as a chance for smart investors to buy low before prices rise again. 2. Chainlink (LINK) — Oracles Driving Growth Chainlink has become a top pick thanks to new partnerships with ICE and Mastercard, plus its buyback program, reducing supply. LINK broke past $26 for the first time in seven months, making it one of the top altcoins 2025 for long-term DeFi adoption. 3. AAVE — Multi-Chain Liquidity Expansion AAVE jumped nearly 19% to $355 after launching on the Aptos blockchain, marking its first move beyond Ethereum. With a $1.5 billion liquidity fund and V4 upgrades in progress, AAVE is strengthening its role as DeFi’s liquidity backbone. Analysts are watching the $400 mark as the next big milestone. 4. Arbitrum (ARB) — Scaling Ethereum’s Future Arbitrum continues to lead Ethereum scaling, rolling out instant cross-rollup access and supporting more than 900 dApps. Its recent Robinhood listing added fuel, positioning ARB as a critical player in Ethereum’s growing layer-2 ecosystem. 5. Polkadot (DOT) — Building for the Long Term Polkadot remains in focus with upgrades like Elastic Scaling and parachain adoption. While DOT trades around $4, forecasts point toward $7–$8 by 2026 if ecosystem growth accelerates. Developers and institutions alike are watching Polkadot 2.0 closely. 6. Avalanche (AVAX) — Institutional and Public-Sector Adoption Avalanche is gaining traction with hedge fund tokenization and Wyoming’s new stablecoin launch. Technical upgrades like the Octane hard fork cut fees by 96%, while ETF filings suggest stronger institutional demand ahead. A breakout above $25 could signal a bullish run. 7. MAGACOIN FINANCE — The Rising Ethereum Gem With attention turning away from big names, MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the few emerging contenders earning a spot on analysts’ watchlists. Market conditions show the project is set to benefit from the capital rotating from leading tokens into smaller high-potential projects. While analysts often caution investors about early-stage projects, experts say MAGACOIN FINANCE is different, highlighting the trust, safety, and growing confidence in the project. Added to that is the 5x return early investors can make on their investments. Such high-potential opportunities are rare, and that is why MAGACOIN FINANCE is the name on every analyst’s list as the best altcoin to buy in 2025. Analysts Say MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Among the Best Altcoins to Buy in 2025 Analysts consistently rank MAGACOIN FINANCE among the best altcoins to buy in 2025 for one key reason: long-term potential . The project is gaining momentum with thousands of early investors , strong social growth, and a transparent development roadmap . It’s the kind of asset seasoned buyers watch before the next bull market cycle kicks off. Bottom Line Opportunities in the cryptocurrency market emerge in every cycle. However, what makes the difference is those investors who get on the projects before the rest of the market does. Right now, this list of tokens represents the best altcoins to buy now. From proven leaders to an emerging contender like MAGACOIN FINANCE that is drawing in thousands of investors daily, 2025 is shaping up to be a year of both stability and bold innovation.

The city has also pursued onerous regulations to rein in the dealings of digital assets to protect investors and control financial risks. The two-day event attracted more than 17,000 ticket registrations, nearly three times last year’s attendance, revealing the meteoric development of Asia’s crypto society. It’s expected that around 15,000 fans will attend — making it the second biggest Bitcoin-focused event on the planet. The right-wing Goethel men have said that the event’s star speaker would be Eric Trump, the son of U.S. President Donald Trump. He commanded attention with his appearance, but he prompted some late withdrawals, too. Eric Yip Chee-hang, executive director of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), and Johnny Ng Kit-ch, a pro-Beijing lawmaker, withdrew from the panel. Officials reportedly recommended they steer clear of Eric Trump amid ongoing political sensitivities. While the pullbacks, Bitcoin Asia is also a platform for regulators, entrepreneurs, and crypto firms to debate the tension between innovation and supervision. Speakers push treasury use and tighter regulation One of the main themes of this year’s Bitcoin Asia 2025 conference is how digital asset treasuries can mature beyond token-bag-holding into a healthier financial ecology. Abel Seow, head of APAC and managing director of BitGo, said companies should view their treasuries as more than passive storage for crypto assets. He explained that firms should use these resources to drive innovation and build sustainable markets. Seow noted that while many companies were still focused on accumulating tokens, the next stage would involve creating ecosystems that attract institutional investors and strengthen trust in crypto. Clarence Shen, a fintech policy manager at the SFC, said Hong Kong aimed to be at the forefront of setting global rules for digital assets. He explained that the city had actively engaged in multilateral and bilateral discussions with regulators. According to him, Hong Kong should take part in these efforts and act as an active writer of the global rulebook. Other speakers concurred with the sentiment that regulation is now the heart of where crypto is going. With the United States and Europe already establishing new benchmarks, many believe Asia — particularly Hong Kong — will be the next front in a global race to harmonize rules for the world of cryptotrading. Hong Kong chases stablecoin rules on its crypto dreams The Bitcoin Asia 2025 conference followed one of the most significant new laws that Hong Kong has introduced in months. On May 21, 2025, the city introduced the stablecoin law , which would have required the operators of Hong Kong dollar-backed stablecoins to be licensed by the HKMA. The law imposes strict rules on reserves, redemption rights, and risk management. The ordinance reflects Hong Kong’s efforts to ensure protection for investors while instilling trust in its financial system. But it has also dampened some initial excitement, as companies contend with higher compliance costs and limits on issuing or marketing stablecoins without the appropriate licenses. In February 2025, the SFC also looked at rules on crypto derivatives and margin financing for professional investors. Hong Kong has granted nine licenses for digital asset trading, with eight more applications under review. The measures are part of the city’s balancing act between wooing international investment in crypto and hedging systemic risks in its financial system. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Today, a staggering Bitcoin options expiration event is set to unfold, involving contracts worth an immense $11.6 billion. This isn’t just a big number; it represents a moment where market dynamics could shift, influencing how Bitcoin and even Ethereum perform in the short term. Understanding these events is crucial for navigating the evolving digital asset landscape. What Exactly is Bitcoin Options Expiration, Anyway? You might be wondering, what exactly happens when options expire? Simply put, a crypto option is a contract that gives a buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) a cryptocurrency at a specific price on or before a certain date. When that date arrives, the options either get exercised, or they expire worthless. Today, at 8:00 a.m. UTC on August 29, we’re seeing a massive expiry. Data from the leading crypto options exchange, Deribit, indicates that $11.57 billion in Bitcoin options are reaching their maturity. Alongside this, Ethereum options valued at $3.13 billion will also expire, adding another layer of intrigue to the market. This simultaneous Bitcoin options expiration and Ethereum event makes it particularly noteworthy. Understanding the Numbers: Put/Call Ratio and Max Pain These large-scale expirations come with some important metrics that traders and analysts closely watch. Let’s break them down: Put/Call Ratio: For the Bitcoin options expiration, this ratio stands at 0.78. This number tells us the volume of put options (bets on price going down) compared to call options (bets on price going up). A ratio below 1, like 0.78, generally suggests that more call options are open than put options, indicating a slightly bullish or neutral sentiment among options traders. For Ethereum, the ratio is 0.77, signaling a similar sentiment. Max Pain Price: This is a fascinating concept. For Bitcoin, the max pain price is $115,000. For Ethereum, it’s $3,800. The max pain price is the strike price at which the largest number of open options contracts (both puts and calls) will expire worthless. In essence, it’s the price point that causes the maximum financial loss for options holders, and conversely, the maximum gain for options sellers (often market makers). While not a guaranteed price target, markets sometimes gravitate towards this level as the expiration approaches. How Might This Bitcoin Options Expiration Impact the Market? Large options expirations, especially those involving significant notional values like today’s Bitcoin options expiration , can introduce volatility into the market. Here’s why: Hedging Activities: Options sellers, or market makers, often hedge their positions by buying or selling the underlying asset (Bitcoin or Ethereum). As expiration nears, they might adjust these hedges, leading to increased buying or selling pressure. Price Discovery: The ""max pain"" theory suggests that the price of the underlying asset might gravitate towards the max pain point. While this isn’t a hard rule, it’s a phenomenon many traders observe. Sentiment Shift: The outcome of the expiration – whether many calls or puts expire in the money – can influence overall market sentiment for the coming days. It’s important to remember that while these events can create short-term fluctuations, the broader market trend is influenced by many factors, including macroeconomic news, regulatory developments, and institutional adoption. Therefore, while significant, the Bitcoin options expiration is one piece of a larger puzzle. Navigating the Volatility: What Should Investors Consider? With such a substantial Bitcoin options expiration , prudent investors and traders might consider a few things: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on real-time price action around the 8:00 a.m. UTC expiration time. Volatility can be swift. Risk Management: If you are actively trading, ensure your risk management strategies are in place, such as setting stop-loss orders. Protect your capital from unexpected swings. Long-Term Perspective: For long-term holders, these short-term volatility events are often just noise. Focus on your investment thesis rather than daily price swings. Today’s event highlights the growing maturity and complexity of the cryptocurrency derivatives market. As more sophisticated financial instruments become available, understanding their impact becomes crucial for all participants. The ongoing development of this market brings both opportunities and challenges. Conclusion: A Day of Anticipation for Crypto Markets The expiration of $11.6 billion in Bitcoin options and $3.13 billion in Ethereum options today marks a significant moment for the crypto derivatives landscape. While it doesn’t guarantee dramatic price movements, it certainly sets the stage for potential short-term volatility and increased market activity. Keeping an eye on the put/call ratios and max pain prices offers valuable insights into the prevailing market sentiment. As always, informed decision-making and robust risk management are your best allies in navigating these exciting market events, especially around a major Bitcoin options expiration . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a Bitcoin options expiration? It’s the specific date and time when Bitcoin options contracts cease to be valid. At this point, holders must decide whether to exercise their right to buy or sell Bitcoin, or let the options expire worthless. 2. What is the significance of the put/call ratio? The put/call ratio indicates the relative volume of put options (bearish bets) to call options (bullish bets). A ratio below 1, like 0.78, suggests more bullish sentiment, while a ratio above 1 points to more bearish sentiment. 3. What does ""max pain price"" mean? The max pain price is the strike price at which the largest number of options contracts (both puts and calls) will expire worthless, causing maximum financial loss for options holders and maximum gain for options writers. 4. Will the Bitcoin options expiration definitely cause a price crash? Not necessarily. While large options expirations can introduce volatility and influence short-term price action, they do not guarantee a price crash. Many factors contribute to market movements, and options expiration is just one of them. 5. Where can I find data on crypto options expirations? Leading crypto options exchanges like Deribit, CME, and others provide data on open interest, put/call ratios, and expiration schedules for Bitcoin and Ethereum options.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a powerful barometer, offering a snapshot of investor psychology. Currently holding steady at 50, this key indicator signals a fascinating neutral stance in the market. But what exactly does this equilibrium mean for your crypto strategy? What Exactly is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is an essential tool designed to measure the prevailing emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. It ranges from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed). When investors are overly fearful, it can present a buying opportunity. Conversely, excessive greed might indicate a market correction is on the horizon. A score of 50, as we see today, suggests a balanced, neutral outlook among participants. This index provides a valuable perspective beyond just price movements. It helps you gauge whether the market is reacting emotionally or rationally. For instance, a sudden dip might cause widespread panic (fear), while a rapid surge could ignite FOMO (greed). The current neutral position of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index suggests neither extreme emotion is dominating. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? Ever wondered what factors contribute to this insightful indicator? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is not based on a single metric but a sophisticated combination of several market data points, each weighted differently to provide a comprehensive view. This multi-faceted approach ensures a more accurate reflection of sentiment. Here are the primary components that determine the index’s value: Volatility (25%): This measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average values over the last 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility often indicates a fearful market. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): The current trading volume and market momentum are compared with average values. High buying volumes in a positive market often signal greed. Social Media (15%): This factor analyzes the number of posts and interactions related to cryptocurrencies on various social media platforms, especially Twitter. A surge in positive sentiment can push the index towards greed. Surveys (15%): While currently paused, surveys historically involved weekly polls to gather direct investor sentiment. This direct feedback offered unique insights. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): An increase in Bitcoin’s market cap dominance often suggests a shift from altcoins to Bitcoin, which can be a sign of fear or uncertainty in the broader altcoin market. Google Trends (10%): This component examines search query data for crypto-related terms. For example, a spike in searches for “Bitcoin price manipulation” might indicate fear. Decoding the Neutral Crypto Fear & Greed Index Reading A score of 50 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index signifies a perfectly neutral market. This means neither extreme fear nor extreme greed is prevalent. Investors are not panicking, nor are they exhibiting irrational exuberance. Instead, the market is in a state of balance, weighing both positive and negative developments carefully. For many, a neutral reading can be a moment of introspection rather than immediate action. It suggests a period where the market might be consolidating or waiting for a clearer catalyst. This balanced sentiment could indicate a pause before a significant move in either direction, making it a crucial time for careful observation. Understanding this neutral Crypto Fear & Greed Index helps inform a measured approach. Actionable Insights: Navigating a Neutral Market with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index sits at 50, what should investors consider? This neutral zone offers unique opportunities and challenges. It encourages a strategic, rather than emotional, approach to crypto investing. Benefits of a Neutral Market: Reduced Volatility: Often, a neutral index correlates with less drastic price swings, providing a calmer environment for analysis. Opportunity for Accumulation: Smart investors might use this period to gradually build positions in projects they believe in, without the pressure of extreme market emotions. Time for Research: It’s an excellent time to conduct thorough due diligence on various cryptocurrencies and emerging technologies. Challenges and Considerations: Lack of Clear Direction: A neutral market can sometimes feel stagnant, lacking obvious trends for short-term traders. Waiting Game: Patience becomes key, as significant price movements may not occur immediately. Vulnerability to News: The market can be more susceptible to sudden shifts based on major news events or regulatory announcements. In this neutral environment, focusing on long-term fundamentals and risk management becomes paramount. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 50 provides a chance to refine your strategy. Conclusion: The Enduring Value of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, currently holding a neutral score of 50, remains an indispensable tool for anyone navigating the cryptocurrency markets. It distills complex market dynamics into a simple, understandable metric of investor sentiment. While it should not be the sole basis for investment decisions, it offers a powerful complementary perspective, helping you to identify potential overreactions or complacency. By understanding its components and what a neutral reading implies, you empower yourself to make more informed, less emotional choices. Keep an eye on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index ; it’s a window into the collective psyche of the crypto world, guiding you through its unpredictable currents. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool that measures the current emotional state of the cryptocurrency market, ranging from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed). It helps investors gauge whether the market is behaving rationally or emotionally. How is a “neutral” reading defined by the index? A neutral reading on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, specifically a score of 50, indicates that neither extreme fear nor extreme greed is dominating the market.

The index is calculated based on several factors, including market volatility, trading volume, social media sentiment, surveys (historically), Bitcoin’s market cap dominance, and Google search trends related to cryptocurrencies. Should investors make decisions solely based on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? No, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index should be used as a complementary tool.

The regulator issued an advisory confirming that U.S. residents can now legally access non-U.S. crypto exchanges through its Foreign Board of Trade (FBOT) registration framework. The move is a tectonic shift for digital asset markets. For years, gray areas in the regulations and aggressive enforcement pushed U.S. traders offshore. Some exchanges blocked access to customers in the United States, relegating them to smaller domestic platforms with a smaller range of options. Now that FBOTs have been registered, international exchanges can compete again in the U.S. markets on a level playing field. The advisory reminds the market that FBOT enrollment applies to non-U.S. exchanges to gain market access to their U.S. traders. This approach, CFTC noted, has worked well for the universally decentralized market for global derivatives and works just as well for crypto. The decision provides long-sought-after clarity on what is and is not a public company, said Caroline D. Pham, the interim chairwoman. She argued that American traders should be free to choose and tap those deep global liquidity pools. According to Pham, American businesses that were previously required to form operations abroad to facilitate trading of cryptos now likely have the opportunity to bring those functions back home. However, market observers say it would effectively reopen the American market to major trading platforms like Binance, Bybit, and OKX, which have rebuffed Americans in recent years. Advisory clears years of regulatory fog. The CFTC also tried to clarify the confusion it had caused around its most recent enforcement actions. Certain overseas exchanges were also unsure if they would want to leverage a bulkier domestic status as a Designated Contract Market (DCM) instead of an FBOT. The uncertainty stifled innovation, leading companies to turn their backs on American customers. Pham said that was due to “novel interpretations” contradicting decades of CFTC practice. With the FBOT rules reaffirmed, regulatory clarity has returned. Non-U.S. exchanges now know the process: register as FBOTs, operate under supervision, and legally serve American traders. The US traders have a lot riding on the CFTC’s decision. For years, they were stuck on a handful of domestic exchanges with fewer options and poor liquidity. U.S. traders can enter global markets, join global pools of liquidity, and enjoy a wider variety of tradable instruments – trade with the world on an equal footing. For the foreign exchanges, the advisory was a long-sought legal path back into the lucrative United States marketplace. Some of the largest platforms, including Binance and Bybit, had stopped or blocked U.S. users at some point to keep from running afoul of enforcement actions. Now that the FBOT registration and structuring framework is clear, these entities can return to the U.S., dealing with a clearly established regime of rules and the overhang of regulatory squandering behind the market. The entire crypto industry will benefit as well. And in indicating an intention to signal a pull back from current forbearance and toward regulatory clarity, the CFTC has solidified the U.S. as a leader in world digital asset markets. If the country reverses course, it will likely restore confidence among market participants and convince more innovation and investment to flow back into the country. Politics drives the market backdrop The announcement comes in a “crypto sprint,” as CFTC insiders describe it, to modernize America’s rules around digital assets. It is also consistent with similar efforts across government to compete globally, after Singapore, Hong Kong, and the European Union created more flexible regulatory regimes. The move was seen as carrying political weight in Washington. Pham described it as a victory for U.S. leadership in financial markets and framed the rule as both pro-innovation and pro-trader. Market reaction was swift. Analysts added that the guidance could contribute to trading volumes on major offshore platforms and drag U.S. traders into the global mix. Some even went as far as to predict that it may serve as a way to help Bitcoin and Ethereum liquidity grow in the coming months. Get seen where it counts.

Due to demand from institutions and activity related to ETF, Bitcoin continues to trade above the six-figure mark. Avalanche, meanwhile, is experiencing sharp swings in price as volatility grips its ecosystem. However, experts claim that the most appealing opportunity this quarter is not found in either of these giants, but rather a new presale token, MAGACOIN FINANCE , which is being tagged as one of the year’s best opportunities. Bitcoin: Stability With a Ceiling Bitcoin is moving sideways between $110,000 and $111,400 with a loss of about 2% in 24 hours. The daily trading volume has ranged between $79 to $87 billion, and the market cap is around $2.19 trillion. Miner and whale profit-taking after a new all-time high above $123,000 triggered the dip, experts say. Even with this correction, analysts believe that ETF inflows are a strong catalyst and think a move towards $150,000 is possible if momentum picks up. However, there are signs of shifting dynamics. The overall crypto market dominance of Bitcoin is slipping gradually as other assets, such as Ethereum and XRP, are catching up by displaying capital rotation. Bitcoin is the gold standard and main store of value, but it does not have much upside compared to new plays. Avalanche: Volatility and Growth Potential Avalanche (AVAX) is currently trading in the range of $23.35 – $23.50, down nearly 8.9% in the last 24 hours. The market cap of Terra ranges between $9.8 and $10.7 billion, with the daily trading volume of around $825 million to $855 million. The dip highlights the network’s recent volatility. Technical indicators suggest that AVAX has encountered strong resistance on multiple occasions, and today’s dramatic drop was not unexpected. In fact, previous supports were tested again in this movement at roughly $18.03. Simultaneously, Avalanche has been added as a candidate to Wyoming’s new WYST stablecoin mainnet launch despite the increasing irrelevance of stablecoin infrastructure. Short-term exposure poses considerable risks, as evidenced by the price pullback, despite on-chain meme coin activity driving engagement. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Safer, Smarter Play While Bitcoin and Avalanche remain popular, analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE is the smarter investment this quarter. With a double audit by HashEx and CertiK, it is rated safe, secure, and fully transparent, having passed every audit. According to the experts, this dual-layer verification makes it one of the safest presale investments today. Furthermore, the increase in whale inflows and the expansion of the community are speeding up the adoption rate of early-stage projects. Investors who secure allocations now are essentially buying at a fraction of its anticipated listing price, which is why the countdown effect is building urgency around this opportunity. With forecasts of 40x–50x upside, a KYC-verified team, and thousands of investors joining in, it’s being ranked as one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025 . Limited supply and rising demand make this presale one of the year’s biggest opportunities. Analyst Rankings Put MAGACOIN FINANCE Among the Best Cryptos to Buy in 2025 Recognized as one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE combines smart contract security with operational transparency. The presale has been thoroughly audited by Hashex, confirming its safety for early participants. With open tokenomics, a public-facing team, and rising investor confidence, MAGACOIN FINANCE checks all the boxes for long-term potential. Conclusion While Bitcoin offers strength and institutional security, Avalanche offers technical innovation and growth potential; neither possesses the unique combination of safety and explosive upside found in MAGACOIN FINANCE. MAGACOIN FINANCE is being termed as the smartest buy of the quarter and, more importantly, one of the most defining opportunities of 2025 thanks to double audits, a verified team and increasing presale momentum.

This significant jump signals a potentially lucrative period for alternative cryptocurrencies, moving us closer to what many investors eagerly anticipate: a full-fledged altcoin season. Understanding this key metric is crucial for navigating the evolving digital asset landscape. What is the Altcoin Season Index and Why Does it Matter? The Altcoin Season Index , provided by CoinMarketCap, is a vital tool for gauging the overall performance of altcoins against Bitcoin. It helps investors determine if the market conditions favor Bitcoin or a broader range of altcoins. A higher index score suggests that a greater percentage of altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin, indicating a shift in market sentiment and potential investment opportunities. This index offers a snapshot of current market momentum. It guides strategic decisions for crypto portfolios. A rising score often precedes significant altcoin rallies. Decoding the Altcoin Season Index: How is it Calculated? The calculation behind the Altcoin Season Index is straightforward yet powerful. It compares the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization against Bitcoin’s performance over the last 90 days. Importantly, stablecoins and wrapped coins are excluded from this analysis to provide a clearer picture of organic altcoin growth. For a period to be officially declared an “altcoin season,” at least 75% of these top 100 altcoins must outperform Bitcoin during that 90-day timeframe. A reading closer to 100 signifies a stronger and more widespread altcoin trend, suggesting broad-based gains across the altcoin market. The recent jump to 57, while not yet 75, certainly indicates a strong upward trajectory. Is it Truly Altcoin Season? Navigating Market Dynamics While the Altcoin Season Index reaching 57 is certainly encouraging, it’s important to understand what this number truly implies. We are not yet in a definitive “altcoin season” as per the 75% threshold. However, an 11-point increase overnight is a powerful indicator of shifting market dynamics and growing investor interest in altcoins. This movement suggests that a substantial portion of the top altcoins are currently showing stronger performance relative to Bitcoin. Investors should view this as a period of heightened potential and careful observation. It’s a time to: Research promising projects: Look beyond the usual suspects. Diversify wisely: Spread investments across different sectors. Monitor market trends: Stay updated on news and developments. Seizing Opportunities in the Rising Altcoin Season Index The current momentum indicated by the Altcoin Season Index presents exciting opportunities for those looking to capitalize on potential market shifts. Historically, periods leading up to an official altcoin season have seen significant gains in various altcoin categories, including DeFi tokens, NFTs, metaverse projects, and Layer-1 solutions. To navigate this environment effectively: Focus on fundamentals: Understand the technology and use cases of projects. Manage risk: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider dollar-cost averaging: Smooth out entry points over time. Stay informed: Follow reputable crypto news sources and analysts. The current Altcoin Season Index rise is a clear signal that the market is evolving. This could be the prelude to a broader altcoin rally, offering investors the chance to explore assets beyond Bitcoin. The recent surge in the Altcoin Season Index to 57 marks a pivotal moment in the cryptocurrency market. While we await the official declaration of an altcoin season, this significant increase highlights strong underlying momentum and growing investor confidence in alternative cryptocurrencies. It underscores the importance of staying informed and strategically positioning your portfolio to potentially benefit from these dynamic market shifts. The crypto landscape is ever-changing, and the rising index offers a compelling glimpse into its exciting future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does an Altcoin Season Index of 57 mean? A: An Altcoin Season Index of 57 means that 57% of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. It indicates strong momentum for altcoins, though it’s not yet the official “altcoin season” threshold of 75%. Q2: How is the Altcoin Season Index calculated? A: The index compares the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) against Bitcoin’s performance over the preceding 90 days. Q3: When is it officially considered an “altcoin season”? A: An official altcoin season is declared when 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin during a 90-day period. Q4: Should I invest in altcoins when the index rises? A: A rising Altcoin Season Index suggests favorable conditions for altcoins. However, always conduct thorough research, understand the risks involved, and consider your investment strategy before making any decisions. Q5: What are “stablecoins” and “wrapped coins” and why are they excluded? A: Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to an asset like the USD, designed to maintain a stable value. Wrapped coins are tokenized versions of other cryptocurrencies (e.g., Wrapped Bitcoin, WBTC) on a different blockchain. They are excluded from the index to focus on the organic price movements of independent altcoins. Did you find this analysis of the Altcoin Season Index insightful?

Ethereum New Contract Activity Booming – Will Price Follow? According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor PelinayPA, a sharp rebound in Ethereum contracts could be seen in 2024 and 2025. This year specifically, new contracts surged dramatically as ETH price climbed beyond $4,500. The CryptoQuant contributor highlighted that during the 2016-17 market cycle, new contract activity remained relatively muted. Despite the subdued activity, ETH price entered a strong uptrend. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Lags Despite All-Time High In Daily Transactions – What’s Next For ETH? On the contrary, following the 2018 bull run, ETH entered a price downtrend despite a rise in new contracts. ETH’s price reaction to a growth in new contracts showed that usage growth could not offset the bursting of the speculative bubble surrounding digital assets. Meanwhile, during the 2020-21 bull market, Ethereum contract creation spiked significantly, in-line with the decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFT) boom. At the time, increased network activity served as a key catalyst in aiding ETH’s rally. Later – during the 2022 bear market – both contract number and ETH price dropped. The digital asset’s price and network activity was also adversely impacted due to dwindling developer interest and user demand during the market cycle. The aforementioned examples confirm that over the long-term, growth in contract creation shows rising confidence and adoption within Ethereum’s ecosystem. These factors play out positively for ETH’s price. That said, sudden surge in contract creation have not always directly resulted into price gains. This was evident from the price corrections observed during 2018 and 2021 cycles. What Does The Current Outlook Indicate? In her analysis, PelinayPA remarked that the latest surge in new Ethereum contracts signals renewed network activity, primarily driven by DeFi, NFT, and institutional adoption. If the trend sustains, it could fuel the next ETH bull run. Related Reading: Ethereum Average Daily Outflow Hits 40,000 ETH Amid Rising Buying Pressure – Details As far as long-term effects are concerned, the analyst said that consistent growth in new contracts highlights Ethereum’s rapidly expanding real-world use-cases. This gives immense support to ETH’s price. However, hype-driven contract spikes can lead to short-lived price corrections. Recent predictions point toward further room for growth for Ethereum. For instance, Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee forecasted that ETH may climb to $5,500 “in the next couple of weeks.” In the same vein, Standard Chartered’s digital assets research chief, Geoffrey Kendrick, noted that ETH could rise to $7,500 by the end of the year. At press time, ETH trades at $4,582, down 0.2% in the past 24 hours.

Whale Alert, a renowned blockchain tracking service, recently reported a colossal USDC transfer of 499,999,990 USDC. This staggering sum, valued at approximately $500 million, originated from Coinbase Institutional and landed in an undisclosed wallet. Such a significant USDC transfer naturally sparks curiosity and speculation about its potential implications. What Does This Massive USDC Transfer Mean? When nearly half a billion dollars in stablecoins moves, it’s rarely a trivial matter. This particular USDC transfer from Coinbase Institutional, a platform catering to large institutions, suggests a high-level transaction. Understanding the nature of such a large movement is key to grasping its potential impact on the broader crypto market. Institutional Activity: Coinbase Institutional serves major players like hedge funds, asset managers, and corporations. A transfer of this magnitude indicates significant institutional involvement. Stablecoin Utility: USDC, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, is often used for large-scale settlements, hedging, or as a safe haven asset during market volatility. Market Speculation: While the destination remains ‘unknown,’ this doesn’t necessarily imply nefarious activity. It could be an over-the-counter (OTC) trade, a treasury management move, or even a large investor rebalancing their portfolio. Who is Behind Such a Significant USDC Transfer? The identity of the ‘unknown wallet’ holder is the central mystery surrounding this event. In the world of blockchain, while transactions are transparent, the entities behind the wallets often remain pseudonymous. However, we can infer some possibilities based on the scale of the USDC transfer : This kind of movement is typically associated with: Large Institutional Investors: Perhaps a fund is deploying capital into other assets, moving funds to a different custodian, or preparing for a major investment. OTC Desks: These platforms facilitate large, off-exchange trades that might not immediately impact spot prices. The funds could be moving to settle such a deal. Corporate Treasuries: Companies increasingly hold stablecoins for various operational or investment purposes, and this could be a treasury management decision. High-Net-Worth Individuals: While less common for such a precise, large sum from an institutional arm, wealthy individuals also make significant moves. The Broader Implications of a Half-Billion Dollar USDC Transfer A USDC transfer of this size, while not directly impacting the price of USDC itself (as it’s a stablecoin), can hint at broader market sentiment and future movements. It signals that significant capital is actively being deployed or repositioned within the crypto ecosystem. For instance, if this capital is preparing to enter volatile assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum, it could indicate bullish sentiment. Conversely, if it’s being moved to a cold storage wallet for long-term holding, it might suggest a more cautious approach. This event underscores the growing adoption of stablecoins for large-scale financial operations within the digital economy. It also highlights the transparency of blockchain, where even anonymous movements are recorded for all to see, allowing services like Whale Alert to track and report them. The sheer volume of this transaction is a testament to the increasing maturity and scale of the institutional crypto market. What’s Next After This Mammoth USDC Transfer? While the exact purpose of this USDC transfer remains speculative, its occurrence reinforces several key aspects of the current crypto landscape. We are witnessing a continuous flow of institutional capital into the digital asset space. Investors and market watchers will be keenly observing subsequent movements from this ‘unknown wallet’ to discern any patterns or further actions. Such large transfers often precede other significant market activities, making them important indicators for market sentiment and potential trends. In conclusion, the nearly $500 million USDC transfer from Coinbase Institutional to an unknown wallet is a powerful reminder of the substantial financial activity taking place in the institutional crypto world. It highlights the critical role stablecoins play in facilitating large-scale transactions and underscores the ongoing evolution of digital finance. While the immediate impact is a subject of discussion, the event undoubtedly signifies robust and dynamic capital movements within the blockchain ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is USDC? USDC (USD Coin) is a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, meaning its value is intended to remain stable at $1.00. It is backed by fully reserved assets, ensuring its stability and reliability for transactions. Q2: What is Coinbase Institutional? Coinbase Institutional is a suite of services provided by Coinbase, designed for large institutional clients like hedge funds, asset managers, and corporations. It offers advanced trading tools, custody solutions, and prime brokerage services for digital assets. Q3: Why are large USDC transfers significant? Large USDC transfers are significant because they often indicate major institutional activity, such as large-scale investments, portfolio rebalancing, over-the-counter (OTC) trades, or treasury management decisions. They can provide insights into market sentiment and potential future movements. Q4: Does an ‘unknown wallet’ imply illegal activity? Not necessarily. While the identity of the wallet owner is not publicly disclosed, many legitimate large-scale transactions occur between anonymous or pseudonymous wallets. It could be an OTC desk, a cold storage wallet, or an institutional investor moving funds. Q5: How can I track such large crypto transactions? Services like Whale Alert specialize in tracking and reporting significant cryptocurrency transactions across various blockchains. They provide real-time updates on large movements, offering transparency into the crypto market. If you found this analysis insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

Arbitrum and PEPE remain in focus, while MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a legitimate project pushing a safety-first approach in a space often clouded by scams. Arbitrum (ARB): Ethereum’s Scaling Powerhouse Arbitrum is one of Ethereum’s most relied-upon Layer-2 solutions, priced at around $0.54. It uses optimistic rollups to process faster and cheaper transactions while still benefiting from Ethereum’s core security. This has made it one of the busiest L2 networks, handling more daily volume than Ethereum mainnet itself. Adoption continues to accelerate, with institutions like BlackRock’s BUIDL network and Franklin Templeton’s OnChain fund integrated into its ecosystem. In terms of activity, Arbitrum has seen nearly 12 million weekly transactions and over half a million new weekly users during peak months. With this level of usage, it’s not surprising that many view ARB as one of the best crypto to buy under $1. ARB also carries weight in governance. As the token of the Arbitrum DAO, it allows holders to participate in shaping upgrades and fund allocations. While risks like large unlock events exist, retail sentiment on platforms like Reddit suggests traders see it as a strategic play on Ethereum’s future. PEPE: Meme Hype Keeps It Alive PEPE coin continues to live up to its reputation as a high-risk, high-reward altcoin. The meme-driven token has seen extraordinary levels of speculative activity, with $87 million worth of PEPE trading hands in just a single day. On-chain data shows that over 96% of holders were in profit after a monthly jump of nearly 90%, sparking renewed retail buzz. Exchange support also plays a role—Binance added PEPE to its Super Stake program, which immediately lifted its price by about 7%. Forecasts for PEPE vary wildly. Some analysts suggest moderate gains toward $0.0000198, while others envision much larger moves fueled by speculative rallies. What’s clear is that, despite the volatility, PEPE remains one of the top altcoins under $1 that traders keep a close eye on. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Safety-First Ethereum Altcoin While hype coins dominate headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE differentiates itself by putting security at the forefront. Built on Ethereum, it comes fully audited (HashEx completed, CertiK ongoing) and operates with anti-phishing protocols. Scam protection is a core message, and its verified compatibility with wallets like MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet adds legitimacy in a market where trust is often lacking. Thousands have already joined the project, making it more than just another meme-driven token. To encourage early participation, MAGACOIN is currently offering a 50% EXTRA bonus with the coupon code PATRIOT50X . For those scanning the best crypto to buy under $1, its safety-first approach paired with a clear growth push sets it apart from speculative meme coins. Analyst Rankings Put MAGACOIN FINANCE Among the Best Cryptos to Buy in 2025 Recognized as one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025 , MAGACOIN FINANCE combines smart contract security with operational transparency. The presale has been thoroughly audited by Hashex , confirming its safety for early participants. With open tokenomics, a public-facing team, and rising investor confidence, MAGACOIN FINANCE checks all the boxes for long-term potential. Conclusion: How to Position in This Market Arbitrum and PEPE continue to offer traders exposure to scaling tech and meme hype under the $1 mark. Yet, MAGACOIN FINANCE brings something the space often lacks—an audited, scam-protected framework.

50842251,568122,1756429258,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50842251.jpeg,Philippines Explores Blockchain-Based Budgeting System Amid Transparency Push,https://bitcoinist.com/philippine-bill-place-national-budget-on-blockchain/,"Efforts to integrate blockchain technology into government operations may soon advance in the Philippines. Senator Bam Aquino announced plans to introduce a bill that would place the country’s national budget on a blockchain platform, aiming to enhance transparency and accountability in public spending. Speaking at the Manila Tech Summit on Wednesday, Aquino explained that the proposed measure seeks to log all government budget transactions on-chain , where they would be viewable by citizens. “No one is crazy enough to put their transactions on blockchain, where every single step of the way will be logged and transparent to every single citizen. But we want to start,” Aquino said at the event, according to local media. In a separate Facebook post , the senator highlighted his interest in using blockchain-based budgeting to ensure that “every peso” in government spending is accounted for. Aquino noted that if successful, the Philippines could become the first country to implement such a system at a national scale, though he acknowledged uncertainty about the level of support the proposal will receive. Blockchain in Philippine Public Sector Initiatives The senator’s remarks follow a recent blockchain-related rollout by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM). Last month, the DBM launched a document validation system on Polygon, which Undersecretary Maria Francesca Del Rosario said was designed to help counter the rise of AI deepfakes and prevent the falsification of official documents. While it remains unclear whether Aquino’s proposed budget system would be tied directly to this initiative, both efforts suggest a growing interest in applying distributed ledger technology to strengthen public governance. Globally, governments are experimenting with blockchain to improve transparency, reduce fraud, and streamline processes. For example, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick recently announced plans to begin publishing official economic statistics, including gross domestic product (GDP) figures, on a blockchain. Similar initiatives are being tested in countries such as Estonia and South Korea, where blockchain has been used for digital identity systems and voting trials. If implemented in the Philippines, a blockchain-based budget system could introduce new standards of traceability in fiscal management. Each allocation and expenditure could be immutably recorded, enabling oversight bodies, auditors, and the general public to verify the flow of government funds in near real time. Opportunities and Challenges Ahead While the potential benefits of blockchain integration in government budgeting are evident, significant challenges remain. Implementing such a system would require strong technical infrastructure, comprehensive legal frameworks, and widespread political backing. Questions also remain about how sensitive budgetary data would be managed, and whether a fully public ledger or a permissioned blockchain would be more suitable. Senator Aquino emphasized that the ultimate goal is to build a more accountable public finance system through technological innovation . However, he admitted uncertainty about whether Congress and other stakeholders would support the initiative. “If we’re able to do this, I think we’ll be the first country to have our budget on the blockchain. Of course, I don’t know what kind of support I will get,” he said.

Both meme coins are drawing heightened interest from retail traders, while analysts expect broader market repricing to amplify their volatility. Dogecoin is leaning on its status as the original meme coin, while Shiba Inu continues to build out new utilities and community-driven governance. Yet as these two battle for dominance, analysts note that some early investors are already scouting new opportunities. MAGACOIN FINANCE , which has attracted strong presale inflows and is is widely recognized for being legitimate and audited, is being discussed as a third force that could challenge the established meme coin order in the next cycle. Doge and Shib’s Investor Sentiment Dogecoin is currently trading around $0.213 as of August 2025. Forecasts for October point to a range between $0.239 and $0.274, with an average projection near $0.261. Bullish scenarios, fueled by celebrity endorsements and waves of retail enthusiasm, suggest possible moves to $0.80 or even $2 by the end of the year. Backed by Elon Musk’s public support and a long history of liquidity, DOGE retains an edge as the sector’s legacy asset. Shiba Inu, meanwhile, trades near $0.0000146. Analysts expect October levels to sit between $0.00004899 and $0.00005999, a potential leap tied to ongoing upgrades and DAO-led community development. SHIB’s strength lies in its innovation pipeline and grassroots engagement, though short-term momentum depends heavily on holding key support zones and sustaining trading activity. For SHIB holders, October is shaping up as a critical test of both technical resilience and market confidence. Meme Coin Market Dynamics The meme coin market overall is expanding, with retail traders and viral campaigns driving rapid cycles of price action. Regions such as North America and Asia-Pacific are proving pivotal, where tech-savvy populations and strong cultural momentum fuel adoption. Market watchers also highlight how integrations, celebrity visibility, and regulatory developments could sharply influence meme coin trajectories through Q4 2025. Dogecoin benefits most from cultural recognition and external endorsements, while Shiba Inu’s bet on added utility continues to attract a loyal base. However, the sector remains highly speculative, where momentum can shift overnight based on online trends or macro headlines. Analysts caution that volatility will remain elevated as October’s repricing nears. A Shifting Investor Outlook to This Crypto Presale While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are locked in a tight battle, presale momentum elsewhere is drawing early capital flows. Traders seeking exposure to the next breakout are increasingly turning toward MAGACOIN FINANCE, citing its strong community traction and exchange-ready positioning. Market analysts argue that the meme coin’s surge of presale demand signals a potential to separate itself from legacy meme plays during the next cycle. This shift in sentiment highlights how meme coin investors often hedge by diversifying across both established names and high-upside entrants. For many, Dogecoin provides short-term liquidity and visibility, Shiba Inu offers longer-term innovation potential, and MAGACOIN FINANCE presents a fresh opportunity that could capture the kind of exponential upside seen in earlier meme coin waves. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is a Trusted Crypto to Buy for 2025 Growth Investors searching for a trusted early-stage project have found a strong contender in MAGACOIN FINANCE, widely ranked among the best cryptos to buy in 2025. Its smart contract passed auditing standards, and the public team has completed full KYC verification. Combined with growing community traction, these strengths make it a top-tier choice for those prioritizing safety and growth. Strategic Outlook Dogecoin appears positioned for stronger near-term moves, particularly if celebrity-driven speculation intensifies into year-end. Shiba Inu is leaning on its innovation roadmap and community strength, which could sustain it if utility upgrades deliver as promised. But analysts stress that crypto presale challengers like MAGACOIN FINANCE should not be overlooked, given the speed with which capital rotates in the meme sector. Ultimately, October 2025’s repricing will be determined by broader market sentiment, the flow of retail money, and unexpected events ranging from policy developments to high-profile endorsements. For investors navigating the meme coin arena, active monitoring and careful positioning in MAGACOIN remain essential.

Analysts now forecast Bitcoin reaching six-figure prices by 2026, with whales showing renewed interest, sparking discussions on where traders should position next. Analysts’ Conservative to Mid-Range Bitcoin Predictions Forecasts for Bitcoin in 2026 cover a wide spectrum. CoinMarketCap places the average near $120,000, with highs around $150,000. Analysts note the 2024 halving event, regulatory clarity, and institutional adoption as key drivers. InvestingHaven adds a wider band, projecting between $99,910 and $200,000, suggesting that gradual adoption trends could support the higher end of that scale. SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci sees a path to $170,000 by mid-2026, citing inflation factors and supportive U.S. policies. Likewise, investor sentiment tracked by MarketWatch options data indicates an expectation around $174,000. Together, these more measured forecasts create a consensus view of Bitcoin stabilizing well above its historical highs by 2026. More Bullish Bitcoin Forecasts for 2026 Some platforms publish even more ambitious estimates. Changelly projects Bitcoin averaging $202,000 in December 2026, with a maximum near $239,000. DigitalCoinPrice is more optimistic, targeting $261,000 to $282,000 averages, with highs around $308,000. MicroStrategy-linked analysts expect BTC to climb toward $225,000 by year-end 2026, reinforcing the role of corporate treasuries in adoption. Meanwhile, algorithm-driven platforms like PricePredictions.com go further, modeling mid-year levels of $500,000 and year-end targets of $562,000. While such extremes are speculative, they highlight the scale of enthusiasm for Bitcoin’s multi-year trajectory. Strategic Investment with MAGACOIN FINANCE: Best Altcoin to Buy Alongside Bitcoin forecasts, many traders are comparing altcoins for strategic positioning. MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining attention for offering a “FOMO-proof” path, where its price ticks up hourly during active sales phases. Built for secure entry and a transparent structure, it has quickly become a top altcoin to watch. As Bitcoin pushes toward six-figure levels, history shows that altcoins often ride the wave, delivering sharper percentage gains. This places MAGACOIN FINANCE in a prime spot to benefit from renewed liquidity flowing into the market. For traders looking beyond Bitcoin alone, MAGA combines meme appeal with utility, making it one of the best crypto plays to consider while the broader market gears up for the next cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Verified Altcoin With Long-Term Upside As one of the best altcoins to buy this year, MAGACOIN FINANCE earns its place through verified credibility. Unlike speculative launches, this project is backed by a Hashex audit and led by a KYC-compliant team, creating a solid foundation for long-term success.

Meanwhile, factory output slipped in July, and retail sales rose far less than anticipated, highlighting the fragility of Japan’s economic recovery as pressure from U.S. tariffs mounted. Analysts say lingering inflationary pressures, coupled with mounting growth risks, underscore the challenge facing the Bank of Japan (BOJ) in deciding when to move on its next rate hike. “Core consumer inflation is likely to slow as a trend as the yen’s rise and moderating increases in import costs weigh on prices,” said Masato Koike, senior economist at Sompo Institute Plus. He noted that while lowered under Japan’s trade deal with Washington, U.S. tariff rates remain high compared with last year’s levels and thus will keep hurting output for a while. Utility subsidies slow Tokyo inflation, but core prices stay elevated Tokyo’s core consumer price index (CPI) increased by 2.5% in August YoY. This figure excludes volatile fresh food but includes fuel costs, government data showed, matching a median market forecast. The CPI was sluggish after a 2.9% rise in July, mostly due to government fuel subsidies that reduced utility bills. An index excluding both volatile fresh food and energy costs—closely monitored by the BOJ as a key measure of underlying inflation—climbed 3.0% in August from a year earlier, following a 3.1% increase in July. Food inflation, excluding fresh produce such as vegetables, held at 7.4% in August, unchanged from the previous month, underscoring persistent pressure from higher prices of staples like rice, coffee beans, and other groceries. Overall, goods prices climbed 3.2% year-on-year, while service costs rose 2.0%, reflecting continued pass-through of rising labor expenses, government data showed. Factory output drops as U.S. tariffs weigh on Japan’s recovery The Bank of Japan (BOJ) ended its decade-long ultra-loose stimulus last year. It lifted short-term interest rates to 0.5% in January, signaling confidence that the economy was nearing a durable achievement of its 2% inflation target. Still, while inflation has remained above 2% for more than three years, BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda has emphasized a cautious approach to further tightening, warning of downside risks to growth from the impact of U.S. tariffs . Highlighting these concerns, government data on Friday showed Japan’s factory output fell 1.6% in July from the previous month, a sharper decline than the market’s median forecast for a 1.0% drop, driven by weakness in the automobile and machinery sectors. The manufacturers that the government surveyed expect production to increase by 2.8% in August and fall by 0.3% in September, the data showed. Other data brought more bad news, with retail sales barely gaining 0.3% in July, much lower than market forecasts for a 1.8% rise, indicating that the increasing cost of living was undermining consumption. With a tightening labor market, pressure on wages is increasing. Government data showed on Friday that the jobless rate eased to 2.3% from 2.5% in June, the lowest level since December 2019. Some 65% of economists questioned by Reuters in August forecast the BOJ will lift its key rate by another 25 basis points or more later this year compared with just over half a month ago.

If so, you’ve likely noticed some truly fascinating trends, especially concerning Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. A significant development has emerged: ETH accumulation addresses have reached an astonishing all-time high! This isn’t just a fleeting statistic; it signals a powerful and growing surge in long-term investor confidence in Ethereum’s future. What’s Driving This Unprecedented ETH Accumulation Phenomenon? When we talk about ETH accumulation addresses, we’re referring to specific wallets that acquire and hold Ethereum for the long term, with a clear intent to avoid frequent selling. These addresses serve as a crucial barometer for long-term market sentiment and investor conviction. According to Burak Kesmeci, a respected contributor at CryptoQuant, this particular metric is a key indicator of robust investor confidence in the market’s enduring potential. The growth in these holdings has been nothing short of dramatic. Consider the data: just last May, before the widespread anticipation of spot ETF approvals , these accumulation addresses held approximately 8.9 million ETH. Fast forward to this August, and that figure has skyrocketed to an astonishing 24.3 million ETH. That represents a threefold increase in just over a year, clearly showcasing a profound shift in how savvy investors are approaching their Ethereum holdings. Is Institutional Demand Fueling the ETH Accumulation Race? Indeed, the recent surge in ETH accumulation isn’t happening in isolation. Kesmeci’s insightful analysis strongly suggests a direct connection to institutional funds. He posits that the increasing interest in Ethereum spot ETFs is likely prompting these large entities to purchase substantial amounts of spot ETH and then strategically move them into secure, long-term storage solutions. This behavior isn’t about short-term gains; it underscores a calculated, strategic approach to Ethereum as a foundational asset. The pace of this accumulation has accelerated dramatically since June, indicating a growing urgency among buyers. Daily inflows, which previously amounted to a few thousand ETH, now frequently reach hundreds of thousands. There have even been multiple instances where over 500,000 ETH flowed into these dedicated accumulation addresses in a single 24-hour period. Kesmeci aptly describes this as the “beginning of an accumulation race,” primarily driven by substantial and sustained institutional demand. This intense activity highlights a deep and growing conviction in Ethereum’s long-term value proposition. Understanding the Significance of the Average $2.5K ETH Accumulation Price It’s also incredibly insightful to consider the average purchase price for these accumulating addresses, which stands at approximately $2,500. This particular detail is significant because it places a substantial portion of these long-term holders, both large institutions and individual investors, in a very comfortable profit position. What does this mean for the market? Historically, investors who are already “in the green” tend to act as a powerful support system for upward price movements. They are far less likely to panic-sell during minor market corrections or dips. Instead, they typically choose to hold onto their valuable assets, thereby reinforcing market stability and contributing to positive momentum. This average buy-in price, combined with the strong commitment to hold, paints a robust picture for Ethereum’s price stability and potential for future appreciation. Key Takeaways from the ETH Accumulation Trend Let’s break down the core insights from this exciting development: Strong Confidence: The record high in ETH accumulation addresses unequivocally signals robust long-term investor confidence in Ethereum’s future potential and its role in the evolving digital economy. Institutional Backing: Institutional funds, likely influenced by the anticipation and eventual approval of spot ETF products, are a major driving force behind this accelerated accumulation. This indicates a maturing market. Market Stability: Long-term holders, many of whom are already in profit from an average buy-in price of $2,500, are historically known to support upward price trends by steadfastly maintaining their positions. This creates a solid floor. Strategic Holding: This isn’t merely speculative trading. Instead, it represents a deliberate and strategic approach to acquire and hold Ethereum for sustained, long-term growth, recognizing its fundamental value. Positive Momentum: The sheer volume and consistency of inflows suggest a strong, underlying bullish sentiment that could continue to propel Ethereum forward. In conclusion, the remarkable surge in ETH accumulation addresses to an all-time high is far more than just a number; it’s a powerful narrative of growing confidence and strategic investment in Ethereum. With institutional players increasingly moving substantial amounts of ETH into long-term storage and existing holders sitting on comfortable profits, the foundation for sustained growth appears remarkably strong. This trend paints a compelling and optimistic picture for Ethereum’s future trajectory, suggesting a maturing market where deep conviction is translating into significant and enduring long-term holdings. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are ETH accumulation addresses? A1: ETH accumulation addresses are cryptocurrency wallets specifically identified as holding Ethereum for the long term, typically without significant outgoing transactions, indicating a strategy of buying and holding rather than frequent trading. Q2: Why is the increase in ETH accumulation significant for the market? A2: An increase in ETH accumulation signifies strong long-term investor confidence. It suggests that more investors believe in Ethereum’s future value and are committing to holding the asset, which can contribute to market stability and upward price momentum. Q3: Are institutional investors playing a role in this ETH accumulation trend? A3: Yes, according to CryptoQuant’s analysis, institutional funds, possibly influenced by the anticipation of spot Ethereum ETF approvals, are a major driving force behind the accelerated pace of ETH accumulation, moving large volumes into long-term storage. Q4: What is the average purchase price for these accumulated ETH holdings? A4: The average purchase price for ETH in these accumulation addresses is approximately $2,500. This places many long-term holders in a profitable position, making them less likely to sell during market fluctuations and more inclined to support upward trends. Q5: How does long-term holding typically affect Ethereum’s price? A5: Long-term holding by a significant number of investors can create a strong support floor for Ethereum’s price. It reduces selling pressure and demonstrates conviction, which often encourages further investment and contributes to sustained price appreciation over time.

Current figures show 9.69 million active wallets, with an impressive 5,000-6,000 new addresses joining daily. Related Reading: XRP’s Biggest Doubter Just Dropped Close To $5 Price Bomb — Here’s Why This growth reflects more than retail speculation as it signals meaningful enterprise adoption in payments, tokenized deposits, and cross-border transactions. Unlike different hyped assets, Stellar has quietly built its reputation as a trusted blockchain solution. The network’s focus on compliance and financial-grade use cases is drawing banks, fintech firms, and remittance providers. With over $150 million in total value locked and consistent wallet creation, Stellar is showing signs of steady, sustainable growth that could lay the groundwork for a major price rally. Why Institutions Are Going Big on Stellar Institutional money is playing a key role in Stellar’s momentum. From partnerships with MoneyGram and Circle to recent pilots with central banks and fintechs like VersaBank, XLM is becoming a practical tool for global finance. VersaBank, for example, has begun testing tokenized deposits (USDVB) on Stellar alongside Ethereum and Algorand, mirroring confidence in Stellar’s scalability and compliance. This steady inflow of enterprise adoption is critical. Unlike retail-driven spikes, institutional backing provides consistent liquidity and long-term confidence. Analysts suggest that the growth of network growth and enterprise demand could act as the spark for XLM’s next breakout, especially if it pushes past psychological resistance at $0.50. XLM Price Forecast: $0.48 to $0.57 in Sight Currently Stellar trades around $0.38, hovering near its key support levels. Technical indicators suggest the cryptocurrency is preparing for a bullish reversal. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits in neutral territory, while narrowing MACD patterns hint at fading bearish momentum. XLM's price moving sideways on the daily chart. Source: XLMUSD on Tradingview Analysts project short-term targets between $0.42 and $0.44, with a medium-term breakout toward $0.48–$0.57 by late September. If XLM clears resistance at $0.50, institutional demand could push the price higher, with some models pointing to the $0.60–$0.77 range as the next major battleground. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Price Is Set To Hit $4 If It Breaks This Resistance Line However, failure to hold above $0.37 could expose Stellar to a deeper pullback toward $0.29. For now, the bullish case outweighs the bearish scenario, and with Stellar nearing 10 million accounts, many traders see this as a defining moment for XLM’s long-term trajectory.

A staggering 92 cryptocurrency Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) applications are currently sitting before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), awaiting their crucial review. This massive wave of filings highlights a growing interest in bringing digital assets to traditional investment vehicles. The prospect of Crypto ETF Approval could unlock significant mainstream adoption and reshape the investment landscape. The Race for Crypto ETF Approval: Which Assets Lead the Pack? Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart recently shed light on this exciting development. His data reveals a diverse range of digital assets vying for a spot on the traditional market. It’s a clear indication that institutions and issuers see immense potential in these innovative financial products. Solana (SOL): Leading the charge with an impressive 16 filings, Solana shows strong institutional interest. Its high transaction speed and low fees make it an attractive candidate for various financial products. XRP: Following closely, XRP has 15 applications. This reflects ongoing efforts to integrate XRP into the broader financial system, despite past regulatory uncertainties. Mixed-Asset Funds: Nine applications focus on diversified crypto portfolios, offering investors exposure to multiple digital assets through a single product. Ethereum (ETH): With six filings, Ethereum continues to be a top contender, building on its strong ecosystem and recent upgrades. Bitcoin (BTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Litecoin (LTC): Each of these well-known cryptocurrencies has four pending applications. Their established market presence makes them perennial favorites for such investment vehicles. Why Does Crypto ETF Approval Matter So Much? The potential for Crypto ETF Approval is a game-changer for several reasons. ETFs offer a regulated and accessible way for traditional investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without directly holding the underlying assets. This ease of access can significantly broaden the investor base. Moreover, these products could attract substantial institutional capital. Large investment firms and pension funds, which often face restrictions on direct crypto investments, find ETFs a compliant and appealing alternative. Therefore, a green light from the SEC could signal a new era of legitimacy and growth for the entire digital asset market. Navigating the SEC’s Stance on Crypto ETF Approval The SEC has historically maintained a cautious stance on cryptocurrency products, primarily citing concerns about investor protection and market manipulation. However, the landscape is evolving. The recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs set a significant precedent, demonstrating a shift in regulatory comfort. Each new application for Crypto ETF Approval undergoes rigorous scrutiny. The SEC evaluates factors such as market surveillance capabilities, the underlying asset’s liquidity, and the potential for fraud. Issuers must demonstrate robust safeguards to meet these stringent requirements. This careful approach aims to protect investors while fostering innovation in the financial sector. What’s Next for Digital Asset ETFs and the SEC? The sheer volume of 92 pending applications underscores the industry’s persistence and belief in the future of crypto ETFs. While there is no guaranteed timeline, the increasing number of filings, particularly for assets like Solana and XRP, suggests a growing momentum. Observers are keenly watching for any signals or decisions from the SEC. The potential approval of these diverse Crypto ETF Approval applications could lead to greater market stability and wider acceptance of digital assets. Investors and enthusiasts alike should stay informed about these developments, as they will undoubtedly shape the future of cryptocurrency investing. In conclusion, the ongoing review of 92 cryptocurrency ETF applications by the SEC marks a pivotal moment for the digital asset space. With Solana and XRP leading the pack, the industry is eagerly anticipating decisions that could usher in a new era of mainstream adoption and institutional engagement. The path to Crypto ETF Approval is complex, but the potential rewards are monumental for investors and the crypto ecosystem as a whole. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a Crypto ETF?

MAGACOIN FINANCE Attracts PEPE, BTC and ETH Whales",https://timestabloid.com/best-crypto-presale-for-100x-roi-magacoin-finance-attracts/,"The crypto market in 2025 is seeing a new pattern of whale accumulation that analysts say could mark the next leg up. Crypto whales are busy with the profits and new ETFs. Ethereum whales are rotating to other opportunities after pushing ETH to multiyear highs. Even PEPE whales are moving money towards bigger upside plays. These movements above indicate that smart money is preparing for another wave of presale-driven returns, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly mentioned in this conversation. Bitcoin: ETF Demand Meets Profit-Taking Bitcoin leads the market again at $110,000–$111,000 near the recent high of $123,000 earlier this year. Whales and miners took profits while inflows into BlackRock and Fidelity ETFs show institutional demand remains strong. If momentum resumes, analysts say then $150,000 is possible. Bitcoin has grown to such an extent that its market size has provided a sustainability aspect to the growth curve. Thus, investors with a 100x upside potential are rotating towards smaller projects that have room for exponential growth. Ethereum: Network Strength but Limited Multiples Previously, Ethereum skyrocketed over $4,800 before a rebound over $4,400. With an increase in on-chain transactions of 63% in the last 30 day and treasury firms including Bitmine added tens of millions in ETHs the fundamentals of ETH are simply unmatched. Yet, whales are also signaling diversification. In only two days, more than 200,000 ETH left exchanges, some of which went to presales. Analysts consider Ethereum to be the leading smart contract platform. However, it is no longer a 100x play as it was for early investors. PEPE: Meme Coin Whales Look for Rotation Investors with large amounts of PEPE have begun to cash out following a big price movement. Despite the heightened trading volumes, it has been noted that large holders have started rotating their capital into presales that offer better perception of safety and stronger fundamentals. According to analysts, the trend indicates that even meme coin investors are becoming increasingly aware that investing in presales early can yield outsized gains compared to riding well-established narratives. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Analysts Say This May Be the Moment Bitcoin, Ethereum, and PEPE whales may be signalling a major rotation that analysts believe is the time for MAGACOIN FINANCE. Analysts are forecasting 100x upside potential for this presale crypto, and it has been dubbed the best crypto to buy for 2025 . Furthermore, the project has also been audited twice by HashEx and CertiK. This means its smart contract is rated as safe, secure, and fully decentralised, making it one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025. Analysts highlight that whale-backed inflows are growing, retail demand is accelerating, and the project is already being mentioned in smart money reports as a standout opportunity. With supply tightening, many believe this is one of the rare presales that could replicate Ethereum-style early returns in the coming cycle. One of the Best Crypto Presales of 2025 According to Analyst Reports MAGACOIN FINANCE is often featured in analyst watchlists as one of the top crypto presales for 2025, and for good reason. The team’s commitment to full transparency — including public audits and KYC verification — builds unmatched trust. These fundamentals give investors peace of mind and separate the project from unverified alternatives in the market. Conclusion The market is still mainly centered around Bitcoin and Ethereum, but PEPE shows just how quickly meme coin capital can be shifted around. But what really matters to investors looking for returns of over 1000% is where the whales go next. With whale accumulation on the rise, dual audits ensuring safety, and 100x upside predicted, MAGACOIN FINANCE has been earmarked as one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025 — and analysts warn that time is running out before early allocations close.

50842631,568336,1756432850,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50842631.jpeg,$40M Bitcoin Treasury Launch Marks South Korea’s First Institutional Crypto Move,https://bitcoinist.com/40m-bitcoin-treasury-marks-south-koreas-first/,"South Korea has officially entered the institutional Bitcoin race with Bitplanet, a rebranded firm formerly known as SGA, unveiling a $40 million BTC treasury. This historic move aligns Bitplanet as the first company in the country to integrate Bitcoin into its corporate reserves, marking a major shift in financial strategy and signaling growing institutional adoption of digital assets. The transition to Bitplanet followed a corporate restructuring led by Asia Strategy Partners, now the firm’s largest shareholder. The rebranding reflects a bold pivot toward blockchain-driven financial planning, aligning with global trends where corporations increasingly treat Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. South Korea’s First $40M Bitcoin Treasury By committing $40 million to Bitcoin , Bitplanet has become the first institutional-grade treasury in South Korea to embrace digital assets at scale. The move goes beyond simple diversification; it represents confidence in Bitcoin as a hedge against traditional market risks. Backed by Asia Strategy Partners, the initiative bridges conventional finance with the digital economy. Analysts suggest this could inspire other South Korean corporations to follow suit, reshaping treasury management practices in the region. If successful, Bitplanet’s model may serve as a blueprint for future institutional crypto adoption across Asia. Challenges and Opportunities Ahead Despite its unique move, Bitplanet faces hurdles. South Korea’s regulatory stance on cryptos remains cautious, requiring firms to deal with evolving compliance rules. Added to this are Bitcoin’s price volatility and heightened investor scrutiny, which could test Bitplanet’s long-term strategy. Still, the significance of this launch cannot be overstated. As Asian firms like Japan’s Metaplanet and Korea’s own K Wave Media increase Bitcoin holdings, Bitplanet’s entry solidifies South Korea’s place in the global race toward institutional Bitcoin adoption. The outcome of its $40 million bet will be closely monitored by investors, regulators, and competitors alike. Bitplanet’s $40 million Bitcoin treasury marks a turning point in South Korea’s financial history. With strong backing and a bold strategy, the firm positions Bitcoin as more than speculation, emerging as a preferred digital asset in Asia.

In a significant development, Bloomberg reports that Coinbase is rapidly emerging as a dominant force in Coinbase crypto lending to the demanding crypto mining industry. This transformation marks a pivotal moment, especially after the dramatic collapses of previous industry giants like Celsius and BlockFi left a substantial void. The Rise of Coinbase Crypto Lending in a Shifting Landscape Coinbase, traditionally known for its robust exchange and secure custody services, is now expanding its financial infrastructure to become a crucial lifeline for mining companies. This strategic move positions the company beyond its core offerings, demonstrating its adaptability and ambition within the broader crypto ecosystem. Indeed, the need for stable financial partners has never been more critical for miners. Several prominent mining firms are already leveraging this new opportunity: CleanSpark (CLSK) : Expanding its credit lines, indicating strong confidence. Riot Platforms (RIOT) : Bolstering its financial capacity for growth. Hut 8 (HUT) : Strengthening its operational funding with reliable support. These expansions highlight the trust and reliance the industry is placing on Coinbase’s new lending capabilities. Therefore, Coinbase is not just filling a gap; it’s redefining the landscape of financial support for crypto miners. Why Mining Firms Need Robust Coinbase Crypto Lending Solutions Crypto mining is an incredibly capital-intensive endeavor. Brian Dobson, a managing director at Clear Street, a New York-based fintech firm, aptly explains the immense financial demands. Mining companies require substantial capital for various critical aspects: High-cost equipment : Advanced ASIC miners are expensive, requiring significant upfront investment. Power needs : Operating these machines consumes vast amounts of electricity, leading to considerable ongoing costs. Transition to AI infrastructure : As the industry evolves, miners are increasingly looking to diversify into AI, which also demands substantial capital outlay. Consequently, having a reliable and well-capitalized lender like Coinbase is paramount for these companies to not only sustain their operations but also to innovate and expand. The availability of consistent Coinbase crypto lending allows these firms to plan for long-term growth and stability, rather than facing uncertainty. Navigating the Future: Regulatory Tailwinds and Coinbase Crypto Lending The timing of Coinbase’s expansion into lending is particularly noteworthy. Brian Dobson also pointed out that Coinbase’s acceleration in building out its financial infrastructure is partly fueled by a more favorable regulatory environment. Specifically, the potential for a pro-cryptocurrency stance under a future Trump administration is creating optimistic conditions for growth and innovation within the sector. This supportive regulatory outlook could provide several benefits: Increased clarity : Clearer rules reduce uncertainty for lenders and borrowers alike. Reduced risk : A more predictable environment can lower the perceived risk associated with crypto-related financial services. Enhanced growth : Easier access to capital can spur further investment and expansion across the crypto mining industry. Therefore, as the regulatory landscape potentially becomes more accommodating, the role of Coinbase crypto lending is set to become even more central to the industry’s continued development and success. A New Era of Financial Stability for Crypto Mining Coinbase’s emergence as a premier lender to the crypto mining industry represents a significant evolution. By stepping into the void left by former lenders, Coinbase is not merely offering loans; it is actively shaping the future stability and growth of a crucial sector within the digital asset economy. This strategic pivot solidifies its position as a multifaceted financial powerhouse, ready to support the next wave of innovation in cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What prompted Coinbase to enter crypto lending for miners? A1: Coinbase stepped into this role following the collapse of previous major crypto lenders like Celsius and BlockFi, which left a significant gap in financial services for mining companies. Q2: Which major mining companies are utilizing Coinbase’s lending services? A2: Prominent firms such as CleanSpark (CLSK), Riot Platforms (RIOT), and Hut 8 (HUT) are expanding their credit lines with Coinbase. Q3: What are the primary capital needs of crypto mining companies? A3: Mining companies require substantial capital for high-cost equipment, significant power needs, and the ongoing transition toward advanced AI infrastructure. Q4: How does the regulatory environment impact Coinbase’s lending expansion? A4: A pro-cryptocurrency regulatory environment, such as the one potentially fostered by a future Trump administration, is accelerating Coinbase’s expansion by creating more favorable and predictable conditions for crypto-related financial services. Q5: What makes Coinbase a reliable lender compared to previous firms? A5: Coinbase’s established reputation as a leading exchange and custody provider, coupled with its strategic expansion into robust financial infrastructure, positions it as a more stable and trustworthy lending partner for the industry.

At the same time, altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE are gaining traction for diversification, offering a fresh option for traders seeking ROI beyond Layer 1 giants. Avalanche’s Institutional Push and Real-World Integration Avalanche has been securing notable wins in institutional adoption. AVAX recently became the second-largest holding in BlackRock’s BUIDL Fund, with over $53.8 million tokenized on-chain. Bloomberg analysts estimate a 90% chance that the SEC will approve Grayscale’s Avalanche Trust ETF by December 2025, which would mark a key milestone for mainstream adoption. The ecosystem is also expanding. Avalanche Bridge V2 strengthens cross-chain functionality, while AVAUSD, a native stablecoin, boosts participation in DeFi. Partnerships add further weight — from FIFA integrations to the launch of the Avalanche Card, a Visa-backed payment solution. These developments have led to projections of AVAX trading between $25.13 and $50.80 by mid-2026, underlining its near-term recovery path. Cardano’s Governance and Institutional Momentum Cardano is prioritizing governance upgrades and network transparency. The Chang hard fork, expected by December 2024, introduces community-driven decision-making, enabling ADA holders to vote on core protocol changes. The Ouroboros Leios consensus model further enhances scalability, aiming to attract developers and strengthen its DeFi footprint. Institutional adoption is also part of the story. Grayscale has allocated 18.5% of its Smart Contract Fund to ADA, while discussions around a Cardano ETF could open the door to mainstream investors. Partnerships are equally diverse, ranging from NASA to the UNDP and FC Barcelona, signaling wider applicability in governance and supply chain sectors. Analysts expect ADA to target $25.89 by 2035, framing it as a longer-term play compared to Avalanche’s nearer-term push. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Diversification and Strategic ROI Play While Avalanche and Cardano work to regain trust, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving out its own lane as a diversification choice. Priced under $0.0005, it sits in a range that allows for easy price movements with minimal capital inflow, benefiting those who join early.

The proposal, submitted through an S-1 registration statement, would use price data from CF Benchmarks, which aggregates information across multiple crypto exchanges. If approved, the fund would mark the first SEI-linked ETF available to U.S. investors. What is SEI? SEI is the native token of the Sei blockchain, a layer-1 network launched in August 2023. The platform focuses on decentralized exchange trading infrastructure and marketplace activity. The token itself can be used to pay transaction fees and participate in governance decisions. As of now, SEI trades around $0.30, placing it in the mid-70s by market capitalization rankings. Custody and Staking Options Under the plan, Coinbase Custody Trust Company would serve as the custodian for SEI held by the ETF. In its filing, 21Shares also raised the possibility of staking SEI to generate extra income for the fund. However, the firm emphasized it is still assessing whether staking could expose investors to legal or tax complications. Competing Applications The move comes just months after Canary Capital filed for its own SEI ETF in April. That proposal would give both institutional and retail investors exposure to staked SEI, with returns boosted by staking rewards. Justin Barlow, executive director of the Sei Development Foundation, welcomed the idea of ETFs tied to the project. He said they act as “a gateway for broader adoption, providing a vital bridge between crypto and mainstream markets.” Broader ETF Landscape Currently, the only spot crypto ETFs approved in the U.S. track Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, there is a growing wave of applications for products tied to other blockchains. 21Shares itself already operates the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF and has applied for funds covering assets such as SUI, XRP, and Ondo Finance. Other major issuers including VanEck, Grayscale, and Bitwise are pursuing ETFs linked to Solana, Cardano, and even memecoins like Dogecoin. Regulatory Developments In an effort to streamline the process, the SEC is reportedly considering a system that would automatically approve certain ETFs after 75 days unless the agency raises formal objections. This would reduce the lengthy back-and-forth that has often slowed crypto ETF approvals in the past. 21Shares, for its part, described its SEI filing as a “key milestone in our vision to expand exchange-traded access to the SEI Network.” Outlook With two filings now on the table, the race is on to see which firm, if any, will bring the first SEI ETF to U.S. markets. While regulatory hurdles remain, the growing number of applications suggests rising demand for diversified crypto investment products that go beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. For SEI, approval of such a fund could mark a major step in its journey from a newly launched blockchain to a mainstream investment asset.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SEI|MARKET|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-08-29 02:31:51

The episode, hosted by Camilla Araujo and fellow influencer Julia Filippo, combined casual conversation with discussions about investment strategies. During the show, Filippo sought guidance on investing, to which Araujo responded by recommending cryptocurrency. She then revealed that her XRP holdings are valued at approximately $1.3 million. Araujo also expressed optimism regarding XRP’s future price potential. Based on her calculations, she suggested that if the token reaches $10 per unit, her holdings could increase fivefold. Given that XRP was trading near $2 at the time of her disclosure, this implies she owns roughly 500,000 XRP. The announcement quickly spread across social media, sparking conversations among investors and analysts. While some members of the community treated the revelation as a humorous or ironic signal, others interpreted it as an indication of rising mainstream interest in the token. ""I have $1.3 million in XRP."" pic.twitter.com/RXwbh2TCTS — Altcoin Daily (@AltcoinDaily) August 28, 2025 Institutional Interest in XRP The discussion surrounding Araujo’s holdings coincides with an increase in institutional activity in XRP markets. CME Group’s XRP futures contracts recently surpassed $1 billion in open interest within three months, reflecting growing institutional engagement. Additionally, futures-based XRP ETFs have accumulated over $800 million in assets, with daily trading volumes steadily increasing since their launch. Despite this momentum, the absence of major asset managers from the XRP ETF market remains notable. Nate Geraci, President of ETFStore, commented on the podcast that BlackRock has yet to file for an XRP ETF, though it has successfully launched products for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Geraci emphasized that this delay is unusual given the asset’s growing adoption and market capitalization. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Context and Outlook XRP’s recent performance has reinforced interest from both retail and institutional investors. The token’s market capitalization recently reached $185 billion, briefly surpassing BlackRock’s $177.8 billion, and securing a position among the top 100 global assets. Analysts, including crypto commentator Zach Rector, have suggested that BlackRock may eventually pursue an XRP ETF to capitalize on the asset’s rising prominence. While regulatory clarity remains a key factor for institutional participation, market observers note that BlackRock’s absence could limit broader adoption in the short term. The resolution of Ripple’s lawsuit against the SEC has reignited expectations for XRP-focused financial products, highlighting a growing gap between retail enthusiasm and institutional engagement. Camilla Araujo’s public disclosure underscores this trend, demonstrating that interest in XRP extends beyond traditional cryptocurrency circles. As attention from influencers and the broader public grows, the market will continue to monitor both regulatory developments and institutional responses to assess XRP’s long-term potential.

Despite price pullbacks, Solana’s ecosystem continues to see industry-leading adoption. Meanwhile, Dogecoin holds up well in the meme coin space as liquidity and volumes continue to be strong. Analysts, however, reckon the strongest upgrade this quarter goes to MAGACOIN FINANCE , which is viewed as a rare hybrid of safety and explosive upside. Solana: Revenue Leader Despite Market Volatility The current price of Solana is around $188. The price of Solana has dropped by more than 3% in the last 24 hours. Over the last few sessions, the price corrected as the market faced technical rejections. The price of Solana has dropped by around 8-10% during that time. Support has developed at $200, and resistance is $211–$215. Despite this temporary setback, Solana remains one of the strongest ecosystems in the industry. During the last 23 weeks, the network remains ahead in blockchain revenue, generating over $1.3 billion so far this year, beating all L1 and L2 competition in H1 2025. Further institutional adoption is highlighted by Sharps Technology’s $400 million digital asset treasury on Solana. The Solana Foundation confirms that a company is buying Solana for $50 million at a discount, which illustrates growing confidence by public companies. The analysts are concerned about the futures positioning and open positionsin the Solana market, however they remain bullish on fundamentals. If the SOL manages to reclaim the $211 level, the technical upside could lead to it reaching $215 and beyond, owing to its DeFi and institutional backing. Dogecoin: Meme Coin Liquidity and Retail Demand At present, Dogecoin is trading at just above $0.211, which is up just above 0.7%. Amid a market capitalization of $30.8 billion and a daily trading volume of about $2.7 billion, retail is still participating. Meme coin demand is steady. Over the last 48 hours, there haven’t been any major protocol upgrades and partnership announcements for Dogecoin, however, Dogecoin continues thriving as a community and meme-driven asset. Due to its traditional retail following and liquidity, it is often ranked as one of the highest networks by engagement. Traders who are looking for a meme coin to trade have DOGE in mind, which has remained stable during the market consolidation. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Analysts Deliver Major Price Prediction Update As Solana and Dogecoin gather momentum, analysts have made a major upgrade to MAGACOIN FINANCE, deeming it a safer high-upside play. The project has passed all tests and is rated completely safe, secure, and fully transparent following double audits from HashEx and CertiK. MAGACOIN FINANCE is unique in that it balances safety and growth. It offers a perfect mix of security and accelerating community adoption, unlike speculative meme coins. Whale inflows are on the rise, early retail momentum is strong, and its presale structure is designed to ensure scarcity. Analysts say this convergence of demand and transparency explains why it is being framed as one of the smartest plays of the year . Forecasts suggest 300x growth potential, and with a KYC-verified team plus thousands of investors already on board, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being positioned as one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025 before allocations run out. One of the Best Crypto Presales of 2025 According to Analyst Reports MAGACOIN FINANCE is often featured in analyst watchlists as one of the top crypto presales for 2025, and for good reason. The team’s commitment to full transparency — including public audits and KYC verification — builds unmatched trust. These fundamentals give investors peace of mind and separate the project from unverified alternatives in the market. Conclusion Solana continues to impress with institutional adoption and ecosystem strength, while Dogecoin remains a key retail-driven asset with consistent liquidity. Yet, analysts argue that the strongest upgrade this quarter belongs to a presale project. With double audits, a transparent team, and forecasts of 40x upside, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being recognized as the safer high-upside play — and one of the most compelling cryptos to buy in 2025 before allocations disappear.

These investment vehicles are capturing considerable attention, especially after a remarkable streak of positive performance. What does this consistent inflow mean for the future of Ethereum and the broader crypto market? What’s Driving the Momentum in US Spot ETH ETFs? Recent data highlights a compelling story for US spot ETH ETFs . On August 28, these funds collectively saw a net inflow of an impressive $39.63 million. This wasn’t a one-off event; it marked the sixth consecutive trading day of positive flows, signaling sustained investor confidence. This consistent demand underscores a growing institutional appetite for exposure to Ethereum without directly holding the cryptocurrency. Understanding these inflows is crucial. They represent real money entering the market, suggesting that investors are increasingly comfortable with the regulatory framework and the long-term potential of Ethereum. This trend could indicate a maturing market for digital asset investments. Which Funds Are Leading the Charge in US Spot ETH ETFs? While the overall picture for US spot ETH ETFs is positive, the flows aren’t evenly distributed. BlackRock’s ETHA product emerged as a clear leader, attracting a substantial $68.09 million in inflows. This significant figure demonstrates BlackRock’s strong market presence and investor trust. Grayscale’s Mini ETH also contributed positively, recording $6.27 million in inflows. These two funds together accounted for the bulk of the positive movement. However, it’s not all green across the board: BlackRock’s ETHA: $68.09 million in inflows, leading the pack. Grayscale’s Mini ETH: $6.27 million in inflows, adding to the positive momentum. Conversely, some funds experienced outflows, indicating a rebalancing or shifting of investor capital within the sector. Fidelity’s FETH saw net outflows of $33.45 million, and Bitwise’s ETHW recorded $1.28 million in outflows. This dynamic shows that while the sector as a whole is gaining, individual fund performance can vary significantly based on investor preferences and strategies. Why Are Consistent Inflows into US Spot ETH ETFs Significant? The consistent net inflows into US spot ETH ETFs are more than just numbers; they represent several key implications for the cryptocurrency ecosystem: Increased Institutional Adoption: The steady flow of capital, especially from major players like BlackRock, signals a growing acceptance of Ethereum as a legitimate investment asset by institutional investors. This legitimization can attract even more traditional finance participants. Market Maturation: ETFs provide an accessible and regulated pathway for investors to gain exposure to crypto. Their success suggests the market is becoming more sophisticated and integrated with traditional financial structures. Potential Price Impact: While not a direct one-to-one correlation, sustained buying pressure from ETFs can contribute to price stability and potentially upward movement for Ethereum, as more ETH is effectively taken off the open market by these funds. Enhanced Liquidity: Higher trading volumes and capital in ETFs generally lead to better liquidity for the underlying asset, making it easier for large investors to enter and exit positions without significant price impact. These factors collectively paint a promising picture for Ethereum’s role in the evolving financial landscape. The continued positive sentiment around US spot ETH ETFs could set a precedent for other digital assets. What Challenges Do US Spot ETH ETFs Still Face? Despite the exciting growth, the journey for US spot ETH ETFs isn’t without its hurdles. Regulatory scrutiny remains a primary concern. Governments worldwide are still grappling with how to best regulate the volatile and rapidly evolving crypto space. Changes in policy could impact the operational framework and investor appeal of these ETFs. Furthermore, market volatility is inherent to cryptocurrencies. While ETFs aim to provide a more stable investment vehicle, they are still exposed to the price swings of Ethereum. Economic downturns or unexpected crypto-specific events could trigger outflows, challenging the sustained growth observed recently. Investors must consider these risks when evaluating US spot ETH ETFs . In conclusion, the consistent six-day streak of net inflows totaling $39.6 million into US spot ETH ETFs is a powerful indicator of shifting tides in the investment world. It reflects a growing confidence among investors and a significant step towards the mainstream adoption of digital assets. As major players continue to attract capital, the narrative around Ethereum’s role in diversified portfolios strengthens, promising an exciting future for this innovative asset class. Frequently Asked Questions About US Spot ETH ETFs Q1: What are US spot ETH ETFs? A: US spot ETH ETFs are exchange-traded funds that directly hold Ethereum (ETH) as their underlying asset. They allow investors to gain exposure to ETH’s price movements without needing to buy and store the cryptocurrency themselves. Q2: Why are the recent inflows into US spot ETH ETFs significant? A: The recent, consistent inflows are significant because they indicate growing institutional and retail investor confidence in Ethereum as an asset, signaling increased market maturity and potential for broader adoption within traditional finance. Q3: Which funds are currently leading in net inflows for ETH ETFs? A: According to recent data, BlackRock’s ETHA has led the inflows, followed by Grayscale’s Mini ETH, demonstrating strong investor interest in these particular offerings. Q4: What are the potential risks associated with investing in US spot ETH ETFs? A: Key risks include market volatility inherent to cryptocurrencies, regulatory changes that could impact the funds, and the potential for economic downturns to trigger outflows. Investors should be aware of these factors. Q5: How do US spot ETH ETFs differ from directly owning Ethereum? A: ETFs offer a regulated and accessible way to invest in Ethereum without the complexities of managing private keys, wallets, or dealing with cryptocurrency exchanges directly. However, direct ownership gives you full control and potential for staking rewards, which ETFs may not pass on. If you found this analysis of US spot ETH ETFs insightful, don’t keep it to yourself!

An insightful analysis suggests that the long-awaited Bitcoin bull market could finally kick off this autumn. For investors closely watching the digital asset space, understanding the forces at play is crucial. This deep dive explores why an expert anticipates a significant shift in market dynamics. Is the Bitcoin Bull Market Finally Here? According to CryptoDan, a respected contributor to on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, the current Bitcoin market cycle is showing unique characteristics. We are experiencing a more prolonged cycle compared to historical patterns. This extended phase has led many to question the timing of the next major uptrend. One key observation from CryptoDan’s analysis involves on-chain data. The proportion of Bitcoin held for over one year is increasing, but at a noticeably slower pace than in previous cycles. This metric often signals conviction among long-term holders, and its current trajectory indicates a nuanced market sentiment. Why is This Bitcoin Bull Market Different? Several factors contribute to this evolving market landscape. CryptoDan highlights a few significant influences that are shaping the upcoming Bitcoin bull market : Spot ETF Introduction: The approval and launch of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have dramatically altered market structure. These financial products provide traditional investors with easier access to Bitcoin, changing capital flows. Institutional and National Adoption: Increased interest and adoption from institutions and even nations are also playing a role. This growing mainstream acceptance brings new money and long-term commitment into the ecosystem. Altcoin Capital Flows: Interestingly, Bitcoin’s rallies have repeatedly stalled when funds shift into altcoins. This dynamic suggests a more diversified investor base, where capital can quickly move between different digital assets, impacting Bitcoin’s momentum. These elements collectively create a market that behaves differently from past cycles, demanding a fresh perspective on future movements. Key Catalysts for the Autumn Bitcoin Bull Market Looking ahead, the analysis points to specific events that could ignite the anticipated Bitcoin bull market this autumn and winter. These potential catalysts are already on investors’ radars: September Interest Rate Cut Expectations: There is growing anticipation for a potential interest rate cut in September. Such a move by central banks typically makes risk assets, like cryptocurrencies, more attractive. It can signal a loosening of monetary policy, encouraging investment. Potential Spot Altcoin ETF Approvals: October could bring another significant development: the potential approval of spot altcoin ETFs. While focused on altcoins, this would likely be a net positive for the entire crypto market. It could attract more institutional capital, benefiting Bitcoin indirectly. These macroeconomic and regulatory shifts are expected to foster a more positive market sentiment, paving the way for a robust uptrend. Seizing Opportunities in the Next Bitcoin Bull Market For savvy investors, understanding these market dynamics offers a clear path forward. CryptoDan concludes that any further market corrections could present highly favorable buying opportunities. This perspective emphasizes a long-term strategy rather than short-term trading. The prolonged cycle, while perhaps frustrating for some, allows for more accumulation at potentially lower prices. Therefore, keeping an eye on market dips and having a clear investment strategy during this period could prove beneficial when the full force of the Bitcoin bull market eventually arrives. Summary: Preparing for the Anticipated Bitcoin Bull Market In conclusion, while the current Bitcoin market cycle is longer than previous ones, this complexity is driven by new factors like spot ETFs and broader adoption. Analyst CryptoDan’s insights suggest that upcoming economic and regulatory developments could set the stage for a powerful Bitcoin bull market this autumn and winter. Smart investors will view any dips as strategic entry points, positioning themselves for the next significant rally in the crypto space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is causing the current Bitcoin market cycle to be prolonged? The current cycle is prolonged due to factors such as the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs, increased institutional and national adoption, and capital flows frequently shifting into altcoins, which can temporarily stall Bitcoin’s momentum. Who is CryptoDan and what is CryptoQuant? CryptoDan is an analyst and contributor to CryptoQuant, a reputable on-chain analytics platform. CryptoQuant provides data and insights into cryptocurrency markets based on blockchain activity. How do spot Bitcoin ETFs impact the market? Spot Bitcoin ETFs provide traditional investors with an accessible way to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. This has introduced new capital into the market, influencing its structure and dynamics. What are the key catalysts expected to trigger the Bitcoin bull market? Key catalysts include the expectation of a September interest rate cut, which could make risk assets more attractive, and the potential approval of spot altcoin ETFs in October, which could boost overall crypto market sentiment. Why are altcoin capital flows relevant to Bitcoin’s price? When funds move into altcoins, Bitcoin’s rallies have often stalled. This suggests a market where capital can quickly diversify, temporarily diverting momentum from Bitcoin and influencing its short-term price action. What does ‘favorable buying opportunities’ mean for investors in a Bitcoin bull market? ‘Favorable buying opportunities’ refers to periods of market correction or dips. According to the analysis, these corrections could be strategic entry points for investors looking to accumulate Bitcoin before the anticipated bull market fully takes hold.

BlockDAG’s Price Jumps to $0.03 while Pi Network Sees Growth and Cardano Goes Bullish,https://thecoinrise.com/new-batch-out-blockdags-price-jumps-to-0-03-while-pi-network-sees-growth-and-cardano-goes-bullish/,"The altcoin market is buzzing with new updates, but only a few names are making real moves. Cardano and Pi Network are trying to hold their momentum, but challenges remain. Cardano (ADA) trend analysis shows a bullish setup, yet it needs to maintain support levels and break resistance to keep the rally alive. Meanwhile, Pi Network (PI) news updates highlight progress through Stellar’s strong growth, but also reveal growing tension within its community. In contrast, BlockDAG is making progress that feels far more concrete. With more than $386 million raised, over 25.5 billion coins sold, and pricing now at $0.03 in Batch 30, BDAG continues to place itself firmly among bullish altcoins in 2025. Cardano Trend Analysis Shows Golden Cross Momentum Cardano (ADA) has caught market attention after a nearly 20% rise this week, climbing close to $0.95. The latest Cardano trend analysis points to a golden cross, with the 9-day moving average pushing above the 21-day. This setup has often signaled major rallies. The last time ADA posted a golden cross in late 2023, it jumped 236% in weeks, moving from $0.30 to almost $1.00. The bullish case grew stronger when ADA broke through a resistance line holding since December 2023. If ADA can stay above $0.90 and push past $1.00, the next resistance may come at $1.20–$1.30. That would confirm a broader uptrend. Still, risks remain. A break under $0.90 could undo momentum and test lower support before another push higher. Optimism exists, but sustained growth will depend on buyers keeping pressure at crucial points. Pi Network News Update Shows Growth and Friction Pi Network is moving on a different track compared to ADA. The project’s base, Stellar, recently surpassed 100 million smart contract transactions, showing it can handle scale and wide adoption across DeFi projects. This milestone reflects positively on Pi, as its growth links directly to Stellar’s proven infrastructure. But community pressure is building. Many Pioneers want the Pi price to climb quickly, hoping for immediate gains. On the other hand, the Pi team is focused on longer-term goals, such as inclusivity, sustainability, and growing a fair digital economy. This clash of short-term expectations and long-term plans has created friction. Still, Stellar’s progress strengthens Pi’s case, showing it has the technical ground to deliver. The challenge lies in patience, as Pi balances fast-rising demand from its community with its own vision for structured growth. BlockDAG: Security, Academy, and Buyer Battles Drive Results BlockDAG is not only part of the bullish altcoin list in 2025, it is leading it. The presale has already raised more than $386 million, with over 25.5 billion coins sold. The coin started at just $0.001 in Batch 1 and has now risen to $0.03 in Batch 30, showing a 2,900% ROI so far. The confirmed launch price of $0.05 sets the stage for more growth. Three main features have set BDAG apart. First, its strong focus on security. BlockDAG has cleared audits from CertiK and Halborn, both known for finding hidden risks. With multi-signature measures and parallel Proof-of-Work processing, BDAG has shown that security remains a top priority. Second, the BlockDAG Academy is bringing education into its ecosystem. This three-tier learning platform issues on-chain credentials, helping users learn blockchain basics and advanced tools. By teaching and certifying people directly, BlockDAG builds trust and grows a skilled community ready to use its network. Finally, Buyer Battles have turned presale buying into a competitive event. Each day, the largest buyer receives unsold coins at no extra cost. This has kept the presale active and engaging, boosting both demand and community spirit. Miner adoption adds another layer. More than 19,500 miners have been sold, generating over $7.8 million in revenue. With the X1 mobile app and hardware miners like the X10, BlockDAG’s ecosystem is already active at multiple levels. Wrapping It Up Altcoin updates show different paths. Cardano trend analysis highlights bullish setups, but execution depends on holding support and breaking through resistance. Pi Network news points to growth tied to Stellar, but its community tension continues to shape its journey. BlockDAG, however, shows clear progress. With more than $386 million raised, a current presale price of $0.03, and over 25.5 billion coins sold, it has proven its momentum. Security audits, the BlockDAG Academy, Buyer Battles, and more than 19,500 miners sold demonstrate real adoption rather than just promises. For those tracking bullish altcoins in 2025, the contrast is sharp. Cardano has potential, Pi has its community debates, but BlockDAG shows measurable delivery. Its mix of growth, education, and market-ready systems gives it a foundation that feels built to last.

On-Chain Data Shows Bitcoin Momentum Slipping,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/warning-signs-on-chain-data-shows-bitcoin-momentum-slipping/,"Bitcoin’s price remains under pressure after retreating from its record high above $124,000 earlier this month. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $113,146, reflecting a decline of 8.7% from its recent peak, though it has recorded a modest 1.8% daily increase. The movement highlights ongoing volatility, as investors weigh both on-chain metrics and broader market sentiment to determine whether the bull cycle can regain strength. Analysts have pointed to a shift in behavior among large traders, particularly on Binance, the world’s largest exchange by volume. According to Arab Chain, a contributor to CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, the activity of whales, investors with large holdings, has played a significant role in recent corrections. His analysis of August trading activity suggests that weakened momentum and renewed selling pressure may explain the inability of Bitcoin to sustain its highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin And The September Curse: Can This Time Be Different? Whale Activity on Binance Signals Weakening Momentum Arab Chain noted that throughout July, Bitcoin fluctuated between $118,000 and $122,000 in what he described as a “trendless” market, with low volatility and limited directional moves. During this period, inactive deltas, which measure the circulation of older coins, declined, suggesting whales had paused selling or temporarily exited the market. However, by mid-August, the trend reversed as inactive deltas surged, signaling that long-held coins were again being moved and potentially sold. This activity coincided with Bitcoin’s drop below $112,000, with the Delta indicator remaining near zero, an absence of clear buying pressure. Arab Chain explained that the lack of demand amid increased coin circulation typically results in corrections. “Large investors are selling again without a strong wave of new buyers emerging to balance the effect. This isn’t the end of the bullish cycle, but the momentum is starting to lose steam,” he said. He added that future price movements may depend on whether new catalysts, such as macroeconomic developments or institutional inflows, can reignite demand. Bitcoin Exchange Data Highlights Mixed Sentiment Another CryptoQuant analyst, TraderOasis, examined several metrics to provide further context. He observed that the Coinbase Premium Index, which compares trading activity between US exchanges and global platforms, showed accumulation even as prices fell. This suggests some investors, possibly institutions, were buying during the dip. However, he flagged caution given that the funding rate remained positive, a sign that traders were still leaning bullish even as prices declined, raising concerns about the risk of a liquidity reset. TraderOasis also pointed to open interest, or the number of outstanding derivatives contracts, as a key factor. He argued that open interest often acts as support or resistance relative to spot price. Currently, open interest sits above the market price, which could act as resistance unless broken. “If this level is broken, the price will continue to rise,” he noted. Together, these insights reveal a complex backdrop. While long-term adoption metrics and institutional buying remain supportive, short-term dynamics show cautious sentiment and potential for volatility. With whales selling, stablecoin inflows rising, and derivatives markets heating up, Bitcoin’s next move will likely depend on whether demand can reassert itself strongly enough to offset recent profit-taking.

Technical studies show XRP holding strong around the $2.90 support, with Elliott Wave models pointing to a 74% upside. Beyond XRP, newer projects are starting to make noise. MAGACOIN FINANCE , recently audited by HashEx, is being tipped as one of the top altcoins for 2025 . Many investors now weigh whether to chase the $5 XRP target or pivot toward a rising star that could rival the best crypto to buy now. Analysts Double Down on XRP Price Forecast Toward $5 A growing number of technical analysts maintain confidence in the XRP price forecast climbing to $5 in 2025. Market data shows XRP holding strong around $2.90 with consistent buy-side demand, reinforcing the case for a bullish breakout. XRP 1Y price chart Beyond technical signals, the looming XRP ETF approval remains the most influential factor. Institutional access to a regulated product would open the doors for pension funds and asset managers. Analysts argue that once these inflows begin, XRP could position itself among the best altcoin to buy now , especially for investors seeking regulated exposure rather than speculative trading. With Gemini launching an XRP credit card and rumors of JP Morgan acquiring XRP , the XRP price could potentially pump. Source At the same time, comparisons with XRP vs Bitcoin 2025 highlight how altcoins may outperform in percentage terms. While Bitcoin often dominates headlines, investors searching for higher upside are keeping XRP firmly on their watchlist. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Rising Contender With 1700% Potential While XRP is chasing its $5 milestone, MAGACOIN FINANCE has started to capture attention as a fresh contender. Market projections suggest a potential 1700% upside, backed by a structured roadmap and fundamentals that appeal to long-term investors. Unlike legacy assets, MAGACOIN FINANCE positions itself as a growth play where early adoption could bring the highest returns. Importantly, the project underwent a full security audit by HashEx, one of the most respected smart contract audit firms in blockchain. Passing all checks adds a layer of trust for new investors who often weigh risk heavily when selecting the best crypto to buy now . With interest shifting away from older large-cap coins, MAGACOIN FINANCE is often mentioned alongside the top altcoins for 2025. Touted as One of the Best Altcoins to Buy by Analysts Touted as one of the best altcoins to buy by crypto analysts, MAGACOIN FINANCE is earning that title through its unique mix of credibility and upside potential . Its presale is attracting strong demand from long-term holders who value security , team transparency , and a roadmap built for serious scalability in 2025 and beyond. Final Word: Is XRP or MAGACOIN the Best Bet for 2025? The race toward XRP price prediction 2025 hinges on whether the SEC grants XRP ETF approval . If approved, analysts expect XRP to surge toward $5, reinforcing its place among the best altcoin to buy now for institutional investors. That said, the conversation has expanded beyond XRP alone. With bold forecasts of 1700% growth, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving out space as a rising star. Strong fundamentals, a HashEx audit, and a clear roadmap push it into discussions about the best crypto to buy now , especially for those who want exposure to projects outside the traditional top ten. In short, XRP remains a strong candidate for institutional-driven growth, but MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a high-upside alternative.

50846466,568390,1756436449,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50846466.jpeg,Chainlink Partners With US Department Of Commerce To Bring Macroeconomic Data On-Chain,https://bitcoinist.com/chainlink-us-department-of-commerce-data-on-chain/,"Chainlink and the US Department of Commerce (DOC) announced their collaboration to deliver key government macroeconomic data on-chain, aiming to improve transparency and unlock new use cases for blockchain markets. Chainlink Brings Economic Data On-Chain On Thursday, the US Department of Commerce and decentralized oracle provider Chainlink unveiled that they had partnered to bring crucial macroeconomic data on-chain from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). The new Chainlink Data Feeds aim to deliver critical information around key US economic data points, including Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, and Real Final Sales to Private Domestic Purchasers. Data on the level and percentage change of Real GDP, PCE Price Index, and Real Final Sales to Private Domestic Purchasers are now available on-chain for consumption. This data will be updated monthly or quarterly as applicable. Additionally, the data will be available across ten blockchain ecosystems initially, including Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, Botanix, Ethereum, Linea, Mantle, Optimism, Sonic, and ZKsync. The announcement highlighted that bringing the US government data on-chain “unlocks innovative use cases for blockchain markets,” like automated trading strategies, increased composability of tokenized assets, the issuance of new types of digital assets, real-time prediction markets for crowdsourced intelligence, transparent dashboards powered by immutable data, and DeFi protocol risk management based on macroeconomic factors. “As the industry-standard oracle platform, Chainlink supports one of the largest ecosystems in Web3, leveraging secure data oracles to build advanced onchain applications—making this work a natural step forward in expanding the scope of trusted data available onchain,” Chainlink wrote. Earlier this week, US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick revealed that the DOC “is going to start issuing its statistics on the blockchain,” adding that the goal is to create a more open and accessible framework for global markets. Lutnick shared his plan to bring Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on-chain for enhanced transparency and data distribution across US government departments. He also highlighted that the initiative aligned with President Trump’s vision to make America the “crypto capital of the world.” Institutional Adoption Of Blockchain Technology This development follows the recent push to integrate blockchain technology into federal institutions. As reported by Bitcoinist, the US House of Representatives passed a bill in June to establish a Blockchain Deployment Program, aiming to develop best practices and explore the adoption of blockchain in multiple areas. Introduced in February by Republican Representative Kat Cammack, HR 1664, also known as the Deploying American Blockchains Act of 2025, directs the US Secretary of Commerce to lead the national efforts, requiring him to serve as the President’s principal advisor for the deployment, use, application, and competitiveness of blockchain and other DLT, and take the actions necessary to support the US leadership in this sector. The bill, co-sponsored by Democratic Representative Darren Soto, establishes that the Secretary of Commerce must encourage and improve coordination among Federal agencies for the deployment of these technologies to offer federal support. It’s worth noting that Chainlink Labs has also met with several key US government officials and regulators to provide policy recommendations aimed at accelerating the growth of the blockchain industry. Notably, their team had several meetings with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) staff to address core issues on broker-dealer and transfer agency compliance using public blockchain infrastructure. Moreover, Chainlink’s founder, Sergey Nazarov, recently met with Tim Scott, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, to discuss the highly anticipated market structure bill and how it could enable the rapid growth of the blockchain industry in the US.",Crypto News|Blockchain Adoption|Blockchain Technologhy|chainlink|Chainlink blockchain|Chainlink ecosystem|LINK|LINKUSDT|US Department of Commerce|US DOC|US Secretrary of Commerce,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|LINK|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-29 03:00:49

Referencing Mr Pool, Tuck described a $1,000 target for 2030 as FUD, suggesting that XRP could reach the five-digit range before the end of 2025. Understanding the Target Range The numbers referenced carry significant implications. A five-digit XRP value would place the token far beyond previous forecasts, suggesting unprecedented capital inflows and institutional adoption. Traditionally, XRP has been discussed in the context of cross-border payments and tokenization. For the digital asset to achieve such a valuation, adoption at the scale of global financial infrastructure would likely be necessary, along with deep integration into payments, liquidity management, and potential use as tokenized assets. While some analysts are confident that the digital asset can reach $1,000 by 2030 , the conversation now extends into whether those figures might actually underestimate XRP’s trajectory. If Mr Pool’s coded messaging is to be interpreted literally, the implication is that the timeline has been significantly accelerated, and the asset could surpass $10,000 this year. The Final Piece of FUD: ""XRP $1,000 by 2030"" Bro … ALL AT ONCE XRP 5 Digits – 2025 #XRP pic.twitter.com/s6irbPIVc2 — Tuck Ricco (@dde_mo2442) August 27, 2025 Reactions From XRP Community The community responses to Ricco’s post reflect a mix of optimism and skepticism. One commenter pointed out that even if $1,000 by 2030 were true, XRP would still outperform all other tokens. The potential to hit $10,000 before the end of the year would set XRP apart in an unprecedented way. Another commenter attempted to break down Mr Pool’s message, setting a timeline that would see the digital asset reach double digits in September, triple digits in October, quadruple digits in November, and finally hit the five-digit range in December. Other participants approached the claim with caution. One commenter questioned whether regulation, institutional adoption, and the tokenized asset markets could realistically align within such a short period. Similarly, another user described the projection of five digits by 2025 as unrealistic, though he acknowledged that the symbolism in Mr Pool’s message seemed to point toward this outcome. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Road Ahead The debate over XRP’s long-term valuation remains ongoing. On one hand, expectations of a price surge to five digits by 2025 highlight the deep conviction among segments of the community. On the other hand, skepticism remains strong, with questions about how rapidly global adoption and institutional-scale liquidity can materialize. Whatever path XRP follows, the worst-case scenario would send it to the top of the crypto market. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

They offer convenience, liquidity, and often lower entry barriers compared to direct crypto purchases. Furthermore, the regulatory oversight associated with these products provides an added layer of security and transparency. However, investors should always consider the broader market dynamics.

ETH is now showing bearish signs and might gain bearish momentum if it declines below $4,400. Ethereum is still struggling to settle above the $4,630 zone. The price is trading below $4,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a bullish trend line with support at $4,550 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could extend losses and dive if there is a close below $4,400 in the near term. Ethereum Price Dips Again Ethereum price started a recovery wave after it tested the $4,320 zone, like Bitcoin . ETH price was able to climb above the $4,400 and $4,450 resistance levels. The price surpassed the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the key decline from the $4,955 swing high to the $4,310 low. However, the bears remained active near the $4,630 resistance zone. There were two attempts, but the bulls failed to gain strength. The 50% Fib retracement level of the key decline from the $4,955 swing high to the $4,310 low is acting as a barrier . The price reacted to the downside below $4,600. Besides, there was a break below a bullish trend line with support at $4,550 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $4,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $4,550 level. The next key resistance is near the $4,600 level. The first major resistance is near the $4,630 level. A clear move above the $4,630 resistance might send the price toward the $4,720 resistance. An upside break above the $4,720 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,800 resistance zone or even $4,880 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $4,550 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $4,440 level. The first major support sits near the $4,400 zone. A clear move below the $4,400 support might push the price toward the $4,320 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $4,250 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $4,150.

Traders are eyeing XRP and Hedera as two of the strongest movers heading into the month, while MAGACOIN FINANCE is being flagged as one of the best altcoins to buy in 2025. The potential is high, considering 100x gains are possible and the bonuses offered to early buyers will already be locked-in. Analysts say this may make September one of the most critical entry points of the year. XRP Analysis In 2025, XRP made history by becoming the fastest contract to hit 1 billion in open interest on a CME Group derivatives market. That places it in the same category as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana and it indicates just how quickly institutional investment is lapping up XRP. The increased liquidity translates into narrower spreads and more stability in prices, which contributes to confidence. The $1.25 billion acquisition of Hidden Road by Ripple contributed to the current trend but made it easier to connect XRP with conventional markets at institutions. In the meantime, Ripple released its stablecoin RLUSD on the XRP Ledger, which increased its usage. More than 300 banks have already implemented RippleNet to make payments, thus its adoption is not slowed down. The regulatory side: SEC case is now a thing of the past of Ripple. That removed a big obstacle and made a way to more listings, funds, and ETFs. As Bitcoin surges and lifts the entire market, watchers anticipate XRP to breach a resistance at about $3.10. In case it successfully penetrates the price, price targets between $3.34 and more are possible; and a drop beneath the price values of $2.80 indicates a temporary correction. Hedera (HBAR) Analysis Hedera also comes under the limelight but due to its different kind of set up. It is operated by a council of international corporations, a feature that makes it special in terms of governance compared to most of the other blockchains. With the ability to process quick low-cost transactions, the network has been increasing its presence in supply chains, DeFi, and digital identifications. Network activity is on the increase with increased number of users and transactions being recorded on a monthly basis. The above growth along with the staking rewards keeps its holders busy and makes the system more resilient. Analysts are optimistic of HBAR given that its market cap is yet to be compared to the size of its technology. As 2025 brings the attention back to those platforms that can really scale, Hedera is well positioned. Provided that the current resistance levels are overcome, HBAR could continue its gains into September along with other altcoins. MAGACOIN FINANCE — Analysts Say It’s the Best Altcoin to Buy Right Now With the predicted bull run expected in September, MAGACOIN FINANCE is standing out as the best altcoin to buy right now . Even investing a small amount of $2,500 when the whales have yet to move in could give an investor up to 100x returns , analysts suggest. A meticulous roadmap, complete transparency and a smart contract audit endorsed by top blockchain companies have seen MAGA already gain thousands of investors. Early buyers are also securing a 50% EXTRA BONUS with code PATRIOT50X — adding to the urgency as FOMO builds around one of 2025’s most talked-about altcoins. Analysts Rank MAGACOIN FINANCE a Leading Crypto Presale for 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE is often featured in analyst watchlists as one of the top crypto presales for 2025, and for good reason. The team’s commitment to full transparency — including public audits and KYC verification — builds unmatched trust. These fundamentals give investors peace of mind and separate the project from unverified alternatives in the market. Conclusion As September begins, the setup across altcoins is looking stronger than it has in months. As RP currently finds itself squarely back in the spotlight, following the clearing of its regulatory hurdles and gaining substantial traction with institutions alike, what could be the next step on the roadmap? Hedera is encouraging adoption via its enterprise-based governance structure and rapidly expanding application niches that may allow the network to become one of the most usable in practical use. Both coins have solid upside potential going into September. But it is MAGACOIN FINANCE that analysts say could turn the book around the investors. With its roadmap already in motion, its security audit passed, and forecasts pointing to gains as high as 100x, it’s being talked about as the altcoin to watch during this next rally. Provided that the market meets the bullish forecasts of September, it is possible that MAGA would turn out to be the greatest beneficiary among the three.

How can these groundbreaking concepts truly reach the masses and achieve their full potential? UXLink, a prominent Web3 social platform, offers a compelling and insightful answer: robust social infrastructure . The Distribution Dilemma: Why RWAs and Stablecoins Struggle to Thrive? Imagine a future where real-world assets, from property to art, are easily tokenized and traded on a blockchain. Or stablecoins, offering digital currency stability, are used globally without friction. These visions are powerful. However, achieving them demands more than just cutting-edge technology. A recent analysis by UXLink points out a critical limitation: the need for public recognition and, crucially, trust. Traditional financial markets have established trust models, often centralized. Web3, built on decentralization, requires a fundamentally new approach to trust. The core challenge for both RWAs and stablecoins lies in their distribution. It’s not enough to simply create these digital assets; people need to: Discover them: How do potential users find out about these new offerings? Understand their value: What benefits do they offer over traditional alternatives? Feel secure using them: How can users be confident in their safety and reliability? Without effective channels for reaching potential users and fostering genuine belief, even the most innovative Web3 solutions can struggle to gain traction and achieve widespread adoption. Unlocking Adoption: How Can Social Infrastructure Build Trust in Web3? UXLink argues persuasively that social networks are inherently trust-based ecosystems. Think about it: we often adopt new ideas or products when friends, family, or trusted community members introduce them. This fundamental human behavior is precisely what Web3 needs to harness. By leveraging existing social connections, powerful social infrastructure can bridge the gap between complex blockchain technology and everyday users. Web3’s core principle of decentralization necessitates a trust model distinct from traditional finance. Instead of relying on centralized authorities, Web3 can build trust through transparent, community-driven interactions. Platforms like UXLink, serving as vital social infrastructure , provide the essential environment where this new trust model can flourish. They allow users to engage, learn, and collectively validate new technologies and assets. UXLink’s Real World Social (RWS) Protocol: A Game-Changer for Distribution? With over 54 million users, UXLink is already a significant player in the Web3 space. The platform recently introduced its Real World Social (RWS) protocol, specifically designed to tackle these critical trust and distribution challenges. RWS aims to integrate social graphs and connections directly into the fabric of Web3, creating a more intuitive and trustworthy onboarding experience for users. By connecting individuals within trusted communities, the RWS protocol can significantly accelerate the adoption of RWAs and stablecoins. Consider these advantages: Peer Validation: Users are more likely to engage with assets recommended by their trusted social circle. Simplified Onboarding: Social connections can streamline the process of understanding and using new Web3 products. Organic Growth: Distribution becomes more natural and viral, spreading through existing networks. UXLink emphasizes that its comprehensive social infrastructure is uniquely positioned to address these dual hurdles of trust and widespread adoption effectively. Beyond Distribution: The Broader Impact of Robust Social Infrastructure The implications of strong social infrastructure extend far beyond just distributing RWAs and stablecoins. It lays the groundwork for a truly decentralized internet where communities, not corporations, drive innovation and growth. This fosters a more inclusive Web3 ecosystem, where diverse voices can contribute and benefit collectively. Robust social layers can enhance user experience across all Web3 applications, making them more engaging and user-friendly. From decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to NFT communities, the ability to connect and interact within trusted groups is paramount. This foundational layer is crucial for Web3’s long-term success and its promise of a more equitable and accessible digital future. In conclusion, UXLink’s insightful analysis into the power of social infrastructure offers a compelling roadmap for overcoming some of Web3’s most persistent challenges. By recognizing the inherent trust within social networks and building innovative protocols like RWS, platforms can unlock the vast potential of real-world asset tokenization and stablecoin adoption. This approach is not just about technology; it’s about empowering people, fostering genuine trust, and building strong communities, ultimately paving the way for a truly decentralized and widely accessible Web3 for everyone. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are Real-World Assets (RWAs) in Web3? Real-World Assets (RWAs) refer to tangible or intangible assets from the traditional financial world, such as real estate, commodities, art, or even intellectual property, that are tokenized and represented on a blockchain. This allows them to be traded and managed digitally, offering increased liquidity and accessibility. Why is distribution a problem for RWAs and stablecoins? The main challenge is gaining widespread public recognition and adoption. Unlike traditional assets, Web3 assets lack established distribution channels and often face a trust deficit from new users. People need to understand their value and feel secure enough to use them. What is Web3 social infrastructure? Web3 social infrastructure refers to decentralized platforms and protocols that facilitate social interactions, community building, and trust creation within the Web3 ecosystem. It leverages social connections to drive adoption and engagement for various Web3 applications and assets. How does UXLink’s Real World Social (RWS) protocol work? The RWS protocol integrates existing social graphs and connections into Web3. It uses the inherent trust within social networks to accelerate the adoption and distribution of digital assets like RWAs and stablecoins, making them more accessible and less intimidating for users. What role does trust play in Web3 adoption? Trust is foundational for Web3 adoption. Since Web3 operates on decentralization, it needs a new trust model, distinct from traditional centralized systems. Social infrastructure helps build this trust by allowing users to adopt new technologies within communities they already know and rely on. Found this analysis insightful?

In just 24 hours, millions of dollars in leveraged positions were wiped out, painting a vivid picture of the inherent volatility in digital asset trading. This significant financial movement affects not only individual traders but also influences broader market sentiment. What Are Crypto Futures Liquidations? For those new to the concept, a crypto futures liquidation occurs when an exchange forcibly closes a trader’s leveraged position. This happens because the trader no longer has sufficient margin to keep the position open. Essentially, if the market moves sharply against a highly leveraged bet, the exchange steps in to prevent further losses to the trader and itself. These events are common in futures trading, where investors can amplify their potential gains (and losses) by borrowing funds. However, this also means smaller price movements can trigger substantial losses, leading to liquidations. Decoding the 24-Hour Crypto Futures Liquidations Data The past day brought particularly striking figures for crypto futures liquidations , with three major cryptocurrencies bearing the brunt: Ethereum (ETH): A staggering $89.14 million in ETH futures was liquidated. Notably, long positions accounted for 73.05% of this total. This indicates that a significant number of traders were betting on ETH’s price to rise, only for it to move downwards, forcing their positions to close. Bitcoin (BTC): The flagship cryptocurrency saw $39.33 million in liquidations. Here, long positions also dominated, making up 57.86% of the total. This suggests a similar scenario to ETH, where bullish bets on Bitcoin faced a market downturn. Solana (SOL): SOL experienced $27.90 million in liquidations. Interestingly, short positions accounted for 57.97% of this figure. This implies that many traders were expecting SOL’s price to fall, but it moved upwards, leading to their short positions being liquidated. These figures highlight the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market, where both upward and downward price movements can trigger massive liquidations. Why Do These Crypto Futures Liquidations Happen So Rapidly? The rapid occurrence of these crypto futures liquidations is primarily due to several interconnected factors: High Leverage: Many traders use high leverage in futures markets, meaning they control a large position with a relatively small amount of their own capital. While this can magnify profits, it also dramatically increases the risk of liquidation with even minor price fluctuations. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile assets. Sudden news, macroeconomic shifts, or large institutional trades can trigger swift and significant price changes, catching leveraged traders off guard. Cascading Effects: Large liquidations can sometimes trigger further price movements. As positions are forcibly closed, market sell orders (for long liquidations) or buy orders (for short liquidations) are executed, potentially pushing prices further in the direction that triggered the initial liquidations, creating a cascade. Navigating Volatility: Insights from Recent Liquidations Understanding these recent crypto futures liquidations offers crucial lessons for traders. It underscores the importance of robust risk management strategies, especially when dealing with leveraged products. Manage Leverage Wisely: Avoid excessively high leverage. While tempting, it drastically increases your exposure to liquidation risk. Use Stop-Loss Orders: Implement stop-loss orders to automatically close your position if the price moves against you beyond a certain point, limiting potential losses before a full liquidation occurs. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, technical indicators, and broader economic trends that could influence cryptocurrency prices. Diversify: Spreading investments across different assets can mitigate risk, though it’s less direct for individual futures positions. These strategies help traders navigate the challenging landscape of crypto futures, aiming to protect capital even amidst extreme market swings. The recent wave of crypto futures liquidations serves as a powerful reminder of the risks associated with leveraged trading in volatile markets. While the allure of amplified gains is strong, the potential for rapid losses is equally significant. Responsible trading practices, including careful risk management and a deep understanding of market dynamics, are paramount for anyone engaging in crypto futures. Frequently Asked Questions About Crypto Futures Liquidations What is a crypto futures liquidation? A crypto futures liquidation is the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange when their margin balance falls below the required maintenance level, preventing further losses. Why did Ethereum (ETH) have higher liquidations than Bitcoin (BTC) in this period? The higher liquidation volume for ETH suggests that a larger amount of leveraged capital was positioned in ETH futures, or that ETH experienced a more significant price movement against the dominant long positions compared to BTC during the 24-hour period. What does it mean when “long positions” account for most liquidations? When long positions account for most liquidations, it means that a majority of traders were betting on the asset’s price to increase. The market then moved downwards, causing these bullish bets to be closed out. How can traders avoid crypto futures liquidations? Traders can avoid liquidations by using lower leverage, setting stop-loss orders, maintaining sufficient margin in their accounts, and carefully managing their risk exposure based on market volatility. Does a high volume of crypto futures liquidations impact the broader market? Yes, significant liquidation events can increase market volatility, contribute to price cascades, and negatively affect overall market sentiment as traders become more cautious.

With XRP making headlines after its historic legal victory and Shiba Inu pushing forward with major ecosystem updates, investors are once again reminded of how early presales can deliver life-changing gains. Now, a new contender has entered the stage — MAGACOIN FINANCE — quickly being called the best crypto presale opportunity of 2025. If you missed out on XRP at under $0.50 or Shiba Inu before its 2021 rally, MAGACOIN FINANCE might just be your second chance. Let’s dive into why this presale is generating so much hype and why many investors are calling it the best crypto presale of the year. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Best Crypto Presale of 2025 As XRP and SHIB prove, early adoption in presales can transform small investments into massive gains .

Massive Hype Cycle — The project is gaining traction across the crypto market, echoing the viral growth of meme tokens but with a utility-driven roadmap. Strategic Timing — Launching during a bullish 2025 market, when institutions are embracing altcoins and retail sentiment is turning positive again. MAGACOIN FINANCE recently went through a full smart contract audit by HashEx — and it passed without issues. This successful audit has given investors more confidence that the project is built on solid foundations. On top of that, the team’s focus on transparency and a well-structured roadmap sets it apart from many other presale tokens. Where to Buy MAGACOIN FINANCE Since fake tokens often pop up using the MAGACOIN FINANCE name, investors should stay alert when making purchases.

Analysts see it as a low-risk, high-reward entry for those positioning ahead of the 2025 altseason . XRP (Ripple) Updates: Regulatory Clarity Sparks Institutional Wave The crypto world recently celebrated a groundbreaking moment — the conclusive end of the Ripple-SEC lawsuit . On August 8, 2025, both sides filed for dismissal of appeals, officially confirming that XRP is not a security in secondary market transactions . Ripple agreed to a final $125 million civil penalty, but the verdict has removed years of uncertainty hanging over XRP. This decision places XRP in the same regulatory class as Bitcoin and Ethereum , opening doors for institutional adoption like never before. Current Price : $2.93–$2.95, with support at $2.90 and resistance around $3.05–$3.20. Year-to-Date Gains : Nearly 400% since Q4 2024 lows of $0.50. Price Predictions : Analysts target $3.70–$4.70 by year-end, with some expecting $7–$10 in 2026. XRP ETF Momentum Seven major asset managers, including Grayscale, WisdomTree, and Franklin Templeton , have filed updated XRP ETF applications. Experts suggest approval odds have surged to 95% , potentially making XRP the first altcoin ETF approved. This combination of legal clarity, ETFs, and mainstream adoption has created a strong bullish case for XRP’s future. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Updates: Ecosystem Growth Despite Volatility Shiba Inu, the original meme coin phenomenon, continues to evolve far beyond its meme origins. Currently trading between $0.00001210–$0.00001281 , SHIB shows resilience after a weekend crash, with critical support at $0.00001247 . Burn Mechanism Volatility August 2025 has been a rollercoaster for SHIB’s token burns : Aug 24–25 : Burn rate surged 4,547% , destroying 3.7M SHIB. Following Days : Burn activity collapsed by 95%, creating uncertainty. Whale & Exchange Activity A whale recently withdrew 132.3B SHIB ($1.66M) from Coinbase. Over 4.66T SHIB removed from exchanges, reducing selling pressure. Shibarium Ecosystem Growth 1.53B transactions processed in two years. 5-second block times with ultra-low fees. Over 29,572 smart contracts now live. Upcoming AI integration, Layer-3 rollout, and SHIB-backed stablecoin by 2026. Despite recent turbulence, SHIB remains a favorite among retail and whale investors, with predictions ranging from $0.000015 to $0.00005 in 2025. Final Thoughts: The Next XRP or SHIB? XRP’s legal clarity and ETF prospects, alongside Shiba Inu’s thriving ecosystem, show how the right project can generate incredible returns for early adopters. MAGACOIN FINANCE is now being compared to these giants — and it’s still in presale. If you’re searching for the best crypto presale of the year, this could be it.

James Seyffart, a well-respected voice in the industry, believes that numerous altcoin exchange-traded products are simply destined to fail. This isn’t just a casual observation; it’s a crucial insight into the evolving landscape of crypto investments, prompting both caution and strategic thinking among market participants. Why Many Altcoin ETPs Face a Dire Future James Seyffart, a prominent Bloomberg ETF analyst, recently shared a rather sobering outlook for the burgeoning market of altcoin ETPs . He clearly stated his prediction: a substantial number of these products will likely not succeed. This forecast stems from a deep understanding of market dynamics and the specific characteristics of the assets these ETPs aim to track. Seyffart specifically highlighted “long-tail assets” as the primary culprits. He describes these as tokens with small market capitalizations and, more importantly, low liquidity. Such assets, according to his analysis, are almost certain to struggle in attracting the significant capital inflows needed to sustain an ETP. Without substantial investment, these products become economically unviable, making their long-term survival questionable. Understanding the Liquidity Challenge for Altcoin ETPs The core issue for many altcoin ETPs lies in the fundamental economics of financial products. ETPs require a certain level of trading volume and investor interest to remain viable. When a product fails to gather sufficient investment levels, it becomes a burden for its issuer. Seyffart warns that products with consistently low investment are highly susceptible to delisting. This is a critical point for both issuers and potential investors. Think about it: an ETP aims to provide easy access to an underlying asset. If that asset itself is hard to buy or sell in large quantities without moving its price significantly, the ETP faces operational hurdles. Market makers, who ensure the ETP’s price tracks the underlying asset, struggle in low-liquidity environments, increasing costs and reducing efficiency. Therefore, the lack of robust liquidity directly impacts the product’s attractiveness and feasibility. The Impact of a Crowded Market on Altcoin ETPs The situation becomes even more precarious when multiple entities are vying for approval for the same altcoin. Imagine five or more applicants awaiting ETP approval for an identical altcoin. This fierce competition, coupled with the inherent low liquidity of the underlying asset, creates an environment where only a select few, if any, can truly thrive. The market simply cannot support such a crowded field for niche assets, leading to a scramble for limited capital. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) currently has a staggering 92 crypto ETFs pending review. This large number indicates a strong interest from financial institutions to offer crypto exposure to a broader investor base. However, Seyffart’s prediction serves as a stark reminder that not all applications, even if approved, will lead to successful products. Even with regulatory green lights, market demand and asset characteristics ultimately determine an ETP’s fate. What Should Investors Consider Before Investing in Altcoin ETPs? For investors, this forecast carries significant implications. It means a careful evaluation of the underlying altcoin’s fundamentals, its market cap, and its liquidity profile is paramount. Don’t be swayed solely by the novelty or hype surrounding an altcoin ETP . Instead, focus on products tracking well-established, liquid assets if you seek stability and a higher chance of long-term viability. Key Challenges and Actionable Insights for Altcoin ETPs: Low Liquidity: Small market cap altcoins often lack the trading volume necessary for efficient ETP management. Action: Prioritize ETPs tracking assets with substantial daily trading volume. Limited Investor Interest: Niche altcoins may not attract a broad enough investor base to achieve significant Assets Under Management (AUM). Action: Research the overall community and institutional interest in the underlying altcoin. Intense Competition: Multiple ETPs for the same altcoin can dilute capital inflows. Action: Be wary of highly competitive segments, as this increases the risk of delisting for weaker products. Operational Costs: Maintaining an ETP involves costs. Low AUM makes it harder to cover these expenses, increasing the risk of closure. Action: Look for ETPs that have already achieved a reasonable AUM. Understanding these challenges helps investors make more informed decisions. It’s not about avoiding all altcoin ETPs , but rather about approaching them with a realistic understanding of the risks involved, especially for those tracking less established digital assets. In conclusion, while the expansion of crypto ETPs offers exciting new avenues for investors, the warnings from experts like James Seyffart are invaluable. The future of many altcoin ETPs , especially those tied to illiquid, long-tail assets, appears bleak. Understanding these challenges is crucial for making informed investment decisions in the dynamic world of digital assets. We encourage both issuers and investors to approach this evolving market with prudence and a clear understanding of the inherent risks, prioritizing robust market fundamentals over speculative appeal. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Altcoin ETPs Q1: What are altcoin ETPs? A: Altcoin ETPs (Exchange-Traded Products) are financial instruments that allow investors to gain exposure to the price movements of various altcoins (cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin) without directly owning the underlying digital assets. They trade on traditional exchanges. Q2: Why does James Seyffart predict many altcoin ETPs will fail? A: Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart predicts failure primarily due to their focus on “long-tail assets” – altcoins with small market capitalizations and low liquidity. These assets struggle to attract sufficient capital inflows to sustain the ETPs, making them economically unviable. Q3: What are “long-tail assets” in the context of ETPs? A: In this context, “long-tail assets” refer to cryptocurrencies that have relatively small market capitalizations and low trading volumes. They are less established and less liquid compared to major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Q4: How does low liquidity affect altcoin ETPs? A: Low liquidity means it’s difficult to buy or sell large quantities of the underlying altcoin without significantly impacting its price. This creates operational challenges for ETP issuers and market makers, increasing costs and making it harder for the ETP to accurately track the altcoin’s price, ultimately deterring investors. Q5: What should investors consider before investing in an altcoin ETP? A: Investors should carefully evaluate the underlying altcoin’s fundamentals, market capitalization, and liquidity profile. Prioritize ETPs tracking well-established, liquid assets and be wary of products for niche altcoins with intense competition among issuers. Q6: How many crypto ETFs are currently pending SEC review? A: According to James Seyffart, a total of 92 crypto ETFs are currently pending review by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), indicating a significant interest in offering these products.

Spot Ether ETFs have recorded nearly $10 billion in inflows since July, far surpassing Bitcoin ETF demand over the same period. Related Reading: XRP Whales Unload Massive Bags: Distribution Or Trap? According to K33 Research, Bitcoin’s open interest has surged to a two-year high of $34 billion, raising concerns about excessive leverage, while Ethereum’s consistent capital inflows highlight growing confidence in its long-term role. Notably, a Bitcoin whale recently swapped 22,400 BTC for ETH, pushing Ethereum to a new all-time high near $4,956. This move accelerated the ETH/BTC ratio to 0.041, signaling that institutional money may be repositioning toward Ethereum’s ecosystem. Why ETH is Wall Street’s Favorite Crypto Wall Street has increasingly embraced Ethereum as the preferred blockchain for stablecoin settlements, decentralized finance (DeFi), and tokenized assets. VanEck CEO Jan van Eck even called ETH “the Wall Street token,” citing its programmable smart contracts and staking yields that set it apart from Bitcoin’s passive “digital gold” narrative. Data shows that over 19 public companies now hold 2.7 million ETH in their treasuries, leveraging staking for steady income. Similarly, investment advisers hold $1.3 billion in Ether ETF exposure, with Goldman Sachs accounting for more than half the amount. The GENIUS Act stablecoin legislation, passed earlier this year, has further boosted institutional confidence by cementing Ethereum’s role in regulated financial systems. ETH's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview Ethereum Price Predictions: $6K–$12K Targets Analysts are increasingly bullish on Ethereum’s projections. Short-term targets point to a breakout above $5,200 and potentially $6,000 in September, with some projections extending as high as $12,000 by year-end. This optimism stems from Ethereum’s dominance in stablecoin infrastructure (over $145 billion), strong ETF flows, and improving technical setups. Historically, Ethereum rallies have coincided with altcoin seasons, but experts caution that the broader market has yet to show signs of overheating. With ETH currently trading around $4,620, analysts note that holding above $4,500 support could be the launchpad for the next major leg higher.

The company is embarking on a substantial capital raise, signaling an ambitious strategy for its Luxfolio LTC investment . This development could reshape perceptions around institutional interest in Litecoin and its broader market implications. What Drives This Ambitious Luxfolio LTC Investment? Luxfolio is actively pursuing a capital increase of $73 million , as reported by Decrypt. This substantial funding is earmarked for a clear and strategic purpose: to significantly boost its holdings in Litecoin (LTC). The company has set an impressive long-term goal, aiming to secure one million LTC by 2026 . This target highlights a strong belief in Litecoin’s future trajectory and its role in Luxfolio’s portfolio. Capital Injection: Luxfolio aims to raise $73 million. Primary Use: The funds are intended to purchase additional Litecoin (LTC). Long-Term Vision: The company targets holding one million LTC by 2026. As a crypto infrastructure provider, Luxfolio plays a vital role in the digital asset ecosystem, often involved in services like mining, staking, or custody. Its decision to allocate such significant capital towards a specific asset like LTC underscores a calculated business strategy. Furthermore, Luxfolio has demonstrated transparency in its acquisition strategy, consistently disclosing its purchase information since July of last year. This consistent reporting allows investors and market observers to track the company’s progress toward its ambitious Luxfolio LTC investment goals. Why Litecoin? Unpacking Luxfolio’s Strategic LTC Investment Many might wonder why Luxfolio is placing such a significant bet on Litecoin. Often referred to as “digital silver” to Bitcoin’s “digital gold,” Litecoin offers several attractive characteristics for institutional investors. It boasts faster transaction times and a larger coin supply compared to Bitcoin, potentially offering different risk-reward profiles. Moreover, Litecoin’s established network and consistent development make it a stable, albeit sometimes overlooked, asset in the volatile crypto market. Luxfolio’s decision likely stems from a strategic analysis of Litecoin’s fundamentals and its potential for growth. Investing heavily in LTC could be seen as a move to diversify crypto portfolios, capitalize on perceived undervaluation, or simply a belief in the network’s enduring utility and adoption. This calculated approach underscores the seriousness of Luxfolio’s strategic Luxfolio LTC investment , aligning with its role as an infrastructure provider that benefits from a robust and liquid ecosystem. What Potential Market Ripples Could Luxfolio’s LTC Investment Create? A capital raise of $73 million, specifically aimed at acquiring one million LTC, is no small feat and could certainly send ripples through the Litecoin market. Such a significant institutional accumulation could lead to several outcomes: Increased Demand: A large buyer like Luxfolio consistently entering the market could create sustained buying pressure. Price Appreciation: While not guaranteed, increased demand often contributes to price appreciation for an asset. Enhanced Legitimacy: A major infrastructure provider making such a substantial Luxfolio LTC investment could signal increased institutional confidence in Litecoin, potentially attracting other large investors. However, challenges also exist. Market volatility remains a constant in the crypto space, and large-scale acquisitions always carry inherent risks. Fluctuations in price or changes in market sentiment could impact the timing and cost of Luxfolio’s purchases. Despite these, Luxfolio’s transparent and long-term strategy provides a fascinating case study in institutional crypto adoption, potentially adding significant liquidity and depth to the LTC market. A Pivotal Moment for Institutional Crypto Adoption? Luxfolio’s commitment to building out its Litecoin reserves represents more than just a company’s investment strategy; it highlights a broader trend of increasing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. This move by Luxfolio could inspire other infrastructure providers or investment firms to explore similar opportunities, further integrating digital assets into traditional financial frameworks. The company’s proactive approach in disclosing its purchases also sets a precedent for transparency in the evolving digital asset landscape, fostering greater trust and understanding. In conclusion, Luxfolio’s pursuit of a $73 million capital increase to fuel its ambitious Luxfolio LTC investment is a noteworthy development. With a clear target of one million LTC by 2026, the company is positioning itself as a major player in the Litecoin ecosystem. This strategic move not only signifies Luxfolio’s confidence in LTC but also underscores the growing institutional appetite for diverse digital assets, potentially paving the way for further mainstream adoption and stability in the crypto market.

50846468,568463,1756440038,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50846468.jpeg,VanEck CEO Calls Ethereum ‘The Wall Street Token’ As Institutional Adoption Rises,https://bitcoinist.com/vaneck-ceo-ethereum-wall-street-token/,"Investment management firm VanEck’s CEO, Jan van Eck, said on Fox Business yesterday that Ethereum (ETH) is very much “the Wall Street token.” His comments come as ETH hovers near a potential new all-time high (ATH), drawing renewed attention from both retail and institutional investors. Ethereum Essential For Stablecoin Transfers In a recent interview with Fox Business, VanEck CEO shared thoughts on ETH’s current momentum – both in terms of price and adoption. The executive said that banks must adopt the smart contract network to facilitate stablecoin transactions. For the uninitiated, stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a reserve asset like the US dollar. They combine the speed of crypto with the stability of traditional currencies, making them widely used for payments, trading, and remittances. Until recently, banks were cautious about stablecoins due to regulatory uncertainty and their association with the broader, volatile crypto market. However, following the passage of the GENIUS Act, attitudes have begun to shift. Regulators are now offering a clearer framework for digital asset operations, and commercial institutions are increasingly open to adopting stablecoins as part of their financial infrastructure. Speaking on Fox Business, Jan van Eck said it is essential for banks and commercial institutions to adopt a blockchain to enable stablecoin movements. Among the several potential candidates, the VanEck CEO thinks Ethereum holds a competitive advantage. He added: So the winner is, who’s going to be building on these blockchains? It’s going to be Ethereum or something that uses Ethereum kind of methodology, which is called EVM. This is not the first time VanEck has highlighted Ethereum’s role in the evolving digital economy. In a recent report, the firm suggested that Ethereum could one day surpass Bitcoin (BTC) as the preferred store of value, citing ETH’s declining issuance rate and expanding network utility as key drivers. Stablecoin adoption has accelerated since Donald Trump’s victory in the November 2024 US presidential election. The state of Wyoming recently launched its own stablecoin, FRNT, marking the first such initiative by a US state government. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent projected that the stablecoin market could grow to as much as $3.7 trillion by 2030. Investment banks are also weighing in as Citigroup recently estimated the market could expand sevenfold within five years. ETH Adoption Outshines Bitcoin Ethereum’s broad utility continues to give it an edge over Bitcoin. While BTC remains primarily a store of value and an inflation hedge, ETH powers decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and functions as a global settlement layer for digital payments. Against that backdrop, an increasing number of firms are actively adding ETH to their balance sheets. For example, SharpLink Gaming recently purchased another 56,533 ETH, increasing its total holdings close to 800,000 tokens. Recent exchange-traded funds (ETF) data also shows ETH ETFs outperforming their Bitcoin counterparts for seven consecutive days. At press time, ETH trades at $4,473, down 3.2% in the past 24 hours.",Ethereum|Altcoin|bitcoin|blockchain|btc|Cryptocurrency|digital currency|ETH|ethereum etf|ETHUSDT|GENIUS Act|smart contract|Stablecoins,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|BTC|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-29 04:00:38
50846484,https://timestabloid.com/?p=80666,1756440045,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Solana and Chainlink May Outperform BNB Despite $900 Price Target, Analysts Say",https://timestabloid.com/solana-and-chainlink-may-outperform-bnb-despite-900-price/,"BNB is once again approaching the $900 mark, trading near $876.94 in late August and setting up for a potential push into the $905–$920 range in September 2025. While this rally has captured attention, market experts consistently caution that Solana and Chainlink could deliver stronger returns this quarter due to network upgrades, institutional flows, and real-world adoption milestones. Alongside these two established leaders, analysts are also pointing towards the safe and audited MAGACOIN FINANCE as a standout presale altcoin for 2025, with early buyers positioning for outsized upside. BNB: Highs, But Facing Competition BNB continues to benefit from its role as the utility token of Binance’s exchange ecosystem. Price momentum has been resilient, with support holding around $816–$835 and upside resistance expected near $900–$1,000. Technical scenarios suggest that a short-term breakout is possible if ETF speculation gains traction, potentially driving average September prices toward $890. Still, analysts note that BNB’s growth ceiling appears lower than peers with stronger innovation pipelines. Without fresh catalysts beyond exchange demand and ETF speculation, BNB may remain in a sideways accumulation pattern, consolidating gains while investors rotate toward altcoins with more dynamic growth narratives. Solana: Technical Innovation and Institutional Adoption Solana has been described as a dominant force in the third quarter of 2025, thanks to a string of upgrades that continue to separate it from competitors. The Alpenglow proposal, bringing settlement speeds of 100–150 milliseconds and throughput of over 4,000 transactions per second, has made the network an attractive option for DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise settlement. Price forecasts for Solana remain wide-ranging, with bearish targets near $130–$150 and bullish scenarios climbing toward $520–$750 by the end of the year. Much of this optimism is rooted in the steady rise of institutional adoption, especially after the approval of Solana-linked ETFs and regulatory clarity around stablecoin issuance. Analysts highlight Solana’s combination of scalability, developer activity, and low transaction costs as reasons it remains one of the top altcoin picks of the quarter. Chainlink: Bullish Breakout and Ecosystem Partnerships Chainlink is also gaining momentum, with analysts pointing to a potential 60% rally in the months ahead. Price targets for Q3 sit between $26.46 and $32, with extended rallies possibly driving LINK toward the $35–$50 range. The bullish thesis centers on Chainlink’s evolving role as the backbone of decentralized finance. Recent upgrades to its Data Streams, enhanced cross-chain interoperability, and partnerships with institutional players have strengthened its positioning. Meanwhile, treasury accumulation has reduced circulating supply, providing an added layer of bullish momentum. For many, Chainlink remains not just an altcoin trade, but an essential piece of infrastructure for the future of decentralized markets. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale Contender for 2025 While Solana and Chainlink are being tipped as outperformers this quarter, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly building its case as the best altcoin to buy for 2025. Analysts highlight its growing presale base and completed audits as critical signals of long-term viability, with forecasts suggesting it could deliver stronger percentage gains than larger-cap tokens. Momentum has been building steadily as early buyers secure allocations using the PATRIOT50X code, which still unlocks a 50% presale bonus. Traders who previously focused on BNB and Solana are beginning to diversify into MAGACOIN, seeing it as a chance to replicate the type of exponential upside that smaller-cap tokens can achieve in early cycles. More than just another presale, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being positioned by market watchers as a strategic play — one that combines strong community traction with an early-mover advantage. As Solana and Chainlink strengthen their fundamentals, MAGACOIN’s appeal lies in its ability to multiply returns for those entering at this stage of the market. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is a Trusted Crypto to Buy for 2025 Growth Investors searching for a trusted early-stage project have found a strong contender in MAGACOIN FINANCE, widely ranked among the best cryptos to buy in 2025. Its smart contract passed auditing standards, and the public team has completed full KYC verification. Combined with growing community traction, these strengths make it a top-tier choice for those prioritizing safety and growth. Strategic Outlook BNB may test the $900–$950 range again in September, but its growth story is increasingly overshadowed by competitors. Solana’s technical progress and ETF-fueled adoption, Chainlink’s breakout potential, and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale momentum offer more compelling upside narratives for investors. Analysts conclude that rotating exposure toward Solana, Chainlink, and MAGACOIN FINANCE aligns with Q3’s broader innovation and adoption themes, while keeping a measured allocation in BNB to capture any ETF-driven moves remains a balanced approach for portfolios.

He described XRP as now “powering real-world data on-chain,” tying the observation directly to Ripple’s latest move in integrating oracle technology into the XRP Ledger (XRPL). This step reflects a broader trend where blockchain networks are prioritizing transparent and auditable access to external data. Partnership Between Ripple and DIA The initiative is being carried out in collaboration with DIA, an open-source oracle provider. The integration is based on DIA’s Lumina platform, which is a decentralized oracle framework. Ripple and DIA aim to deliver reliable oracle services to the XRPL , creating a system where financial data is both transparent and fully auditable. Ripple’s partnership with DIA aims to enhance how decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, tokenized assets, stablecoins, and banking systems interact with blockchain infrastructure. DIA’s Lumina framework removes reliance on “black-box” models by running all oracle activity on-chain. This ensures participants can verify data sources, giving the XRPL both transparency and compliance while maintaining an open and decentralized structure.

While the usual big names are still in the spotlight, more and more attention is shifting toward early-stage projects with fresh upside potential. Analysts are pointing to Ethereum, Binance Coin, Sui, and Pepe—with MAGACOIN FINANCE also creeping into the conversation as a new contender gaining a reputation for being one of the safest plays in the market. Here’s a closer look at why these five tokens are making waves in August 2025 and why some traders believe this presale wildcard could be one to watch closely. 1. Ethereum (ETH) – Institutional Demand Drives Record Highs Ethereum has been one of the highest-rallying cryptocurrencies this year, all thanks to the success of the ETF launches and sustained institutional demand. In August alone, ETFs have pulled in nearly $3 billion, indicating the level of institutional interest in ETH. With more than 30% of ETH staked and a DeFi TVL of $95 billion, Ethereum remains the backbone of altcoin momentum. Analysts expect ETH to reach $7,500 to $10,000 by late 2025, making it a frontrunner among the best altcoins to buy now. 2. Binance Coin (BNB) – Utility and Ecosystem Growth BNB trades near $850 with strong support around $820. Its value comes from Binance’s ecosystem — powering exchange fees, DeFi staking, and treasury programs. Analysts see potential for $940 in the near term and $1,770 by 2026. BNB’s consistent growth makes it a staple in many portfolios of the top altcoins to buy in 2025. 3. Sui (SUI) – Gaming and Real-World Assets Sui is proving itself as a scalable blockchain built for gaming and real-world assets. The network surpassed 4 billion transactions and boasts $2.72 billion in DeFi TVL. Gaming protocols like Jackson.io and tokenized gold via Matrixdock’s XAUm are expanding its ecosystem. With SUI trading near $3.5 and targets of $5, it’s one of the more innovative altcoins to buy now. 4. Pepe (PEPE) – Meme Coin With Breakout Potential PEPE is consolidating near $0.00001001, with analysts watching resistance at $0.0000125. A breakout could double its price, though risk remains high. Still, viral community energy keeps PEPE relevant, and spinoffs like Little Pepe raising $21 million prove the brand has staying power. For traders who embrace volatility, PEPE is still among the best altcoins to buy now. 5. MAGACOIN FINANCE – Secure Presale With Growing Momentum MAGACOIN FINANCE’s momentum has kept it in the spotlight. The token is moving faster across crypto circles than established tokens, with some now comparing it to the early stages of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. What sets the token apart is its growing community. Investors and traders alike are excited by the potential of the token as one of the standout altcoins. Alongside that, large investors are exiting their positions in other tokens to key into MAGACOIN FINANCE based on its low entry price and solid roadmap. For smart investors, that sends a signal as to where the market is going. MAGACOIN FINANCE may not have the backing of BNB or the institutional demand of Ethereum, but it surely has a momentum that positions it as one of the best altcoins to buy now, ahead of the altcoin season. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is the Best Crypto to Buy in 2025 If you’re searching for the best crypto to buy in 2025 , MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out for its real utility , verified transparency , and surging community interest. From clear tokenomics to an accountable team , it’s checking every box investors demand in a future billion-dollar altcoin . This is why industry insiders are watching it closely. Final Take Ethereum and Binance Coin continue to show strength backed by big institutions, Sui is carving out its place with real-world utility, and PEPE is proving that meme culture still has a seat at the table. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is stepping in as a newer, more secure option that’s starting to gain traction with investors. So, for investors wondering what are the best altcoins to buy now? This mix of proven giants and up-and-coming tokens could give traders a balanced approach heading into the next altcoin season.

Five opposition parties are actively pushing to reopen a crucial Milei LIBRA investigation into President Javier Milei’s involvement with the memecoin, LIBRA. This move comes amidst claims of substantial financial losses suffered by investors who allegedly acted on the president’s previous promotions. Why is the Milei LIBRA Investigation Being Relaunched? The core of the issue stems from President Milei’s past actions. He had openly promoted the memecoin LIBRA on his X account, drawing considerable attention to the digital asset. However, following a dramatic crash in the token’s price, many investors found themselves in a difficult financial situation. This situation initially triggered an inquiry by Argentina’s Anti-Corruption Office. Interestingly, the task force assigned to this case was later disbanded, leading to questions and concerns among the public and political figures. The opposition now seeks to revive this dormant Milei LIBRA investigation , aiming for greater transparency and accountability. Understanding the Controversy: What is LIBRA Memecoin? Memecoins are a unique and often volatile segment of the cryptocurrency market. They typically gain popularity through social media hype rather than underlying technological innovation or utility. LIBRA, in this context, appears to be one such token. The controversy surrounding the Milei LIBRA investigation highlights the inherent risks associated with these digital assets, especially when public figures endorse them. Investors, drawn by high-profile promotions, often face significant financial exposure if the token’s value plummets. The Role of Presidential Endorsement in Crypto When a head of state promotes a specific cryptocurrency, it carries immense weight and can significantly influence public perception and investment decisions. This raises important ethical and regulatory questions. For instance, is it appropriate for political leaders to endorse speculative assets? What responsibilities do they bear if their endorsements lead to investor losses? These are critical considerations that the renewed Milei LIBRA investigation seeks to address, potentially setting precedents for future engagements between politicians and the crypto space.

They spend months building credibility through presale updates, technical whitepapers, or developer showcases. BlockDAG is taking a different route altogether. By securing a sponsorship deal with Inter Milan, alongside rugby and cricket partnerships, the project is pushing itself into stadiums and TV broadcasts before its mainnet even arrives. This strategy signals more than just brand awareness; it shows that BlockDAG is positioning itself as a household name rather than a niche blockchain. With over $386M raised, 25.5B coins sold, and 200,000 holders already onboard, the scale of early adoption is undeniable. Analysts point out that visibility at this stage is exceptionally rare. For most projects, consumer-facing recognition takes years, but BlockDAG is already embedding itself into popular culture. This unusual move could prove decisive in its bid to attract global retail audiences at a pace most Layer-1s can only dream of. Sports Sponsorship as a Brand Strategy The partnership with Inter Milan, one of Europe’s most storied football clubs, instantly puts BlockDAG in front of millions of fans weekly. Add to that the Seattle Seawolves in rugby and the Seattle Orcas in cricket, and BlockDAG gains exposure across two major U.S. sports markets. These deals push the brand beyond the crypto bubble, into arenas where loyalty, culture, and visibility drive adoption. For comparison, Solana leaned heavily on NFTs before branching into branding, while Avalanche and Aptos focused primarily on developers in their early phases. BlockDAG is skipping that incremental process, moving straight into mainstream sports branding before its listing. This signals a project confident in its trajectory and determined to capture attention outside of crypto-native communities. Visibility in global sports serves a deeper purpose than recognition, it builds trust. Many everyday participants unfamiliar with crypto are more likely to engage when they see familiar names like Inter Milan associated with a project. By aligning itself with these teams, BlockDAG builds legitimacy in the eyes of an audience that traditional crypto marketing often fails to reach. Unlike projects such as Aptos ($350M in VC funding) or Avalanche ($230M raised with institutional backing), BlockDAG has built momentum without leaning on venture capital. Its $600M presale target is being fueled primarily by grassroots participation, making it one of the most decentralized fundraising models of 2025. Sponsorships accelerate this strategy by drawing attention from new demographics, people who may never have heard of a presale but recognize trusted sports institutions. Meanwhile, adoption is being reinforced by accessible participation tools. The X1 Mobile Miner app, with over 2.5M downloads, enables users to mine from their phones, making entry easy. On the hardware side, the X10 miner has sold 19,000 units, appealing to those who want deeper network engagement. This combination ensures BlockDAG converts sports-driven visibility into active participants, bridging brand awareness with practical involvement. This dual-track approach, global recognition plus onboarding tools, is the secret behind BlockDAG’s unusually high adoption figures for a presale project. Most competitors only dream of achieving this blend years after launch. Analysts on the Value of Early Visibility Analysts argue that cultural positioning is just as important as technical infrastructure. Ethereum achieved dominance not only through scalability but by becoming central to DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 branding. Solana experienced rapid growth because of its cultural alignment with NFT projects and strong retail engagement. BlockDAG is adopting a similar playbook but starting far earlier. With 4,500 developers building 300+ dApps on its EVM-compatible system, technical foundations are strong. By pairing that with mainstream sports sponsorships, BlockDAG ensures growth is being seeded both from the developer side and the cultural side. This dual appeal boosts confidence in its presale performance. At $0.03 in batch 30, with a confirmed listing target of $0.05, early participants already have a clear ROI path of 3,025%. Long-term analyst speculation places potential valuations at $1–$10, with cultural branding playing a critical role in accelerating adoption. Visibility in sports expands the reach beyond crypto circles, feeding into stronger demand post-listing. From Presale to Prime Time BlockDAG’s decision to secure sponsorships with Inter Milan and U.S. sports teams before its listing reflects an ambitious strategy: to position itself not as a niche Layer-1 but as a global consumer brand. Combined with its $386M presale, 2.5M mobile miners, and thousands of developers, the project is stepping into exchanges not just with hype, but with recognition already baked in. For most projects, achieving mainstream visibility pre-launch is nearly impossible. BlockDAG has already pulled it off. That kind of momentum doesn’t just make it a project to watch in 2025; it makes it one of the most culturally visible launches in crypto history.

The token is currently priced at $0.3486, reflecting a 19.2% decline from its all-time high of $0.4313 recorded late last year. Over the past week, the market has seen limited upward movement, with TRX trading in a narrow range, suggesting muted buying pressure. On-chain analysts are closely watching TRON’s market dynamics as it approaches a potential inflection point. According to data shared on CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, TRX is exhibiting conditions that mirror earlier phases in its history where heightened optimism preceded corrections. The combination of rising sentiment indicators and technical positioning has sparked debate on whether TRX is preparing for a breakout or facing increased risk of retracement. Related Reading: TRON Defies the Market: Outpaces Ethereum, XRP, and Solana in BTC Pair Performance Market Conditions and On-Chain Metrics CryptoQuant contributor CryptoOnchain explained that TRX is at the edge of a critical zone, with “Extreme Greed” sentiment levels dominating investor behavior. Historically, such phases have led to either price discovery above resistance or sharp pullbacks when momentum fails to sustain. The analyst noted that the gap between TRX’s spot price and its realized price has widened, indicating substantial unrealized gains in the market. This divergence often increases incentives for holders to secure profits, adding to potential selling pressure. The on-chain data further highlights that TRX is approaching its upper value band, an area typically associated with overbought conditions. CryptoOnchain noted: TRX is at a critical juncture: a breakout above the all-time high could lead to further upside, but there is also a real risk of a correction. Traders should proceed with caution. To mitigate risks, strategies such as trailing stop-losses and partial profit-taking were recommended, especially given the heightened levels of speculative optimism. Stablecoin Dominance on the TRON Network While price performance has drawn attention, another significant factor shaping TRON’s trajectory is its growing role in stablecoin settlements. CryptoQuant analyst Burak Kesmeci recently emphasized that stablecoin transfers heavily dominate TRON’s ecosystem in 2025. Data shows: USDT: over 383 million transfers. Wrapped TRX (WTRX): 3 million. PayNet Coin: 1.88 million. USDD: 585,000. This activity shows TRON’s positioning as the leading blockchain for USDT transactions, benefitting from its relatively low fees and high throughput. The passage of the US Genius Act, which reinforced the role of certain blockchains in stablecoin settlements, further boosted TRON’s relevance in global payment flows. The analyst argues that while speculative trading around TRX’s price dominates headlines, its utility-driven demand in stablecoin transfers provides a strong foundation for long-term resilience.

Nasdaq-listed Caliber is the latest to join this trend, having recently announced the formal approval of its new Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) Strategy, which features decentralized oracle provider Chainlink (LINK) at its core. LINK Tokens As Reserve Assets The announcement came from Caliber’s Board of Directors, which outlined its intention to not only purchase LINK tokens but also engage in activities aimed at maximizing returns from these digital assets. With a focus on the token’s long-term appreciation potential, the real state-focused asset manager plans to hold the cryptocurrency as part of its equity portfolio and generate yield through staking, further diversifying its investment strategy. To support the implementation of this digital asset approach, Caliber has established the Caliber Crypto Advisory Board (CCAB). This dedicated advisory group, composed of experts in digital assets and blockchain technology, will provide guidance on the DAT Strategy and Policy.. The DAT Policy itself outlines a framework for the acquisition, custody, and management of digital assets, including specific protocols for security and internal controls. The Board believes that adopting this strategy will not only enhance shareholder value but also strengthen the company’s balance sheet and improve liquidity. By holding LINK as a reserve asset. Additionally, the integration of Chainlink’s technology is expected to streamline key business processes, such as asset valuation and fund administration, further benefiting the company. Chainlink’s Partnership With US Commerce Department Chris Loeffler, Chief Executive Officer of Caliber, emphasized the importance of this strategic move, stating, “We believe that implementing a digital asset treasury strategy strengthens our balance sheet and aligns Caliber with the future of digital finance.” He noted that this initiative positions Caliber at the forefront of innovation in the real estate and investment management sectors, reinforcing its commitment to becoming a “diversified alternative asset manager.” To ensure the responsible execution of this strategy, the asset manager said it has collaborated with a team of experts, including legal advisors from Perkins Coie and Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, as well as its existing audit firm, Deloitte. Caliber’s announcement precedes a significant breakthrough for the Chainlink network, which recently partnered with the US Commerce Department to bring critical macroeconomic data on-chain . NewsBTC reported earlier today that following the disclosure of the partnership, LINK’s price experienced a notable surge, reaching approximately $25, reflecting a 6% increase. As of this writing, the Chainlink’s price has dropped toward $24.86, losing earlier gains to a 1.8% increase now recorded in the 24-hour time frame.

Here’s why",https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-xrp-it-will-take-some-days-but-it-will-pump-hard-heres-why/,"Over recent weeks, XRP price has been consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern, as shown on the four-hour chart shared by the crypto analyst Maxi (@Maxi_Dec2020). The structure is defined by lower highs pressing against a gradually rising support trendline. This type of narrowing formation often signals that a decisive move is approaching, with volatility likely to follow once the price breaks beyond the converging boundaries. The analyst believes XRP will “pump hard once” it breaks above the triangle in a few days. $XRP It will probably take some days, but it will pump hard pic.twitter.com/NEnImdWKnk — Maxi (@Maxi_Dec2020) August 27, 2025 Is a Breakout Coming? The chart indicates that XRP has already tested both the upper and lower bounds of this range multiple times. The most recent retest of the upper trendline happened in July when the asset reached an all-time high , and it tested the lower boundary when it fell below the $3 support level in early August. Each retest has reinforced the strength of these levels, adding weight to the idea that the eventual breakout could be significant. While the current movement remains contained, the reduction in price swings is a common precursor to stronger directional momentum. Technical Indicators and Market Context Supporting the tightening formation on price, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator also displays a similar symmetrical triangle structure . The MACD and signal lines have been following a downtrend while simultaneously narrowing into their own triangle. This alignment between price action and momentum indicators suggests that the market is preparing for a larger move. Although no explicit price targets are displayed on the chart, the setup points toward an imminent breakout scenario. A close above the descending resistance trendline would typically be interpreted as bullish, while a failure to hold the rising support would shift the outlook to the downside.

All Eyes Are On XRP Maxi is confident that the consolidation phase is temporary and that XRP could soon experience a strong upward reaction once the triangle resolves. He expects this to happen in a few days and anticipates a massive pump. As XRP edges closer to the apex of the triangle pattern, pressure continues to build, and market participants will be watching for its next move.

SOL price is now consolidating above $212 and might aim for more gains above the $220 zone. SOL price started a fresh upward move above the $200 and $212 levels against the US Dollar. The price is now trading above $212 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a bullish trend line forming with support at $212 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could extend gains if it clears the $220 resistance zone.

Speaking at BTC Asia in Hong Kong, CZ said moves by public companies to hold bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets — following the example set by MicroStrategy — mark a breakthrough moment. “In the world’s largest economy, 90%-95% of the money is managed by institutions,” he noted. “Until ETFs and treasury companies, those guys couldn’t participate in crypto in a large way.” By bringing crypto exposure to equity markets in the U.S., Hong Kong, Japan and beyond, CZ said the industry is effectively “bringing the equity markets to crypto, or bringing crypto to them — depending how you look at it.” Tokenization Push Beyond bitcoin treasuries and ETFs, Zhao pointed to the surge in tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) as another transformative trend. Stablecoins, treasury bills, commodities, real estate and even personal income streams are being tokenized, funneling “hundreds of millions and billions” into the crypto economy. “We’re going both ways,” CZ said. “Equity markets now have access to crypto, and we’re bringing real-world assets into crypto. This is fantastic.” Risks of Overreach Despite his enthusiasm, CZ warned that not every company pursuing this strategy will succeed. Some firms may use crypto treasuries as a way to “pump up their stock price,” while others lack the expertise to manage complex baskets of digital assets or investments in crypto startups. Failures are inevitable, he said, especially when markets turn. “Right now we’re in a bull market,” Zhao said. “But eventually there will be a winter, there will be a bear market. Treasury companies will have to go through at least one cycle.” MicroStrategy (MSTR), he noted, endured a painful first cycle but benefited later as its average bitcoin cost basis dropped. Stability vs Speculation CZ argued that in the long run, larger inflows of capital from institutional and equity markets should reduce volatility. “Basically, the larger the market cap, the less volatility it has,” he said. “It’s just physics. A bigger ship is more stable.” But he acknowledged that equity markets are full of speculative traders, meaning short-term volatility could increase even as the overall asset class stabilizes over time. Beyond bitcoin While bitcoin remains the centerpiece of most treasury strategies, CZ noted that other tokens are being adopted too — including a recently launched BNB treasury company. For smaller and newer tokens, however, the risks are magnified. “The more mature the ecosystem, the less risk,” Zhao said. “Newer ones may have higher risk and higher returns, but the established ones are safer bets.”re For CZ, the fusion of crypto with traditional markets — through bitcoin treasuries, ETFs and tokenized RWAs — is overwhelmingly positive. Still, he urged caution. “Not every treasury company is going to multiply in value,” he said. “Investors need to evaluate them carefully, understand the risks, and be prepared for cycles.” Read more: Bitcoin Remains Under Pressure as Gold Quietly Targets New Record High",Markets|Binance|Tokenization|Bitcoin ETF|Treasury|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MARKET|BTC|BNB,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-29 05:13:00

The world’s richest Indian businessman, who normally prefers to control narratives from inside his Reliance boardroom, is now being dragged into the messy standoff between Washington and New Delhi over one thing: Russian oil. And also, Putin. Trump’s decision to double tariffs on Indian goods directly targets Reliance’s massive, discounted oil imports from Russia, which have allegedly saved the company hundreds of millions of dollars this year. But here’s the thing: Russian oil isn’t sanctioned, so technically no laws are being broken. Still, the optics are brutal. Buying from Rosneft under a long-term supply deal now looks like a geopolitical gamble, especially since that deal is tied to Reliance’s cutting-edge Jamnagar refining complex. Washington fumes, Delhi deflects, Reliance ducks Now let’s be real, Reliance doesn’t want any part of this. Their refining ops are world-class, and the Jamnagar site can process everything from sweet light crude to the gunk scraped off a pirate ship’s bilge. But the lifeblood of that business is cheap oil. And Russia’s been handing out discounts like it’s a Diwali sale. A 10-year supply pact with Rosneft went live earlier this year, locking in rates well below market. According to Bloomberg’s math here , Reliance saved at least $571 million in the first half of 2025 alone. That’s before you even count shipping or insurance. Yet that savings now has a cost. The U.S. wants India to stop buying Russian barrels and switch to American supply. But ditching Rosneft means breaching a deal, ceding market advantage, and (more importantly) undercutting the Indian government’s position. India never joined Western sanctions. It’s been loud and clear that it will keep buying where the prices work. So Reliance is basically being asked to walk a diplomatic tightrope on stilts. Fun, huh? And while the Trump administration hasn’t named names, they’re never exactly subtle. White House trade advisors have called out India’s richest families for “war profiteering,” again, not naming Mukesh, but come on. His company is the single biggest importer of Russian crude in the country. What more needs to be said? Jio, clean energy, and the quiet oil shuffle At Reliance’s much-hyped investor meeting, you’d think oil would be the hot topic, but according to Bloomberg, Mukesh plans to stay away from that landmine, in that his keynote won’t even mention Russia at all. Instead, the spotlight will be on Jio’s AI innovation. But make no mistake, the company’s transition away from fossil fuels has been a decade in the making. Oil, gas, and chemicals still account for over 50% of Reliance’s revenue, and 40% of its EBITDA. The digital services arm only overtook refining in profitability recently. So, for all the AI and EV chatter, crude oil still pays the bills. That’s why Reliance isn’t throwing away Russian barrels just because the U.S. is angry. The company has always hunted for deals that give it a competitive edge. Back in 2012, they locked in a 15-year deal to buy Venezuelan crude, notoriously heavy and dirty. They ran with it until U.S. sanctions killed the trade. Then came a waiver from Biden. But even that lifeline dried up in May. So, what’s the next move? The company’s been testing new waters. West Africa. Middle East. U.S. Earlier this week, they quietly bought 2 million barrels of American crude, set to load in October. Some say it’s a peace offering. Others call it hedging. Mukesh, true to form, is saying nothing publicly. But his actions speak loud. No flashy statements on oil. Just deals being made in the background while the spotlight shifts to digital and green energy. Internally, the company is focused on buying whatever crude works on the spreadsheet, regardless of where it comes from. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

While these giants battle for positioning, MAGACOIN FINANCE has also entered the conversation, giving early buyers a unique alternative. Ethereum ETF-Driven Climb Toward Market Leadership Ethereum’s climb in 2025 has been anchored by spot ETFs and the vast capital flowing into them. In early June alone, inflows topped $240 million in a single day, with BlackRock’s ETHA capturing most of it. Across multiple providers, cumulative ETF inflows exceeded $1.2 billion in just a matter of weeks, lifting confidence across the market. Momentum has only accelerated. In August, Ethereum ETFs absorbed $2.3 billion in six days, highlighted by ETHA’s purchase of 150,000 ETH. Daily inflows even peaked at $727 million, underscoring investor appetite. Since April, Ethereum’s price has doubled, notching a 40% gain in July and outperforming Bitcoin. Regulatory clarity, supported by frameworks like the GENIUS Act, has strengthened Ethereum’s positioning. Spot ETFs now account for nearly $123.5 billion in trading activity, up by 30–49% over recent months. On-chain fundamentals also remain resilient: $150 billion worth of ETH is staked, with Ethereum controlling 65% of DeFi’s total value locked. Looking ahead, analysts are revising projections. Standard Chartered now targets $7,500 by 2025, citing institutional inflows and DeFi dominance. If regulators approve staking-inclusive ETFs later this year, Ethereum could see its role expand further, combining long-term yields with its already established market scale. Avalanche Riding ETF Speculation and Institutional Inroads Avalanche’s 2025 story has centered on speculation of ETF approval. Its token climbed roughly 15% in July, driven by anticipation of a Grayscale AVAX ETF decision. By August, Bloomberg placed the likelihood of approval at 90% by year-end, inviting comparisons to Bitcoin’s surge after ETF approval. Institutional participation is adding weight to the narrative. BlackRock allocated $240 million to Avalanche projects under its BUIDL fund, while VanEck announced a $100 million RWA fund targeting the AVAX ecosystem. On-chain, Avalanche reached 20 million daily transactions—a 20× increase from 2021—cementing its claim to scalability. Adoption is also expanding through partnerships and technical upgrades. FIFA tapped Avalanche subnets for NFT ticketing, while the Octane upgrade trimmed transaction fees, driving further engagement. Price action has mirrored this activity, with AVAX trading around $24–25 and testing the $27 level. Analysts view $33 to $54 as possible targets if ETF approval arrives before December. Forecasts vary, with some projecting $25 in 2026 while others stretch targets toward the mid-$30s. The ETF decision remains the defining catalyst. If greenlit, Avalanche could gain market share rapidly, but without it, Ethereum’s established ETF-driven dominance keeps it ahead in the Layer 1 race. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Early Access With Audit-Safe Infrastructure Beyond the Layer 1 spotlight, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving out space as an altcoin worth watching. Built on a security-first foundation, the project has already passed audits by CertiK and HashEx, giving buyers confidence in its infrastructure. For a limited window, early participants can unlock a 50% bonus by using the code PATRIOT50X, though availability is capped and prices adjust upward every hour. This time-sensitive offer is why many are moving quickly rather than waiting. With thousands already on board, MAGACOIN FINANCE presents itself as a secure, strategic entry point in today’s altcoin landscape. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is a Top Altcoin to Buy in 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to lead lists of the top altcoins to buy in 2025 because it’s built on verified trust. From its Hashex-audited smart contract to a fully KYC-certified team, every aspect of the project prioritizes investor protection. These foundations make it more than a trend — they establish it as a serious, secure contender for major upside. Conclusion: How to Position in This Market Ethereum leads today with ETF inflows driving adoption, while Avalanche is on the cusp of a breakout pending SEC approval. For those diversifying beyond the major players, MAGACOIN FINANCE provides a timely entry point—with bonuses still live and the price climbing by the hour.

Further, the company stated that it may engage in staking if tax status permits. The proposed product aims to “reflect rewards from staking a portion” of the ETF’s SEI tokens “without undue legal or regulatory risk.” The filing comes at a time when the US regulatory agency is keen on reviewing several altcoin ETF applications . Among other crypto ETF filings, funds tracking the price of XRP have gained momentum, particularly after the token has long been at the center of legal and regulatory debates. The filing has named Coinbase Custody Trust Company as the ETF’s custodian, with Coinbase acting as prime broker. SEC’s Recent Crypto ETF Delays Are Possibly Not Denials Following several delays, the SEC is expected to issue decisions on several pending applications in October, including products tied to Trump Media and Solana (SOL). Altcoin ETF issuers are pressing forward with new amendments, hoping that October deadlines could be a turning point for the crypto ETF landscape. The SEC recently delayed decisions on the approval of Truth Social’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, besides XRP and Litecoin funds. The US watchdog has marked Oct. 8 as its next deadline for both Truth Social’s crypto ETF products.

SEI Token Surges Past 4% – Will it Go Further? Following the 21Shares’ spot SEI ETF filing, the native token rose 4.06% in the past 24 hours. The move signals bullish chart structure after a 60% 90-day gain. Parallelly, SEI’s TVL hit $682 million with DeFi protocols like Dragonswap driving usage. The surge is also attributed to the recent institutional adoption drive. Circle’s IPO filing reveals that by the end of 2024, the company held 6.25 million SEI tokens. The holdings make the most significant token on its balance sheet compared to other crypto. Besides, the state of Wyoming shortlisted SEI for its state-backed stablecoin (WYST) . SEI is seen trading at $0.302 at press time, per CoinMarketCap data . The token’s price trajectory hinges on technical upgrades, institutional adoption, and ecosystem growth.

Meanwhile, Caliber’s shares skyrocketed 162% after the company announced plans to establish a Chainlink-based treasury despite facing a Nasdaq delisting notice for failing to meet equity requirements. IREN Shares Jump on Record Results Bitcoin mining firm IREN delivered its strongest quarter on record after reporting $187.3 million in revenue for the three months ended June 30. The stellar performance helped push its full-year revenue to $501 million, a new company high, while net income swung sharply into positive territory at $176.9 million. The results were released on Thursday, and ignited investor enthusiasm. The company’s shares shot up 3.1% to $23.04 by market close and surged by close to 14% in after-hours trading, according to Google Finance data. IREN’s share price over the past 24 hours (Source: Google Finance ) The impressive turnaround was fueled primarily by rapid growth in IREN’s Bitcoin mining operations, which positioned the firm among the top players in the industry. In July, IREN outpaced rival MARA Holdings in monthly production after mining 728 BTC compared to MARA’s 703 BTC. The company also scaled its installed Bitcoin mining capacity to 50 exahashes per second, though it has since paused further expansion in that area to sharpen its focus on artificial intelligence. Under current mining economics, IREN estimates its annualized revenue potential at $1 billion. IREN’s pivot toward AI has been a key driver of its growth story this year. The company expanded its GPU fleet to 1,900 during the quarter, which is a 132% increase year-on-year, while becoming a “Preferred Partner” to Nvidia, granting it greater access to advanced hardware. Revenue from AI services—primarily renting GPU power for machine learning, training large language models, and supporting enterprise workloads—already reached around $25 million per month. The firm now plans to spend $200 million to scale its GPU count to 10,900 by year-end, targeting $200 million to $250 million in annualized AI revenue by December. Longer term, IREN wants to install 60,000 of Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs at its British Columbia site. IREN’s growth outlook The company’s success is a stark reversal from just a year ago, when short-selling firm Culper Research branded IREN as “wildly overvalued.” It even mocked its AI aspirations as ill-prepared. Shares subsequently tumbled to $5.59 in April before mounting a dramatic 312% rally in the past four months. IREN also recently resolved a long-standing dispute with creditor NYDIG over $105 million in defaulted equipment loans tied to 35,000 Antminer S19s, and reached a confidential settlement that removed a lingering overhang. For now, IREN seems to have silenced its critics. Caliber Jumps With LINK Pivot Meanwhile, shares of real estate asset manager Caliber also soared on Thursday after the Nasdaq-listed company revealed plans to pivot toward a Chainlink-based digital asset treasury, even as it faces the risk of delisting. The firm’s board of directors approved a policy to allocate a portion of its funds toward acquiring LINK tokens. Alongside the move, Caliber also announced the creation of a crypto advisory board to guide its management on digital asset strategy and related initiatives. Investors welcomed the news as Google Finance data showed Caliber’s stock jumping 162% over the past 24 hours, trading at $4.46 at press time. Caliber’s share price over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) The announcement was made just one day after Caliber disclosed that it received a written notice from Nasdaq stating that the company was no longer in compliance with Listing Rule 5550(b)(1), which requires firms to maintain at least $2.5 million in stockholders’ equity. According to its second-quarter SEC filing, Caliber reported a deficit of $17.6 million in stockholders’ equity, placing it at risk of being delisted from the exchange. The company has 45 days to submit a compliance plan, and up to 180 days to address the shortfall if its plan is accepted. Establishing a Chainlink treasury could be a means to raise capital and regain compliance. Caliber delisting notice Caliber’s strategy is part of a wider shift in the corporate treasury space, which was first pioneered by Strategy when it became the first public company to hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset. While early corporate treasuries were largely Bitcoin-focused, a growing number of firms are now experimenting with altcoin allocations. This week alone, Trump Media and Technology Group launched a $6.42 billion Cronos treasury, while Sharps Technology almost doubled in value after unveiling a $400 million Solana treasury. However, not all companies have benefited from the trend. Windtree Therapeutics, which established a BNB treasury last month, lost 77% of its value after Nasdaq confirmed it would be delisted . While the immediate market reaction has been positive for Caliber, the firm’s long-term survival on Nasdaq may hinge on whether this strategy actually generates enough capital to fill its equity deficit.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BUSINESS|MACROECONOMICS|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-29 05:30:00

In the video, Schwartz explained Ripple’s progression toward broader institutional utility. He described the current stage as one where market infrastructure is being built to support major participants and deep liquidity. According to Schwartz, Ripple is working toward an environment where money can move efficiently across borders and between currencies. He noted that this liquidity would provide “easy ways to get money in and out,” making it a settlement system of high value. The Path Ahead for XRP XRP Governor emphasized that, based on Schwartz’s comments, years of patience are about to pay off. Schwartz tied these developments to XRP, stressing that as liquidity increases and cross-border pathways expand , the token will gain value as a settlement asset. By positioning XRP at the center of this framework, Schwartz suggested it could eventually serve as a core mechanism for large-scale transactions.

The Role of Liquidity and Utility Schwartz’s remarks describe liquidity as a determining factor in the next phase of XRP’s adoption. The ability for financial institutions to enter and exit positions quickly is vital for any asset intended for settlement. By emphasizing both cross-currency and cross-border applications, he highlighted areas where XRP’s speed and cost efficiency may address longstanding challenges in global payments. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The discussion also reinforced Ripple’s strategy of building infrastructure that appeals to established players in finance. Schwartz referenced the transition to a stage involving “big players and lots of liquidity,” indicating that widespread institutional participation would be necessary for XRP to achieve its intended function. For the XRP community, Schwartz’s comments add weight to expectations that the token will evolve beyond speculative trading into a utility-driven role . The prospect of becoming the backbone of a high-value settlement system aligns with Ripple’s long-standing narrative of bridging gaps in cross-border finance. While such outcomes depend on adoption by major institutions and the successful integration of the digital asset into global payment systems, the framework described suggests a clear direction that could bring significant growth.

According to Martinez, Solana is testing a critical resistance area again and this time the breakout may be more likely to be sustained. After three failed attempts, Solana broke through the $205-$207 resistance range today, rising to $212. This prompted investors to wonder, “Will this time be different?” Martinez noted that, from a technical perspective, repeated tests of the same resistance level typically weaken the region, but previous attempts above $207 were short-lived. What makes this move different, according to Martinez, is the shift in social sentiment. While previous attempts have seen excessive optimism ahead of local peaks, this time, a cautious tone prevails across the market. Social sentiment is well below the 230 level, and there's no overly enthusiastic buying pressure.

According to the analyst, on-chain data suggests a strong accumulation area below the $207 level. These supports extend from $206 to $165. However, since there is no historically strong resistance above $212, Martinez notes that a volume-supported breakout could bring the $300 target into play. In addition to technical signals, Martinez also highlighted Solana's network upgrades. The Alpenglow consensus upgrade, currently up for vote, will reduce transaction finality from 12 seconds to approximately 150 milliseconds, providing near-instant confirmation for users. This could significantly improve network performance. *This is not investment advice.

Eyes are also on today’s US July Core PCE report, which is one of the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauges. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s batch of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 0.79, meaning that there are more long contracts expiring than shorts, as bullish momentum returns. There is a max pain point of $116,000 where most losses will be made on expiry. Open interest (OI), or the value or number of BTC options contracts yet to expire, is highest at $140,000, which has surged to over $2.8 billion at this strike price on Deribit . There is also around $1.9 billion OI at $120,000 and $130,000 strike prices as the bull speculators load up on contracts, but $110,000 and $95,000 are still popular strike prices for short sellers.

Meanwhile, XRP has gained new momentum after long-awaited regulatory clarity, bringing fresh eyes to its potential. Institutional adoption, ETF filings, and technical upgrades are driving bold forecasts for these tokens. Yet in this scaling battle, a new challenger is turning heads — MAGACOIN FINANCE , backed by a clean HashEx audit and major targets. XRP Price Prediction 2025 — Regulatory Clarity Sets the Stage Few assets have seen such a turnaround story. After Ripple’s settlement with the SEC ended over a decade of uncertainty, XRP finally gained the green light for mainstream adoption. The ruling confirmed XRP sales on exchanges are not securities, sparking a surge in institutional interest. XRP all-time price chart This shift is why XRP price prediction 2025 stands at $5.50 in bullish forecasts. The possibility of spot ETFs being approved later this year could bring $5–8 billion in capital inflows, pushing adoption even further. Combined with real-world usage, such as cross-border payments and even an XRP-branded credit card offering 4% cashback, the token is no longer just about speculation — it’s utility-driven. For investors scanning the best altcoin to buy now , XRP’s clarity and growing payment use cases put it on the shortlist. Avalanche Crypto Price — Layer 1 Blockchain 2025 Bets Institutional adoption has been Avalanche’s biggest weapon. From SkyBridge Capital tokenizing $300 million in hedge fund assets to Wyoming launching the first state-backed stablecoin on its rails, Avalanche is positioning itself as an enterprise hub. This explains the Avalanche crypto price target of $32 by Q4 2025, as institutional capital deepens its footprint. AVAX all-time price chart If its ETF filing gains approval, it would mark the first yield-bearing altcoin ETF thanks to staking features, a huge differentiator against other Layer 1 blockchain 2025 rivals. Technical improvements like the Octane upgrade cutting transaction fees by 96% also keep AVAX competitive. For investors eyeing top altcoins for 2025 , Avalanche checks both adoption and infrastructure boxes. Polygon MATIC Price Prediction — Sidechain Crypto Projects Push Ahead Polygon continues to thrive as one of the most successful sidechain crypto projects . This move consolidates staking, governance, and gas fees under one banner, streamlining the ecosystem. Analysts see Polygon MATIC price prediction hitting $1.57 in 2025 , supported by DeFi inflows and upgrades like Heimdall v2, which cut transaction finality from 90 seconds to just 4–6 seconds.

Key Takeaways: Luxxfolio filed to raise up to $73 million as it deepens its Litecoin treasury strategy. The company aims to acquire 1 million LTC by 2026, with Charlie Lee now on its advisory board. Despite ambitions, Luxxfolio faces mounting losses and warned of survival risks without new funding. The filing, submitted Thursday with Canadian regulators (excluding Québec), will allow Luxxfolio to issue a mix of securities, including shares, debt, and warrants, over a 25-month window. Luxxfolio CEO Says Capital Raise Will Boost Flexibility and Litecoin Expansion CEO Tomek Antoniak said the move gives the company “financial flexibility” to scale operations and accelerate Litecoin adoption. “In our sector, scale is critical — the larger our treasury, infrastructure, and ecosystem footprint, the greater our ability to capture market share,” Antoniak said in the company’s announcement. The fundraising plan comes just months after Luxxfolio became the first publicly traded company to formally anchor its corporate treasury in Litecoin. The firm began disclosing its Litecoin purchases in July and has outlined an ambitious goal of acquiring 1 million LTC by 2026. Litecoin creator Charlie Lee joined the company’s advisory board in June, further cementing its alignment with the 12-year-old blockchain network. Luxxfolio has filed a preliminary short form base shelf prospectus. Once finalized, it could allow us to raise up to CAD $100M over 25 months for future growth. No securities are being issued at this time.

In its most recent quarterly report, the company posted a Q2 net loss of $197,000, up from just $8,000 a year earlier. Over the nine-month period ending that quarter, losses more than doubled year-over-year. With only $112,000 in cash on hand as of the quarter’s end, the company relied on an $844,000 private placement to remain operational. Since its founding in 2017, Luxxfolio has accumulated nearly $19 million in total losses. Its management has already flagged “significant doubt” about the company’s ability to continue without securing new capital. The shelf prospectus, once finalized, is intended to give the company room to raise capital quickly as market conditions shift, and as it attempts to grow its Litecoin infrastructure footprint despite mounting financial pressure. Galaxy, Jump, and Multicoin Plan $1B Solana Treasury Bet As reported, Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto, and Multicoin Capital are in talks to raise around $1 billion to build the largest Solana treasury to date. Bloomberg reported that Cantor Fitzgerald has been tapped as the lead banker, with the Solana Foundation backing the deal, which could close in early September. The plan involves taking over a publicly traded company and converting it into a digital asset treasury vehicle dedicated to Solana. Likewise, Pantera Capital is preparing to raise as much as $1.25 billion to transform a Nasdaq-listed company into “Solana Co.,” a public vehicle built to accumulate Solana (SOL) as a treasury asset The plan reportedly involves an initial $500 million raise, followed by $750 million through warrants. If completed, it would mark one of the largest dedicated efforts to create a public Solana treasury vehicle. The move follows Pantera’s disclosure earlier this month that it has already deployed about $300 million into digital asset treasury (DAT) firms.

This trend involves companies integrating digital assets, such as Bitcoin, into their balance sheets. While this growing adoption is a positive sign for the crypto market’s maturity, a crucial warning from Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) urges caution. Speaking at the BitcoinAsia event in Hong Kong, Zhao highlighted both the immense potential and the inherent dangers of these innovative strategies. Understanding the Rise of Corporate Crypto Treasuries What exactly are corporate crypto treasuries ? Simply put, these are strategies where traditional companies allocate a portion of their treasury reserves into cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin being a popular choice. This strategic move offers several key advantages. For traditional stock market investors, it provides an indirect way to gain exposure to the rapidly expanding digital asset space without needing to purchase cryptocurrencies directly. Moreover, this institutional embrace plays a vital role in the broader adoption and legitimization of crypto and Bitcoin. When established corporations begin to hold digital assets, it sends a powerful signal to the wider financial community. This encourages more mainstream acceptance and investment, reflecting a growing confidence in the long-term viability and value proposition of cryptocurrencies. What Are the Risks of Corporate Crypto Treasuries? Despite these undeniable benefits, Zhao’s warning serves as a critical reminder of the crypto market’s inherent volatility. He specifically cautioned that if the market enters a downturn, companies holding significant crypto assets could experience a simultaneous drop in their stock prices and the value of their digital holdings. This ‘double whammy’ effect has the potential to amplify losses for investors. Consider a scenario where a company’s core business performance is already facing challenges. If its corporate crypto treasuries also decline sharply in value, the combined impact on its financial health and stock performance could be severe. Therefore, investors in such companies must remain vigilant, carefully monitoring both market volatility and the structural risks associated with these new treasury strategies. Navigating Volatility: Actionable Insights for Investors So, how can investors effectively navigate this evolving landscape? Zhao’s advice emphasizes the need for a diligent and informed approach. It is not enough to simply invest in companies that have adopted corporate crypto treasuries ; understanding their specific exposure and risk management practices is paramount. Here are some actionable insights: Assess Exposure: Research the percentage of a company’s treasury allocated to crypto. A higher percentage might indicate greater risk. Examine Risk Management: Look for companies with clear policies on managing their digital asset holdings, including diversification strategies or hedging mechanisms. Monitor Market Trends: Stay informed about both the traditional stock market and the cryptocurrency market. Pay attention to macroeconomic factors that could impact both. Understand Correlation: Recognize that during periods of market stress, correlations between traditional assets and crypto assets can increase, leading to synchronized declines. Being informed and proactive can help investors make more sound decisions when considering companies with digital asset exposure. The Future of Corporate Crypto Treasuries: A Balanced Perspective The integration of corporate crypto treasuries into mainstream finance is undoubtedly a landmark development. It signifies a maturation of the crypto space and opens new avenues for investment and growth. However, as Changpeng Zhao wisely points out, innovation always comes with its own set of challenges and risks. The key lies in maintaining a balanced perspective: embracing the potential while meticulously preparing for the pitfalls. For companies, this means developing robust risk frameworks and transparent reporting. For investors, it means conducting thorough due diligence and maintaining a keen awareness of market dynamics. Ultimately, the successful evolution of corporate crypto adoption will depend on a collective commitment to transparency, prudent management, and continuous education. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are corporate crypto treasuries? A: Corporate crypto treasuries involve companies allocating a portion of their cash reserves or balance sheets into cryptocurrencies, typically Bitcoin, as part of their treasury management strategy. Q2: Why are companies adopting crypto treasury strategies? A: Companies adopt these strategies to gain exposure to potential growth in digital assets, provide indirect crypto exposure to traditional investors, and signal innovation, which can aid in broader crypto adoption. Q3: What is Changpeng Zhao’s main warning about corporate crypto treasuries? A: CZ warned that in a market downturn, the stock prices of companies with crypto treasuries could fall simultaneously with the value of their crypto assets, amplifying losses for investors. Q4: How can investors mitigate risks when investing in companies with crypto treasuries? A: Investors should assess a company’s crypto exposure, examine its risk management policies, monitor both traditional and crypto market trends, and understand potential correlations during market stress. Q5: Are there any benefits to corporate crypto treasuries for the broader market? A: Yes, corporate adoption lends legitimacy to the crypto space, encourages institutional investment, and facilitates broader mainstream acceptance and understanding of digital assets.

With the U.S. SEC’s final deadlines approaching in October, optimism is building that approval could unlock historic inflows. Analysts like Kwok even argue that regulated XRP ETFs could attract more capital than Bitcoin or Ethereum products, citing XRP’s massive global holder base and consistent dominance in exchange volumes. At the same time, some investors are diversifying into Remittix (RTX) , a PayFi altcoin dubbed “XRP 2.0,” which has raised over $21 million while preparing for major exchange milestones. XRP ETFs Could Change the Game Currently, the XRP Price hovers above $3 with short-term support intact. A breakout could be triggered by SEC approval of XRP ETFs, which Polymarket odds peg at 84% by year-end. If granted, the product could rival Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in size. With whales already accumulating, traders expect the XRP Price to retest its July high at $3.60 and possibly enter new price discovery zones if institutional flows surge. The XRP Price outlook is tied closely to the ETF narrative. XRP already ranks as one of the most heavily traded tokens worldwide, with a daily trading volume of $6.6 billion, the majority of which comes from centralized exchanges. On CME, XRP futures hit $1 billion in open interest just three months after launch, underscoring growing institutional appetite. If spot ETFs follow, experts say the XRP Price could rally beyond current levels as regulated inflows create fresh demand. Why Remittix Is Being Dubbed XRP 2.0 While ETF speculation drives XRP, attention is shifting toward Remittix , a PayFi altcoin now dubbed “XRP 2.0” by early backers. Priced at $0.0987, the token has already raised over $21.8 million with more than 625 million tokens sold. A confirmed BitMart listing and a second exchange reveal planned at the $22 million milestone provide liquidity milestones. Meanwhile, its Q3 2025 wallet beta aims to connect over 40 cryptocurrencies with more than 30 fiat currencies, routing crypto directly to bank accounts in over 30 countries. Why Traders Call It XRP 2.0 Real-world remittance focus, solving a $19T global payments problem Flat fees and real-time FX quotes for predictable transactions Merchant-focused Remittix Pay API for business adoption Exchange listings set to boost liquidity and visibility Deflationary model supporting long-term token value Remittix Has 50x ROI In Store: Get In Now The XRP Price recovery above $3 sets the stage for an ETF-driven breakout if regulators approve products later this year. However, as the institutional appeal of XRP becomes stronger, whale capital is pouring into Remittix , which top ICO analysts are calling XRP 2.0 and is set for over 50x returns to early adopters. With XRP riding regulatory catalysts and Remittix targeting adoption milestones, investors now see two parallel paths that could deliver outsized gains before the end of 2025.

Bitcoin Users Will Have Native Access To USDT Via RGB Protocol As revealed by Tether in a website announcement , its stablecoin USDT will be coming to the RGB protocol. RGB allows users to create, send, and manage smart contracts directly on the BTC blockchain. The protocol launched on the BTC mainnet in July with its 0.11.1 release. Thanks to this release, stablecoins, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and community tokens are all now possible natively on the BTC network, just like on Ethereum and other newer blockchains. Something to note is that RGB isn’t a network layer on top of Bitcoin. Rather, it makes use of only client-side validation to confirm transactions. “RGB operates with no trusted third parties, no federations, no validators, and no coordinators,” said RGB Hub in the 0.11.1 launch announcement. USDT is the largest stablecoin in the cryptocurrency sector, circulating on a slew of networks, and with Tether’s latest move, the token would finally become accessible to users of the original digital asset, Bitcoin. Tether noted in the press release: This announcement underscores Tether’s leadership in expanding the reach of stablecoins and its commitment to ensuring Bitcoin remains not only the original cryptocurrency but also the bedrock for global, everyday money. So far, the stablecoin issuer hasn’t confirmed any date, but once launched, users will be able to hold and transfer both BTC and USDT directly from the same wallet. Paolo Ardoino, Tether CEO, said: Bitcoin deserves a stablecoin that feels truly native, lightweight, private, and scalable. With RGB, USD₮ gains a powerful new pathway on Bitcoin, reinforcing our belief in Bitcoin as the foundation of a freer financial future. In some other news, the Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen their largest drawdown from the all-time high (ATH) since April, as CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has pointed out in an X post . As displayed in the above chart, the spot ETFs currently have their holdings around $813.9 million down since the peak. These latest outflows have occurred alongside BTC’s price decline. Another thing that has come with the drawdown in the cryptocurrency is a surge in long liquidations. As quant Frank has noted in an X post , long liquidations recently hit their highest level of dominance in four years. The last time that long liquidations were this dominant was in May 2021. Back then, bulls were flushed by a massive crash in the Bitcoin price that put the bull run on pause for a few months. BTC Price Bitcoin has slowly been climbing up since its low earlier in the week as its price has now reached the $112,400 mark.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin RGB|btc|BTCUSDT|Tether|USDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|USDT|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-29 06:00:09

Solana Is Now Observing 5.8 Bullish Comments For Every Bearish Post In a new post on X, analytics firm Santiment has discussed about the latest trend in the Positive/Negative Sentiment for Solana. This indicator tells us about how the bullish and bearish comments related to SOL currently compare on the major social media platforms. The metric uses a machine-learning model to judge whether a given post/thread/message is positive or negative. Once it has separated the texts into the two categories, it counts them up and finds their ratio. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Over? CryptoQuant’s Bull Score Index Turns Bearish Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Solana Positive/Negative Sentiment over the last couple of months: As displayed in the above graph, the Solana Positive/Negative Sentiment has witnessed a sharp increase recently, indicating that positive comments related to the cryptocurrency have ramped up. Currently, there are 5.8 positive posts appearing for every negative post. This is the highest that the ratio’s value has been since June 11th, more than two months ago. The rise in bullish sentiment is a result of the 16% price surge that SOL has enjoyed over the past week. While some excitement after rallies is normal, an excess of it can be something to watch out for. This is because digital assets have historically tended to move in a way that goes contrary to the expectations of the majority. This means that a large amount of hype among social media users can lead to tops. Similarly, widespread fear can facilitate the formation of a bottom. With the Positive/Negative Sentiment sitting on an 11-week high, it now remains to be seen whether trader FOMO would become an obstacle in the Solana rally. In some other news, Santiment has shared an update on how projects on the SOL blockchain currently rank up against each other in terms of the Development Activity. The “Development Activity” refers to a metric that measures, as its name suggests, the total amount of work that the developers of a given cryptocurrency project are putting in on its public GitHub repositories. Related Reading: Bitcoin & Ethereum Whale Populations Quietly Growing, On-Chain Data Reveals Below is a table that shows the 30-day value of the metric for the top projects in the SOL ecosystem.

Wormhole (W) and Drift (DRIFT) are the next best projects with metric values of 41.47 and 31.9, respectively.

Despite efforts to sustain traction, selling pressure and reduced speculative hype have weighed heavily on its price. Chainlink holders too have seen limited upside recently, leaving many searching for higher-growth opportunities. This shift has opened the door for PayFi-focused projects like Remittix (RTX), which offers a very different value proposition compared to meme-style or oracle-driven tokens. Where Pi coin relies on mass community participation and LINK focuses on smart contract infrastructure, RTX directly addresses cross-border payments with measurable real-world adoption potential. Comparing Remittix’s Narrative To Pi and Chainlink: Clear Difference In Utility And Adoption While Pi coin has community strength, its price struggles show the difficulty of sustaining long-term value without robust use cases. Chainlink remains essential for smart contract infrastructure but may lack the exponential upside that early investors now demand. Source: TradingView Remittix fills that gap, combining real-world adoption with early-stage investment potential. It offers the kind of high-growth opportunity that LINK once represented in its infancy, but with a clearer payments utility. This mix of utility and speculative upside explains why experts are tipping RTX as the best crypto presale 2025 . Why Remittix is the Best Crypto Presale of the Year Remittix (RTX) is currently priced at $0.0987 and has already raised more than $21.9 million, selling over 625 million tokens. Unlike Pi coin’s speculative narrative, Remittix is targeting the $19 trillion remittance industry with a wallet set to launch in Q3 2025, enabling crypto-to-bank transfers in over 30 countries. Analysts expect gains of 7,500% to 8,000% if adoption accelerates. Its deflationary tokenomics, burning 10% of transaction fees, coupled with a confirmed BitMart listing provide a structural advantage over both Pi and Chainlink. Holders frustrated with stagnant performance are increasingly moving capital into RTX as the next 100x crypto. Beta wallet with 40+ crypto and 30+ fiat pairs Transaction fees under 1%, far below traditional remittance costs Exchange listings already secured, expanding global reach Deflationary design driving long-term scarcity Strong traction with freelancers and small businesses This Could Be the Presale That Changes Everything: Remittix is not just another hype-driven project but a payments-first crypto positioned as one of the best DeFi projects 2025. Remittix Is The Top Altcoin To Buy Now With Pi coin sitting at $0.34 and Chainlink showing modest movement, smart investors are eyeing Remittix’s path toward potential 8,000% returns. Its cross-border payment focus, upcoming wallet launch, and growing liquidity make it stand out as both a utility token and a speculative play.

According to the data he shared, the transfer originated from an unknown wallet and was sent to Coinbase. At the time of the transfer, the amount was valued at $91.4 million. While large transactions from whales on the blockchain are not unusual, the context of this movement caught attention due to its timing and the scale involved. Xaif described it as a “suspense move” and questioned whether it represented a sell-off or a strategic play. Such a transfer into Coinbase, one of the largest crypto exchanges, often leads to speculation about whether the purpose is immediate liquidation or positioning for a future strategy.

At the same time, such moves can also reflect internal exchange operations or preparation for institutional trades. The transparency of the XRPL means that transactions of this scale are visible in real time. However, with no identifying information tied to the sending wallet, the motive remains unclear. What stands out is the size of the transfer, which places it among recent whale sell-offs , suggesting that these large investors may be reassessing their positions or anticipate a short-term bearish move. Community Observations Community members responded with varying perspectives, ranging from cautious interpretation to outright suspicion. X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull), a prominent crypto figure, suggested that the transfer could be routine, but left open the possibility that something is brewing behind the scenes. Another response viewed it as consistent with prior large movements, stating it appeared “just like the rest.” Not all reactions were neutral. Some participants considered the move potentially suspicious and emphasized the importance of monitoring it closely. Others pointed to the most straightforward explanation, asking why such a transfer would occur unless the purpose was part of a sell-off.

Whether the $91.4 million transfer signals downside for XRP depends on how the funds are used. Large inflows to exchanges can indicate that selling may follow, which often pressures the price in the short term . However, without confirmation of the sender’s intent, it cannot be assumed that the move reflects an imminent sell-off. Subsequent activity will ultimately determine whether this transaction contributes to a decline or remains a neutral event.

According to the company's report, the price of Bitcoin could reach $1.3 million by 2035. Bitwise bases this prediction on three key factors: Increased institutional demand: It is stated that Bitcoin will increasingly become an institutional investment vehicle, resulting in continuous net inflows. The need for protection against inflation: It is argued that the demand for “hard assets”, especially from institutional investors, will bring Bitcoin to the forefront. Limited supply: The fact that Bitcoin's new supply is extremely limited and inelastic is seen as the most important factor supporting the price in the long term. Related News: Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Gives Date for Potential Deadly Threat Facing Cryptocurrencies Bitwise notes that Bitcoin's compound annual return over the next decade could reach 28.3%, but that significant volatility will likely follow. However, the company predicts that these fluctuations will remain below historical averages. The report states that Bitcoin will maintain its low correlation with stocks, bonds, and other major asset classes, making the “four-year cycle” approach obsolete. However, potential regulatory and legislative risks, political uncertainty, and Bitcoin's relatively new nature are cited as the biggest threats. Bitwise states that technological risks (e.g., those arising from quantum computing) are less likely, but should not be ignored. The company describes Bitcoin's transformation from “zero to a $2.4 trillion asset” in 16 years as the most critical threshold and describes the upcoming period as “the transition process from 1 to 100,” in the words of Peter Thiel. *This is not investment advice.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently in Phase 6 of its presale, is being quietly labeled as that kind of sleeper hit. With its combination of an overcollateralized stablecoin system, yield-generating staking mechanics, and programmatic buybacks aligned with Tier-1 exchange discovery, the project is building a foundation that will be difficult to ignore. Here are three concrete reasons why investors are projecting as much as 23x ROI by Q2 2026. Reason 1: real transactional utility through the $1 stablecoin The strongest case for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) rests on its decentralized stablecoin. Unlike algorithmic models that have caused shocks in the past, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s design will only allow minting of its $1 stablecoin when borrowers post collateral such as ETH. Loans will always be overcollateralized, and automatic liquidation will protect the system’s safety. Governance will actively adjust interest rates to keep the coin at $1, tightening or easing borrowing costs to stabilize demand. Take an ETH holder posting $20,000 worth of collateral at a 70% loan-to-value ratio. That borrower will unlock $14,000 in liquidity, spendable without ever selling their ETH. Each loan like this will require stablecoin issuance, and each repayment will burn that supply, creating a natural cycle of recurring demand and stability. This is a utility that will keep usage consistent and independent of market noise. As stablecoin adoption spreads, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will sit at the center of real transactional activity — something most projects never achieve. Reason 2: yield and locked demand with mtToken Staking A second major driver will be mtTokens, which lenders will receive when they deposit assets into liquidity pools. These mtTokens will be staked in designated smart contracts, creating a long-term lock on capital. Instead of passive inflation, the system will use protocol revenue to buy MUTM on the open market and distribute it as rewards. This creates continuous buy pressure and guarantees that rewards will be backed by real platform activity. Consider a lender who supplies $12,500 USDC in a P2C pool at a 13% APY. By year’s end, the mtUSDC representing that position will have grown in value, reflecting a $1,600 gain. Not only will the lender’s balance increase, but staking that mtUSDC will unlock additional MUTM rewards — paid from open-market buybacks. This double-layer return locks demand for both the stablecoin and the native token, creating an ecosystem where yield directly supports token value. Reason 3: buybacks and exchange discovery as growth catalysts The third reason is mechanical and market-driven. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has committed to converting protocol revenue into buybacks, which will constantly recycle activity into higher demand for its token. At the same time, expected Tier-1 listings on platforms like Binance, KuCoin, and Coinbase will expand liquidity and make it easier for a global audience to access MUTM. When a project combines recurring buybacks with mass-market exchange exposure, the result is sustained upward pressure on token value. At this point, the presale speaks for itself. Phase 6 pricing is set at $0.035, with over $15.04 million raised, more than 15,800 holders onboard, and 28% of tokens already sold. Phase 7 will push the price to $0.040 — a 15% step from today’s level. The total supply of 4 billion tokens, the 95 CertiK audit score, the $50,000 bug bounty program, and the $100,000 giveaway all signal that the project is taking security and community engagement seriously. With over 12,000 followers already watching its updates, visibility is only increasing. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will also layer in P2P opportunities for those seeking higher risk and reward. For example, a FLOKI lender will set a 24% APY for 30 days on $3,000, allowing partial fills while keeping core pool safety intact. These flexible structures show that the system is designed to serve both conservative and aggressive investors. The roadmap is equally decisive. From the introduction phase of presale and audits, through core smart contract development, testnet demos, and now the preparation for beta, each step has been mapped in four clear phases. The beta will go live alongside listing, which means the revenue engine and buyback system will begin immediately — not as a distant promise, but as a launch-ready feature. Conclusion For those analyzing crypto investing, the numbers tell the story. A Phase 1 buyer who entered at $0.01 with $2,000 has already seen their position rise to $7,000 at today’s $0.035, a 3.5x gain on paper even before the token hits the exchange. With live product adoption, Layer-2 scaling, continuous buybacks, and Tier-1 listings, projections of around 23x by Q2 2026 are grounded in mechanics, not speculation. Unlike projects caught in a crypto crash, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designing a system where real usage, yield, and liquidity expansion will keep driving demand. Phase 6 is already 28% sold, leaving only a narrow window before the price steps up to $0.040. For investors looking at crypto prices today, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents one of the last discounted entries into a project that is positioned to become a long-term market player.

Pal, chief executive at Global Macro Investor, shared a chart that tracks XRP’s price history over a decade. The chart shows several long periods where the crypto moved sideways within falling wedges or descending triangles before breaking sharply higher. He argued that the current setup resembles two earlier cycles that ended with powerful rallies. XRP… in the process of Full Porting… pic.twitter.com/U06LyPqvX1 — Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) August 29, 2025 “Full porting” in his framework means an asset has completed years of compression, and is preparing to move into an expansion phase. Current XRP Setup Mirrors Earlier Structures That Preceded Rallies In XRP’s case, compression refers to prices being trapped in narrowing ranges, with volatility gradually declining. Expansion happens when the token escapes those limits and often surges into a parabolic run. Pal believes XRP is at that turning point now. The XRP chart shows four major structures. Between 2014 and 2017, the token traded inside a descending triangle before breaking out and joining the wider bull run. From 2018 to 2020, it repeated the pattern, this time within a falling wedge, before surging again in late 2020. A third cycle formed from 2021 to 2023, when XRP slipped into another wedge against long-term support. That period ended with a breakout in 2023 and early 2024. The present pattern, according to Pal, is an ascending triangle forming just below the long-elusive $3 mark. At the time of writing, XRP traded around $2.90, down 3.4% on the day and nearly 7% over the past week. The token continues to face resistance at three dollars, a level it has struggled to reclaim since its rally in 2021. Full Porting Could Trigger Rally Years In The Making Pal’s suggestion of “full porting” implies that XRP could soon escape this structure and enter a new expansion phase, potentially echoing its past surges. In 2021, for example, it climbed from $0.20 to more than $2 once the consolidation broke. XRP remains one of the most closely watched tokens due to its association with Ripple and the long-running regulatory battle in the US . Despite these headwinds, its price structure has continued to form patterns that traders view as classic setups for eventual breakouts. Pal’s interpretation is that the token is now approaching the end of its latest compression cycle. If history is a guide, he suggests, the process of “full porting” could soon give way to a new uptrend. For XRP holders, that would mark the beginning of another expansion phase that has been years in the making.

With crypto prices today showing less volatility than in the past few months, investors are searching for projects that combine yield, scalability, and growth potential. The spotlight is shifting toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a protocol that will use borrowing demand to channel revenue into buybacks and staking rewards. For those investing in crypto with a focus on asymmetric upside, the current presale stage is beginning to attract growing attention. Bitcoin (BTC) holds around $110K amid market uncertainty Bitcoin (BTC) stabilized at ~$110,000 as of August 27, 2025, with a 24-hour trading volume of $45 billion, following a volatile week. The price hold comes after $800 million in liquidations, with $450 million in long positions wiped out, driven by macro pressures like US tariffs and a hawkish Federal Reserve outlook. Technical indicators show BTC testing $110,000 support, with RSI at 44 and resistance at $112,000. Despite $2.7 billion in weekly ETF inflows and whale accumulation of 19,800 BTC ($2.2 billion), sentiment remains cautious. A break above $112,000 could target $116,713, but a drop below $110,000 risks $105,000. Social media reflects mixed sentiment, with some anticipating a rebound after key economic events. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): stablecoin utility and yield for the next cycle Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will operate on a dual model of peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending. In the P2C model, a user who deposits $18,000 in BUSD at 13% APY will receive mtBUSD tokens, earning $2,350 annually. These receipts will grow in value as interest accrues and will always be backed by on-chain liquidity. Borrowers will also find clear advantages. For example, a SOL holder posting $16,500 at 72% loan-to-value will unlock $12,000 while still keeping exposure to price appreciation. In the P2P segment, a lender will be able to set custom terms, such as offering $4,000 worth of TRUMP tokens at 12% APY for 40 days, with partial fills possible and risks isolated from the main liquidity pools. Alongside these mechanics, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will introduce a decentralized stablecoin designed to stay pegged at $1. The token will be minted when collateral-backed borrowing occurs and burned when loans are repaid or liquidated. Governance will adjust interest rates dynamically to help defend the peg, while strict issuer caps will ensure no single entity has excessive minting power. Arbitrage between markets will further stabilize the price, giving institutions a reliable tool in an environment where stability and transparency are highly valued. The roadmap is also structured for progressive delivery. The early phases have focused on presale initiation, audits, and community growth. Phases 2 and 3 will advance contract development, demos, and compliance alignment. At Phase 4, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will launch live, with the beta expected to go public at the same time as the token listing. This timing means early participants will see borrowing and lending begin to generate buyback flow almost immediately, with mtToken stakers earning MUTM that is repurchased on the open market. Presale momentum and institutional angle The presale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now in Phase 6, with tokens available at $0.035. So far, approximately $15.04 million has been raised, with 28% of the supply sold and over 15,800 holders. The total supply stands at 4 billion tokens, with the next Phase 7 scheduled to lift the price to $0.040. The project has already completed a CertiK audit, receiving a Token Scan score of 95 and a Skynet score of 78, giving institutions and retail investors confidence in the code quality. In addition, a $50,000 bug bounty program has been announced, with rewards scaling based on severity, alongside a $100,000 giveaway that will distribute $10,000 to each of 10 winners. The social base continues to expand, with more than 12,000 followers on X. This presale structure will appeal to larger players looking to hedge market exposure while earning a consistent yield. The buyback-to-staker model is straightforward: platform revenues will purchase MUTM from exchanges and distribute it to mtToken stakers. This deterministic feedback loop will provide transparent returns, which is exactly the type of mechanism that institutions prefer over less predictable systems. Conclusion Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is increasingly being discussed in the same breath as larger infrastructure plays. While some are watching the launch of any crypto ETF, others are looking at how protocols like this will generate real on-chain yield. With crypto prices today holding steady and Bitcoin (BTC) acting as an anchor, the logic is clear: hedging long exposure with a yield-focused token at $0.035 is an opportunity that will not last long. Phase 6 is already more than a quarter sold, and once it turns to $0.040, the ROI profile will shift sharply. Investors who act now will not only secure access to presale pricing but will also align themselves with the roadmap delivery that will put stablecoin issuance, mtToken staking, and buyback-driven rewards into motion. The window to accumulate Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $0.035 is closing, and as institutional flows grow, demand will only accelerate.

Each of these projects has strong institutional backing, technical upgrades, and clear growth drivers heading into Q4. Analysts are also starting to highlight MAGACOIN FINANCE , which passed a full security audit from HashEx, as a rising contender tipped for notable returns. While the spotlight shines on the majors, this new project could stand out as the next breakout. Ethereum’s Upgrades Fuel Bullish Outlook Ethereum continues to attract major institutional flows, making it one of the best altcoin to buy now . In August 2025, whales removed over 598,000 ETH (about $1.6 billion) from exchanges, reducing sell pressure. At the same time, Ether ETPs recorded $2.5 billion in inflows, even outpacing Bitcoin. The Shanghai++ upgrade, scheduled for Q4, will introduce EIP-4844 “proto-danksharding,” which is designed to lower Layer 2 gas fees. Analysts remain optimistic about the Ethereum price prediction 2025, setting a target near $5,500. With stronger institutional adoption and network improvements, Ethereum is seen as a top crypto to invest in 2025. Solana Gains Institutional and Payment Use Cases Solana is back in focus, drawing attention from Pantera Capital’s $1.25 billion treasury vehicle that directly holds SOL. This move signals confidence in Solana’s ecosystem and its capacity to support enterprise-grade applications. SOL price chart: CoinGecko The Solana price forecast remains bullish with expectations of reaching $280 by year-end. The network’s utility as an infrastructure layer for potential SWIFT payment pilots adds another layer of demand. With whales holding large positions and a “Cetus” upgrade lined up, Solana is once again being called one of the best cryptos to buy October 2025 . Avalanche Targets Institutional Demand Avalanche has made strides with both ETFs and enterprise adoption. Grayscale recently filed to convert its Avalanche Trust into a Nasdaq-listed spot ETF that could yield up to 85% staking rewards. This filing comes alongside SkyBridge Capital’s move to tokenize $300 million worth of assets on the chain. AVAX price chart: CoinGecko The Avalanche crypto prediction is targeting $32 by December 2025, supported by enterprise use and regulatory-friendly features like encrypted smart contracts. With its April and July upgrades already cutting fees and boosting utility, AVAX positions itself as a best altcoin to buy now as institutions expand their exposure. MAGACOIN FINANCE Tipped for 55x Gains While Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche dominate headlines, analysts are beginning to focus on MAGACOIN FINANCE as an under-the-radar contender. Unlike the majors, MAGACOIN is still in its early growth stage, which gives it outsized upside potential. Forecasts suggest the project could deliver 55x gains by building momentum around its fundamentals, roadmap, and investor confidence. A key confidence boost is its independent HashEx security audit , where MAGACOIN passed all contract tests. This gives investors confidence in both reliability and transparency. With many predicting an altcoin bull run 2025, projects like MAGACOIN could capture outsized attention as traders search for the best altcoin to buy now before the majors fully run. A Legitimate Presale Offering Safe Entry for 2025 Crypto Investors Few projects combine legitimacy and early-stage opportunity like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is why it’s ranked among the best crypto presales for 2025 . With verified audit results, a transparent roadmap, and a compliant team structure, the project sets a new standard in presale safety. This foundation is what gives MAGACOIN FINANCE its growing reputation as one of the most promising altcoins in the space. Final Thoughts: October Bull Run Could See New Leaders Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche are well-positioned to headline the altcoin bull run of 2025 thanks to strong institutional interest, upcoming upgrades, and regulatory progress. Each has a bullish forecast—whether it’s the Ethereum price prediction 2025, the Solana price forecast, or the Avalanche crypto prediction—that points toward growth through the end of the year. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a new and exciting project with the potential for outsized gains. Backed by a strong roadmap and an audit from HashEx, it may emerge as more than just a rising star.

Key Takeaways: OSL Group’s H1 revenue rose 58% to $25.1 million, driven by acquisitions and organic growth. Operating losses more than doubled due to a rapid expansion in headcount. OSL Pay accounted for 29% of revenue, while a $300M raise will fuel further global growth. In its interim financial report released Thursday evening, the Hong Kong-based company said losses from continuing operations widened to HK$20.3 million ($2.6 million), up from HK$9.6 million a year earlier. The company attributed the growing loss primarily to a sharp rise in headcount, expanding from 167 employees to 568 within a year. OSL Attributes Revenue Surge to Organic Growth and Strategic Acquisitions OSL said the revenue gains were fueled by organic growth and recent strategic acquisitions, according to a separate statement published on Thursday. Key moves included the February purchase of Japanese crypto exchange CoinBest and a June agreement to acquire a 90% stake in Evergreen Crest, an Indonesian exchange operator, through a $15 million share deal. One of the standout performers was OSL Pay, its crypto on-and-off ramp platform launched in April. The division generated HK$55.9 million (US$7.2 million) in the first half, contributing 29% of total group revenue. “Growth and investment defined OSL Group’s performance in the first half of this year,” said Kevin Cui, CEO of OSL Group.

Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum managed to make a new record price this week at $4,960 and closed with a 5% gain. While this is encouraging, buyers will have to break the $5,000 resistance and secure it as a key support to sustain the ongoing rally. At the time of this post, the price is found in a pullback and around $4,500 as bulls and bears battle for dominance. Even if ETH falls to the support at $4,000, buyers still maintain a clear advantage with higher highs. Looking ahead, Ethereum may be consolidating under $5,000 before it gathers enough strength to break this key level. It’s important for buyers to continue to defend the price and keep it above $4,000 if they want to retain control. Chart by TradingView Ripple (XRP) The price of XRP has failed to break away from its ongoing downtrend, but managed to close the week with a modest 2% gain. On the positive side, every time sellers pushed the asset lower, buyers came back around $2.8 to drive it back up. The current price action has formed a descending triangle with a base around $2.8. Should sellers break this key level, then XRP will fall lower in search of new support. The strongest candidate for that is $2.5. Looking ahead, until XRP can make higher highs, it is unlikely this downtrend will reverse. Watch closely how the price reacts at $2.8 since a re-test of that support appears likely at the time of this post. Chart by TradingView Cardano (ADA) In the past four days, the price of ADA has been flat, moving sideways around $0.85. Due to this low volatility period, the asset is in a similar position to last week. With momentum stalling, the volume is also in decline. This is not a bullish indicator. Instead, it shows weakness, which could translate into a lower price later on. The most important support on the chart right now is found at $0.77. Looking ahead, if volume does not pick up, Cardano could test the key support at $0.77 before buyers show interest again. This makes the chart short-term bearish. Chart by TradingView Binance Coin (BNB) BNB continues to show strength after making an all-time high last week at $900. Since then, the price corrected somewhat, but still managed to close this week with a 2% gain. Right now, it appears that Binance Coin is consolidating the recent advances by moving in a range between $900 and $830. These key levels are acting as resistance and support, respectively. Looking ahead, this cryptocurrency is one of the strongest performers this year after it managed to break into new price records. It’s highly likely that BNB will continue to show strength and eventually test the key psychological target at $1,000. Chart by TradingView Hype (HYPE) HYPE has tried three times to break and secure a price above $50, but each attempt was rejected. The most recent happened this past week. After the excitement that the price managed to move above $50, sellers returned in force to push the price back to $45. Despite this pullback, HYPE still closed the week with a 9% gain and may need some time to consolidate before it makes a new attempt at a breakout beyond $50. As long as the price stays in this ascending triangle (as seen on the chart), the bias remains bullish. Looking ahead, this cryptocurrency has strong support around $45, and if it holds, buyers have an advantage. Should this support fall, then sellers could take HYPE into a longer correction towards $40 and lower.

Mutuum Finance stage 6 of presale is now ongoing at the price of $0.035. All the investors who acquire this token today have a chance of growing their investments at least 500% within a short time span. Mutuum Finance presale has already amassed over $15.1 million of capital and over 15800 token holders. With its unorthodox approach to decentralized lending and growing popularity among DeFi investors, Mutuum Finance is increasingly being promoted as a watch-list project during this recovery period. Meanwhile, XRP continues in its steady posture as investors await the next direction of the entire market. XRP Price Prediction: Staying Steady At $3.03 XRP is currently trading at $3.03, which shows stability after recent market fluctuations. Pundits believe that if XRP gets supported in the range of $2.90–$3.00, it can continue to aim for higher levels in the coming times with resistance levels around $3.50 and $4.60 under watch. It is based on the overall market mood and investors’ positioning. Other new initiatives like Mutuum Finance are also beginning to make their presence felt in the crypto market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Stage 6 Presale Mutuum Finance is already a rapidly growing behemoth in the world of DeFi and has achieved that by onboarding over 15,800 investors as well as having recorded a presale of over $15.1 million. The project is currently at Stage 6 of Presale selling tokens at $0.035 per MUTM. The stage offers early birds a huge profit window where they are presented with a chance to buy in prior to the token breaking higher in subsequent stages. $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program Consistent with an open infrastructure, Mutuum Finance is launching a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program. It defines four categories of risk in relation to reward program-related risk for support of community testing and security support: critical, major, minor, and low. With security experts and white-hat hackers on the board, Mutuum places its platform at the forefront of any risk around it as being impenetrable and invincible. Massive Community Incentive, $100,000 Giveback Apart from cementing its vision to establish a healthy, growing, and sustainable community, Mutuum Finance has also introduced a $100,000 giveaway . 10 winners will get $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens, and it also offers the early birds and new investors a chance to be part of the project. Two-model strategy is adopted by Mutuum Finance for initiating flexibility and efficiency through Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending models. Peer-to-Contract is introducing autonomous smart contracts which will lend with no sort of human intervention. These will be run on changing rates of the market but always a fixed rate of interest on prevailing demands and supplies. Middlemen have no role in the Peer-to-Peer model and lenders approach borrowers directly. Peer-to-Peer model suits meme coins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has reached a turning point in its journey, with more than $15.1 million allocated and over 15,800 holders backing its presale at $0.035. Experts are pointing to this time as one of the last major pullback opportunities before the market can potentially regain strength, and projects with real momentum are drawing the most interest. The next price step is already set higher, with current holders in line for good upside as the token moves to its final stages and prepares for launch.

50853901,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/gate-launches-gusd-a-stable-investment-backed-by-real-world-assets,1756452609,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/50853901.jpeg,Gate Launches GUSD: A Stable Investment Backed by Real-World Assets,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/gate-launches-gusd-a-stable-investment-backed-by-real-world-assets,"Cayman Islands, British Overseas Territories, August 29th, 2025, Chainwire Gate, a leading global digital asset trading platform, officially launched its new investment certificate, GUSD. Supported by real-world assets (RWA) such as U.S. Treasury bonds, GUSD provides users with low-risk, stable investment returns. By leveraging blockchain technology, it brings steady yields of traditional finance into the crypto world, serving as an important bridge between TradFi and DeFi, and offering users a safer, more predictable option for asset allocation. With the launch of GUSD , Gate has fully enabled trading, deposits, withdrawals, and related investment functionalities. Users can directly exchange USDT for GUSD on the spot market, or mint GUSD at a 1:1 ratio using USDT or USDC through Gate's ""Staking"" page. This allows users to conveniently obtain GUSD whether they wish to trade flexibly in the spot market or generate stable returns through RWA minting. GUSD will also serve as a Unified Account contract margin, supported from day one. As of August 29, 2025, Gate has officially opened trading for major cryptocurrency pairs and Simple Earn flexible savings for GUSD, further expanding its circulation and utility. Meanwhile, Gate Launchpool has officially opened its first GUSD staking pool, allowing users to stake GUSD and share CELB token rewards, with an estimated annualized yield of up to 365%. Additionally, lending, CandyDrop, and other functions for GUSD are gradually being rolled out. Once conditions are met, Gate will also collaborate with quality projects to launch GUSD staking pools, providing additional liquidity incentives to attract market attention. Unlike stablecoins that serve solely as a medium of exchange, GUSD itself is an investment certificate with an appreciation attribute. Its returns are derived from the interest generated by the underlying RWA assets. Users do not need to collect interest daily; instead, they receive both principal and accrued interest upon redemption. For example, if a user mints GUSD with 100 USDT and the accumulated return reaches 20% at redemption, they will receive 120 USDC. This mechanism gives GUSD not only stability but also growth over time. While holding USDT simply preserves value for market transactions, holding GUSD is effectively equivalent to indirectly holding a continuously appreciating portfolio of U.S. Treasury-backed assets. Gate stated that as the product continues to expand, the total fund size of GUSD is expected to exceed $100 million in the near term, establishing a more solid market foundation. The platform will also gradually disclose reserve proofs and cooperation details with custodian institutions, ensuring that users can publicly verify that every GUSD issued is fully backed by real-world assets, guaranteeing 100% reserves. Users redeeming GUSD receive USDC, which can then be converted into USDT or other cryptocurrencies, enhancing the credibility and transparency of the product's dollar-asset linkage. With over $4 billion in managed investment assets and years of robust compliance and operations, Gate provides strong assurance of GUSD's security and transparency. Compared with RWA products from leading platforms like Binance, GUSD not only follows the same underlying logic but also offers greater flexibility for users, supporting dual-currency minting with USDT and USDC for easier access worldwide. Gate's launch of GUSD offers a new solution to the long-standing question of how to achieve stable returns in the crypto world. It transforms stablecoins into a secure, transparent, and sustainable digital investment option. As trading pairs, lending, Simple Earn, and staking scenarios continue to expand, GUSD is poised to become the preferred tool for users seeking to allocate assets and achieve long-term growth. About Gate Gate, founded in 2013 by Dr. Han, is one of the world's earliest cryptocurrency exchanges. The platform serves over 36 million users with 3,600+ digital assets and pioneered the industry's first 100% proof-of-reserves. Beyond core trading services, Gate's ecosystem includes Gate Wallet, Gate Ventures, and other innovative solutions, while its global partnerships extend to top-tier sports brands like Oracle Red Bull Racing in F1 and Inter.

It was also reported that Robby Yung, CEO of parent company Animoca Brands, was appointed as The Sandbox's new CEO two weeks ago. The allegations also claimed that more than half of the company's 250-person staff had been laid off and five or six offices had been closed. Related News: Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Gives Date for Potential Deadly Threat Facing Cryptocurrencies The Sandbox team, in its official statement, emphasized that the news reports contained “inaccurate and out-of-context statements.” The statement included the following: The co-founders' roles: Arthur Madrid is now the CEO of The Sandbox, and Sébastien Borget is the global ambassador. Borget will continue to represent the platform globally. New CEO: Robby Yung, CEO of investments at Animoca Brands, has been appointed as the new CEO of The Sandbox. Yung has been closely involved with the project since the Animoca-Sandbox merger in 2018. Structural changes: The company has shifted to a more “efficient and agile” team structure, focusing on AI-powered game development and operations. As a result, some locations have been closed. However, developers have stated that most of the reportedly closed offices are actually small-scale spaces run by one to three freelancers. The Sandbox still maintains an official presence in nine different locations. Future plans: The Sandbox and Animoca Brands maintained that they will remain committed to their mission of empowering content creators and that there will be no changes to the SAND, LAND, and NFT ecosystems. The statement said, “The Sandbox is not closing; we remain fully committed to the project.” The developers maintained that, contrary to speculation, The Sandbox has not deviated from its core goals and that efforts to grow the ecosystem are ongoing. *This is not investment advice.

Here’s the Latest,https://timestabloid.com/big-things-coming-for-xrp-holders-heres-the-latest/,"A recent video shared by Xaif (@Xaif_Crypto) featured an interview with Flare co-founder Hugo Philion, who provided updates on FireLight, an application designed to expand the functionality of XRP on the Flare network. The discussion centered on staking opportunities for FXRP, the Flare-based representation of XRP, and the broader vision for extending XRP’s role within decentralized finance. FireLight and Its Purpose Philion explained that FireLight is being developed by Sentora, a group with experience in data and investment management, and confirmed that the project is progressing toward launch. The central idea is that FireLight will enable XRP holders to stake their tokens once they are moved to Flare as FXRP . By doing so, they can earn yield while maintaining exposure to the asset. Philion emphasized that FireLight represents Sentora’s first on-chain application and that its significance lies in converting XRP from an asset used primarily for transaction fees on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) into a more versatile tool within the DeFi ecosystem. Big things coming for #XRP holders! With FXRP on Flare, you’ll soon be able to stake your XRP in vaults and earn real yields . This is how XRP steps deeper into DeFi + smart assets pic.twitter.com/Fi9Eti5EsS — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) August 28, 2025 Technical Progress and Timelines Philion noted that FireLight has already undergone one audit and is currently engaged in an education process. The timeline for release is tied closely to the launch of FXRP itself. “They’re waiting for us to launch FXRP, which we should be in September, and then they will be launching soon after,” he said. This sequencing shows how central FXRP is to Flare’s strategy, as it provides the necessary bridge between XRP and Flare’s smart contract environment . FXRP enables XRP holders to join decentralized applications such as FireLight’s staking platform. Philion said Flare’s mission is to add utility to non-smart-contract assets, a major share of crypto value, by integrating them into DeFi and advanced financial use cases. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Expanding XRP’s Role in DeFi The introduction of FXRP and the launch of FireLight could significantly increase how XRP holders engage with decentralized markets. Rather than remaining limited to fast settlement and liquidity provision, XRP would be positioned to serve in staking , lending, and other yield-generating activities. Philion described the opportunity for XRP staking as “absolutely huge,” suggesting that FireLight will mark a major step in evolving the token’s use cases. With FireLight almost ready and FXRP scheduled for release in September, XRP holders may soon gain access to new staking options on Flare, expanding the asset’s reach in the DeFi market.

Bitcoin Forms Bearish Divergence Similar to 2021 Bitcoin is showing a weekly chart pattern that resembles what appeared just before the 2021 cycle top. The current structure includes higher highs in price while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) forms lower highs. This divergence often appears when momentum slows down during a rally. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez pointed out this signal. He explained that the same setup appeared ahead of the 2021 peak, where Bitcoin topped out and then began a longer downward phase. Now, as BTC recently traded close to $120,000, the RSI has not kept pace. This gap between price and strength indicators suggests reduced buying pressure at higher levels.

The $112,000 area is now viewed as a key support zone. Some analysts believe that holding this level could decide the short-term direction. Michaël van de Poppe shared a chart showing that if Bitcoin breaks below $112,000, a deeper pullback could follow. He posted , “If #Bitcoin can’t hold above $112K, we’ll probably face a very ugly correction across the board.” The price has already dropped from its recent peak near $124,500 and has moved through several previous support levels, which may now act as resistance.

A retest zone near $117,000 could come into play if the price moves upward, but sellers remain active near resistance. Illiquid Supply Builds While Liquid Supply Drops Data from Binance shows that Bitcoin’s illiquid supply is at a high point, while liquid supply is shrinking. This means more BTC is being held in wallets that aren’t used for frequent trading. Fewer units available on the market often lead to stronger price moves in either direction. Remarkably, this change in supply has supported Bitcoin’s rise above $120,000, even with limited external investment. As fewer units are available for trading, any new demand could drive prices higher, especially with long-term holders not selling. Source: CryptoQuant Analyst Arab Chain said , “Whales and institutions are currently adopting a ‘hold for the long haul’ strategy,” but added that any change in this could trigger a fast drop. A few analysts think Bitcoin may top $150,000 in 2025 due to the rise in illiquid supply. On the other hand, if big sellers emerge, the price could drop to $90,000 to $100,000 range. Depending on how liquidity plays out in the coming weeks, the market can either go up or experience a steep drop.

This signals growing adoption of blockchain technology and another step towards the continued evolution of the crypto market. At the same time, as crypto becomes mainstream and network demands soar, the development of Layer 2 blockchains is picking up to solve congestion issues. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , for example, will create a figurative fast lane in the Bitcoin ecosystem, allowing for high-speed, low-cost transactions. This booming presale is already setting the project up for success with $12.6M+ pouring in from investors. On-Chain Economic Data to Revolutionize the Crypto Market Yesterday, the US Department of Commerce published macroeconomic data across 10 blockchains , including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, with assistance from two of the largest oracles by market capitalization. Pyth and Chainlink announced the news on their respective websites and social media pages. The following data are now available on-chain, with annual percent change included: Real GDP level, PCE Price Index level, Real Final Sales to Private Domestic Purchasers level. Since blockchains only have access to data within their closed networks, oracles like Pyth and Chainlink come in as data bridges, allowing chains to access real-world information. They thus feed external data, such as the US macroeconomic data in this case, into the network in a secure, verifiable way. Doing so allows the data to be used for further applications, like creating automated trading strategies based on the latest inflation level. The US putting its macroeconomic data on-chain can also have a dramatic impact on the market, as it will allow traders to react quickly to these figures and make more informed investment decisions. This also marks yet another phase in blockchain technology’s evolution. With its foundation already firmly established, now’s the time for projects that help build or improve upon them, whether it’s making them more efficient, secure, or expanding their capabilities. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is yet another example of this technological shift within crypto. This popular pre-market project is building a Layer-2 to upscale Bitcoin, arguably the most in-demand digital currency today. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): Paving the Way for Bitcoin’s Next Chapter Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) builds on the current blockchain technology, but strives to make it better. While the current Bitcoin blockchain is highly secure, it’s also slow and known for its high transaction costs. To solve these issues, Bitcoin Hyper will develop a Layer 2 (L2) to act as a fast lane to the perpetually clogged Bitcoin L1. Aside from that, the L2 can expand Bitcoin’s utility in ways that weren’t previously possible. For context, Bitcoin has limited programmability compared to Ethereum and Solana. But Hyper’s smart tweaks, like its Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration, bridge the technological gap between old and new blockchain tech. The entire ecosystem includes three main components: the Bitcoin L1, the Hyper L2 powered by the SVM, and a canonical bridge. Here’s how they work together: First, you deposit $BTC to an address monitored by Hyper’s canonical bridge. This automatically mints wrapped $BTC ($wBTC) cross-chain, ready for use on Hyper’s L2. The $wBTC value is constantly synchronized between L1 and L2. On the L2, you can use your $wBTC to interact with dApps and DeFi protocols. To bring your $BTC back to the L1, simply withdraw it to your Bitcoin wallet address. Since the L2 runs on a Solana Virtual Machine, transactions are much faster and at a lower cost.

Bitcoin Hyper’s Presale Is Booming: $12.6M+ Raised and Counting To raise funds for this much-needed Bitcoin upgrade, the project team is running a presale of its $HYPER token. To date, it has already raised over $12.6M, making it one of the best presales of 2025. Available for $0.012825, the token will be used for network gas fees, getting exclusive access to on-chain features, and enjoying voting rights when the L2 launches. Early adopters can also stake their tokens throughout the presale for 88% APY. According to our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction , $HYPER has the potential to reach as much as $0.32 by late 2025 (a 2395% increase from its current price). Buying tokens is quick and easy, as Bitcoin Hyper accepts credit/debit cards as well as crypto payments. Our ‘How to Buy Bitcoin Hyper’ guide has all the details you need to get started. Join the Bitcoin Hyper presale today. The Next Phase of Crypto is Here With the US government’s growing adoption of blockchain technology, we’re entering a new phase of the crypto economy. Putting macroeconomic data on-chain will revolutionize the way we trade in more ways than one. In a similar way, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) can fundamentally change how we use Bitcoin. $HYPER holds long-term utility, from staking to gas fees and governance. And its L2 bringing applications that weren’t previously possible for Bitcoin’s L1 gives this token moonshot potential in 2025 and beyond. Disclaimer: This is not investment advice.

The world of cryptocurrency trading often moves at lightning speed, but sometimes, even the biggest players hit a snag. Recently, Binance futures trading experienced a sudden, albeit brief, disruption that sent ripples across the market. This incident left many traders wondering what exactly happened and what it means for the stability of their investments. What Exactly Happened with Binance Futures Trading? On a recent day, Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges globally, announced a significant issue. Specifically, its USD-margined (UM) futures trading encountered an abrupt halt. This disruption affected both USDT and USDC perpetual futures, stopping all activity for approximately 21 minutes. The halt occurred between 6:17 a.m. and 6:38 a.m. UTC. During this critical window, traders found themselves unable to execute new orders or manage existing positions on these specific futures contracts. Binance later confirmed via its official X account that the issue was resolved, and Binance futures trading was back to normal operations. The Unexplained Disruption: Why No Cause Provided? Despite resolving the technical glitch, Binance has not yet offered an official explanation for the cause of the disruption. This lack of transparency has naturally led to speculation within the crypto community. Understanding the root cause is crucial for building trust and preventing future occurrences. Without an official statement, the incident remains a mystery, highlighting the need for robust post-mortem analyses from major exchanges. Traders rely on stability, and an unexplained halt, even a short one, can create anxiety and impact confidence in the platform’s reliability. Did Other Exchanges Face Similar Futures Trading Issues? Interestingly, the disruption wasn’t confined solely to Binance. Shortly after the halt on Binance, similar issues were observed on other prominent exchanges, including Bybit and Bitget. This simultaneous occurrence suggests a broader underlying factor rather than an isolated incident. Many industry experts presume that such widespread disruptions are often a result of most exchanges relying on ‘index feeds.’ These feeds incorporate price data from various sources, including other exchanges, to minimize risk and ensure fair pricing. Therefore, a significant anomaly on one major platform could potentially cascade across others. Understanding the Speculation: Market Makers and API Orders Beyond index feeds, other theories have emerged regarding the cause of the halt. Some market participants speculated that the problem might have originated from malfunctioning orders placed by market makers. Market makers play a vital role in providing liquidity, and any issues with their systems could severely impact trading. Moreover, disruptions could also stem from orders placed via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Many institutional traders and sophisticated individual investors use APIs for automated trading strategies. A bug or overload in API processing could trigger widespread issues, impacting Binance futures trading and beyond. What Does This Mean for Futures Traders? For traders involved in Binance futures trading , such events underscore the inherent volatility and technical risks within the crypto market. Even with leading exchanges, unexpected halts can occur. This highlights the importance of effective risk management strategies. Diversification: Spreading investments across different assets and exchanges can mitigate risk. Stop-Loss Orders: Utilizing automated stop-loss orders can help protect capital during sudden market movements or disruptions. Staying Informed: Keeping up-to-date with exchange announcements and market news is crucial. These incidents serve as a potent reminder that while crypto offers exciting opportunities, it also demands vigilance and preparedness for unforeseen circumstances. The resilience of platforms like Binance, despite temporary setbacks, is continually tested. Conclusion: Navigating the Dynamics of Binance Futures Trading The recent 21-minute halt in Binance futures trading was a brief but impactful event that resonated across the crypto landscape. While the immediate issue was resolved, the lack of an official cause leaves an important question unanswered. This incident not only affected Binance but also mirrored on other major exchanges, pointing to interconnected market dynamics. As the crypto market matures, transparency and robust infrastructure become increasingly vital. Traders must remain adaptable and informed, understanding that even leading platforms can face technical challenges. Ultimately, this event serves as a valuable lesson in risk management and the continuous evolution of digital asset trading. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What type of trading was affected during the Binance disruption? The disruption specifically affected Binance’s USD-margined (UM) futures trading, including USDT and USDC perpetual futures contracts. 2. How long did the Binance futures trading halt last? The trading halt on Binance lasted for approximately 21 minutes, from 6:17 a.m. to 6:38 a.m. UTC. 3. Did other cryptocurrency exchanges experience similar issues? Yes, similar disruptions were observed on other exchanges like Bybit and Bitget shortly after the Binance incident, suggesting a broader market impact. 4. Has Binance provided an official reason for the futures trading halt? No, Binance has not yet provided an official explanation for the cause of the disruption, only confirming that the issue was resolved. 5. What are index feeds, and how might they relate to the disruption? Index feeds aggregate price data from multiple exchanges to minimize risk and ensure fair pricing. A significant issue on one major exchange can cascade through these feeds, potentially affecting others. Did you find this article insightful?

A key technical indicator is warning of an early end to the bitcoin (BTC) bull market, even as traders continue to position for a continued rally into the year-end. The indicator under consideration is the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum oscillator that ranges from 0 to 100. It helps traders gauge the speed and magnitude of recent price movements, typically calculated over a 14-day, 14-week, or 14-month period. BTC’s 14-month RSI is now flashing a bearish divergence, a pattern that occurs when the indicator begins to decline while prices continue to rise. The occurrence of this divergence on the monthly chart indicates that BTC's bull market may be weakening and could potentially transition into a bearish trend. The monthly chart shows that while BTC reached a new high in the July-August period, surpassing the December peak, the RSI moved in the opposite direction, forming a lower high. The bearish divergence gains added significance as it coincides with BTC encountering resistance at a key trendline drawn from the previous bull market peaks of December 2017 and November 2021. To cut to the chase, bulls should stay alert for potential bearish trend reversals. That said, the latest market flows suggest that traders are anticipating continued price gains. ""Blocks suggest traders are gearing up for further gains, with notable activity in December BTC call spreads ($125K/$160K). Ethereum's focus was on tighter topside, with $4,800 strikes active for September, and front-end pressure lifting,"" Jake Ostrovskis, OTC Trader at Wintermute, said in an email Thursday. Block flows are large transactions privately negotiated over the counter and outside of the public order book. These transactions typically involve institutions and high-net-worth individuals. The December call spread mentioned by Ostrovskis essentially bets on prices rallying to $160K and higher by the end of the year. The consensus is for a continued rally into the year-end and beyond, with prices reaching as high as $190,000 . As of writing, BTC changed hands near $110,500, representing a 4.6% loss for the month, according to CoinDesk data.

This sudden wipeout sent shockwaves, following a larger trend of $341 million in futures positions liquidated over the past 24 hours. For many traders, this isn’t just a number; it represents significant losses and a stark reminder of the inherent volatility in digital asset trading. Understanding these rapid shifts is crucial for anyone navigating the crypto space. What Exactly is Crypto Futures Liquidation? When we talk about crypto futures liquidation , we are referring to the forced closing of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange. This happens when a trader’s margin balance falls below the required maintenance margin. Think of it like this: you borrow money (leverage) to make a bigger bet on a crypto’s future price. If the price moves against your bet significantly, the exchange steps in to close your position automatically to prevent further losses and protect its own capital. It’s a safety mechanism, albeit a painful one for the trader involved. Leverage amplifies both gains and losses. While it can lead to substantial profits with small capital, it also exposes traders to higher risks. A small price movement against a highly leveraged position can quickly trigger a liquidation, wiping out the initial margin. This rapid chain of events often contributes to market instability, especially during periods of high volatility. Why Did This Massive Liquidation Happen So Quickly? Such a significant crypto futures liquidation event typically points to extreme market volatility. A sudden, sharp price movement—either up or down—can trigger a cascade of liquidations. For instance, if Bitcoin or Ethereum experiences a rapid drop, all traders with long positions (betting on price increase) who are highly leveraged will see their positions close automatically as their margin depletes. This, in turn, can add selling pressure, pushing prices down further and triggering even more liquidations. It becomes a vicious cycle, often referred to as a “liquidation cascade.” Several factors can contribute to these sudden price swings. These include major news events, macroeconomic data releases, regulatory announcements, or even large institutional trades. Identifying the exact trigger in real-time can be challenging, but the outcome for leveraged traders is often swift and severe. Who Gets Hit Hardest by Crypto Futures Liquidation? The immediate impact of a large-scale crypto futures liquidation primarily falls on individual retail traders. These traders often use high leverage in hopes of quick profits, but they also bear the brunt of sudden market reversals. While institutional traders might also face liquidations, they typically employ more sophisticated risk management strategies. Beyond individual losses, these events also affect overall market sentiment. A large liquidation can create fear and uncertainty, leading to further selling pressure from other traders. This can result in a broader market downturn, impacting even those who are not directly involved in futures trading. Exchanges, while executing the liquidations, also face the challenge of maintaining system stability under extreme load. Navigating the Volatile Waters: Actionable Steps for Traders Understanding the risks associated with crypto futures liquidation is the first step toward smart trading. Here are some actionable insights: Manage Your Leverage Wisely: Avoid excessively high leverage. While tempting, it drastically increases your risk of liquidation. Start with lower leverage ratios, especially if you are new to futures trading. Implement Stop-Loss Orders: Always use stop-loss orders. These automatically close your position at a predetermined price, limiting your potential losses before a full liquidation occurs. It’s your safety net. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversifying across different assets can help mitigate risks during volatile periods. Stay Informed and Educated: Keep up-to-date with market news, technical analysis, and fundamental developments. Knowledge is your best defense against unexpected market movements. Practice Risk Assessment: Before entering any trade, assess the potential reward versus the potential risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose. These strategies are vital for protecting your capital in the unpredictable world of crypto futures. Summary: The Crucial Lesson from Recent Liquidations The recent $100 million crypto futures liquidation serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent risks and rewards in the volatile cryptocurrency market. While futures trading offers exciting opportunities, it demands a disciplined approach to risk management. Traders must prioritize understanding leverage, setting stop-loss orders, and staying informed to navigate these turbulent waters successfully. Always remember, protecting your capital is paramount in the high-stakes game of crypto trading. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Here are some common questions regarding crypto futures liquidation: What does it mean when futures are “liquidated”? When futures are liquidated, it means an exchange automatically closes a trader’s leveraged position because their margin balance has fallen below the required level, typically due to significant price movements against their trade. How does leverage contribute to a crypto futures liquidation? Leverage allows traders to control larger positions with a smaller amount of capital. However, it also magnifies losses. A small adverse price movement can quickly deplete a highly leveraged position’s margin, triggering a liquidation much faster than with lower leverage. Can traders prevent their crypto futures from being liquidated? While complete prevention isn’t guaranteed in extreme volatility, traders can significantly reduce the risk by using lower leverage, setting strict stop-loss orders, maintaining sufficient margin, and diversifying their portfolios. What are the broader market implications of large liquidations? Large liquidations often indicate significant market volatility and can lead to increased selling pressure, further price drops, and a general decline in market sentiment. They can also highlight periods of high risk for all participants. Was this explanation helpful in understanding the recent crypto market movements?

The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with the latest move from a significant player. An anonymous whale recently made headlines by depositing a staggering 5 million FORM token , valued at an impressive $18.61 million, directly into Binance. This massive transfer, reported by Arkham, has naturally sparked considerable discussion and speculation across the market. Investors and enthusiasts are now closely watching the implications of this substantial transaction. What Does This Massive FORM Token Deposit Signify? When large amounts of any asset, especially a substantial FORM token holding, move to an exchange, it typically signals a potential intention to sell. Whales, by definition, hold enough assets to influence market prices significantly. Their actions are closely watched because they can often precede major price movements. This particular deposit could indicate that the whale is preparing to liquidate a portion of their holdings. Potential Selling Pressure: A deposit of this size can introduce significant selling pressure if the whale decides to offload their FORM token on the open market. Market Sentiment Shift: Such a move can also trigger a shift in market sentiment, leading other holders to consider selling, fearing a price drop. Liquidity Management: Alternatively, it might be a strategic move for liquidity management, though less common for such a large amount to be moved in one go without an immediate selling intent. The whale still retains a substantial 22.03 million FORM token , worth approximately $81.73 million, even after this transfer. This remaining holding underscores their significant influence within the FORM ecosystem, suggesting that even a partial sale could have considerable impact. Is a FORM Token Price Drop Imminent? The immediate question on many investors’ minds is whether this deposit will lead to a decline in the FORM token price. Historically, large transfers to exchanges are often interpreted as bearish signals. However, the market’s reaction isn’t always straightforward, and various factors can influence the outcome. While the potential for a sell-off is real, several factors could influence the outcome: Market Demand: If there is strong buying demand for FORM token , the market might absorb the selling pressure without a drastic price fall. Whale’s Strategy: The whale might execute an OTC (Over-The-Counter) deal, which wouldn’t directly impact exchange prices as much as open market selling. Timing: The timing of any potential sale relative to broader market conditions will also play a crucial role, as overall market trends can sometimes overshadow individual whale moves. It is vital for investors to exercise caution and monitor the market closely. This event highlights the inherent volatility of cryptocurrency markets, especially when large holders make their moves. Informed decisions are paramount. Understanding FORM Token Whale Behavior Understanding why whales make such moves is key to interpreting market signals. Whales often have deep insights or specific strategies that guide their actions. Their deposits to exchanges can be driven by various motivations: Profit Taking: After a significant price run-up, a whale might decide to realize profits, cashing out a portion of their gains. Portfolio Rebalancing: They might be rebalancing their portfolio, shifting capital from FORM token to other assets they believe have greater potential. Market Manipulation: In some instances, large deposits can be used to create FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) and drive prices down, allowing the whale to buy back at a lower price, a tactic known as ‘wash trading’ or ‘bear trapping’. Data platforms like Arkham provide invaluable transparency into these movements, allowing the community to track significant transactions and anticipate potential market shifts. This transparency is a cornerstone of the crypto market, enabling more informed decision-making for all participants. Navigating the FORM Token Market Volatility For individual investors, reacting wisely to such whale movements is crucial. Panic selling can often lead to losses, while ignoring the signals entirely can also be detrimental. Here are some actionable insights to help you navigate the potential volatility: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always investigate the underlying fundamentals of the FORM token project, its use cases, and development roadmap before making investment decisions. Set Stop-Loss Orders: Implement risk management strategies like stop-loss orders to protect your capital from sudden price drops, limiting potential losses. Diversify Your Portfolio: Avoid putting all your eggs in one basket. Diversification across different assets can mitigate risks associated with individual asset volatility. Stay Informed: Follow reliable crypto news sources and analytics platforms to stay updated on market developments and whale activities. Knowledge is power in these markets. The cryptocurrency market is dynamic, and understanding the interplay between large holders and market sentiment is a continuous learning process. Adaptability and a well-thought-out strategy are your best allies. Conclusion: The recent $18.6 million FORM token deposit to Binance by an anonymous whale is a significant event that demands attention. While it primarily suggests a potential sell-off, the exact impact on the FORM token price remains to be seen. This incident serves as a powerful reminder of the influence large holders wield and the importance of vigilance, informed decision-making, and robust risk management strategies in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. Stay tuned as we monitor how this intriguing development unfolds, and remember that market analysis is an ongoing process. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a crypto whale? A1: A crypto whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence its market price with their transactions. Q2: Why do whales deposit tokens to exchanges? A2: Whales typically deposit tokens to exchanges when they intend to sell, take profits, rebalance their portfolios, or in some cases, strategically influence market sentiment. This makes their holdings more liquid. Q3: How does a large FORM token deposit affect its price? A3: A large deposit of FORM token to an exchange can create selling pressure, potentially leading to a price drop if the whale sells their holdings on the open market. However, strong buying demand or OTC deals can mitigate this impact. Q4: What is Arkham and how does it track whale movements? A4: Arkham is a blockchain analytics platform that tracks and identifies entities behind cryptocurrency transactions. It uses on-chain data to provide insights into whale movements, exchange flows, and other significant market activities. Q5: Should I sell my FORM token holdings after this news? A5: Investment decisions should always be based on your own research, risk tolerance, and financial goals. While a whale deposit can signal potential selling pressure, it’s crucial to consider broader market conditions and the project’s fundamentals before making any decisions.

Investors are watching closely as Bitcoin and Ethereum battle for dominance as the ultimate store-of-value asset. The two cryptocurrencies are getting great media attention due to increased institutional interest, clearer regulations, and significant technological improvements. Nevertheless, the arguments keep going and the smart investors are wondering: Which crypto asset is the best to buy at the moment? Surprisingly, the answer may not be Bitcoin or Ethereum at all— it could be MAGACOIN FINANCE , a fast-emerging project that’s positioning itself as the next big opportunity in digital assets. Bitcoin Continues to Dominate Bitcoin continues to dominate headlines but not without turbulence: Bitcoin Miner Hut 8 Surges 10% on 1.5 GW Expansion Plans Shares of Bitcoin mining firm Hut 8 soared 10% today after news of its 1.5 GW expansion. Investment bank Roth Capital emphasized this could “materially re-rate the stock,” signaling renewed institutional excitement around Bitcoin mining. Bitcoin ETFs Face Record Outflows Despite mining optimism, Bitcoin ETFs are under pressure. Analysts report that ETFs need nearly $1 billion in new inflows to prevent the second-largest outflow in history. Weak ETF dynamics have weighed on Bitcoin price action. Bitcoin Price Under Pressure As of 12:00 PM ET, Bitcoin’s on-chain data reveals slowing network adoption, with bearish indicators pointing to limited upside in the short term. In short, Bitcoin remains a giant, but short-term headwinds mean investors are searching for the best crypto to buy beyond BTC. Ethereum: Technical Volatility but Long-Term Strength Ethereum has also been in the spotlight with both short-term volatility and long-term bullish momentum. On August 26, 2025 , Binance issued a warning about potential price manipulation setups in Ethereum. ETH dipped to $4,518 before rebounding toward $4,640, with resistance near $4,800. Traders were advised to proceed cautiously, as volatility spikes made leveraged positions especially risky. A report from BlockByte on August 26, 2025 highlighted ETH’s retreat from $4,953 down to $4,400–$4,419. These fundamentals make Ethereum attractive, but short-term turbulence leaves many investors looking elsewhere for the best crypto to buy with less immediate downside risk. Enter MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Best Crypto to Buy in Q4 While Bitcoin and Ethereum continue their heavyweight contest, a new player is stepping into the arena: MAGACOIN FINANCE . This project is gaining momentum as one of the best cryptos to buy for both seasoned investors and newcomers looking to get ahead of the next bull wave. Investors can secure tokens below $0.001 before the big exchanges list MAGACOIN FINANCE, creating the potential for early exponential gains. Major investors continue to stack MAGACOIN FINANCE as leading analysts give a greenlight with major upward potential. Designed with utility, scarcity, and reward mechanisms in mind, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers real value rather than hype. The project has been carefully audited by leading blockchain firm HashEx and the team is KYC verified. This adds another layer of confidence among investors. Thousands of investors have already joined the MAGACOIN FINANCE presale—many securing an exclusive 50% EXTRA allocation, positioning themselves for massive upside as demand surges ahead of exchange listings. MAGACOIN FINANCE: One of the Best Crypto Presales to Buy in 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly gaining traction as one of the best crypto presales to buy in 2025 thanks to its exceptional transparency and audit-backed foundation. The project has passed a full smart contract audit by Hashex and features a fully KYC-verified team, offering rare legitimacy in today’s market. These verified credentials have made it a standout choice among analysts and investors alike. Conclusion The discussion about Bitcoin and Ethereum is still going on. Bitcoin’s energy-intensive mining and ETF problems are signs that the cryptocurrency is still risky but also strong. Meanwhile, the ups and downs of Ethereum cover its solid features for the future, such as staking and being the leader of DeFi. But if you’re an investor asking yourself what is the best crypto to buy right now, the answer may not be the obvious two giants. MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving out its space as a fresh, high-potential alternative poised to reward early adopters. Don’t wait for Bitcoin or Ethereum to break new highs—savvy investors know that fortunes are made by spotting the best crypto to buy before the rest of the market catches on.

Ethereum's highly anticipated network upgrade Pectra brought improved scalability and security while launching new features. During Q2 25, we maintained our relative value-based investment strategy, which meant that the portfolio remained underweight in Ethereum. Several states advanced digital asset reserve legislation, aligning with the Trump administration's push for a national bitcoin reserve and digital asset stockpile. As the market evolves and activity/adoption occurs between the two networks, we continue to reevaluate our allocations to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Key Takeaways Markets: US stocks were volatile due to concerns over the impact of Trump's tariffs on economic growth, inflation, and Fed policy, with fears of recession or stagflation. Despite traditional market volatility, positive momentum around regulation led cryptocurrency markets to rebound during the second quarter of 2025 (Q2 25). Contributors/Detractors: Both holdings were positive contributors to the portfolio, which includes Bitcoin (BTC-USD) ( BTC ) in the Currency sector, and Ethereum (ETH-USD) ( ETH ) in the Smart Contract Platform sector. Portfolio Outlook: During Q2 25, we maintained our relative value-based investment strategy, keeping an underweight to Ethereum and overweight to Bitcoin when compared to the strategy's benchmark, the S&P Cryptocurrency MegaCap Index. Market Outlook: We believe that new blockchain technologies have the potential for capital appreciation that can be captured through strategic selection of their underlying tokens. We believe emerging blockchain technologies offer capital appreciation opportunities through selective exposure to their underlying tokens. Recent moves by the Trump Administration and several U.S. state governments to establish cryptocurrency reserves, establish rules for stablecoins and provide regulatory clarity on the market structure for digital assets aim to position the U.S. as a leading crypto hub.

Higher T-bill demand induced by broader allocations into cryptocurrencies represents greater fragility in the short-term dollar funding market. As volatility rises, stablecoin outflows and collateral sales could erode Treasuries’ safe-haven role, leaving investors more exposed just when protection is needed most. By Victor Xing An underappreciated corner of crypto is shaping US government debt markets. Stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency designed to retain a stable value, were once seen mainly as digital cash for trading. But stablecoins now hold hundreds of billions of dollars in Treasury bills. And flows into or out of stablecoins can move short-term yields, shift liquidity conditions, and alter Treasuries’ safe-haven role. For investors, that means a new source of volatility in the world’s most important safe asset, one that links portfolio resilience to crypto-market sentiment. The Bank for International Settlements ((BIS)) estimates that inflows into stablecoins reduce 3-month T-bill yields by 2 to 2.5 basis points within 10 days, while outflows lift yields by 6 to 8 basis points in the same time period. In its report, “ Stablecoins and safe asset prices ,” BIS notes that stablecoins pegged to the US dollar and backed by T-bills increasingly resemble money market funds. After the $5 trillion debt ceiling hike increased T-bill issuance, stablecoins’ contribution toward absorbing upsized ($100 billion) weekly 4-week T-bill issuance has underscored cryptocurrencies’ role as funding provider for US federal expenditure, especially when total US public debt outstanding surged $700 billion in the month of July 2025 (Figure 1). Figure 1. Source: Treasury Department’s “Debt to the Penny” portal. When Crypto Sentiment Drives Treasury Liquidity A paradox emerged as a major fiat haven asset (and funding channel for the US federal government) became closely coupled with instruments active in decentralized finance (DeFi). In “ Stablecoins and Crypto Shocks: An Update ,” New York Federal Reserve researchers concluded “demand for stablecoins grows along with demand for non-stablecoin crypto assets (as proxied by Bitcoins)” and “the demand for stablecoins appears to be tied to activity levels in the broader crypto ecosystem.” This suggests that a decline in broader crypto sentiment (e.g., Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) downturn) could correspond to less demand for stablecoins, and outflows from stablecoins to cash could result in collateral shedding. This risk-off to T-bill liquidation feedback loop risks eroding the latter’s haven characteristics. Furthermore, as of June 30, the largest stablecoin, Tether ( USDT-USD ), held 20% of its reserves in corporate bonds, precious metals, Bitcoins, other investments, and secured loans . These less-liquid assets would be less capable of meeting cash demands during a funding crunch, and this hints at “dash for cash” via T-bill sales during adverse market shocks. A Brookings analysis highlighted this dynamic during the March 2020 volatility event as institutions sold Treasuries , the most liquid assets available on institutional balance sheets, to meet funding needs at the height of the equity rout. The New York Fed highlighted the dominance of Tether and USDC ( USDC-USD ) in the stablecoin market, and both are large T-bill holders (Figure 2). Figure 2. A Fair-Weather Funding Channel with Investor Risks The amplification of T-bill flows by stablecoins could act as a double-edged sword in shaping US market conditions. During “fair-weather” periods, healthy inflows into the crypto markets (and growth in stablecoins) would boost demands for T-bills to help offset the trend rise in US short-term debt sales. Conversely, market instability and a broader liquidity drought (that reduces risk appetite in cryptocurrency markets) could reduce stablecoins' footprint in the Treasury market, thus leaving a greater portion of issuance to be absorbed by fixed income investors. This would likely come at a time of rising government benefits disbursement and lower tax receipt. Finally, CME analysis noted growing institutional acceptance of cryptocurrencies and their integration alongside traditional investments, which would likely contribute to higher equity and Bitcoin correlation . Combined, higher correlation between traditional risk assets and crypto markets, co-movements between digital asset sentiment and stablecoin market cap, and the casual relationship between stablecoin market cap and demand for T-bills suggest higher US fiscal and sovereign bond market sensitivity to cryptocurrency volatility. Conclusion: Fragility Behind the Stablecoin–Treasury Link In conclusion, higher T-bill demand induced by broader allocations into cryptocurrencies represents greater fragility in the short-term dollar funding market. Stablecoins’ “fair-weather” debt purchases offer only a temporary reprieve for fiscal authorities, offsetting issuance pressures but not permanently absorbing them. For portfolios, the risk is hidden but real: a virtuous cycle in calm markets can turn vicious in stressed conditions. As volatility rises, stablecoin outflows and collateral sales could erode Treasuries’ safe-haven role, leaving investors more exposed just when protection is needed most. Investors may need to stress-test their reliance on Treasuries as a safe-haven and prepare for funding dynamics increasingly shaped by crypto-market sentiment.

Binance, long considered the go-to exchange for individual retail investors, is now witnessing a dramatic surge in Binance whale activity . This remarkable change signals a potential evolution in how major players interact with the digital asset market. Understanding the Unprecedented Surge in Binance Whale Activity For years, Binance maintained a reputation as the preferred platform for everyday crypto enthusiasts. However, data from CryptoQuant, highlighted by analyst maartunn, paints a new picture. Since the beginning of 2024, the average Bitcoin (BTC) inflow per transaction on Binance has skyrocketed. Starting at a modest 0.8 BTC at the year’s outset, this figure has since climbed significantly to an impressive 13.5 BTC, based on a seven-day moving average. This metric clearly indicates that larger, more influential investors – often referred to as “whales” – are now making substantial moves on the exchange. Who Are These Whale Investors, and Why Does Their Activity Matter? Whale investors are individuals or entities holding vast amounts of cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence market prices with their trades. Their movements are often watched closely as indicators of market sentiment and potential future price trends. The sudden increase in Binance whale activity suggests a growing confidence among these large holders in the exchange’s liquidity and operational capabilities, or perhaps a strategic positioning for anticipated market shifts. This influx challenges the traditional perception of Binance. It suggests that the exchange is maturing beyond its retail roots, attracting a more diverse and capital-intensive user base. This evolution could have significant implications for market dynamics. What Drives This Shift to Binance for Large Investors? Several factors might contribute to whales increasingly choosing Binance: Liquidity: Binance consistently boasts some of the highest trading volumes globally, offering deep liquidity. This is crucial for whales who need to execute large orders without causing significant price slippage. Range of Assets: The exchange provides a vast array of cryptocurrencies and trading pairs, allowing whales diverse investment opportunities. Infrastructure: Despite past regulatory challenges, Binance has continuously invested in its technological infrastructure, security, and compliance frameworks, which can appeal to more sophisticated investors seeking reliability. Market Conditions: The broader market sentiment, potentially driven by factors like the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, could be encouraging larger capital flows into the crypto space, with Binance being a primary conduit. The shift underscores Binance’s adaptability and its efforts to cater to a broader spectrum of market participants. What Are the Implications of Increased Whale Activity? The surge in Binance whale activity carries several important implications for the cryptocurrency market: Increased Volatility: Large transactions by whales can sometimes lead to greater price swings, as their buy or sell orders can significantly impact supply and demand. Enhanced Market Depth: Conversely, the presence of more large players can also increase market depth, making it easier for large orders to be filled without drastic price changes. Signal for Retail Investors: Retail investors often observe whale movements. A sustained increase in whale activity on Binance could be interpreted as a bullish signal for the market, potentially attracting more capital. Competitive Landscape: This trend also heats up competition among exchanges, as others will likely strive to attract similar high-value clients. It’s a dynamic environment, and understanding these movements helps paint a clearer picture of the evolving crypto landscape. Navigating the Waters: Actionable Insights for Investors For both new and experienced investors, understanding the implications of significant Binance whale activity is key. Stay Informed: Monitor on-chain data and analyst reports to gauge large investor sentiment. Risk Management: Be aware that increased whale presence can lead to higher volatility. Always practice sound risk management strategies. Diversification: Do not put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your portfolio across different assets and exchanges if appropriate. Long-Term Perspective: While whale movements can cause short-term fluctuations, focusing on long-term market trends and fundamental analysis remains crucial. The crypto market is constantly evolving, and adapting to these changes is essential for informed decision-making. In conclusion, the undeniable surge in Binance whale activity since the start of 2024 marks a pivotal moment for the exchange and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. This shift from a retail-centric hub to a significant player for large investors highlights Binance’s growing maturity and the increasing institutionalization of digital assets. As whales navigate these waters, their actions will undoubtedly shape market trends, offering both opportunities and challenges for all participants. It’s a testament to the dynamic nature of crypto, where adaptation and robust infrastructure continue to attract capital from all corners of the financial world. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly is a “whale investor” in cryptocurrency? A whale investor is an individual or entity holding a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency. Their trades are significant enough to potentially move market prices. Why is the increase in Binance whale activity notable? Binance has traditionally been seen as a retail-focused exchange. The surge in large transactions indicates a shift, showing that major investors are increasingly using the platform, challenging its previous perception. How does CryptoQuant track whale activity on Binance? CryptoQuant tracks whale activity by analyzing on-chain data, specifically focusing on metrics like the average Bitcoin inflow per transaction on exchanges, using moving averages to identify trends. Could this whale activity impact Bitcoin’s price? Yes, significant whale activity, whether buying or selling, can influence Bitcoin’s price due to the large volume of assets being moved. It can contribute to both volatility and market depth. Should retail investors be concerned about this trend? Retail investors should be aware that increased whale activity can lead to higher market volatility. However, it also signifies growing confidence and liquidity in the market. It’s important to use this information for informed decision-making rather than panic. Share This Insightful Article! Did you find this analysis of Binance whale activity informative?

This has since turned sentiment around the cryptocurrency toward the negative. However, not everyone is on the bandwagon as crypto analyst JACKIS believes that the digital asset is still bullish . In fact, the analyst explains that the Ethereum price is bullish for years to come, despite saying that one of the major bull market indicators has come to an end. End Of An Era: Forget The Crypto 4-Year Cycle The crypto 4-year cycle remains the most prominent of all cycles, having served as a pointer toward each of the previous bull markets. This cycle coincides with the Bitcoin halving, which occurs roughly every four years, and precedes each bull market by a year. This means the year after each Bitcoin halving has often seen the start of a market-wide bull run. However, this time around, the market seems to be deviating, especially as digital assets such as Ethereum have not followed Bitcoin straight to new all-time highs. This is something that crypto analyst Jackis alludes to in their post, telling investors to forget about the 4-year cycle. According to the analyst, for Ethereum specifically, the 4-year cycle had ended back in December 2024. This coincides with the year in which Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs were approved, leading to what many believe is a premature high for Bitcoin, although Ethereum did not enjoy the same fate. Given this, the analyst believes that investors must evolve with the fact that there is no longer a 4-year cycle for Ethereum. But this does not mean that Ethereum is no longer bullish. Quite the opposite, in fact, as the analyst says Ethereum is bullish for years to come . Ethereum Price Set For New Highs With the current state of the market, the analyst points out that the recent rejection from all-time highs has led to a 6th touch of the outlined trendline. However, this is no cause for alarm because historically, there has been an MTF shakeout before an HTF expansion. In the present case, it is possible for more sell-offs to take the Ethereum price below $4,000 again. This would be a pre-bull market shakeout, leading bears into a possible trap with beliefs that the cycle top is in. But as the analyst explains, the ETH price could rally from here toward highs above $7,000 . “If the price wants to immediately continue, then it needs to accept above 21 ATHs straight from here,” Jackis said.",Ethereum|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|TRADING|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-29 08:00:11

Here’s Why It May Be Different This Time,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/another-short-lived-solana-rally-different-this-time/,"Solana (SOL) is attempting to reclaim a strong resistance zone for the fourth time, which has led some investors to suggest that the rally won’t last long. Nonetheless, on-chain data suggests that SOL’s next leg up could be starting. Related Reading: XRP Shows Strength Amid $3 Retest, But Analyst Warns Of Potential Correction Solana Breaks Out Of Triangle Pattern On Thursday, Solana hit a six-month high of $216 after breaking out of one of its most crucial resistance zones. The cryptocurrency bounced 16% from Monday’s lows and reclaimed the $200 barrier as support on Wednesday, closing the day above this area. SOL briefly reclaimed this level during the early August breakout, but the recent market corrections dragged its price to the $175-$195 area. Amid Thursday’s rally, market watcher Daan Crypto Trades highlighted its performance, asserting that it is “at an interesting spot.” The trader explained that Solana is trading in a multi-month rising wedge pattern, currently nearing the resistance level that has held over the months. Notably, the cryptocurrency has been rejected from the pattern’s upper boundary multiple times since July, retesting the ascending support line on each occasion. Supporting SOL’s case, Daan argued that it has “been strong on the back of treasury vehicles being spun up and potential upcoming buying + frontrunning,” noting that “rising wedges are generally leaning bearish but in bull markets it’s nothing new for these to break towards the upside instead.” Based on this and the cryptocurrency’s recent performance, he forecasted that it would reach higher levels later this year. Similarly, analyst Ali Martinez pointed out a six-month ascending triangle pattern on the altcoin’s chart, which targets the $360 area. Solana retested the pattern’s resistance three times over the past month and a half, but ultimately failed to turn the $205-$207 zone into support. As the altcoin pushed past the $210 mark, the analyst raised the question of whether the ongoing breakout attempt will be successful or if SOL’s rally would be short-lived for the fourth time. Fourth Time’s The Charm? Martinez shared multiple technical indicators that suggest Solana could finally break out of this pattern and aim for the long-awaited $300 barrier. The analyst explained that the backdrop of social sentiment and on-chain positioning differentiate the current price move from the previous attempts. Unlike the previous breakout attempts, sentiment across the community is more subdued. “Historically, euphoric sentiment above the ‘230’ index level coincided with local tops, as excessive optimism preceded retracements,” he detailed. According to the analyst’s chart, sentiment is muted this time, which suggests “skepticism rather than crowded bullish positioning.” Additionally, around $1 billion in realized profits have been booked after the surge to $212, signaling that some traders likely remain unconvinced that momentum will hold during this attempt. He also highlighted that there are significant accumulation zones below $207, with multiple support zones between $165 and $206, providing a strong base to continue rallying, which contrasts with the lack of resistance above the $212 area. Related Reading: Cardano Retests Key Support As SEC Delays ETF Decision – Is An October Rally Brewing? “If buying pressure builds, the path toward $300 is comparatively less obstructed,” Martinez affirmed, adding that Solana’s fundamentals, including the proposed Alpenglow consensus upgrade, may also add fuel to the breakout. “With skepticism still present, strong accumulation below $207, and little resistance overhead, this attempt has a higher probability of succeeding compared to prior failures. A confirmed breakout above $212–$215 on sustained volume would shift focus to the $300 target zone,” he concluded. As of this writing, Solana is trading at $212, a 17% increase in the weekly timeframe.

One of the hottest debates has been a Solana price prediction of $300 by December. While Solana (SOL) has been one of the top crypto gainers in the 2025 bull run, analysts and investors question the feasibility of the prediction. Simultaneously, an emerging PayFi solution, Remittix (RTX), continues to generate buzz after analysts forecast a 5,500% gain by December. Can Solana price shoot to $300, or are we journeying to $150? Is a 5,500% gain feasible for Remittix (RTX) ? Let’s analyse. Solana Price: $150 Or $300? At the time of writing, Solana trades near $212, driven by recent market-wide bullish volatility. Analysts argue the price might touch down at $150 if the market pulls back or reverses. Solana has seen renewed interest in its ecosystem during the past few months. On-chain metrics have reported increasing network activity, with Solana now hosting a growing number of developers, DeFi projects, NFTs, and gaming applications. Rumors of a possible SOL ETF approval are driving institutional interest. Solana’s price has been above the $120–$140 range. And it has given a bullish signal from the inverse head-and-shoulders formation after the last breakout at the $156 resistance. Seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez stated that $SOL has a solid support base at $188–$206, with almost no resistance above that. Source: Ali_chart via X. Soon, Solana’s price will soar to $224, move to $270, and then $300. However, if SOL fails to hold the current $180 support, it could retest the $156 support. The Altcoin Analysts Say It Could Rise 5,500% By December While Solana’s price predictions are strong and bullish, Remittix’s predictions are louder and more assertive. Analysts see a 5,500% rally by December, making RTX the most performing token of 2025. Remittix (RTX ) is a PayFi platform that combines speed, scalability, and DeFi integration to solve a $19 trillion payment gap between traditional payment systems and cryptocurrency. Remitix facilitates instant crypto-to-bank transfers in over 30 countries, and supports 40+ cryptocurrencies.

By 2028, DOGE may potentially achieve a peak price of $1.05. By 2031, DOGE might touch $1.71 with an average trading price of $1.64. Propelled by a dedicated community of part-time developers and enthusiastic internet supporters, Dogecoin is poised for significant growth in the coming years. Despite relying on borrowed code due to limited resources, its popularity continues to soar, with tens of thousands of social media followers advocating for supply limitations. Having touched its ATH at $0.7376, will DOGE reach $1? Let’s get into the Dogecoin price prediction and technical analysis.

The cryptocurrency lost 2.14% of its value. The DOGE coin is expected to find support around $0.210. On August 29, 2025, Dogecoin price analysis reveals a downward trend for the meme coin with clear bearish pressure. The coin’s price decreased to $0.218 today, representing a 2.14 percent loss since it closed at $0.224 yesterday. The coin has been unable to break above $0.224 despite a three-day-long recovery process, and now it has been losing value again throughout the trading session. DOGE has been unable to find support after sellers crushed the support at $0.222. Dogecoin 1-day price chart analysis The one-day price chart of Dogecoin confirmed a bearish trend in the market, as sellers are defining the price action. The cryptocurrency’s value dipped to $0.218 today. Red candlesticks on the price chart signify renewed selling activities. The selling pressure was high three days ago, and sellers are again in the lead. DOGE/USD 1-day Price Chart. Source: TradingView The distance between the Bollinger bands defines the volatility. This distance is high, leading to high volatility levels. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, indicating the resistance level, has shifted to $0.245, whereas its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $0.206. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is trending in the neutral area. The indicator’s curve has travelled toward 48.45 in the past 24 hours. The indicator gives a sell indication as the selling momentum continues to rise. DOGE/USD 4-hour price analysis The four-hour price chart of Dogecoin also confirmed a bearish trend in the market. The DOGE/USD price has been facing decreasing volatility toward the $0.218 level on an hourly basis. The decreasing volatility signals a lesser chance of a trend reversal and less price oscillation in the coming hours. Sellers are currently holding the DOGE price quite below its moving average. DOGE/USD 4-hour price chart. Source: TradingView The Bollinger Bands are converging, leading to decreasing volatility. This low volatility signifies less market unpredictability. Moving ahead, the upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $0.227, indicating the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band has moved to $0.210, showing the support point. The RSI indicator is trending below the centerline of the neutral region. Its value has decreased to 46.15 in the past four hours. This situation hints at dominance by the sellers, and further depreciation also seems possible.

Dogecoin price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. The coin’s value has decreased to $0.218 in the past 24 hours. If sellers maintain their momentum, DOGE’s price might trigger further losses and head toward $0.210. Is DOGE a good investment? Dogecoin has strong potential for growth due to its high adoption and strong community. However, DOGE is highly volatile, and its unlimited supply raises questions about its future price. Social media news and trends also highly affect the meme coin, so diversification and your own research are advised. The coin is expected to touch the $0.481–$0.612 level by 2026. Why is DOGE down? DOGE’s price dipped to $0.218 over the last 24 hours as sellers tried to maintain resistance around $0.224 and succeeded. Moreover, sellers are currently competing for dominance over the price action. What is the expected value of Dogecoin in 2025? Dogecoin is expected to trade at an average price of $0.328029 in 2025. Will DOGE reach $0.50? If the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish, DOGE will join the rally. As a meme coin, it runs mostly on positive speculation. It’s expected that the coin will touch this level by March 2026. Will DOGE reach $1? Considering Dogecoin’s current value, $1 is still a far-reaching target. However, robust community support can push this meme coin to $1 by 2028. Will DOGE hit $10? Despite the risk involved with meme-based crypto pairs like Dogecoin, they can still shoot up on positive momentum. However, the market speculates that DOGE cannot reach the $10 level in the foreseeable future. How much is $500 worth of Dogecoin right now? $500 is worth nearly 2,284 DOGE in August; however, this amount changes based on day-to-day price fluctuations. Does DOGE have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but looking at DOGE, it’s trading above its average price of the last two years. Currently, the coin is trading below the year’s peak price of $0.414, which was observed on January 17, 2025, but the trend is expected to change, and a positive outbreak can be expected. The DOGE/USD pair is expected to reach the $1.71 mark by 2031, so holding it for longer can be beneficial.

Our analysis shows that DOGE could cross $1.71 by 2031. Dogecoin historic price sentiment DOGE price history by Coingecko 2013 was the beginning of Dogecoin, and it surged to $0.0004 in the first days of trading. By March 2014, the coin attempted a breach of $0.001 but failed, closing the year at $0.0001. In the subsequent years, Dogecoin faced immense competition from new coins, including Stellar, Neo, and Monero, which dragged the coin’s price further down. According to the Dogecoin price history, it traded in a strict range of $0.002 to $0.0036 for most of 2019. In January 2021, DOGE saw significant gains, closing the month at $0.037. Subsequently, Dogecoin attained an ATH of $0.7376 on May 8, 2021, but lost 76% of its value, closing the year at $0.1703. In 2022, Dogecoin maintained an average market price of about $0.07. The coin began trading around $0.08 in 2023 and closed the year at $0.08955, as per crypto market records. In 2024, Dogecoin (DOGE) began consolidating around $0.08, surged above $0.2 during March’s bull run, fluctuated between $0.1011 and $0.1759 through mid-year, spiked to $0.4312 in November, and ended the year at $0.314. In January 2025, DOGE clocked the highest price of $0.41; however, after shedding 38% value, it stepped down to $0.258 in February. In March, DOGE’s value decreased further as it dipped to the $0.20 range, and April saw the lowest DOGE price of $0.142. However, in May, the meme coin recovered to the $0.249 mark, following some improvement. On July 20, 2025, Dogecoin peaked at $0.274, and at the start of August, DOGE is trending near $0.214.",Crypto Price Predictions|DOGE,EN,0,0,MINING|DOGE|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|SPONSORED|BLOCKCHAIN|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-29 08:00:39

Notably, veteran trader Peter Brandt has already confirmed the arrival of altseason for 2025 , and with XRP already trading well above its level from this time last year, the possibility of continued strength has energized discussion over how far XRP can realistically extend its gains.

One participant stressed that the next stage of the market may not resemble previous altseasons, arguing that regulatory changes could make “the past irrelevant.” Most of XRP’s notable price surges in the past happened during the prolonged Ripple lawsuit. Now that the lawsuit is over , many market participants believe XRP will perform better than before once its price starts climbing. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Another commenter reminded the community that XRP often corrects after its peak. He believes it could reach $10 but pointed to prior price action where XRP reached its all-time high in July before a swift correction. However, he still has bullish expectations, as he noted that when the asset reaches $100, the correction will bring it back to around $75 or $50, which is much higher than current levels. The Path Toward Institutional Integration While community opinions diverged on the feasibility of XRP reaching $10, there was agreement that external factors would play a defining role. Some placed weight on regulation, others on historical corrections, and some on institutional integration . XRP’s position as a payments-focused asset continues to support arguments for long-term growth, with advocates pointing to partnerships, favorable crypto regulation, expanding adoption and utility, and developments as key factors to sustaining momentum.

Speaking at the BitcoinAsia event held in Hong Kong, CZ claimed that Bitcoin will eventually become the global reserve currency. Stating that he has personally witnessed the development of BTC from its first day to the present, CZ said that Bitcoin will be at the center of the financial system in the very near future. “I have witnessed the evolution of Bitcoin firsthand. It is very encouraging to see not only the traditional financial sector but also governments and states embracing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. We've already come a long way. So the day is not far off when Bitcoin will assume a central role in the global financial system.” Be Careful of Cryptocurrency Companies! While CZ praised Bitcoin in his speech, he also warned investors about the risks posed by the rise of institutional crypto treasuries. CZ said that the increasing interest of companies in Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) strategies is positive for the market, but also calls for caution. CZ stated that DAT strategies provide traditional stock market investors with indirect exposure to cryptocurrencies and help promote wider adoption of crypto and Bitcoin. However, he warned that if the market were to decline, the stock prices of these companies, along with crypto assets, could fall simultaneously. Therefore, investors in such companies should monitor market volatility and structural risks, and exercise greater caution when investing, Zhao said. CZ also recently added that he keeps most of his wealth in BNB. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Binance Founder CZ Talks About Bitcoin!

According to real-time market monitoring from Bitcoin World, BTC is currently trading at $109,959.91 on the Binance USDT market. This sudden dip has certainly caught the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike, prompting crucial questions about its causes and potential implications for the broader digital asset landscape. What Triggered This Urgent Bitcoin Price Drop? The immediate observation of the Bitcoin price drop below $110,000 is a clear signal of increased selling pressure in the market. While specific catalysts for such movements can often be complex and multifaceted, several factors typically contribute to these significant shifts. Understanding these underlying dynamics is crucial for anyone attempting to navigate the volatile cryptocurrency markets. One primary influence can be broader macroeconomic trends. For instance, concerns over rising global inflation, aggressive interest rate hikes by central banks, or geopolitical instability often ripple into the crypto space. These macro factors can lead investors to de-risk, pulling capital from more speculative assets like Bitcoin and moving it into safer havens. Moreover, large institutional trades or significant liquidations on derivatives markets can also trigger cascading sell-offs, amplifying the downward momentum. How Are Investors Reacting to the BTC Price Fall? When we observe a notable BTC price fall , it naturally elicits a diverse range of reactions from investors. Some individuals might adopt a cautious stance, choosing to observe the market from the sidelines until greater stability emerges. This approach often stems from a desire to avoid further losses during periods of heightened uncertainty. However, other investors, particularly those with a strong long-term conviction in Bitcoin’s future, may view this dip as a strategic accumulation opportunity. They might employ strategies like dollar-cost averaging, where they invest a fixed amount regularly, regardless of the price, to average out their entry point over time. This current trading price of $109,959.91 on the Binance USDT market offers a specific data point for those considering such moves. Key considerations for investors during a significant Bitcoin price drop: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets are inherently known for their rapid and sometimes dramatic price swings. This current dip serves as a powerful reminder of that inherent volatility. Risk Management: Implementing a robust risk management strategy is absolutely essential. This includes setting clear stop-loss orders to limit potential losses or diversifying one’s portfolio across different asset classes. Long-Term Vision: Many seasoned investors focus on Bitcoin’s foundational technology and its long-term potential as a store of value or digital gold, viewing short-term fluctuations as a natural part of its growth trajectory. Is This Bitcoin Price Drop a Buying Opportunity? The question resonating with many market participants is whether this particular Bitcoin price drop truly represents a chance to “buy the dip.” Historically, Bitcoin has demonstrated resilience, with significant price corrections often preceding periods of robust recovery and even new all-time highs. However, it is vital to remember that past performance does not guarantee future results, and every market cycle possesses unique characteristics. Before making any investment decisions, thorough due diligence is always recommended. Investors should carefully evaluate their personal financial situation, risk tolerance, and long-term investment goals. Consider researching prevailing market sentiment, analyzing on-chain data for insights into network activity, and consulting expert analyses from reputable sources. The current trading level below $110,000 certainly presents a lower entry point compared to recent highs, but the broader market context and potential future developments are crucial to consider. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Current Dip: Stay Informed: Actively keep abreast of global economic news, regulatory developments, and crypto-specific updates. Knowledge is your most powerful tool. Diversify Your Portfolio: Avoid concentrating all your capital in a single asset. Diversification can help mitigate risk during volatile periods. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging: As mentioned, investing a fixed sum periodically can help average out your purchase price and reduce the impact of short-term volatility. Consult Financial Professionals: If you are uncertain about your investment strategy, seeking advice from qualified financial advisors can provide valuable guidance tailored to your circumstances. The Crucial Takeaways from This Bitcoin Price Drop The recent Bitcoin price drop below $110,000 serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. While such significant price movements can certainly be unsettling for some, they also present moments for critical reflection, strategic re-evaluation, and informed planning. Whether you are a seasoned trader closely monitoring every tick or a newcomer just beginning your crypto journey, understanding the nuances of these price shifts is absolutely crucial for making sound decisions. The digital asset market continues to evolve at a rapid pace, and staying educated, agile, and prepared remains your best strategy for long-term success. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What does the Bitcoin price drop below $110,000 mean? This signifies a notable decrease in Bitcoin’s market value, reflecting increased selling pressure and potentially shifting market sentiment. It means BTC is trading at a lower price point than before, specifically around $109,959.91 on Binance USDT. 2. What typically causes a significant Bitcoin price drop? Several factors can contribute, including macroeconomic concerns (like inflation or interest rate hikes), large institutional sell-offs, technical market indicators being breached, or shifts in investor confidence. 3. Should I sell my Bitcoin when there’s a price drop? The decision to sell depends on your individual investment strategy, risk tolerance, and financial goals. Some long-term investors hold through dips, while others might rebalance their portfolios. It’s crucial to avoid emotional decisions and consult a financial advisor if unsure. 4. Is this current Bitcoin price drop a good time to buy? Historically, some investors view significant dips as “buy the dip” opportunities, hoping for future recovery. However, there’s no guarantee of recovery, and past performance is not indicative of future results. Thorough research and understanding your own financial situation are essential before buying. 5. Where can I get reliable information about Bitcoin’s price? Reputable market monitoring platforms like Bitcoin World, major exchanges like Binance, and financial news outlets specializing in cryptocurrency provide real-time data and analysis.

The surge comes as Ethereum ETFs experience massive momentum, with $4 billion in net inflows in August. Binance Still Leads, But ETFs Challenge Exchange Dominance Bitcoin ETFs now account for 13.1% of total spot trading volume since the US presidential election, making them the third-largest trading venue behind Binance’s dominant 29.1% and Crypto.com’s 13.5% shares. Source: CryptoQuant CryptoQuant data reveals that these funds regularly exceed those of most centralized exchanges in daily volume, with peak activity reaching $10 billion during high-volatility periods. Source: CryptoQuant Binance maintains its leadership position with Bitcoin volumes reaching $10-18 billion on active trading days. During Bitcoin’s recent all-time high on August 13, Binance recorded $7 billion in spot volume compared to ETFs’ $4.8 billion. Other major exchanges include Bybit, with a 9% market share, Coinbase at 6%, and Bullish, which commands 5%. However, Ethereum paints a starkly different image. ETFs capture merely 4.4% of ETH spot trading volume. Binance dominates Ethereum trading with a 35% market share since November, followed by Crypto.com at 20% and Bybit at 6%. ETF Flows Signal Major Institutional Rotation Into Ethereum Ethereum ETFs extended their winning streak to seven consecutive days by August 28, accumulating $309 million in fresh inflows. BlackRock’s ETHA dominated with $262.6 million, while Fidelity’s FETH added $20.5 million. Notably, Grayscale’s flagship ETHE recorded rare positive flows of $5.7 million after months of heavy redemptions. The momentum shift is becoming even clearer. Matt Hougan’s analysis of August flows reveals that Bitcoin ETFs recorded net outflows of approximately $800 million, while Ethereum ETFs attracted $4 billion in net inflows. ETF Flows in August BTC: -$800 million ETH: +4.0 billion There is a relentless bid for ETH atm. (h/t @FarsideUK ) — Matt Hougan (@Matt_Hougan) August 28, 2025 This $4.8 billion monthly differential favoring ETH particularly points to a decisive institutional preference rotation. Bitcoin ETFs maintained steady but modest progress with $81 million in daily inflows on August 27. BlackRock’s IBIT led with $50.9 million, supported by Fidelity’s FBTC at $14.6 million. Total Bitcoin ETF assets reached $144.6 billion, representing 6.5% of Bitcoin’s market capitalization. Meanwhile, Ethereum ETFs hold $30.17 billion, equivalent to 5.4% of Ether’s market capitalization. Corporate treasury activity accelerated the institutional shift. BitMine Immersion Technologies acquired $2.2 billion worth of ETH in a single week , becoming the world’s largest corporate Ethereum holder with 1.7 million ETH valued at $8.82 billion. Market analysts note that declining Bitcoin dominance, below 58%, is attributed to over 45 altcoins outperforming BTC in the past 90 days. The Altseason Index surged to 61 after months below 55, with full-scale altseason typically beginning at 75. Just yesterday, Michaël van de Poppe also predicted altseason will commence within 4-6 weeks , potentially driving ETH to $5,200 and SOL to $250 in Q4. Corporate Bitcoin Treasury Strategies Face Credit Cycle Risks Corporate Bitcoin holdings have exploded to $408 billion across 310 entities, but new research warns this “ dangerous game ” will likely see most participants fail during a full credit cycle. Sentora’s analysis identifies critical flaws in strategies that involve “borrowing billions in fiat, issuing new equity, and restructuring entire balance sheets to acquire Bitcoin.” The research categorizes Bitcoin treasury strategies as “negative-carry trades” where companies borrow fiat to acquire non-yielding assets. Unlike traditional carry trades with positive yield cushions, Bitcoin strategies offer “no yield cushion, no neutral carry, and no risk-parity ballast.” MicroStrategy pioneered the model, utilizing $3.7 billion in ultra-low-coupon convertible bonds and $5.5 billion in perpetual preferred shares. The research warns of structural risks when “interest payments become unserviceable, refinancing costs spike, equity issuance turns non-accretive, and boards question the Bitcoin strategy itself.” Rising interest rates amplify negative carry effects, while Bitcoin price stagnation over 2-3 years could erode conviction and make equity issuance dilutive. The study notes “there is no lender of last resort, no circuit breaker, and no refinancing facility” when Bitcoin carry trades break, making risks “binary and reflexive.” The research concludes that for long-term success, “Bitcoin must evolve from digital property to digital capital” that generates yield without custodianship requirements.

50857324,568651,1756458731,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50857324.jpeg,Bitcoin Over $1 Million: Bitwise Prediction Sets Bitcoin Hyper on Fire,https://bitcoinist.com/bitwise-predicts-bitcoin-over-1m-sets-bitcoin-hyper-on-fire/,"Another day, another bold new Bitcoin price prediction: $1.3M by 2035. The world’s largest crypto has evolved from a niche digital asset to a major institutional holding. Crypto asset manager Bitwise sees that evolution continuing at a 28.3% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next decade – far outperforming equities (6.2%), bonds (4.0%), and gold (3.8%). The recently-released Bitcoin Long Term Capital Market Assumptions report from Bitwise explains the reasoning behind the $1.3M price prediction in greater detail, highlighting just how much room for growth remains for Bitcoin. Bear in mind, Bitwise’s bullish $BTC prediction doesn’t take into account the impact that innovative projects could have on the Bitcoin blockchain – further driving up its price. And one project in particular, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , could well be that game-changer. The Big Picture: Even the Downsides Bode Well for Bitcoin Bitwise notes that while the broader economic picture is positive, there are some looming downsides. First, the US’ national debt is climbing rapidly. When that happens, countries prefer to lower interest rates and devalue their own currency, minimizing the impact of the debt held in that currency. And as the Bitwise report puts it, it ‘pays to bet on that happening’ in terms of the US’ national debt. Lower interest rates encourage spending and, by themselves, would be a good sign for Bitcoin’s outlook. Investors are already looking forward to the September Federal Reserve board meeting, in which Jerome Powell, Fed Chair, is widely expected to cut interest rates . More broadly, US dollar dominance is weakening slightly globally. That isn’t a doomsday scenario for the US economy, but it does indicate a potential opportunity. As the dollar weakens and loses global dominance, it creates an opening for alternative reserve currencies. That’s where Bitcoin could come in. In fact, it already has – with Michael Saylor popularizing the Bitcoin Treasury strategy. The Best Is Yet to Come for Bitcoin Bitwise’s actual price prediction is incredibly bullish and rests on a number of simple facts: Bitcoin demand is no longer the domain of retail traders. Institutions now account for over 75% of Bitcoin trading volume on Coinbase. Corporate treasuries are accelerating their accumulation – 44 public companies now hold at least 1K $BTC each . Bitcoin’s supply restrictions strengthen its case as a digital store of value. About 19.91M $BTC of its total 21M supply ( 94.8%) is already in circulation. Amid skyrocketing US federal debt ($36T) and nearly $1T in annual interest costs, investors are increasingly drawn to hard, limited-supply assets. That explains why Bitcoin’s performance since 2020 has been little short of mind-blowing: Bitwise believes that performance will continue. With a 28.3% CAGR, Bitcoin would reach $1.3M by 2035; that’s Bitwise’s base projection. In a truly bullish scenario, that CAGR ticks up to 39.4%, and Bitcoin could reach $2.9M. Importantly, Bitwise isn’t just pulling numbers out of a hat with these predictions. The numbers are based on underlying assumptions. Some of them may be incorrect, but there’s a clear logic behind them. Bitcoin could under-perform, of course. In Bitwise’s bearish scenario, the CAGR falls to almost nothing and Bitcoin declines to $88K. But then again, Bitcoin could benefit from factors Bitwise hasn’t considered – like the advent of a fast, powerful Bitcoin Layer-2. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – The Layer-2 Solution Designed for a Faster, More Integrated Bitcoin Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) offers a meme coin vibe with genuine utility and innovation behind it. What is Bitcoin Hyper? It’s a Layer-2 that addresses a clear problem – Bitcoin’s throughput limitations, high fees, and lack of scalability – and applies a unique solution. A solution that could potentially boost Bitcoin’s growth even further as the Hyper Layer-2 adds utility to Bitcoin. The project relies on a hybrid architecture that uses a Canonical Bridge to send Bitcoin from the base layer to Bitcoin Hyper (as wrapped $BTC). Hyper’s Layer-2 also integrates the Solana Virtual Machine , giving it Solana’s lightning-fast transaction speeds and high throughput. Whereas Bitcoin averages around seven transactions per second (TPS), Solana has a max theoretical TPS of 65K . At the same time, final settlement remains on the Bitcoin blockchain, leveraging Bitcoin’s reliability and security. There’s plenty of investor appetite for the $HYPER token, the meme coin behind the Bitcoin Hyper Layer-2. Learn how to buy $HYPER and jump into the ongoing presale, where $12.6M+ has already poured into the project. $HYPER currently costs $0.012825 – with staking rewards at 88% APY. However, our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction shows that it might have the potential to reach $0.32 by the end of 2025. That would give $HYPER a return of 2,395% – even better than Bitcoin’s 1,400% since 2020. Visit the Bitcoin Hyper presale for the latest info. Balancing Optimism with Realism Bitwise warns that volatility is unlikely to vanish. Models are inherently uncertain, and investors should expect possible drawdowns despite positive trends. Still, models can be wrong in terms of downward trends as well as upwards. Could Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) send Bitcoin higher than anyone – even Bitwise – could possibly expect?

Bitcoin continued to see demand by institutional investors including corporate treasuries, reaching a historic price milestone of ~$112k in mid-May. Ethereum's highly anticipated network upgrade Pectra brought improved scalability and security while launching new features. On a relative basis, all sectors contributed to the portfolio's positive performance. The U.S. Senate passed the GENIUS Act for stablecoin regulation. Key Takeaways Markets: US stocks were volatile due to concerns over the impact of Trump's tariffs on economic growth, inflation, and Fed policy, with fears of recession or stagflation. Despite traditional market volatility, positive momentum around regulation led cryptocurrency markets to rebound during the second quarter of 2025 (Q2 25). Contributors: Most holdings were positive contributors to the portfolio, including tokens in the Currency, Smart Contract Platforms, Infrastructure, and Decentralized Finance sectors. Detractors: Two tokens from the Smart Contract Platforms sector, Polkadot (DOT-USD) (DOT) and Optimism (OP-USD) (OP), and one Infrastructure token, Filecoin (FIL), had slight negative contributions to the portfolio. Outlook: We believe that new blockchain technologies have the potential for capital appreciation that can be captured through strategic selection of their underlying tokens. We believe emerging blockchain technologies offer capital appreciation opportunities through selective exposure to their underlying tokens. Recent moves by the Trump Administration and several U.S. state governments to establish cryptocurrency reserves, establish rules for stablecoins and provide regulatory clarity on the market structure for digital assets aim to position the U.S. as a leading crypto hub.

The price of Worldcoin is expected to reach a maximum level of $7.35 in 2031. Worldcoin is capturing the attention of investors and enthusiasts in equal measure, which aligns with the world’s prediction. In the first week of May, Worldcoin’s token, WLD, saw a dramatic rise in its value, positioning it as one of the top-performing altcoins in the market. This surge coincides with heightened activity around artificial intelligence (AI) advancements, particularly those involving OpenAI, hinting at a significant correlation between WLD’s market movements and developments in AI technology. The buzz is partly attributed to speculative reports about potential collaborations and new ventures that could integrate more AI tools into cryptocurrency.

A break below this level could lead to further declines. Both the 1-day and 4-hour charts show continued bearish momentum, with price struggling to break resistance at $0.9629. Decreasing volume indicates a lack of buying interest, suggesting limited chances for a bullish reversal without a shift in market conditions. As of August 29, 2025, Worldcoin (WLD) is trading at $0.9243, reflecting a 2.6% drop in the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency is currently experiencing a downtrend after testing immediate resistance levels and facing pressure from market fluctuations. The price has been fluctuating within a tight range, seeing a daily high of $0.9629 and a low of $0.9204. Market participants are watching these levels closely for signs of further movement. Worldcoin 1-day price chart: WLD bearish momentum persists Looking at the 1-day chart, Worldcoin’s price action is clearly exhibiting bearish momentum. The coin faced an initial push towards the $0.9629 resistance but was unable to sustain this level. As shown in the chart, the price steadily retreated from this high, reflecting increased selling pressure, which resulted in a drop below $0.92. The downtrend could signal a retest of $0.9 level, with a possible significant dip below this level depending on broader market sentiment. The decline from resistance is reinforcing a bearish outlook for the time being, suggesting that sellers may have gained the upper hand. WLD/USDT Chart: TradingView The price has formed lower highs, confirming the downtrend in the short term. Additionally, trading volume is decreasing, which often signifies a lack of buying interest, further reinforcing the selling pressure. The MACD indicator, though not highly divergent, is showing signs of weak bearish momentum, suggesting that the selling force is gaining strength. Unless a major shift occurs, Worldcoin’s price may continue to find difficulty in breaking above the resistance at $0.9629. Worldcoin 4-hour price chart: WLD testing key support zone at $0.92 On the 4-hour chart, Worldcoin’s price is currently testing the immediate support zone at $0.92. This support level is critical for the near-term price action. Should the price fail to hold above this level, it could trigger a further decline towards lower support levels. The 4-hour chart shows a steady downtrend, with the price moving in lower highs, confirming that bearish sentiment dominates in the shorter timeframe. WLD/USDT Chart: TradingView The 4-hour MACD shows more pronounced bearish divergence, reinforcing the overall downtrend in the market. Additionally, the volume patterns on the 4-hour chart confirm a lack of significant buying pressure, which may prevent any immediate bullish reversal. If the support at $0.92 breaks, the next possible support zone could see further downside pressure, and traders may look to reassess the outlook based on new levels. Worldcoin technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.880901 BUY SMA 5 $0.94724 SELL SMA 10 $1.035388 SELL SMA 21 $1.112588 SELL SMA 50 $1.013944 SELL SMA 100 $1.10097 SELL SMA 20 $1.27281 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $1.057438 SELL EMA 5 $1.048003 SELL EMA 10 $1.016681 SELL EMA 21 $0.960841 SELL EMA 50 $0.998505 SELL EMA 100 $1.242968 SELL EMA 200 $1.670996 SELL ​​What can you expect from the Worldcoin price next? Based on the current price action and technical analysis, Worldcoin (WLD) is likely to continue facing downward pressure in the short term. With the price falling below the critical support at $0.9204, it clould lead to further declines towards lower support zones. The bearish momentum across both the 1-day and 4-hour charts suggests that unless there’s a significant shift in market conditions, WLD may struggle to break past resistance at $0.9629 in the near future. Given the decreasing volume and lack of significant buying interest, the chances for a bullish reversal are limited without a catalyst to drive new buying momentum. Traders will be closely monitoring the support at $0.91 for signs of a potential rebound or further decline, with the outcome largely dependent on broader market sentiment and external factors influencing crypto markets. Is Worldcoin a good investment? Currently, Worldcoin (WLD) shows bearish momentum, with price struggling to break resistance at $0.9629 and testing key support at $0.9204. A breakdown below this level could lead to further declines, and the lack of buying interest suggests limited chances for a bullish reversal in the short term. Given the current market conditions and decreasing volume, Worldcoin may not be an ideal investment at the moment. Investors should wait for more evident signs of a trend reversal or market stability before considering any positions. Why is the WLD Price Down today The decline in Worldcoin (WLD) price today can be attributed to several key factors. First, the cryptocurrency has been struggling to break through resistance at $0.9629, which has led to increased selling pressure. As a result, the price dropped below, reflecting a 4% drop in the past 24 hours. Secondly, the broader market sentiment appears weak, with a lack of buying interest. This is evident from decreasing trading volume, signaling that traders are hesitant to enter new positions. Without a significant catalyst or change in market conditions, Worldcoin’s price faces ongoing bearish momentum, reinforcing the downtrend. Lastly, the price is currently testing key support at $0.91-$0.92, and a potential break below this level could exacerbate further declines. Will Worldcoin reach $5? Yes, according to the long-term predictions, Worldcoin is projected to reach up to $5 by 2030. Will Worldcoin reach $100? Worldcoin’s prediction shows that $100 is highly unlikely due to current market conditions, its present price levels, and the significant rise in market capitalization required. Such an increase would necessitate extraordinary growth and adoption. Does Worldcoin have a promising long-term future? WLD coin is showing some recovery trend; hence, many may consider investing in the token as it may have a promising long-term future. Continued development, adoption, and favorable market trends will be crucial for its success.

Projects like Arbitrum and FLOKI remain popular choices for their fundamentals and community support, while Ethereum-based presales are now commanding the spotlight. Among them, the audited and legitimate MAGACOIN FINANCE project is drawing outsized demand, with analysts pointing to accelerating inflows and limited supply. Arbitrum (ARB) — Layer-2 Growth Driving Momentum Arbitrum continues to strengthen its reputation as a leading Ethereum Layer-2 network. The token currently trades around $0.39, maintaining one of the most active user bases in the scaling space. On-chain activity and adoption metrics have been trending higher, with analysts forecasting a potential breakout toward the $1 mark if bullish conditions hold into Q4 2025. Arbitrum’s appeal lies in its ecosystem depth, where robust DeFi protocols and developer traction have made it a consistent performer. Compared with other Layer-2s, it has built a strong case for risk-adjusted returns under the $1 level. Analysts continue to highlight Arbitrum as one of the most reliable sub-dollar assets for investors seeking exposure to Ethereum scalability. FLOKI — Meme Appeal Meets Utility Expansion FLOKI remains a community-driven project that has successfully expanded beyond its meme coin origins. Price projections for the next year place it between $0.000175 and $0.000257, pointing to steady if moderate appreciation through 2026. Its growth is being powered by new token utilities, rapid network expansion, and crossover appeal between the meme and DeFi sectors. FLOKI’s community engagement remains a defining strength, with its ecosystem now supported by ongoing technical upgrades. While long-term targets are speculative, FLOKI has established itself as one of the most recognizable altcoins under $1, with analysts pointing to its community as a key driver of resilience. Ethereum-Based Presales — MAGACOIN FINANCE in the Spotlight Presales have become a central theme of the sub-$1 market, and Ethereum-powered launches are gaining the strongest traction. The standout so far is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which analysts say is leading the current wave of interest. With its presale already more than halfway sold out, investors are treating it as one of the tightest supply opportunities of 2025. That scarcity, combined with accelerating demand, has elevated MAGACOIN FINANCE into the conversation as one of the year’s most promising altcoins. The project’s positioning as a meme and utility hybrid has helped it gather momentum, drawing in both retail participants and whale inflows. Early access incentives have amplified this trend, with many investors eager to secure allocations before supply constraints tighten further. Industry observers note that while Arbitrum and FLOKI offer steady growth potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being viewed as the high-upside presale with 70x ROI potential if current demand persists. Other Ethereum-based presales, such as SUI and Maxi Doge Token, are also gaining traction, but MAGACOIN FINANCE has clearly taken the lead in terms of visibility and buzz. For many traders, it represents a rare window to capture an early position in a token that is rapidly moving toward mainstream attention. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is a Trusted Crypto to Buy for 2025 Growth Investors searching for a trusted early-stage project have found a strong contender in MAGACOIN FINANCE, widely ranked among the best cryptos to buy in 2025. Its smart contract passed auditing standards, and the public team has completed full KYC verification. Combined with growing community traction, these strengths make it a top-tier choice for those prioritizing safety and growth. Other Sub-$1 Contenders Beyond Arbitrum, FLOKI, and Ethereum presales, several other altcoins remain on analysts’ radar. Cardano (ADA) continues to be recommended as a smart contract platform with strong institutional interest and ongoing scalability upgrades. VeChain (VET) is drawing attention for its real-world supply chain partnerships, while SEI has built momentum in DeFi and gaming applications. Speculative picks such as DOGE, Ethena (ENA), Mantle (MNT), and Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) also remain part of the broader conversation, particularly for investors seeking exposure to higher-risk, high-reward bets in the under-$1 segment. Conclusion — Scarcity and Momentum Shape 2025’s Sub-$1 Market Arbitrum and FLOKI provide proven growth stories supported by adoption and strong communities, while Ethereum-based presales are capturing the imagination of investors looking for exponential upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the clear leader in this group, with its presale scarcity and accelerating demand making it one of the most closely watched opportunities under $1 in 2025. For investors balancing stability with early-stage exposure, combining established projects like Arbitrum and FLOKI with high-buzz presales like MAGACOIN would offer the most effective way to capture value in the coming cycle.

The $500,000 donation, announced by the group on Thursday, brings the total funds raised for Storm’s legal defence to over $5.5 million. According to data from the official Roman Storm defence fund page, Storm’s defence campaign remains roughly $1.5 million short of its $7 million goal. Fund organizers have described Storm’s appeal as time-sensitive, and have warned that without adequate resources, Storm could face up to five years in prison based on his single conviction, or significantly more if prosecutors pursue two additional charges. Roman Storm convicted Storm’s legal troubles escalated on Aug. 6, when a jury in New York found him guilty of operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business through Tornado Cash, the Ethereum-based privacy protocol he helped build. However, the jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict on two charges, including conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to violate US sanctions. Those deadlocked counts remain open, and prosecutors could still bring them back to court. The trial was focused on whether Storm knowingly enabled illegal activity by allowing Tornado Cash to be used by sanctioned entities such as North Korea’s Lazarus Group, which is known to have laundered millions worth of illicit funds via the cryptocurrency mixer. Prosecutors have constantly argued that Tornado Cash developers knew their platform could be misused, therefore, they urged the Jury to hold Storm responsible. On the other hand, lawyers representing Storm, in his defence, claim that Tornado Cash operated as autonomous, immutable code that was beyond the reach or control of its developers. A number of jurors reportedly struggled with the idea of convicting someone for code they no longer had the power to alter, ultimately leading to the split verdict. The same idea has resonated among Storm’s supporters, who continue to argue that prosecuting developers for writing open-source software poses serious risks to the future of innovation. Many have warned that such prosecutions could deter developers from building privacy tools or contributing to decentralized protocols altogether, for fear that they might one day be held criminally liable for how their code is used. “The allegations underlying these convictions are based on a fundamental misunderstanding of how blockchain technology works,” the Solana Policy wrote in its announcement. “If the government can prosecute developers for creating neutral tools that others misuse, it fundamentally changes developers’ risk calculus,” the group added, warning that it could lead to an exodus of talent towards jurisdictions more welcoming to open-source innovation. Crypto community comes together to support Storm Storm’s fundraising appeal has united much of the crypto developer ecosystem. Notable donations have come from both major blockchain foundations and individual contributors who see the case as a turning point for open-source development and privacy rights. For instance, in July, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin donated a total of 150 ETH across two separate transactions, amounting to more than $670,000 at current prices. Around the same time, Julian Zawistowski, founder of the Golem Project, confirmed a contribution of 50 ETH, valued at over $224,000. Ethereum core developer Federico Carrone, who had to face his own share of legal troubles earlier this year in Turkey over privacy tech affiliations, also contributed $500,000 on Aug. 11 in a show of solidarity.

Recently, a significant development emerged from South Korea’s crypto landscape. South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Coinone officially announced an extension of its Coinone investment warning designation for Kaichain (KAI) by an additional two weeks. This news directly impacts KAI holders and signals the exchange’s continued vigilance in market oversight. What Does This Coinone Investment Warning Extension Mean for KAI? Coinone’s decision to prolong the Coinone investment warning for Kaichain (KAI) is a clear signal to its users. Initially, such warnings are issued when an asset might pose risks to investors, often due to factors like: Low Liquidity: Making it difficult to buy or sell without significant price impact. Price Volatility: Unpredictable and extreme price swings. Project Issues: Concerns about the underlying project’s viability, development, or transparency. Market Manipulation Risks: Potential for unfair trading practices. The extension suggests that the initial concerns have not been fully resolved to Coinone’s satisfaction. Investors should take this as a prompt to re-evaluate their positions and understand the potential implications. Why Do Exchanges Issue Investment Warnings Like Coinone’s? Cryptocurrency exchanges, like Coinone, bear a significant responsibility to protect their users. Issuing an investment warning is a proactive measure designed to safeguard investors from potential financial harm. These warnings are not arbitrary; they are typically the result of thorough internal reviews and assessments of an asset’s market conditions and the underlying project’s health. By flagging assets, exchanges aim to: Enhance Transparency: Inform users about potential risks associated with certain tokens. Promote Investor Protection: Help prevent losses due to unforeseen market events or project failures. Maintain Market Integrity: Ensure a fair and orderly trading environment for all participants. This commitment to user safety is a cornerstone of reputable exchanges, and Coinone’s action with KAI underscores this principle. Navigating the Landscape: What Should KAI Holders Do Amidst the Warning? For individuals holding KAI, the extended Coinone investment warning necessitates careful consideration. It’s not necessarily a call to panic, but rather an urgent reminder for due diligence. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Regularly check Coinone’s official announcements and Kaichain’s project updates. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Determine if the current risk profile of KAI aligns with your personal investment strategy. Diversify: Avoid putting all your capital into a single, potentially high-risk asset. Consult an Expert: If unsure, seek advice from a qualified financial advisor who understands the crypto market. Understanding understanding exchange policies and the rationale behind such warnings empowers you to make informed decisions. Ultimately, Coinone’s decision highlights the ongoing need for caution in the rapidly evolving crypto space. While opportunities abound, so do risks. An extended Coinone investment warning serves as a critical reminder that market participants must remain vigilant and prioritize research before making any investment moves. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a Coinone investment warning? A1: A Coinone investment warning is an official notice issued by the Coinone exchange to alert users about potential risks associated with a specific cryptocurrency, such as low liquidity, high volatility, or project concerns. Q2: Why was the Coinone investment warning for KAI extended? A2: The extension indicates that the issues or concerns that initially led to the warning for Kaichain (KAI) have not yet been fully resolved to Coinone’s satisfaction, requiring continued monitoring. Q3: Does an investment warning mean KAI will be delisted? A3: Not necessarily. An investment warning is a cautionary measure. While it can precede a delisting, it primarily serves to inform investors of heightened risks, giving them time to react. Q4: What actions should I take if I hold KAI on Coinone? A4: It’s recommended to review your investment, stay updated on official announcements from Coinone and Kaichain, and consider your personal risk tolerance. You might choose to hold, sell, or consult a financial advisor. Q5: How long can a Coinone investment warning last? A5: The duration can vary. In KAI’s case, it was extended by two weeks, but exchanges assess each situation individually based on the resolution of the identified risks. Q6: Where can I find official updates regarding the Coinone investment warning? A6: Always refer to Coinone’s official website or their official communication channels for the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding any investment warnings or asset status changes.

Bitcoin and Ethereum Expect a $15 Billion Options Earthquake! What to Expect for BTC and ETH?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/augusts-critical-data-released-bitcoin-and-ethereum-expect-a-15-billion-options-earthquake-what-to-expect-for-btc-and-eth/,"In August, Bitcoin (BTC) and then Ethereum (ETH) experienced significant gains, reaching new ATHs. However, as macroeconomic data and increasing uncertainty slowed, upward momentum slowed, and BTC and ETH entered a consolidation phase following their rallies. While the bullish mood in the market is expected to continue again in September, the expiration date for option contracts in the crypto market has come today, as it does every Friday. These options are more important because they fall on the last Friday of both the week and the month. According to data for the fourth week of August, $11.7 billion worth of Bitcoin and $3.2 billion worth of Ethereum options will expire on August 29 on the Deribit derivatives exchange. Accordingly, the Put/Call Ratio of BTC options is 0.79, the maximum loss point is $116,000 and the notional value is $11.7 billion. When we look at Ethereum, ETH options have a Put/Call Ratio of 0.76, a maximum loss point of $3,800, and a notional value of $3.2 billion. Looking at the put/call ratio, we see that it's 0.79 for Bitcoin and 0.76 for ETH. These ratios indicate a cautious but optimistic outlook in the market, with more buy orders than sell orders and a bullish outlook among options traders. The maximum pain point is the level at which the cryptocurrency price settles at a certain value as an option approaches its expiration date, resulting in significant losses for the largest number of option traders. At this point, with $11.7 billion and $3.2 billion worth of BTC and ETH options expiring on August 29th, volatility is expected and both Bitcoin and Ethereum prices are likely to retreat towards their respective maximum pain levels. As of writing, Bitcoin and Ethereum are trading at $111,000 and $4,450 respectively, with options data pointing to an imminent correction for ETH and a possible upside for BTC. *This is not investment advice.

Using the Gann Fan, a widely respected tool among technical traders, the analysis highlights how XRP has methodically conquered previous resistance levels like $2 and $2.5, turning them into support. The Gann Fan is a geometric-based trading tool that helps identify key price levels and trend lines based on time and price relationships. By tracking the angles of movement, traders can pinpoint areas of support and resistance that often dictate market behavior. In XRP’s case, The Great Mattsby notes that multiple prior resistance levels, which once held back price gains, have already been breached and successfully flipped into support. This sets the stage for the next critical challenge: the $3.01 “final boss” resistance. Turning $3.01 into support is key, as it marks both a psychological and technical barrier. Once flipped, this level could spark renewed buying and fuel XRP’s push toward higher targets. Market participants are watching closely, as XRP’s price has been consolidating just below $3, forming a tight range that suggests accumulation and preparation for a decisive move with major support sitting at $2.80. Meanwhile, market commentator Olivia Jane recently opined that the real surge begins once XRP flips $3.10 with strong volume, triggering momentum traders to jump in. At the time of this writing, XRP was trading at $2.86 per CoinGlass data. Historic Milestone: Digital Assets Set to Go Live on SWIFT via ISO 20022 in November 2025 In a groundbreaking development for the global financial landscape, renowned crypto researcher SMQKE has announced that, for the first time, new digital asset use cases will go live on SWIFT via ISO 20022 in November 2025. This milestone marks a significant step toward integrating blockchain-based assets into traditional banking systems. ISO 20022, the emerging global standard for financial messaging, is set to replace the legacy SWIFT MT protocol by November 22, 2025. This transition aims to enhance data quality, improve interoperability, and streamline international transactions. The adoption of ISO 20022 is not merely a technical upgrade because it represents a fundamental shift in how financial institutions communicate and process payments. SMQKE's announcement highlights that SWIFT's live digital asset trials have confirmed the integration of blockchain technologies using the ISO 20022 data dictionary. This development signifies a pivotal move towards the convergence of traditional financial messaging standards and decentralized systems. The implications of this integration are profound. Digital assets like XRP and Hedera (HBAR) are poised to benefit from SWIFT's transition to ISO 20022, as they align with the standard's requirements for structured data and efficient transaction processing. This alignment facilitates smoother interoperability between digital and traditional financial systems, potentially accelerating the adoption of cryptocurrencies in mainstream finance. As the November 2025 deadline approaches, financial institutions, regulators, and digital asset developers are closely monitoring these developments. The successful implementation of ISO 20022 could pave the way for broader acceptance of digital assets, offering enhanced transparency, security, and efficiency in cross-border payments. Conclusion SMQKE's revelation underscores a transformative moment in the financial sector. The integration of digital assets into SWIFT's ISO 20022 framework represents a significant leap towards a more inclusive and technologically advanced global financial system. Additionally, The Great Mattsby’s Gann Fan analysis paints a bullish picture for XRP. Previous resistance levels have flipped to support, clearing the path toward a critical $3.01 milestone.

During the first half of the year, this prominent firm acquired approximately $7.85 million worth of various cryptocurrencies. This strategic decision highlights a growing trend of traditional companies venturing into the digital asset space, signaling increasing institutional confidence in the crypto market. Why This Bold Hong Kong Crypto Investment? LineKong’s significant foray into digital assets isn’t just a random purchase; it represents a calculated strategy. The company’s acquisition of 63 BTC, 330.5 ETH, and 6,691.7 SOL demonstrates a diversified approach to digital asset management. This bold Hong Kong crypto investment suggests a belief in the long-term value and potential of cryptocurrencies as part of a modern investment portfolio. Diversification: Companies often seek to diversify their treasury holdings beyond traditional fiat currencies. Inflation Hedge: Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are increasingly viewed as a hedge against inflation. Future Growth: Investing in leading digital assets positions the company to benefit from the burgeoning Web3 and blockchain economy. This strategic move by a publicly traded entity from Hong Kong sends a strong signal about the evolving perception of digital assets in mainstream finance. Understanding LineKong’s Digital Asset Choices LineKong’s specific selection of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) is quite telling. Each of these cryptocurrencies plays a distinct role in the digital asset ecosystem and offers different investment theses. Bitcoin (BTC): As the original and largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Bitcoin is often seen as ‘digital gold’ – a store of value. Its finite supply and robust network security make it an attractive long-term holding. Ethereum (ETH): Ethereum powers a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Its utility and ongoing development, including the transition to Ethereum 2.0, position it as a foundational layer for the future of the internet. Solana (SOL): Known for its high transaction speeds and low fees, Solana is a strong competitor in the smart contract platform space. Its growing developer community and innovative technology make it an attractive asset for those looking at high-performance blockchain solutions. By investing in these top-tier assets, LineKong is betting on the established leaders and promising innovators in the crypto space. This prudent selection underscores a sophisticated understanding of the market dynamics. Broader Implications of This Hong Kong Crypto Investment What does LineKong’s significant Hong Kong crypto investment mean for the wider market? This action could very well serve as a catalyst for other corporations, particularly those in Asia, to explore similar ventures. When a publicly listed company makes such a move, it adds a layer of legitimacy and reduces perceived risk for other potential institutional investors. Moreover, Hong Kong has been proactive in establishing a clear regulatory framework for digital assets. This supportive environment likely encourages companies like LineKong to make such bold moves. Increased institutional participation often leads to greater market stability, liquidity, and further innovation within the cryptocurrency sector. It truly marks a pivotal moment for digital asset adoption in the region. Navigating the Future of Hong Kong Crypto Investment While the prospect of significant returns is appealing, making a Hong Kong crypto investment also comes with inherent challenges. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and regulatory landscapes can shift. Companies must carefully assess their risk tolerance and stay informed about market developments and compliance requirements. However, the benefits often outweigh the risks for forward-thinking companies. By embracing digital assets, businesses can unlock new avenues for growth, enhance their treasury management strategies, and align themselves with the future of finance. LineKong’s move serves as a compelling example of how traditional businesses are adapting to the digital age, paving the way for broader acceptance and integration of cryptocurrencies. LineKong’s substantial $7.85 million Hong Kong crypto investment in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana marks a significant milestone for institutional adoption in Asia. This strategic move highlights the growing confidence of publicly listed companies in digital assets as a legitimate and valuable component of their investment portfolios. As more firms follow suit, we can expect a continued evolution of the financial landscape, driven by innovation and a bold embrace of the digital frontier. It’s a clear signal that cryptocurrencies are here to stay, becoming an undeniable part of global corporate strategy.

By the way, I give the same credit to the Middle East. I mean, the Middle East has really embraced cryptocurrency in a massive way, and they are running and they are running fast in that endeavor,” the son of U.S. President Donald Trump said. Trump framed the U.S.–China dynamic as central to the future of digital finance, agreeing that both countries “are definitely leading the way on cryptocurrency.” Asked whether the topic might come up in an expected trade meeting between his father and Chinese President Xi Jinping, he suggested the agenda would likely focus on larger issues, but said he “would certainly love to talk about bitcoin.” He also emphasized bitcoin’s role in creating a uniquely international community, calling it “one of the most diverse communities in the world"" and noted that conversations about bitcoin bring together people from “different cultures, different societies, different languages, different religions.” This global network makes the asset class “great for humanity,” he said. He positioned the U.S. under his father’s leadership as a fast mover, claiming that more progress on digital assets had been made in the seven months since Trump’s return to office than in the previous decade. Trump described America as “winning the digital revolution” thanks to strong political backing and an influx of institutional support from Wall Street firms, sovereign wealth funds, and retirement accounts.

This significant milestone highlights a dramatic shift in the global financial landscape, capturing the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike. What Does This Monumental Bitcoin Market Cap Achievement Mean? For the first time, the total value of all Bitcoin in circulation, known as its Bitcoin market cap , now exceeds the combined market capitalization of two companies that have dominated the traditional payments industry for decades.

Moreover, it suggests a growing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate store of value and a potential challenger to established financial systems. Bitcoin Magazine first reported this incredible feat via X, drawing widespread attention. The data, confirmed by sources like CoinMarketCap, shows Bitcoin’s current market cap standing at approximately $2.1819 trillion. In contrast, the combined market value of Visa and Mastercard, while immense, now sits below this figure. Bitcoin’s Ascendance: A Closer Look at the Numbers This achievement is not just symbolic; it reflects substantial capital inflow into the digital asset space. Investors are increasingly recognizing Bitcoin’s potential, moving significant wealth into the cryptocurrency. This shift impacts not only the perception of digital assets but also the future direction of global finance.

Investor Confidence: The surge indicates strong investor belief in Bitcoin’s long-term viability and its role in a diversified portfolio. Technological Disruption: It underscores the disruptive power of blockchain technology against traditional, centralized financial infrastructures. Why is Bitcoin’s Market Cap Growing So Rapidly? Several factors contribute to the impressive expansion of Bitcoin’s market cap. Institutional adoption plays a crucial role, with major financial institutions and corporations adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Furthermore, the approval of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in key markets has opened new avenues for traditional investors to gain exposure to the asset, simplifying access and boosting liquidity. Moreover, Bitcoin’s narrative as a hedge against inflation continues to resonate with investors globally. As traditional currencies face inflationary pressures, many seek alternative assets to preserve wealth. Bitcoin, with its finite supply, offers an attractive proposition in this environment. This sustained interest from both retail and institutional players fuels its remarkable growth. Implications for the Future of Finance and Payments This milestone sparks critical discussions about the future of money and transaction systems. Traditional payment networks like Visa and Mastercard excel in processing high volumes of transactions quickly, but they operate within a centralized framework. Bitcoin, on the other hand, offers a decentralized, peer-to-peer system that operates without intermediaries. The implications are far-reaching: Increased Competition: Bitcoin’s rise intensifies competition for traditional payment processors, potentially spurring innovation across the board. Evolving Investment Strategies: Financial advisors and portfolio managers must now seriously consider Bitcoin as a significant asset class. Global Accessibility: Bitcoin offers financial services to the unbanked, providing an alternative to conventional banking systems. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for anyone navigating the evolving financial landscape. The world of payments is undeniably changing, and Bitcoin is at the forefront of this transformation. In conclusion, Bitcoin’s market cap surpassing the combined value of Visa and Mastercard is more than just a headline; it is a powerful indicator of a fundamental shift in global finance. This monumental achievement underscores Bitcoin’s growing legitimacy, its disruptive potential, and its undeniable presence as a major force in the economic world. The journey of digital assets continues to unfold, promising exciting developments ahead. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is “Bitcoin market cap”? A1: Bitcoin market cap refers to the total value of all Bitcoin currently in circulation. You calculate it by multiplying the current price of one Bitcoin by the total number of Bitcoins mined. Q2: Why is it significant that Bitcoin’s market cap surpassed Visa and Mastercard? A2: This milestone is significant because it shows Bitcoin’s growing financial power and mainstream acceptance. It positions Bitcoin as a major global asset, challenging the dominance of traditional payment giants. Q3: What factors are driving Bitcoin’s growth? A3: Several factors contribute to Bitcoin’s growth, including increasing institutional adoption, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, and its perceived role as a hedge against inflation. Growing retail investor interest also plays a key role. Q4: Does this mean Bitcoin will replace Visa and Mastercard soon? A4: While Bitcoin’s market cap is impressive, it operates differently from Visa and Mastercard. It is more of a store of value and a settlement layer, whereas Visa and Mastercard are transaction processors. This milestone signifies a shift in financial influence rather than an immediate replacement of payment networks. Q5: Where can I find current Bitcoin market cap data? A5: You can find real-time Bitcoin market cap data on reputable cryptocurrency data platforms like CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, and others that track digital asset prices and metrics.

LINK consolidates near $24 with resistance at $26.60; traders eye potential breakout or retracement. Caliber adopts LINK in new treasury strategy, joining the rising corporate trend of digital asset reserves. US Commerce Department Works With Chainlink The US Department of Commerce has entered into a partnership with Chainlink to place official macroeconomic data on-chain. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) said that it has already been published using Chainlink’s oracle feeds. According to the Department, a verified hash of second-quarter GDP data has been added to Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, TRON, Stellar, Avalanche, Arbitrum One, Polygon PoS, and Optimism. Coinbase, Gemini, and Kraken supported the publishing process. US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick commented , “It’s only fitting that the Commerce Department and President Donald Trump, the Crypto-President, publicly release economic statistical data on the blockchain.” Furthermore, the Department stated that a proof of concept is planned to test government-wide blockchain use cases. The move follows President Trump’s push to strengthen the United States’ position in digital assets. Chainlink confirmed that six core indicators are now available on-chain. These include Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) index, and Real Final Sales to Private Domestic Purchasers, along with their percentage changes. Chainlink added that the data will be refreshed monthly or quarterly and is currently distributed across ten blockchains, including Ethereum, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, and Optimism. Additional networks will be added in the future. Pyth Network, which also partnered with the Department, is helping distribute the same economic data across multiple chains. LINK Price Action and Technical Setup Chainlink (LINK) was trading at around $24 with a daily volume of $2.87 billion. The token is down 2% in the last 24 hours and 5% over the past week. On the chart, LINK recently staged a sharp rally, reaching resistance near $26.60 before retreating. The token is consolidating below that zone, with the 9-day EMA at $24.57 and the 50-day SMA near $20.24. Analysts note that a breakout above $26.60 with volume could confirm an extension of the rally. A drop toward the $20–$21 range could serve as the next key support level. Source: X Broader Use and Institutional Interest Analyst Altcoin Sherpa observed , “$LINK is 1 of those universal projects that transcends chains, dapps etc—every project needs oracles.” They added that Chainlink continues to serve as core infrastructure for the wider crypto ecosystem. Meanwhile, Nasdaq-listed Caliber announced approval of a Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) strategy that features Chainlink. The company said it will purchase LINK for its reserves and seek to generate returns from its holdings. The move places LINK among a growing list of tokens being adopted by corporations as part of their treasury strategies.

Binance, one of the globe’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has officially announced the upcoming Binance MITO listing . This isn’t just any new token; MITO is the 34th project to join Binance’s highly anticipated Hodler Airdrops program, creating a wave of excitement among long-term crypto holders. What is the Binance Hodler Airdrops Program? The Hodler Airdrops program is a fantastic initiative by Binance designed to reward its loyal users. Essentially, it allows users who hold specific cryptocurrencies on the exchange to receive free tokens from new, promising projects. This strategy benefits both the projects, by distributing their tokens to a broad, engaged audience, and the hodlers, who get a chance to acquire new assets without direct investment. Binance carefully selects projects for this program, ensuring they meet certain criteria for innovation and potential. The inclusion of MITO signifies a strong vote of confidence from the exchange, highlighting its perceived value and future prospects. This program reinforces Binance’s commitment to supporting its community and fostering the growth of the broader crypto ecosystem. Why is the Binance MITO Listing Significant? The upcoming Binance MITO listing is a big deal for several reasons. Firstly, a listing on Binance provides immense visibility and liquidity for any project. Binance boasts millions of users worldwide, meaning MITO will instantly gain exposure to a massive audience of potential investors and traders. This exposure is crucial for a project’s long-term success and adoption. Secondly, being part of the Hodler Airdrops program means that existing Binance users who qualify will receive MITO tokens directly into their accounts. This creates immediate distribution and encourages early engagement with the token. It’s a win-win scenario, offering an attractive incentive for users to continue holding their assets on Binance while simultaneously introducing them to a new project with potential. Increased Visibility: MITO gains access to Binance’s vast user base. Enhanced Liquidity: A major exchange listing typically brings higher trading volumes. Community Rewards: Hodlers receive free tokens, boosting engagement. Trust and Credibility: Binance’s endorsement adds significant legitimacy to MITO. Understanding MITO: What Does This Project Offer? While the initial announcement focuses on the listing, it’s essential to understand what MITO brings to the table. MITO is the native token of the Injective Protocol , a blockchain built for finance. Injective is a Layer-1 blockchain optimized for building Web3 financial applications. It offers a powerful infrastructure for decentralized exchanges (DEXs), derivatives, prediction markets, and more. MITO plays a crucial role within the Injective ecosystem. It will likely be used for governance, staking, and potentially for paying transaction fees or accessing specific features within applications built on Injective. This utility makes the Binance MITO listing not just about a new coin, but about a new entry into a robust and expanding decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape. How Can You Prepare for the MITO Airdrop and Listing? The official listing time for MITO on Binance is set for 3:30 p.m. UTC on August 29 . If you are a Binance user and wish to participate in the Hodler Airdrops, ensure you meet the eligibility criteria set by Binance. Typically, this involves holding a certain amount of a specified cryptocurrency (like BNB or others, as announced by Binance) in your spot wallet. Keep an eye on official Binance announcements for precise details regarding the airdrop snapshot and distribution. It’s always wise to: Verify Eligibility: Check Binance’s announcements for specific token holdings required. Stay Informed: Follow Binance’s official channels for updates. Understand MITO: Research the Injective Protocol to grasp MITO’s fundamentals. This Binance MITO listing represents a fresh opportunity for crypto enthusiasts to diversify their portfolios and engage with an innovative project. The seamless integration into Binance’s Hodler Airdrops program makes it even more accessible for existing users. The Future Impact of Binance MITO Listing The addition of MITO to Binance’s extensive list of tradable assets is poised to have a significant impact. It underscores the continued expansion of the crypto market and the increasing sophistication of projects being launched. For Injective Protocol, the listing provides a major boost in credibility and reach, potentially attracting more developers and users to its ecosystem. For hodlers, this is a direct benefit, offering a chance to gain new tokens from a project with solid fundamentals. As the crypto space evolves, programs like Binance’s Hodler Airdrops are crucial in fostering community engagement and providing tangible rewards for long-term support. The excitement around the Binance MITO listing is a testament to the vibrant and ever-growing world of digital assets. In conclusion, the upcoming Binance MITO listing as part of the Hodler Airdrops program is a landmark event. It offers significant advantages for both the Injective Protocol and Binance users, promising increased visibility, liquidity, and valuable rewards.

Price Analysis,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/bitcoin-btc-trend-break-fails-whats-next-price-analysis,"An assault on the descending trendline by the bulls on Thursday was repelled by the bears. After this break of trend failure the Bitcoin price is heading downwards on Friday. Where will it stop? Are the bears taking control? $BTC rejected at descending trendline Source: TradingView Having just hit $110,000, this latest red candle is a sharp reminder of the power the bears still have at this particular stage of tug-of-war that the bulls and the bears are going through. A tiny green candle has just opened at the $110,000 horizontal level, but it could be swallowed up if this rejection continues. The bearish scenario is that this dip continues and the price makes another lower low below $109,000. If this level does end up failing, the next decent level of support is at $106,000, with the psychological level of $100,000 perhaps bringing some real terror into the market if the price gets this far down. Putting the rose-tinted glasses back on, there is good support at this current level, while $109,000 could still be tagged without making a lower low. Probably the biggest problem at the area of the breakout attempt was that the bulls were starting to get tired. Momentum was faltering as first the 4-hour Stochastic RSI indicators reached the top, and then when the 8-hour Stochastic RSI indicators crossed back down this was the signal that the bulls were defeated - at least for now. Moving averages starting to roll over - bigger dip coming? Source: TradingView The daily chart has some potential issues to keep an eye on. Firstly, the main Simple Moving Averages of the 50-day (blue), 100-day (green), and 200-day (red) are perhaps signalling some concern. The 50-day SMA and the 100-day SMA are just starting to tilt downwards. If one looks back to the last time this happened, it was the beginning of a full-blown 30% collapse to the downside, which even pierced through the 200-day SMA which is supposed to act as bull market support. Of course, this might just be a little squiggle in these moving averages as they then turn back to the upside, but it’s certainly something to keep an eye on. At the bottom of the chart, the RSI indicator line is bouncing at a band of support. If it drops through, the 200-day SMA might well be tested. Bearish divergence on 2-week chart - bears taking control? Source: TradingView Rather than looking at the weekly chart, the 2-week chart has less false signals and is therefore a very good indicator of future price direction. It can be seen that right now the price is sitting on the very important $109,000 horizontal support. If it falls through here, and confirms below, a much deeper price correction becomes possible. The two indicators at the bottom of the chart are currently providing ammunition for the bearish thesis. Firstly, the MACD indicators are shaping to cross down. Secondly, the Stochastic RSI indicators are crossing down. Both the MACD and the Stochastic RSI indicators are sloping down, while the price action is angled upwards. This signals bearish divergence for the entirety of 2025 so far. Will a big dip be required to enable this bearish divergence to play out, or could the price action shoot skywards and nullify the divergence? As it stands, the bears look to be firmly in control.

With risk-on sentiment returning to digital assets, analysts and retail traders alike are shifting attention toward early-stage projects that can deliver outsize returns compared to more established names. Among the most talked-about opportunities are MAGACOIN FINANCE , Dogecoin, and Arbitrum, which continue to dominate headlines and community chatter. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale Leader MAGACOIN FINANCE has become the centerpiece of presale discussions in August, ranking at the top of analyst shortlists. Market watchers highlight that it is drawing heavy momentum thanks to audited infrastructure and projections of substantial upside potential. The project’s positioning as a secure entry point has been amplified by investor incentives, including early access bonuses that increase allocations before demand overtakes supply. Momentum is further reinforced by whale interest, as large holders steadily accumulate during the presale rounds. This activity, combined with strong retail enthusiasm, is creating an ecosystem of confidence around MAGACOIN FINANCE . Analysts note that the appeal is not purely speculative: the audited framework and structured rollout provide a sense of security, making the project attractive even to investors who typically avoid presales. For those looking to maximize exposure, the presale includes promotional codes such as PATRIOT50X, which early buyers have been using to secure an additional 50% bonus allocation. This offer is expected to accelerate inflows as the token moves closer to its exchange debut, heightening anticipation that MAGACOIN FINANCE could replicate the kind of exponential gains seen in earlier breakout cycles. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Verified Altcoin With Long-Term Upside As one of the best altcoins to buy this year, MAGACOIN FINANCE earns its place through verified credibility. Unlike speculative launches, this project is backed by a Hashex audit and led by a KYC-compliant team, creating a solid foundation for long-term success. Its combination of security, transparency, and utility makes it highly attractive to forward-thinking investors. Dogecoin: Meme Hype with Renewed Energy Dogecoin is not technically a presale, but it continues to dominate speculative cycles in ways that mirror the excitement around early-stage launches. Traders point to bullish technical patterns, including a golden cross between its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, as a signal of potential upside. Price forecasts range from $0.30 to above $1 in optimistic scenarios, reflecting the ongoing enthusiasm around its volatility. Community energy remains central to Dogecoin’s momentum. The meme-driven rallies of past cycles have resurfaced, bringing both nostalgic retail investors and opportunistic newcomers into the market. At the same time, upgrades to the Dogecoin chain and growing merchant adoption are expanding its practical use cases. Speculation about a potential Dogecoin ETF only adds to the buzz, ensuring that DOGE continues to capture mainstream attention alongside presale tokens. Arbitrum: Scaling Ethereum and Building Trust Arbitrum represents a very different type of opportunity, appealing to investors looking for sustainability as well as growth. As one of Ethereum’s leading Layer-2 scaling solutions, it now secures over $12 billion in total value locked across hundreds of decentralized applications. Partnerships, including integrations with PayPal’s PYUSD, further validate its role in the broader ecosystem. From a technical perspective, ARB has shown renewed momentum, climbing above resistance levels and targeting ranges between $0.74 and $1.00. While short-term volatility remains a possibility due to recent token unlocks, analysts argue that the long-term case for Arbitrum is intact, underpinned by institutional flows and real-world utility. Unlike purely meme-based tokens, its infrastructure focus makes it a candidate for investors seeking exposure to Ethereum’s growth without the same downside risks. Ozak AI, Remittix, and Layer Brett Round Out the List Beyond the headline names, several smaller presales are generating niche excitement. Ozak AI has captured interest with its AI-powered predictive market platform, aiming for ambitious returns of up to 560x from presale to target price. Remittix is focusing on the $750 billion remittance market, offering low-cost cross-border transfers with audited security, while Layer Brett blends meme-driven enthusiasm with Layer-2 scalability and staking features. Each of these projects brings a distinct angle, from AI integration to payments disruption, reflecting the diversity of themes driving the current presale cycle. While their upside projections vary, they illustrate the appetite for both speculative gains and real-world application within the altcoin market. Conclusion — MAGACOIN FINANCE Leads the Pack The presale market in late August 2025 reflects a blend of meme-driven hype, infrastructure plays, and tech-driven innovation. Dogecoin and Arbitrum continue to command strong visibility, but MAGACOIN FINANCE has established itself as the clear presale leader, attracting both whale inflows and retail momentum. With audited security, forecasted high ROI potential, and early-buyer bonuses fueling participation, it is increasingly being positioned as the top presale to buy now.

50858647,568916,1756461172,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50858647.jpeg,Best Crypto Presales to Buy Now – Grok AI’s Top Recommendations,https://bitcoinist.com/best-crypto-presales-grok-ai-top-recommendations/,"As ridiculous as it may sound, the only way high-cap mainstream cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum could ever climb 1000x during an altcoin rally is if every physical money note in the world got infected with a virus. In simple terms, these giants are just too big to move that violently. And that’s exactly why the spotlight shifts to the best crypto presales . Think of crypto presales like stock IPOs – you get the chance to invest in a potentially breakout project at some of the lowest prices you’ll ever see. Even better, since these tokens aren’t listed on exchanges yet, they’re shielded (for now) from the crypto market’s notorious volatility. To zero in on the top cryptos to buy now, i.e., the presales carrying that wild 1000x potential, we turned to Grok. The AI leveraged its direct integration with X, sweeping through expert analysis, breaking news, and even community chatter to spotlight three potential 1000x cryptos . 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – New Telegram Trading Bot for Meme Coin Sniping If you’re looking for a low-cap coin that could grow alongside the broader crypto market, consider Snorter Token ($SNORT) . At its core is the Snorter bot, a new Telegram-based trading tool designed to help retail investors snipe liquidity in freshly listed meme coins on Solana. Soon after launch, Snorter plans to expand support to other chains as well, including Ethereum, BNB, Polygon, and Base, covering virtually all major meme coin launches. The best part? You can place buy, sell, limit, or stop orders through simple Telegram messages, and the bot will execute them the moment liquidity becomes available. Snorter also stands out for its strong security features. From rug pulls and honeypots to front-running and sandwich attacks, it protects you against common on-chain threats, offering a safe, hassle-free trading experience. Interested? Buy Snorter Token , the project’s native cryptocurrency that unlocks: A potential 800% return, according to our $SNORT price prediction Staking rewards, currently yielding 128% No daily sniping limits Advanced analytics Lowest-ever trading fees, just 0.85% Currently in presale, $SNORT has already pulled in over $3.5M from early investors. And each token is priced at just $0.1027. Visit Snorter Token’s official website for more information. 2. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – Dogecoin-Inspired Meme Coin Eyeing 1000x Returns Although AI chatbots usually stick to relatively ‘safe’ cryptos, that’s not the case with Grok. Laced with Elon Musk’s wild energy, Grok highlighted Maxi Doge ($MAXI) as one of the best cryptos to buy now . Unlike other presales that push game-changing missions and glossy whitepapers, Maxi is a pure hype-fueled meme coin that doesn’t pretend to be anything it’s not. After breaking free from Dogecoin’s shadow, Maxi positioned himself as the ultimate anti-Doge, bulking up with heavy lifts in the gym and even heavier gains in the markets. Armed with a big green candle as his weapon, Maxi has already built a loyal following of traders who share his disdain for Doge and his ‘the charts never sleep, so why should I?’ mindset. In its quest for 1000x returns, $MAXI has reserved a massive 40% of its total token supply for marketing. This will fuel paid campaigns, influencer collaborations, and social media blitzes, along with holder-only perks like weekly trading competitions and leaderboard prizes. And the results are already showing. Just weeks into its presale, $MAXI has raised over $1.64M, proving that investors are hungry for a raw, degen-powered meme coin bold enough to challenge eight-figure whales. The best part? You can buy $MAXI for just $0.0002545 apiece, but hurry up because this price will increase in the next couple of days. For more information, check out Maxi Doge’s official website. 3. Remittix ($RTX) – A Potentially Revolutionary Project Bringing Crypto & Fiat Together With already over $22M raised in its presale, Remittix ($RTX) is quickly becoming one of the most anticipated projects in recent times. Why? Because it aims to bridge the gap between crypto and fiat payments in a truly unique way, allowing users to send fiat payments using cryptocurrencies. In simple terms, you’ll be able to pay any bank account in the world with crypto, while the recipient receives the funds in their native fiat currency. Even better, neither the receiving bank nor the recipient will know the payment originated as crypto. This effectively allows users to bypass crypto-to-fiat restrictions, especially in tier-two and tier-three countries. The hype around $RTX makes even more sense when you consider the sheer size of the market it’s targeting. The global cross-border payments market is massive, and it’s projected to hit a whopping $250T valuation by 2027 . Wrapping Up While picking mainstream cryptos is relatively straightforward – there are only so many to choose from – finding under-the-radar presale gems is a much tougher challenge. So we brought in the big guns, asking Grok which tokens it believes could be the next cryptos to explode . The result? Chef’s kiss. Grok singled out a mix of genuinely solid projects, blending utility-driven tokens like Snorter Token ($SNORT) and Remittix ($RTX) with pure hype-fueled meme coins like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) .

The application follows a similar filing in April by Canary Capital, signaling growing institutional interest in the relatively new blockchain. The S-1 registration statement, submitted on Thursday, outlines plans to use CF Benchmarks—a crypto price index provider—to track SEI’s price through data aggregated from multiple exchanges. Coinbase Custody Trust Company has been named as the custodian of SEI holdings. The filing also leaves room for potential staking of SEI to generate additional returns, although 21Shares noted it is still evaluating whether this would pose legal, regulatory, or tax concerns. 21Shares Expanding ETFs Launched in August 2023, SEI is a layer-1 blockchain designed to power decentralized exchanges and trading-focused infrastructure. Its token is used for gas fees and governance, making it a utility asset within the ecosystem. The SEC has so far only approved spot ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum, but filings for additional crypto assets are building momentum. In a statement on X, 21Shares described its SEI ETF filing as a “key milestone in expanding exchange-traded access to the SEI Network.” Canary Capital, a US-based digital asset firm , submitted its own SEI ETF proposal earlier this year. That filing suggested investors could gain not only direct exposure to SEI but also passive income through staking rewards. Commenting at the time, Justin Barlow, executive director of the Sei Development Foundation, said ETFs could act as a “gateway for broader adoption, providing a vital bridge between crypto and mainstream markets.” SEC Considers Streamlined Approval Process Beyond SEI, 21Shares already manages several products , including the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, and has filed for ETFs tracking other tokens such as SUI, XRP, and Ondo. The timing of the SEI filing could be favorable. According to journalist Eleanor Terrett, the SEC is weighing a new system that would simplify ETF approvals . Under the proposed structure, issuers would file a standard S-1 form and wait 75 days. If the SEC raised no formal objections within that period, the ETF would be automatically approved. If successful, the move could speed up the entry of SEI and other crypto tokens into the regulated ETF market, potentially broadening access for both institutional and retail investors.

Analysts see further upside potential, setting $0.50 and $0.88 as next targets. XRP slipped to $2.85 after failing to break above $3.10. However, industry participants remain bullish and believe the asset could reach a new all-time high soon. BTC dropped below $110K as September’s bearish trend weighs. Still, Charles Hoskinson sees potential for $250K this cycle and a $10T market cap in five years. CRO Took Center Stage The cryptocurrency sector had a somewhat surprising star this week, and its name is Cronos (CRO). The token behind the exchange Crypto.com saw its price skyrocket by over 100% in the last three days. At one point, CRO reached almost $0.40 (a level last witnessed in the spring of 2022), but it later retraced to the current $0.29 (per CoinGecko’s data). CRO Price, Source: CoinGecko The pump was fueled by Trump Media, which revealed it will purchase approximately 2% of the asset’s entire supply by spending roughly $105 million for 685,427,004 CRO. The Truth Social and Truth+ platforms will launch a rewards system for their users, utilizing the digital wallet infrastructure of the popular exchange and adopting the coin as a utility token. Additionally, Trump Media, Yorkville, and Crypto.com will set up a digital asset treasury firm, which will purchase roughly 19% of the entire CRO supply. Despite the drop in the past several hours, multiple analysts on X remain optimistic that CRO is headed for further upside in the short term. X user JAVON MARKS believes the valuation could soar by 3x to $0.8868. For their part, CryptoPulse set $0.50 as a target but only if “momentum kicks back in.” Meanwhile, CRO’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) has risen above 70, indicating that the asset is in overbought territory and may be due for a pullback. The technical analysis tool measures the speed and magnitude of recent price changes, and ratios under 30 are typically interpreted as bullish, as they suggest the token is oversold. CRO RSI, Source: TradingView XRP’s Next Targets Ripple’s cross-border token experienced another decline over the last 24 hours, and as of this writing, it trades at around $2.85. Earlier this week, the popular X user Ali Martinez warned that failing to overcome $3.10 would lead to a drop to $2.83. STEPH IN CRYPTO also sounded the alarm, arguing that the peak of the bull run for XRP may arrive in the next one or two months. Other analysts, though, are in the optimistic corner. X user Mags estimated that XRP’s price has recently consolidated the same way it did in 2017 and could be gearing up for a massive rally to $5.20 and even $7.30 (if history repeats itself). How’s BTC Doing? While the primary cryptocurrency reached a new all-time high of over $124,000 in mid-August, it has been in an evident decline ever since. As of this writing, it trades below $110,000, while its market capitalization has plunged beneath $2.2 billion. September has historically been a predominantly bearish month for BTC, with some community members expecting an additional plunge in the short term. BTC Monthly Returns, Source: CoinGlass Prominent figures, such as Cardano’s founder Charles Hoskinson, on the other hand, remain unfazed. In a recent interview, he predicted that the price of the asset could surge to $250,000 during this cycle, while its capitalization might explode to $10 trillion within the next five years.

We saw an incredible surge in Ethereum network activity , reaching levels not witnessed in years. This isn’t just a minor uptick; it signals a robust and expanding ecosystem. What’s Behind the Explosive Ethereum Network Activity? In August, the Ethereum network activity hit an astonishing peak. Data from The Block reveals that monthly adjusted on-chain transaction volume surpassed an incredible $320 billion. This figure marks the highest level recorded since May 2021, a clear indicator of growing adoption and utility. But what exactly does ‘adjusted on-chain transaction volume’ mean? Simply put, it represents the total value of all transactions processed on the Ethereum blockchain, excluding certain internal transfers that might skew the data. This metric provides a more accurate picture of genuine economic activity on the network. Several factors likely contributed to this significant rise in Ethereum network activity : Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Growth: DeFi protocols continue to attract users, with lending, borrowing, and decentralized exchanges driving substantial transaction volume. Stablecoin Utility: Stablecoins, many of which operate on Ethereum, saw increased usage for cross-border payments and trading, boosting network traffic. NFT Market Resurgence: While not at peak hype, the NFT market still generates considerable transactions, especially for new collections and marketplaces. Developer Engagement: More projects launching and deploying on Ethereum means more smart contract interactions. Why Does This Increased Ethereum Network Activity Matter to You? A surge in Ethereum network activity is not just a statistic; it has real-world implications for everyone involved in the crypto space. This increased volume signifies a healthy and vibrant ecosystem, indicating strong demand for Ethereum’s capabilities. For users, it means more dApps, more services, and more opportunities. For developers, it translates into a larger user base and a more robust platform to build innovative solutions. Essentially, it reinforces Ethereum’s position as a leading blockchain for decentralized applications and digital assets. Moreover, sustained high activity often correlates with network security and resilience. A busy network proves its ability to handle significant demand, further solidifying trust among its participants. This strong foundation is crucial for long-term growth and adoption. Navigating the Landscape of Ethereum Network Activity While increased Ethereum network activity is largely positive, it also brings certain considerations. One common challenge associated with high demand is network congestion, which can lead to higher transaction fees, often referred to as ‘gas fees’. However, the Ethereum community is actively addressing these scalability concerns. Layer 2 scaling solutions, such as Optimism and Arbitrum, are gaining traction. These solutions process transactions off the main chain, significantly reducing costs and increasing speed, before settling them back on Ethereum. Furthermore, the ongoing development of Ethereum 2.0 (now known as the ‘Merge’ and subsequent upgrades) aims to fundamentally improve the network’s scalability, security, and sustainability. These advancements are crucial for handling future surges in Ethereum network activity efficiently. The Future Outlook for Ethereum Network Activity: What’s Next? Looking ahead, the outlook for Ethereum network activity remains incredibly promising. The August surge demonstrates the network’s enduring appeal and its critical role in the broader crypto economy. As the ecosystem matures and scaling solutions become more integrated, we can expect even greater efficiency and accessibility. The continuous innovation from developers, coupled with growing institutional interest, suggests that Ethereum will likely maintain its trajectory of growth. Keeping an eye on key metrics like transaction volume and active addresses provides valuable insights into the network’s health and future potential. In conclusion, the remarkable increase in Ethereum network activity during August is a powerful testament to its strength and relevance. It underscores the network’s critical role in driving innovation across DeFi, NFTs, and beyond. This surge is not just a fleeting moment; it’s a clear signal of Ethereum’s robust present and its bright future in the decentralized world. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What caused the surge in Ethereum network activity in August? The surge was likely driven by a combination of factors, including increased activity in Decentralized Finance (DeFi), greater utility of stablecoins, and continued engagement within the NFT market, alongside general growth in developer deployments. How is ‘adjusted on-chain transaction volume’ calculated? ‘Adjusted on-chain transaction volume’ measures the total value of transactions on the Ethereum network, excluding certain internal or self-transfer transactions that might inflate the raw volume figure, providing a more accurate view of economic activity. What does this increased activity mean for the ETH price? While increased network activity often indicates strong demand and a healthy ecosystem, which can positively influence price, it’s not a direct or sole determinant. Market sentiment, macroeconomic factors, and broader crypto trends also play significant roles in ETH’s price movements. Are there any challenges associated with high Ethereum network activity? Yes, high activity can sometimes lead to network congestion and increased transaction fees (gas fees). However, Layer 2 scaling solutions and ongoing Ethereum upgrades are designed to mitigate these challenges and improve overall network efficiency. What are the key benefits of a robust Ethereum network? A robust Ethereum network offers numerous benefits, including a secure platform for decentralized applications, a global settlement layer for digital assets, and a thriving ecosystem that fosters continuous innovation and utility for users and developers alike.

Dogecoin is seeing a rise in whale accumulation, while Stellar (XLM) has broken past resistance and is eyeing higher targets. But the real question for traders is simple: which cryptos are worth buying in August for the next major run? Here is why analysts are already pointing to one new altcoin as the hottest crypto to buy in August, with real 20x–50x potential Dogecoin Whales Load Up Ahead of ETF Buzz Dogecoin price has jumped more than 4% in the past 24 hours, now trading near $0.22. The move comes as whales aggressively scoop up DOGE during recent dips. One new wallet withdrew 32.9 million DOGE, then added another 20 million from Binance, bringing holdings to over $11.7 million. Dogecoin Price Chart | Source: TradingView On top of that, well-known whale James Wynn went long again on DOGE , betting on a breakout. And optimism is building around a potential Dogecoin ETF approval. Grayscale and Bitwise have filed applications, with Bloomberg analysts giving a 90% chance of SEC approval by October 17. If ETF approval goes through, DOGE may easily break $0.23 resistance and target $0.30 and $0.82–$2.18 on longer-term charts. Options expiration later this week may make traders cautious due to heightened volatility. XLM Price Prediction: Can Stellar Hit $0.52? While Dogecoin grabs headlines, Stellar (XLM) is flashing one of the strongest setups in the market. XLM is trading at $0.46 after a 3.8% pump, with bulls eyeing $0.52 as the next key target. XLM Price Chart | Source: TradingView Technicals look bullish with RSI, MACD, and exchange volumes , which remain high. If Stellar breaks $0.47 with momentum, traders forecast a run to $0.52, a new yearly high. Long-term support is $0.43 and deeper at $0.36. The bullish case is clear, but traders keep position sizes tight with XLM already 48% above its 200-day moving average. For now, the XLM price prediction is bullish into September, but risk management is key. Remittix: The Hottest Crypto To Buy In August As Dogecoin and Stellar push higher, analysts say the real opportunity may be in Remittix (RTX) , a payments-focused altcoin already being called the “next-gen XRP.” Remittix is building a PayFi platform that lets users send 40+ cryptocurrencies directly into bank accounts across 30+ countries. Transfers settle in 24 hours, fees are flat, and payments appear as standard bank deposits, with no crypto exposure for the recipient. Key milestones fueling Remittix momentum: $21.8 million raised in presale, with 625 million tokens sold. The first CEX listing was confirmed on BitMart, and more listings are expected once the $22 million milestone is hit. Certik audit completed at an early stage, ensuring the safety of its smart contracts. The beta wallet will debut in September, facilitating multichain operation, real-time FX tracking, and faster and safer transaction completion. Ongoing $250,000 Remittix Giveaway driving community growth. Unlike Dogecoin or Stellar, which rely on speculation and slow adoption cycles, Remittix is currently solving a $183T payments problem.

The price dropped to $2.84, down from $3.05 support and below the $3 psychological threshold, with the decline pushed XRP’s market cap from $179.82 billion to $169.72 billion, underperforming the broader crypto market’s 3.35% decline over the same period. XRP 1-day market cap chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Technical indicators confirm the bearish shift. XRP’s MACD histogram printed at –0.0146, while the relative strength index (RSI) fell to 46.58, signaling downside momentum. The breakdown also triggered $113 million in long liquidations, according to CoinMarketCap’s community data. $2.88 is the next key Fibonacci retracement level (78.6%). A sustained move below $2.75, the swing low, could open the door to a deeper correction. Crypto trading expert weighs in The intraday slide also arrived amid a public forecast shift from on-chain analyst Ali Martinez. On August 25, Martinez posted on X that “it won’t take long” before XRP returned to $3.70, a call Finbold noted looked unlikely at the time with the token trading below $3, pointing out that it was much more likely for XRP to trade at $2.70 instead. Four days later, on August 28, Martinez wrote that “$XRP continues to retrace toward $2.83 as anticipated!” bringing his outlook in line with the prevailing downside momentum as price action gravitated toward that level. $XRP continues to retrace toward $2.83 as anticipated! https://t.co/kzn0z7oh4X pic.twitter.com/WCChD1ildN — Ali (@ali_charts) August 29, 2025 The selloff follows a week of mixed sentiment around potential XRP spot ETF approval.

Both tokens will show resilience, but the real story over the next two years will be about rotation. Investors will search for smaller-cap projects with clear mechanics to generate returns from day one. Utility-heavy DeFi platforms will be favored, and among them, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already shaping up as the most convincing candidate to outperform. Why Rotation Will Favor Smaller Utility Tokens As crypto prices grow, the search for new gains will not stop at DOT and XRP. Utility-focused assets like lending protocols, Layer-2 efficiency tokens, and staking-driven platforms will attract new liquidity. Lending tokens will allow users to monetize their idle stablecoins, while governance-focused tokens will capture attention through network direction. Yield-generating tokens will stand out by combining simplicity with transparent distribution of revenue. Within this field, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will hold a stronger hand than most. The project will bring forward a decentralized $1 stablecoin that will be minted only against collateral like ETH or AVAX. The mint-and-burn mechanism will keep the stablecoin tied closely to its peg, while issuer caps will prevent oversupply. This stablecoin will remain at the center of the platform’s borrowing and lending engine, creating both liquidity and trust in the system. mtTokens will act as receipts for deposits. A user placing assets into a pool will receive mtTokens in return, and their value will rise with interest earnings. These tokens will not only remain transferable but also be stakeable in designated smart contracts, unlocking further MUTM rewards. Importantly, the protocol will recycle revenue back into the market by buying MUTM and redistributing it to stakers. This cycle of revenue, buyback, and redistribution will give the token lasting demand beyond speculation. Concrete examples make the model stand out. A lender will place $18,500 USDT into a peer-to-contract (P2C) pool at 13% APY and will generate $2,450 in annual interest. A borrower posting $12,200 in AVAX at 70% LTV will unlock $8,400 in liquid funds without selling their holdings. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) will also thrive, with deals such as a TRUMP lender offering 25% APY on $3,300 for 25 days. Each of these transactions will create fees, and those fees will fuel the buyback-and-redistribute loop that strengthens MUTM. Presale Momentum and Roadmap Execution Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still in its presale Phase 6, priced at $0.035. Around $15.04 million has already been raised, more than 28% of supply has been sold, and over 15,800 holders are participating. The next step, Phase 7, will lift the token to $0.040, giving immediate upside for current participants. The token has a total supply of 4 billion and a planned listing price of $0.06. Security has been addressed early, with CertiK Token Scan scoring 95 and Skynet score reaching 78. The team has also rolled out a $50,000 bug bounty and a $100,000 giveaway campaign, while social growth has topped 12,000 followers on X. The roadmap is carefully staged in four phases. The first introduced presale, audits, and awareness campaigns. The second will focus on building the core contracts and app structure. The third will finalize with demos, testing, and security preparations. The fourth will deliver the live launch, expected exchange listings, and multi-chain expansion. A crucial milestone will come when the beta launches at the same time as the token listing, letting users borrow, mint, and stake immediately. Early protocol activity will generate revenue, which will power the first rounds of buybacks and MUTM rewards for stakers. Numbers Don’t Lie For investors, the numbers already tell a compelling story. A Phase 2 investor who shifted $7,500 from DOT into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $0.015 will hold a position now valued at $17,500 at Phase 6’s $0.035. That is before Phase 7 lifts the price to $0.040 and before the listing at $0.06. This type of performance demonstrates why MUTM will be ranked ahead of many other proposals by 2026. With its $1 stablecoin driving lending flows, mtToken staking expanding yield, and the buyback mechanism locking in recurring demand, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will bring real fundamentals to the table. Crypto predictions over the next two years will highlight how DOT and XRP move steadily upward, but the sharper gains will flow into tokens that can generate immediate value. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be at the front of that line. Phase 6 is already 28% sold, and the price will rise 15% at Phase 7. Investors who want exposure to a project with stablecoin utility, staking rewards, and a recycling revenue model will act now before the next increase.

Bonk price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. The coin’s value has decreased to $0.00002070 in the past 24 hours. At the same time, the cryptocurrency has lost up to 4.39 percent today. Technical indicators favor the bearishness of the market, and the price charts project a bearish market scenario for the day. Is Bonk a good investment? After its launch in December 2022, Bonk quickly gained traction. Being on the Solana blockchain, it triggered a surge in SOL’s price due to Bonk’s unique distribution strategy. Bonk is a meme coin, but it has many side projects that contribute to its usability and make it more valuable than a mere dog meme coin. It is expected that by 2031, Bonk will reach $0.000207, which is approximately 681% more than its current price, making it a good investment to consider. However, it is advised to do your own research and conduct expert opinion before investing in the highly volatile meme coin market. Why is Bonk down? Bonk lost a portion of its value over the last 24 hours. Today, its price decreased to $0.00002070. The overall bearish trend in the market moved Bonk’s price in a negative direction, resulting in the recent losses. Will Bonk reach $0.000055? Bonk’s strongest current resistance level is $0.00003541. Over the last few days, BONK saw intense selloff below this level. Bonk may not break above this level in the short term, but according to market speculation, it will reach $0.00005835 by the start of 2026. Will Bonk reach $0.0000700? Bonk price prediction suggests that the coin can reach $0.0000700 and surpass it by the end of 2026. When Bonk reaches this price level, its market capitalization will increase 4.5-fold. Will Bonk reach $1? According to the Bonk price prediction, Bonk may not achieve the $1 level in the foreseeable future. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $1, which seems impossible as of now. Does Bonk have a good long-term Future? Bonk has garnered much attention from investors with its community-driven value. However, analysts do not share the same sentiment and are divided in their views on the crypto pair. This is true to an extent, as after its initial surge, sustaining the momentum has proved a challenge for Bonk. According to The Cryptopolitan’s review of the meme coin, it is expected that Bonk will reach a maximum value of $0.000207 by the end of 2031, which is quite a bit above its current price.

In 2010, Bitcoin was worth a few cents. One year later, it hit $20. In six years, it was $17,000, and now it’s sitting at over $100K, after hitting an ATH of $123K in July. Historically, if you’d invested in Bitcoin at launch, you’d have an ROI of 188,643,000%. The likes of Mastercard, JP Morgan, and scores of S&P 500 companies are buying Bitcoin in droves. There’s never been anything like Bitcoin before, and investors are waking up to that reality. However, Bitcoin is getting old for modern standards. No dApps, no smart contracts, and almost non-existent DeFi scalability. It needs an upgrade. And that’s what Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is here to do with Layer-2 technology. Click to learn more about Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a crypto project planning to launch the fastest Layer-2 chain for Bitcoin. Its goal – to bring Bitcoin’s blockchain to modern standards. This means compatibility with dApps, smart contracts, and seamless DeFi programmability for developers. The L2 will run on a Canonical Bridge, combined with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), for native compatibility with Solana. You’ll be able to build token programs, LP logic, oracles, games, NFT infrastructure, DAOs, and much more. All without reinventing the wheel. To engage with the L2, you’ll deposit $BTC to a designated address monitored by the Canonical Bridge.

HOW TO BUY $HYPER Today’s Bitcoin Technical Analysis Unfortunately for Bitcoin and crypto enthusiasts, the OG crypto is flashing several signs of a potential bearish turn. Down more than 2.5% today, $BTC is pushing toward a close below the 100 EMA – a key support level it has respected for the past few months. Adding to the pressure, the short-term EMAs (10, 20, and 50) have lined up in bearish order: the 50 above the 20 and the 20 above the 10. To make matters worse, this alignment only formed recently, which is often a signal that a downside move may only just be getting started. That said, the higher timeframe (weekly) offers a glimmer of hope. Bitcoin is currently trading within the 0.5-0.618 Fibonacci retracement zone – the so-called golden pocket – which is historically where trend continuations often emerge after a pullback. It’s also worth noting that the U.S. PCE & Core PCE data are set to be published today at 8:30 AM ET. As the Fed’s preferred inflation metric, this release will be closely watched, so expect some volatility in the coming hours. US Government Puts Macro Data On-Chain August 29, 2025 • 10:00 UTC The US Department of Commerce has published six macroeconomic data on 10 blockchains yesterday with assistance from top oracles Pyth and Chainlink . The levels and annual percentage changes of the country’s Real GDP, PCE Price Index, and Real Final Sales to Private Domestic Purchasers are now accessible on various blockchains, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Having macroeconomic data on-chain can have a variety of use cases, like allowing traders to create strategies based on the latest available US inflation rate. This follows a trend of creating projects that build or improve upon the foundations of blockchain technology. An example is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , which aims to develop a Bitcoin Layer 2 to help make Bitcoin transactions faster and more cost-effective. Read our ‘What is Bitcoin Hyper’ page for more information. 21Shares Files S-1 for a SEI ETF to Compete with Canary Capital, Firing Up Bitcoin Hyper August 29, 2025 • 10:00 UTC 21Shares filed an S-1 form for a SEI ETF with the SEC, which puts it in direct competition with Canary Capital, which did the same back in April. The company announced the news publicly on X , stating that this is ‘a key milestone in our vision to expand exchange-traded access to the SEI Network.’ The chance for a favorable SEC decision is very high, according to Bloomberg analyst , James Seyffart, which predicts a 90% chance for a positive outcome.

50858974,https://timestabloid.com/?p=80715,1756461627,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Shiba Inu Price Set To Fall Over 20% In Weeks As Remittix Sees Thousands Of Cardano Holders Buy $RTX,https://timestabloid.com/shiba-inu-price-set-to-fall-over-20-in-weeks-as-remittix-sees/,"The market is showing early signs of a shift as Shiba Inu price struggles to recover from July’s highs. At about $0.000013, SHIB is down 18% from recent peaks and 27% below its yearly high, even after a remarkable 1,550% spike in token burns. Meanwhile, Cardano holders are increasingly exploring alternatives with stronger utility and adoption potential, notably Remittix (RTX) , hinting at a significant market rotation that could reshape investor portfolios in the coming months. Shiba Inu Price Faces Heightened Downside Risk The charts paint a grim picture for the Shiba Inu price. The token has dipped below its 50-day and 100-day moving averages, signalling weakening momentum. More importantly, a head-and-shoulders build is forming with the head that is located at $0.00001760 and shoulders that stand at $0.000016. Analysts caution that falling below the neckline at $ 0.00001027 may lead to a fall to a level of $0.000009, which means that the downside will be more than 20% from current levels. The traditional market mechanism of burning tokens, which typically helps reduce supply and support price, seems ineffective here and investors are better served moving to top Defi coins like Remittix . Cardano Faces Short-Term Consolidation With Strategic Withdrawals Large investors have recently withdrawn over $170 million worth of ADA from exchanges like Coinbase, Upbit, and Binance. While this signals bullish intent and a potential supply squeeze, Cardano is currently trading at $0.8697, showing consolidation between $0.8465 and $0.8752. Technical analysis presents a neutral picture: RSI at 49, ADA trading below the midline of Bollinger Bands, and resistance around $0.896. Short positions clustered near $0.99 also create a potential short-squeeze scenario, though a dip toward $0.75 support is possible before any significant upward movement. Why Remittix Is Capturing The Attention Of Cardano Holders Remittix ($RTX) is currently priced at $0.0987, having raised $21.9 million and sold over 625 million tokens. Thousands of former Cardano holders have begun shifting capital toward RTX, attracted by its growing ecosystem and scalable infrastructure. Key Factors Driving Remittix Momentum Targeted Adoption: Real-world payment solutions increase utility and transactional volume. Strategic Investor Inflows: Cardano holders seeking yield and lower volatility are moving to RTX .

According to a regulatory filing , Cayman Islands-based Bitcoin Infrastructure Acquisition Corp Ltd will offer 20 million shares at $10 each and then search for a private company to merge with and take public. Experienced Crypto Team The company’s leaders bring long ties to bitcoin and crypto firms. Ryan Gentry, named CEO, spent five years leading business development at Lightning Labs. He also worked as a lead analyst at Multicoin Capital. James DeAngelis was picked as finance chief; he has run finance teams at Kroll, a firm involved in several crypto bankruptcy cases. Vikas Mittal, a director, is the chief investment officer at Meteora Capital, the sponsor behind this IPO and a backer of the 2023 SPAC that took Bitcoin Depot public. According To The Filing, Focus Will Be On Infrastructure Bitcoin Infrastructure says it will look for targets involved in wallets, custody, exchanges, lending protocols and tokenized financial instruments, as well as applications such as payments, DeFi and cross-border finance. The filing frames the SPAC as a vehicle to bring infrastructure-style businesses into public markets rather than speculative consumer tokens. Market Appetite For Crypto IPOs Wall Street money has already flowed into crypto companies that went public this year, and SPACs are part of that push. Bullish and Circle Internet Group are two recent public debuts tied to crypto. In just two days, two crypto-focused SPACs raised a combined $575 million: CSLM Digital Asset Acquisition Corp III closed a $230 million IPO and M3-Brigade Acquisition VI Corp closed $345 million. A prior M3-Brigade SPAC took ReserveOne public in July. These moves show there is still capital available for firms that promise a path to public markets. Baggage And Risks Remain There are reasons for caution. Kroll, where DeAngelis worked with finance teams, faces a lawsuit over a data breach that touched creditors of FTX, BlockFi and Genesis. The SPAC itself has not named a target yet. That leaves investors buying into a plan without a clear deal on the table. Blank-check companies have been criticized for raising large sums and then racing to find a suitable merger, which can lead to rushed decisions.

How Undervalued Is Bitcoin? The bank’s cross-asset team says six-month BTC volatility has fallen from nearly 60% at the start of 2025 to roughly 30%—a series low—and that Bitcoin is now only about twice as volatile as gold, the narrowest gap on record. On the bank’s volatility-adjusted framework, that compression implies Bitcoin’s market value would need to rise about 13%—translating to roughly $126,000 per coin—to align with the roughly $5 trillion private investment market in gold, leaving BTC “undervalued by around $16,000” on this basis. Related Reading: Bitcoin And The September Curse: Can This Time Be Different? The framing matters. JPMorgan is not saying Bitcoin should be as large as the entire gold complex—jewelry, central-bank reserves and industrial uses included—but rather that on a risk-adjusted basis, given how much less volatile BTC has become relative to bullion, Bitcoin’s capitalization can justify a higher level than where it trades today if one benchmarks against gold’s private-investment slice of the market. The headline takeaway—“Bitcoin undervalued vs. gold as volatility falls”—was amplified by market-moving account Walter Bloomberg on X, underscoring the point that the valuation gap is a function of volatility as much as price. The bank’s analysts, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, attribute part of the volatility collapse to an evolving holder base and market structure. They point to accelerating accumulation by corporate treasuries—which they estimate now hold more than 6% of circulating supply—and to index-related dynamics that are drawing passive capital into equities tied to Bitcoin exposure, both of which dampen day-to-day swings. The cause-and-effect is straightforward in their telling: a larger, more stable base of “sticky” holders lowers realized volatility, which in turn raises fair value on a volatility-normalized, gold-relative model. Gold Parity And Beyond The claim also drew a pointed reaction from industry commentators. “It’s only a matter of time until Bitcoin reaches parity with gold,” argued Joe Consorti, head of growth at Theya, calling JPMorgan’s note “a big admission.” Related Reading: Bitcoin & Ethereum Whale Populations Quietly Growing, On-Chain Data Reveals In his view, the longer-run destination is not parity on a risk-adjusted model but outright dominance: “At today’s market capitalization, Bitcoin would trade at $1.17 million per coin if it were equal to the size of gold.” He extends the thought experiment into a timeline, contending that if Bitcoin and gold simply maintain their five-year compound growth rates, parity arrives in the early 2030s. “If Bitcoin and gold simply keep growing at their current five-year compound annual growth rates, parity arrives in late 2031. That would mean a $53 trillion market cap for Bitcoin and a price north of $2.5 million per coin. Even under more conservative assumptions, the convergence still happens in the early 2030s. Because it’s not just about Bitcoin’s growth, it’s also about gold losing market share,” the analyst argues. JPMorgan just admitted bitcoin at $112k is undervalued versus gold. Bitcoin would be $1.17M if it was the size of gold today. When will bitcoin reach gold parity, and how much will it be worth?

In his remarks, Garlinghouse describes the current cryptocurrency market size of approximately $2.5 trillion, expressing confidence in its long-term expansion. He suggested that a tenfold increase in market value over the next five to ten years, which is $25 trillion, appeared realistic and described such growth as a conservative estimate. He also acknowledged the possibility of much larger gains, noting that while a one-hundred-fold rise might seem ambitious, it could not be dismissed. Garlinghouse further addressed the risks facing traditional currencies, using Argentina as an example of a country where the national currency has repeatedly collapsed in value. He argued that people in developed economies, particularly in the United States, often underestimate the likelihood of similar macroeconomic pressures over time. His comments framed digital assets as a potential safeguard in a world where fiat currencies remain vulnerable to devaluation and long-term instability. #XRP WAS ALWAYS DESIGNED TO TRANSFER ALL BANK TRANSACTIONS AT A STABLE PRICE BETWEEN 4-5 DIGITS. #RIPPLE IS SO CLOSE TO BECOME A WORLD BANK pic.twitter.com/kGAyBsgbxg — Lord XRP (@Bitforcoinz) August 28, 2025 Expert’s Comment Commenting on the post, Lord XRP asserted that “XRP was always designed to transfer all bank transactions at a stable price between 4-5 digits,” further suggesting that Ripple is on the verge of positioning itself as a “world bank.” The claim reflects an ambitious interpretation of both the technical framework behind XRP and Ripple’s growing influence in the financial sector. By referring to XRP’s potential valuation in the range of four to five digits, Lord XRP suggested that the asset was built for high-value global settlement use , particularly in the banking sector. The statement also framed Ripple’s progression as extending beyond a technology provider for cross-border payments to potentially becoming a central player in international finance. While such views remain speculative, they align with long-standing discussions within the XRP community about the scale of the network’s capacity and its suitability for global financial infrastructure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Interpretation of Market Signals Lord XRP’s comments, combined with Garlinghouse’s perspective, emphasize two key narratives that are frequently discussed in relation to XRP. The first is the claim that XRP was designed with a global role in mind , capable of handling banking-level transactions with efficiency and scalability. The second is Garlinghouse’s framing of digital assets as a safeguard in an uncertain global financial system, where traditional currencies face ongoing risks of devaluation. While Garlinghouse did not specifically mention XRP reaching a particular valuation, his outlook on overall market expansion provides context for the ambitious claims made by XRP supporters such as Lord XRP. The alignment between the community’s vision of XRP’s design and Ripple’s public statements on long-term growth has continued to reinforce speculation about the asset’s potential place in future financial markets. Lord XRP’s assertion that XRP was always designed to transfer all bank transactions at a value in the four-to-five-digit range reflects a bold interpretation of the token’s utility. His further claim that Ripple is close to becoming a “world bank” underscores the growing sentiment among parts of the XRP community that the company could play a central role in reshaping global finance. Brad Garlinghouse’s remarks in the interview supported the idea of significant market growth for digital assets and drew attention to the vulnerabilities of fiat currencies under macroeconomic pressures. Together, these perspectives add to the ongoing conversation around XRP’s position in the evolving landscape of global payments and digital finance.

While digital assets often carve their own path, they are not immune to the gravitational pull of traditional markets. Today, all eyes are on the US Dollar’s strength as a pivotal economic indicator looms large: the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation report. This crucial data release has the power to reshape market sentiment, influencing everything from global currencies to your crypto portfolio. Let’s delve into what’s at stake and how the dollar’s performance could signal significant shifts. What’s Driving US Dollar Strength Amidst Uncertainty? The US Dollar strength has been a persistent theme in recent times, often acting as a safe haven during periods of global economic uncertainty. However, its trajectory is rarely straightforward. Ahead of the critical PCE inflation report, the dollar has shown a modest upward trend, reflecting cautious optimism or perhaps simply a flight to quality as investors brace for new data. This short-term resilience, however, is juxtaposed against a broader market expectation of a potential monthly decline, signaling a complex interplay of forces at play. Several factors contribute to the dollar’s current stance: Interest Rate Differentials: The Federal Reserve’s relatively higher interest rates compared to other major central banks continue to make dollar-denominated assets attractive. Global Economic Slowdown: Concerns over economic growth in Europe and China often push investors towards the perceived safety of the US dollar. Market Positioning: Traders adjusting their positions ahead of major economic announcements can create short-term volatility and upward pressure. Yet, the underlying narrative suggests a potential weakening. The market has largely priced in future rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, which could erode the dollar’s yield advantage. The upcoming PCE data will be instrumental in confirming or challenging these expectations, directly impacting the dollar’s medium-term outlook. Decoding the PCE Inflation Report: Why It Matters to the Federal Reserve At the heart of the current market anticipation is the PCE inflation report . Unlike the more commonly cited Consumer Price Index (CPI), the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index is the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation. This preference stems from several key characteristics: Broader Coverage: PCE covers a wider range of goods and services than CPI. Adaptive Weighting: PCE adjusts for changes in consumer behavior, reflecting when consumers substitute cheaper alternatives for more expensive items. This makes it a more accurate gauge of actual spending patterns. Inclusion of Employer-Sponsored Healthcare: PCE includes costs paid by employers on behalf of employees, offering a more comprehensive view of economic activity. The core PCE, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, is particularly scrutinized as it provides a clearer picture of underlying inflationary pressures. A higher-than-expected PCE reading could signal persistent inflation, potentially pushing the Federal Reserve to maintain a tighter monetary policy for longer. Conversely, a softer reading might bolster arguments for earlier rate cuts, significantly impacting the US Dollar strength and global markets. Here’s a quick comparison between CPI and PCE: Feature Consumer Price Index (CPI) Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Scope Household spending on goods and services Broader, includes non-profit institutions and employer-sponsored healthcare Weighting Fixed basket of goods and services Dynamically adjusts for consumer substitution Source Survey of households Survey of businesses How Does the PCE Inflation Report Influence Federal Reserve Policy? The Federal Reserve policy framework places immense emphasis on the PCE inflation report. As the central bank’s primary gauge for price stability, the PCE data directly informs their decisions regarding interest rates and quantitative easing/tightening. The Fed has a dual mandate: to achieve maximum employment and maintain price stability (typically targeting 2% inflation). When inflation deviates significantly from this target, the Fed adjusts its monetary policy tools. A higher-than-expected PCE figure would suggest that inflation is proving more stubborn than anticipated. This scenario could lead the Federal Reserve to: Maintain Current Rates: Keep the federal funds rate at its elevated level for a longer duration, extending the “higher for longer” narrative. Delay Rate Cuts: Postpone any planned rate cuts, which are currently priced into market expectations for later in the year. Signal Future Tightening: In an extreme case, if inflation were to re-accelerate, the Fed might even hint at further rate hikes, though this is a less likely scenario given current trends. Conversely, a PCE report showing inflation cooling faster than expected would provide the Fed with greater flexibility to consider rate cuts sooner. Such a move would be aimed at preventing an economic slowdown and supporting growth. Traders and investors meticulously analyze every nuance of the PCE report, as it offers a direct window into the future direction of US monetary policy, significantly impacting the Forex market analysis and beyond. Navigating the Forex Market Analysis: What Does PCE Mean for Currency Pairs? For participants in the Forex market analysis , the PCE inflation report is a seismic event. The dollar’s reaction to this data will dictate the movement of major currency pairs globally. A stronger dollar, driven by hawkish Fed expectations, typically sees the USD gain against other currencies, while a weaker dollar suggests the opposite. Consider these potential scenarios and their implications for key currency pairs: PCE Higher Than Expected (Hawkish Outcome): Impact on USD: Stronger, as higher inflation could mean delayed Fed rate cuts or even a hawkish surprise. EUR/USD: Likely to fall, as the Euro weakens against a stronger dollar. USD/JPY: Likely to rise, as the dollar strengthens against the Japanese Yen, which typically benefits from a dovish Fed. GBP/USD: Likely to fall. PCE Lower Than Expected (Dovish Outcome): Impact on USD: Weaker, as lower inflation strengthens the case for earlier Fed rate cuts. EUR/USD: Likely to rise, as the Euro gains against a weaker dollar. USD/JPY: Likely to fall, as the Yen strengthens against a weaker dollar. GBP/USD: Likely to rise. Traders will be scrutinizing not just the headline PCE number but also the core PCE, month-over-month, and year-over-year figures. Divergences from consensus forecasts will trigger immediate market reactions. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for anyone involved in currency trading, providing valuable context for their strategies and risk management. Broader Economic Data Impact: Ripple Effects on Global Markets and Crypto The ripple effects of the PCE inflation report extend far beyond the Forex market, influencing the broader economic data impact on global financial markets, including the volatile cryptocurrency space. When the US dollar strengthens due to hawkish Fed expectations, it can create headwinds for riskier assets. This is because a stronger dollar often implies tighter global financial conditions, making it more expensive for international borrowers to repay dollar-denominated debt and reducing liquidity. Here’s how the PCE outcome can influence other markets: Cryptocurrencies: A stronger dollar and higher interest rates can reduce investor appetite for speculative assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. Investors might shift capital from crypto to less risky, yield-bearing traditional assets. Conversely, a weaker dollar and the prospect of rate cuts could inject liquidity and boost crypto valuations. Commodities: Gold, often seen as an inflation hedge or safe haven, typically has an inverse relationship with the dollar. A stronger dollar can depress gold prices, while a weaker dollar can support them. Oil prices can also be affected, as a stronger dollar makes oil more expensive for non-dollar holders, potentially dampening demand. Equity Markets: US equity markets can react to PCE data based on its implications for corporate earnings and economic growth. Persistent high inflation or aggressive Fed tightening can weigh on stock valuations, especially growth stocks. The interconnectedness of these markets means that the PCE report is not just a US statistic; it’s a global market driver. Investors across all asset classes, including crypto, must pay close attention to this key economic release to anticipate shifts in market sentiment and adjust their portfolios accordingly. The challenge lies in accurately predicting market reactions and managing the inherent volatility that follows such significant data releases. As the market braces for the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation report, the future trajectory of the US Dollar strength hangs in the balance. This pivotal economic indicator is not merely a number; it’s a crucial determinant for Federal Reserve policy , directly influencing interest rates and, by extension, global capital flows. Our Forex market analysis shows that whether the PCE inflation report comes in higher or lower than expected, its economic data impact will reverberate across currency pairs, commodity markets, and even the cryptocurrency ecosystem. For investors, staying informed and adapting strategies based on these macro shifts is paramount to navigating the complex financial landscape. The coming report will undoubtedly provide a clearer picture of the inflation outlook and the Fed’s next steps, offering both challenges and opportunities for vigilant market participants.

Understanding these movements is crucial for investors seeking to make informed decisions. Recently, a significant piece of economic news emerged from Central Europe: Poland inflation recorded an astonishing drop, with the August inflation rate edging lower to 2.8%. This development is not just a local story; it carries profound implications for the European economic outlook , future central bank policy , and how global investors interpret key economic indicators . What Does Poland’s Astonishing Drop in Inflation Mean? The news that Poland’s consumer price index (CPI) inflation fell to 2.8% in August, year-on-year, has caught many analysts by surprise. This figure represents a substantial decrease from previous months and positions Poland as one of the few European nations experiencing such a rapid deceleration in price growth. For context, July’s inflation rate stood at 10.8%, highlighting the dramatic nature of this recent decline. Such a sharp drop suggests that the aggressive monetary tightening measures implemented by the National Bank of Poland (NBP) may finally be bearing fruit, or that other underlying economic factors are at play. For everyday Poles, this could translate to a much-needed reprieve from rising living costs, potentially boosting consumer confidence and spending. For investors, it signals a potential shift in the economic landscape, which could influence currency valuations, bond yields, and even the attractiveness of Polish assets. Decoding the August Inflation Rate: What’s Behind the Numbers? To truly understand the significance of the August inflation rate , we need to look beyond the headline figure. Inflation is a complex phenomenon driven by various components, and a sudden drop can be attributed to several factors: Base Effects: A common driver of sharp drops in year-on-year inflation figures is what economists call ‘base effects’. If inflation was exceptionally high in August of the previous year, then even a moderate increase this year can appear as a significant drop when compared to that high base. Energy Prices: Global energy prices, particularly for oil and natural gas, have a substantial impact on inflation. A decline in these prices, or a stabilization after previous spikes, can quickly bring down overall inflation figures. Food Prices: Similarly, food prices, which constitute a significant portion of household budgets, can fluctuate based on agricultural yields, supply chain efficiencies, and global commodity markets. Government Interventions: Sometimes, government policies, such as subsidies on energy or food, or temporary tax cuts, can artificially suppress inflation figures. Poland has previously implemented such measures, and their continued effect could be a factor. Weakening Demand: Persistent high interest rates can cool consumer demand, leading businesses to slow down price increases or even offer discounts to attract buyers. This demand-side cooling contributes to lower inflation. While the exact breakdown for Poland’s August figures requires deeper statistical analysis, it is likely a combination of these elements. The market will be keenly watching for detailed reports from the NBP to ascertain the sustainability of this trend. Key Inflation Components (Illustrative Example) To give a clearer picture, here’s an illustrative breakdown of how different components might have contributed to the overall August inflation rate drop: Component July YoY Change (%) August YoY Change (%) Contribution to Drop Overall CPI 10.8% 2.8% Significant Energy 8.5% -2.0% High Food & Non-alcoholic Beverages 15.6% 7.0% Moderate Core Inflation (Excluding Food & Energy) 9.0% 7.5% Low Note: These figures are illustrative and serve to demonstrate how different categories might influence the overall inflation rate. Actual data would be released by official statistical offices. How Will This Impact Central Bank Policy in Poland and Beyond? The National Bank of Poland (NBP) has been proactive in combating inflation, raising its benchmark interest rate significantly over the past couple of years. A dramatic fall in Poland inflation to 2.8% provides the NBP with considerable room for maneuver. This could lead to: Interest Rate Cuts: With inflation nearing the NBP’s target range (which is 2.5% +/- 1 percentage point), the central bank might consider cutting interest rates sooner than expected. This would be a dovish pivot, potentially stimulating economic growth by making borrowing cheaper for businesses and consumers. Strengthening Currency: Paradoxically, initial rate cut expectations might weaken the Polish Zloty (PLN) in the short term. However, a stable and predictable inflation environment can attract foreign investment in the long run, strengthening the currency. Policy Divergence: This move could set Poland apart from other major central banks in the Eurozone and the US, which are still grappling with stubbornly high inflation and are either holding rates steady or considering further hikes. Such divergence can create arbitrage opportunities for forex traders. The NBP’s next meeting will be closely watched. Any indication of a shift towards easing monetary policy would send clear signals to markets, affecting not only local assets but also potentially influencing sentiment across the broader European financial landscape. Understanding the Broader European Economic Outlook Poland’s economic performance is an integral part of the larger European economic outlook . While not a Eurozone member, its strong trade ties and geographical proximity mean that its economic health impacts its neighbors and the wider continent. A significant drop in Polish inflation has several implications for Europe: Positive Spillover: If Poland manages to tame inflation without triggering a deep recession, it could serve as a positive example for other European economies still struggling with price stability. This could boost overall confidence in the region’s ability to navigate current economic challenges. Investment Flows: A more stable economic environment in Poland, characterized by lower inflation and potentially lower interest rates, could make it an attractive destination for foreign direct investment (FDI) and portfolio investment. This can benefit not just Poland but also European businesses that trade with or invest in the country. Challenges for the ECB: The European Central Bank (ECB) is still battling elevated inflation within the Eurozone. Poland’s success might put pressure on the ECB to re-evaluate its own strategies, especially if disinflationary trends start to spread more broadly across the continent. However, the diverse economic structures within the Eurozone mean a direct comparison is not always straightforward. For global investors, including those in the crypto space, understanding these macro trends is vital. A stronger, more stable European economy, even outside the Eurozone, contributes to overall global economic health, which can indirectly influence risk appetite and investment in digital assets. Key Economic Indicators to Monitor for Future Trends While the August inflation rate is a crucial data point, it is just one piece of the economic puzzle. Investors and analysts must continue to monitor a range of economic indicators to gauge the sustainability of this disinflationary trend and its broader impact. Here are some key indicators to watch: Core Inflation: This metric excludes volatile items like food and energy, providing a clearer picture of underlying price pressures. If core inflation remains high, the overall drop might be temporary. GDP Growth: How the economy is growing (or contracting) will indicate whether disinflation is occurring alongside healthy growth or due to a slowdown. A ‘soft landing’ is the ideal scenario. Unemployment Rate: A tight labor market can push wages up, which can fuel inflation. Monitoring unemployment will show if the labor market is cooling or overheating. Retail Sales and Consumer Confidence: These indicators provide insights into consumer spending behavior, a major driver of economic activity. Manufacturing PMIs: Purchasing Managers’ Indexes for manufacturing and services sectors offer a forward-looking view of economic activity and business sentiment. Wage Growth: Sustained high wage growth can lead to a wage-price spiral, making it harder to bring down inflation permanently. By keeping an eye on these indicators, market participants can better anticipate future moves by the NBP and assess the true health of the Polish economy, informing their investment strategies across various markets, including the often-reactive crypto market. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor What does this mean for you, the astute investor? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Diversified: While specific country data is important, maintaining a diversified portfolio across different asset classes and geographies remains paramount. Monitor Central Bank Communications: Pay close attention to official statements from the NBP. Their forward guidance on interest rates will be a major market mover. Consider Forex Implications: If the NBP cuts rates, the Polish Zloty (PLN) could see volatility. Forex traders might look for opportunities in PLN pairs. Global Macro View: Connect Poland’s situation to the broader global economic narrative. How does this disinflationary trend compare with inflation in the US, Eurozone, or UK? This comparative analysis helps in understanding global capital flows. Crypto Market Sensitivity: Remember that the crypto market often reacts to macro news. A more stable global economic environment, signaled by easing inflation, can sometimes foster greater risk appetite, which might benefit digital assets. Conversely, uncertainty can lead to a flight to safety. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Hope for Economic Stability The dramatic fall in Poland inflation to 2.8% in August is a significant economic event, offering a glimmer of hope for greater price stability in the region. It suggests that, at least in Poland, the tide may be turning against the inflationary pressures that have gripped economies worldwide. While the full implications will unfold over time, this data point profoundly impacts expectations for central bank policy , shapes the evolving European economic outlook , and provides critical insights through various economic indicators for global investors. As we move forward, the focus will shift from the headline number to the underlying drivers and the sustainability of this disinflationary trend. The ability of Poland to maintain this trajectory will be a key determinant of its economic health and its role within the broader European and global financial system. For those navigating the complexities of modern markets, including the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, understanding these fundamental shifts is not just beneficial, but essential.

Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) Growth Outshines Ripple’s (XRP) 2025 Forecasts,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/whats-the-best-crypto-to-buy-right-now-mutuum-finances-mutm-growth-outshines-ripples-xrp-2025-forecasts/,"As the crypto market starts a shape-defining trend in 2025, attention has turned to up-and-coming coins leading a decentralized finance (DeFi) revolution. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been showing strong growth in presale to become one of the most talked-about DeFi platforms. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now standing at $0.035 in presale stage 6. Investors in the project are estimated to earn a minimum return on investment of 400% once MUTM goes live. Mutuum Finance has already passed over $15.1 million and more than 15800 token buyers. As (XRP) maintains steady predictions for the year, Mutuum Finance boom and investor sentiment is generating ripples. Whereas regulatory shifts and market fluctuations inform portfolio strategy, Mutuum Finance might be establishing a new paradigm in adoption and innovation in 2025. XRP 2025 Forecast: What Experts Say XRP is at $2.99, slightly higher as it finds support at $2.90. Experts are watching closely: should XRP manage to breach resistance levels of around $3.11–$3.40, ETF momentum-driven positive narratives, institutional buying, and increasing stablecoin infrastructure would see it to around $5 by the end of the year. More cautious models are looking at a 2025 range of between $1.81 and $4.10, and even further-distant bulls eyeing as much as $5.50 if momentum keeps up. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Stage 6 Success Mutuum Finance (MUTM) 2025 presale has been a record-breaking success, one of the milestones of the project in shaping the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. The token is now at Stage 6 at a price of $0.035 and reflects higher investor anticipation as well as stronger market anticipation. Mutuum Finance will create the decentralized finance future on the template of a next-generation platform, long-term growth, and next-generation retail and institutional consumer solutions. The presale alone has already onboarded over 15,800 token holders and over $15.1 million worth of value of capital, setting the project up for a robust launch and widespread adoption. Through its ambitious agenda, cutting-edge smart contract platform, security and scalability focus, Mutuum Finance is setting itself up for a DeFi revolution in 2025 and beyond. $100K Worth of Tokens to Be Won Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also holds a $100,000 giveaway . 10 participants are set to bag a $10,000 MUTM reward. The giveaway is evidence that the project is serious about a long-term and a dedicated community. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also launched an Official Bug Bounty Program in collaboration with CertiK. The project team invites the participants with a promise of providing up to $50,000 USDT as a bounty for finding bugs in the project. The objective of the bounty program is to identify the probable weaknesses of the project. Four types of weaknesses are analyzed in the program to rank them on the basis of their severity, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low. Dual Lending Model Mutuum Finance is based on a two-lending model whereby customers are given unprecedented convenience by Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). In the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model, lending pools have access to smart contracts, which can be programmed to determine whether or not they will dynamically shift interest rates as a function of how the market conditions trend. Fixed incomes are provided by lenders while borrowers are insured upon accessing loans. The P2P model does not involve middlemen to create a direct relationship between lending and borrowing parties. Any asset with price-risky demands such a purely decentralized model under full control of users. While XRP is experiencing little movement and projections limited to $5, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is causing serious ripples with over $15.1 million raised, 15,800 subscribers on the list, and phase 6 advancing at $0.035. Powered with a solid DeFi strategy, CertiK-managed security upgrades, and a presale ROI potential of 400%, it’s already one of the hottest new entrants of 2025. Place your stake on phase 6 before the next price spike freezes higher entry prices.

The result coincided with a new all-time high for ETH and further expectations of scaling the $5,000 hurdle for the first time. Ethereum activity returned to levels not seen since 2021, showing the combination of value growth and on-chain transfers. The recent ETH rally also showed that the L1 was good enough for large-scale DeFi, with no serious gas spikes or congestion. Ethereum on-chain value reached the highest levels in 2025, with over 9.2M in monthly active users. | Source: The Block Data Adoption for DeFi and stablecoin usage remains near peak levels. Monthly active addresses for ETH expanded to 9.7M , with regular daily spikes to over 830K daily active users. Ethereum monthly transactions and volumes reach 2025 peak Ethereum monthly transactions reached over 46.9M transfers as of August 29, breaking the peak from May 2021 at 45.06M transfers. Based on those transaction levels, the Ethereum network moved over $14B on a weekly basis, returning to liquidity not seen since the summer of 2021. On-chain volumes also reached the highest level for 2025 in the past month. ETH is still facing disparate price pressures. Reports have shown whales are still buying significant amounts of ETH after the recent small dip. Ethereum whale just bought $80,370,000 $ETH . Buy the dip opportunities incoming. pic.twitter.com/PGxco1CwWr — Ted (@TedPillows) August 29, 2025 At the same time, Wintermute has accumulated ETH with the potential to sell, and Binance has also placed millions of ETH orders within minutes. Based on recent reports, the market absorbed up to $400M in ETH for the past few hours. ETH may also see additional downside, as most of the liquidity is deployed below current prices. Large-scale whale selling may lead to additional liquidations, erasing some of the net gains for August. The rise in activity is seen as a sign of retail returning. In the past quarters, retail had almost abandoned ETH, while whales continued to accumulate. Now, Ethereum activity shows a shift in sentiment, with users returning to the most active apps. Based on gas usage, the Ethereum network carries simple ETH transfers, with USDT and USDC also in the top 3 smart contracts. As a whole, smart contract creation expanded for Ethereum in 2025, again recovering to activity levels of 2021. This time around, the smart contracts were tied to DeFi, and not to NFT or the launch of meme tokens. Ethereum activity boosts ETH market price As ETH showed robust results, the price stabilized around $4,350.16, based on robust inflows. ETH recovered above 0.040 BTC, retaining its momentum while BTC showed weakness. Based on the monthly performance to date, ETH is on track to end August with a net gain for the first time in three years. For the month to date, ETH gained over 17%, despite short-term volatility and corrections. ETH is also showing signs of ongoing whale accumulation, with a mix of selling at the peak and re-buying at lower prices. ETH also has an ongoing interest in ETF buying for the whole of 2025, as Cryptopolitan previously reported . The Ethereum chain has now evolved to carry a different type of traffic, mostly removing NFT and play-to-earn games. Ethereum also showed that the network was not cannibalized by L2 chains or abandoned for cheaper L1 networks like Solana and BNB Chain. The only thing that kept users away was the lack of liquidity and DeFi opportunities. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Binance has recently also temporarily paused USDC withdrawals on multiple networks during a wallet upgrade. The Latest Issue Earlier today, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange informed its users about a problem affecting Futures UM trading on the platform. To cope with that, the company temporarily suspended all futures trading services. “Our team is working to resolve this as soon as possible. New updates will be shared here. Thank you for your patience ,” the team said. Numerous X users praised the disclosure, but others expressed their frustration with the news. Some went even further, labeling Binance as the next FTX (the former crypto giant that collapsed in 2022 due to allegations of customer fund misuse and liquidity mismanagement). The outage, though, lasted less than an hour, with the firm announcing : “The issue affecting Futures UM trading on Binance has been resolved. All futures trading is now fully operational. Thank you for your patience and support!” Futures UM on Binance refers to contracts where traders use stablecoins as margin, while profits are also paid in the form of USDT or other similar tokens. The contracts can be perpetual (with no expiry date) or delivery ones. Other Temporary Disruptions as of Late Several weeks ago, Binance performed a wallet maintenance for USDC withdrawals via Ethereum (ETH), Polygon (POL), Arbitrum (ARB), Base (BASE), and Optimism (OP). To support the smooth implementation of the procedure, it briefly halted USDC withdrawals through those networks and later restored the services. Prior to that, the exchange paused all deposits and withdrawals due to a live upgrade on its wallet network infrastructure. System improvements are vital for the exchange, as they optimize the user experience, enhance security, and contribute to the overall health of the ecosystem. Usually , disruptions during such maintenance efforts last from mere minutes to a few hours.

Offshore exchanges no longer face dual registration confusion. Binance.US and others can expand under new FBOT guidance. CFTC Clarifies Rules for Foreign Crypto Trading The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has issued guidance regarding foreign boards of trade (FBOTs), clarifying that these platforms may serve U.S. clients provided they are registered. This update aims to provide long-awaited regulatory clarity for offshore crypto exchanges and U.S. investors. Since the 1990s, U.S. investors have been permitted to trade on foreign exchanges under the FBOT registry, which applies to all asset classes, including cryptocurrency. “Today’s FBOT guidance provides the regulatory clarity needed to legalize onshore trading activity that was driven out of the United States by the unprecedented enforcement approach of recent years,” said Acting CFTC Chair Caroline Pham. Returning to the U.S. Market The previous administration’s regulatory approach forced many U.S. companies to move operations abroad. Now, these companies can return by restructuring and registering as FBOTs. This new guidance also opens the U.S. market to offshore crypto exchanges. For example, Binance cannot serve U.S. users directly but does so through Binance.US. With the updated rules, more platforms may establish compliant operations in the U.S. Simplifying Compliance for Exchanges Previously, offshore exchanges faced confusion over whether they had to register not only as FBOTs but also as designated contract markets (DCMs). The CFTC’s latest guidance clarifies that a foreign crypto exchange needs only to register as an FBOT to operate legally in the U.S. market. In 2023, the CFTC charged Binance and its former CEO, Changpeng Zhao, for promoting cryptocurrency derivatives to U.S. clients without registering as a DCM. The clarification now reduces such regulatory uncertainty and encourages responsible market participation. Part of a Global Initiative: Crypto Sprint The current guidance is part of the CFTC’s Crypto Sprint, a global initiative to shape the regulatory framework for crypto assets. By providing clear rules, the Commission hopes to encourage offshore platforms to operate safely while giving U.S. investors access to global crypto markets. With this move, the CFTC is signaling a more balanced approach to regulation, supporting innovation while protecting investors.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-29 11:43:58

While this rally has captured attention, market experts consistently caution that Solana and Chainlink could deliver stronger returns this quarter due to network upgrades, institutional flows, and real-world adoption milestones. Alongside these two established leaders, analysts are also pointing towards the safe and audited MAGACOIN FINANCE as a standout presale altcoin for 2025, with early buyers positioning for outsized upside. BNB: Highs, But Facing Competition BNB continues to benefit from its role as the utility token of Binance’s exchange ecosystem. Price momentum has been resilient, with support holding around $816–$835 and upside resistance expected near $900–$1,000. Technical scenarios suggest that a short-term breakout is possible if ETF speculation gains traction, potentially driving average September prices toward $890. Still, analysts note that BNB’s growth ceiling appears lower than peers with stronger innovation pipelines. Without fresh catalysts beyond exchange demand and ETF speculation, BNB may remain in a sideways accumulation pattern, consolidating gains while investors rotate toward altcoins with more dynamic growth narratives. Solana: Technical Innovation and Institutional Adoption Solana has been described as a dominant force in the third quarter of 2025, thanks to a string of upgrades that continue to separate it from competitors. The Alpenglow proposal, bringing settlement speeds of 100–150 milliseconds and throughput of over 4,000 transactions per second, has made the network an attractive option for DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise settlement. Price forecasts for Solana remain wide-ranging, with bearish targets near $130–$150 and bullish scenarios climbing toward $520–$750 by the end of the year. Much of this optimism is rooted in the steady rise of institutional adoption, especially after the approval of Solana-linked ETFs and regulatory clarity around stablecoin issuance. Analysts highlight Solana’s combination of scalability, developer activity, and low transaction costs as reasons it remains one of the top altcoin picks of the quarter. Chainlink: Bullish Breakout and Ecosystem Partnerships Chainlink is also gaining momentum, with analysts pointing to a potential 60% rally in the months ahead. Price targets for Q3 sit between $26.46 and $32, with extended rallies possibly driving LINK toward the $35–$50 range. The bullish thesis centers on Chainlink’s evolving role as the backbone of decentralized finance. Recent upgrades to its Data Streams, enhanced cross-chain interoperability, and partnerships with institutional players have strengthened its positioning. Meanwhile, treasury accumulation has reduced circulating supply, providing an added layer of bullish momentum. For many, Chainlink remains not just an altcoin trade, but an essential piece of infrastructure for the future of decentralized markets. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale Contender for 2025 While Solana and Chainlink are being tipped as outperformers this quarter, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly building its case as the best altcoin to buy for 2025. Analysts highlight its growing presale base and completed audits as critical signals of long-term viability, with forecasts suggesting it could deliver stronger percentage gains than larger-cap tokens. Momentum has been building steadily as early buyers secure allocations using the PATRIOT50X code, which still unlocks a 50% presale bonus. Traders who previously focused on BNB and Solana are beginning to diversify into MAGACOIN, seeing it as a chance to replicate the type of exponential upside that smaller-cap tokens can achieve in early cycles. More than just another presale, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being positioned by market watchers as a strategic play — one that combines strong community traction with an early-mover advantage. As Solana and Chainlink strengthen their fundamentals, MAGACOIN’s appeal lies in its ability to multiply returns for those entering at this stage of the market. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is a Trusted Crypto to Buy for 2025 Growth Investors searching for a trusted early-stage project have found a strong contender in MAGACOIN FINANCE, widely ranked among the best cryptos to buy in 2025. Its smart contract passed auditing standards, and the public team has completed full KYC verification. Combined with growing community traction, these strengths make it a top-tier choice for those prioritizing safety and growth. Strategic Outlook BNB may test the $900–$950 range again in September, but its growth story is increasingly overshadowed by competitors. Solana’s technical progress and ETF-fueled adoption, Chainlink’s breakout potential, and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale momentum offer more compelling upside narratives for investors. Analysts conclude that rotating exposure toward Solana, Chainlink, and MAGACOIN FINANCE aligns with Q3’s broader innovation and adoption themes, while keeping a measured allocation in BNB to capture any ETF-driven moves remains a balanced approach for portfolios.

Reports indicate this substantial public fund holds approximately 240,000 shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock, valued at an impressive $80 million. This indirect yet considerable investment positions the fund with exposure to Bitcoin, sparking discussions across the financial community. Understanding the Florida Pension Fund’s MicroStrategy Holding According to insights from Bitcoin Historian, the Florida pension fund ’s stake in MicroStrategy is a strategic decision that offers a unique pathway to Bitcoin. MicroStrategy, a business intelligence firm, has become well-known for its corporate strategy of acquiring and holding large amounts of Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset. Therefore, investing in MSTR stock means gaining indirect exposure to the world’s leading cryptocurrency. This approach allows traditional institutional investors, like state pension funds, to participate in the potential upside of Bitcoin without directly holding the volatile digital asset themselves. It leverages the company’s expertise in managing its Bitcoin holdings, providing a layer of separation and potentially reduced regulatory hurdles for the pension fund. Why Are Pension Funds Looking Towards Bitcoin Exposure? Pension funds globally are constantly seeking avenues to diversify portfolios and generate robust returns to meet their long-term liabilities. The traditional investment landscape often presents challenges, including low-interest-rate environments and market volatility. Bitcoin, despite its own volatility, has demonstrated remarkable growth over the past decade, attracting the attention of even the most conservative investors. For the Florida pension fund , an investment in MicroStrategy offers several potential advantages: Diversification: Adding an asset class with a low correlation to traditional markets can enhance portfolio resilience. Inflation Hedge: Many view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation, preserving purchasing power over time. Growth Potential: Despite price fluctuations, Bitcoin’s long-term growth trajectory remains a compelling factor for long-term investors. Indirect Access: MicroStrategy provides a regulated and publicly traded vehicle for Bitcoin exposure, simplifying compliance for institutional investors. What Are the Implications for State Investments and Bitcoin? The move by the Florida pension fund is more than just an isolated investment; it reflects a broader trend. Institutional adoption of Bitcoin and related assets is steadily increasing, signaling a maturation of the cryptocurrency market. When a state-level pension fund, responsible for the retirement savings of thousands, makes such a significant allocation, it lends credibility to Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. However, this strategy also comes with its own set of considerations: Market Volatility: While indirect, the value of MSTR stock is significantly tied to Bitcoin’s price, inheriting its volatility. Company-Specific Risk: Beyond Bitcoin, the performance of MicroStrategy as a company also influences the stock’s value. Public Scrutiny: Investments by public funds often face intense scrutiny regarding risk management and fiduciary duty. This development could encourage other state and institutional funds to explore similar strategies, further integrating digital assets into mainstream finance. It highlights a growing acceptance of Bitcoin’s role in a diversified investment portfolio, even if accessed indirectly. Looking Ahead: The Future of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption The decision by the Florida pension fund marks a fascinating chapter in the ongoing narrative of institutional Bitcoin adoption. It underscores a shifting paradigm where traditional finance is increasingly recognizing the potential of digital assets. As more information becomes available and the market evolves, it will be crucial to observe how these pioneering investments perform and influence future policy decisions for public funds. This significant stake by the Florida pension fund serves as a powerful indicator that Bitcoin is no longer on the fringe but is steadily cementing its place within the global financial ecosystem. It’s a testament to the evolving understanding and strategic integration of digital assets by major financial players. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock? MicroStrategy (MSTR) is a business intelligence company that has adopted Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset. Investing in MSTR stock offers investors indirect exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements. How does the Florida pension fund gain Bitcoin exposure through MSTR? By holding shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock, the Florida pension fund indirectly benefits from MicroStrategy’s significant Bitcoin holdings. The value of MSTR stock is heavily influenced by the price of Bitcoin. Why are pension funds considering Bitcoin investments? Pension funds are exploring Bitcoin-related investments for portfolio diversification, potential inflation hedging, and long-term growth potential, especially in a challenging low-interest-rate environment. What are the risks associated with this type of investment? Key risks include the inherent volatility of Bitcoin, company-specific risks related to MicroStrategy’s business operations, and potential public scrutiny concerning fiduciary duty for public funds. Will other state pension funds follow Florida’s example? The significant investment by the Florida pension fund could serve as a precedent, potentially encouraging other state and institutional funds to explore similar indirect or direct strategies for Bitcoin exposure as the digital asset market matures.

While Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) remain top-set assets with strong ecosystems, many owners are exploring new projects in which long-term value appreciation is bound to occur. That is where Remittix (RTX) has captured interest, especially with its upcoming wallet release and innovation in the battle against international payments. Solana and XRP Trading Performance Solana is trading at $213.50 after a 5.41% increase, with a market capitalization of $115.44 billion. The trade volume rose 37.99% in the last 24 hours to $12.71 billion. Despite the recent volatility, Solana is still considered to be among the top crypto under $1,000 that has great developer adoption. Ripple, however, is down by 0.71% and now trading at $2.99. Its market capitalization is at $178.17 billion with $6.66 billion in daily volume, a 0.65% drop. While XRP is yet a leading crypto with utility in actual usage in payments, attention is gradually turning towards new altcoins that have both use and adoption value. Remittix Presale and Wallet Release Remittix (RTX) is priced at $0.0987 per token and raised over $21.8 million during its presale, trading over 625 million tokens.

Starting now, Bybit users can trade on market sentiment and volatility trends of crypto’s golden pair of blue-chip assets—BTC and ETH. The advanced volatility indices by Volmex , the leader in crypto volatility indices and other novel crypto indices, allow traders to seize opportunities based on the market volatility of BTC and ETH. Measuring implied volatility in the crypto options market, BVIV and EVIV reflects the market’s 30-day forward-looking volatility expectations of BTC and ETH derived from option prices across leading cryptocurrency exchanges. This real-time data transforms how traders can approach market timing and build volatility-based trading strategies. Combining Bybit’s powerful trading suite and BVIV and EVIV’s institutional-grade insights, traders may formulate effective and personalized trading strategies: High Volatility Readings – Short Volatility Opportunities : When BVIV and EVIV show elevated levels, indicating heightened market tension and expectations of large price swings, savvy traders can implement short volatility strategies. As market risk expectations ease and volatility premiums shrink, strategies such as Dual Asset products allow traders to lock in high premiums, while Discount Buy strategies enable asset acquisition at lower effective prices. Low Volatility Environments – Long Volatility Setups : Conversely, when indices display lower values indicating calmer market sentiment, they signal growing expectations for future market swings. This presents opportunities for long volatility strategies including Double-Win products that generate profits from price movement in either direction, and Smart Leverage options that amplify returns when market trends become clear. Bringing Institutional-Grade Volatility Analysis to Retail Traders Bybit Advanced Earn is dedicated to empowering traders with advanced market intelligence and tools by bringing Volmex’s sophisticated and market-tested volatility indicators. Backed by Volmex, the indices match BVIV and EVIV to the corresponding structured products based on real-time market signals, based on TradingView and CoinMarketCap data.

His remarks placed the Trump family at the centre of renewed discussion about the political and institutional support behind Bitcoin’s growth, highlighting how the administration’s policies have shaped demand. This comes at a time when Bitcoin is already up 18% this year, reaching a record high before correcting slightly, as markets weigh both regulatory shifts and increasing institutional flows worldwide. Trump family links with Bitcoin community Eric Trump highlighted how the Bitcoin community had rallied behind his father even before his second term as President. He said the family had “believed in” the cryptocurrency network, noting that the level of support from the sector was unlike anything they had experienced before. His comments underscored a longer-running alignment between Trump’s political momentum and Bitcoin advocacy, particularly among investors who welcomed the administration’s more favourable stance on digital assets and broader innovation worldwide. Bitcoin price movements in 2024 Bitcoin surged to an all-time high of $124,480.82 in mid-August, fuelled by institutional demand and a regulatory environment considered more favourable under Trump’s leadership. The cryptocurrency has since pared gains, falling back from those record levels. On Friday, Bitcoin was trading at $110,082.64, down 2.59% in the past 24 hours, reflecting a sharper short-term pullback than earlier this week. Source: CoinMarketCap Despite this pullback, the year-to-date performance remains strong, with market sentiment still largely bullish amid expectations of further mainstream adoption and the possibility of larger global asset managers increasing exposure. Institutional demand and regulatory climate The Trump administration’s more supportive policies on cryptocurrencies have been cited as one of the reasons behind Bitcoin’s recent rally. Institutional investors have also maintained consistent demand, providing additional stability and signalling confidence in digital assets. Analysts view this as a critical shift, with political backing and institutional flows working together to push the cryptocurrency beyond speculative cycles and into broader financial markets. Market participants suggest that this combination could play a central role in sustaining higher prices in the months ahead. $1 million Bitcoin prediction Eric Trump’s forecast that Bitcoin would eventually reach a $1 million price point came as part of a broader narrative about long-term adoption. He told the Hong Kong audience there was “no question” about Bitcoin hitting that milestone. The statement reflects both optimism within crypto markets and the role of political figures in shaping public expectations about the digital asset’s future trajectory. His comments further highlighted how politics and finance are increasingly intersecting in the evolution of Bitcoin, with institutional flows reinforcing the view that cryptocurrency is moving closer to the mainstream financial system globally.

Funding rates for other major tokens were steady at around zero, indicating neutral sentiment. OI in the CME bitcoin futures slipped to 135.72K BTC, the lowest since April, while ether OI remained elevated at record highs near 2.10 million ETH. The divergence suggests a continued preference among investors for ETH over BTC. On Deribit, downside bias in BTC options has strengthened across all tenors, with puts trading at a five volatility premium to calls at the front end. ETH options display similar dynamics, marking a shift from bullish positioning early this week. On Paradigm, block flows featured call selling and put rolling strategies in BTC and ETH. Market maker Wintermute pointed to demand for call spreads in the December expiry BTC options. Token Talk Solana (SOL) posted a 44% drop in second-quarter application revenue, sliding to to $576.4 million from $1 billion in the first quarter even as its DeFi sector expanded, according to Messari. The downturn reflects weaker profitability across key decentralized apps. Pump.fun (PUMP) still led with $156.9 million, but was still down 44% as memecoin frenzy cooled. Axiom was the outlier, surging 641% to $126.6 million, showing how fast protocol-specific growth can offset broader ecosystem weakness. Jupiter (JUP) earned $66.4 million (–16%), while Phantom and Photon were hit hardest with declines of 65% and 72%, respectively. Despite revenue losses, DeFi TVL on Solana climbed 30% to $8.6 billion in the quarter and has since crossed $11 billion, cementing the chain as the largest DeFi network behind Ethereum. Kamino Finance drove TVL growth, up 34% to $2.1 billion after introducing Kamino Lend V2, which attracted $200 million in deposits and $80 million in loans within three weeks. Kamino now controls 25% of Solana’s market share. Raydium staged a strong comeback, rising 54% to $1.8 billion in TVL, reclaiming second place from Jupiter. It now commands 21% share versus Jupiter’s 19%. Trading activity, however, told a different story: Average daily spot DEX volume fell 45% to $2.5 billion, reflecting a fading of the memecoin momentum that had fueled the previous quarter's records.",Markets|Markets|market analysis|Derivatives|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET|SOL|BTC,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-29 12:00:00
50863003,568928,1756468809,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50863003.jpeg,Bitcoin Whales Take Over Binance: Average Deposit Size Jumps To 13.5 BTC,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-whales-take-binance-average-deposit-jumps/,"Bitcoin is facing renewed selling pressure as the broader crypto market struggles with volatility and uncertainty. Price action has narrowed into a critical zone around $110,000, a level that could dictate the trajectory for the coming weeks. Holding above this support would keep bullish hopes alive, opening the door for a potential retest of all-time highs. But if BTC loses this foothold, analysts warn that a sharper drop toward $100,000 could follow, a move that would shake market confidence. Fresh onchain data adds another dimension to this picture. CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn shared insights revealing that Binance Exchange Inflow (Mean, MA7) has shifted significantly, showing a marked increase in the average size of deposits hitting Binance. While historically Binance has been known as a retail-heavy exchange, the 7-day mean inflow now stands at 13.5 BTC per transaction — a level that signals whale-sized activity rather than small retail deposits. This structural shift highlights how large players are becoming more active on Binance, seeking its deep liquidity to manage significant trades efficiently. For Bitcoin, it adds weight to the current moment: a pivotal price test against the backdrop of growing whale presence, making the next moves all the more decisive. Whale Activity Surges As Exchange Inflows Shift According to CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn, the onchain metric known as Binance Exchange Inflow (Mean, MA7) offers a valuable lens into the type of participants dominating exchange activity. This metric tracks the average size of deposits hitting Binance. When the mean inflow is low, it typically indicates a large share of deposits coming from retail investors, who generally move smaller amounts of Bitcoin. In contrast, when the mean inflow rises, it reflects whale-sized transactions, suggesting that larger players are becoming more active. At present, the 7-day moving average stands at 13.5 BTC per deposit, a striking figure that confirms whales are playing a greater role on Binance. To put this into perspective, back in early 2024, the same metric hovered around just 0.8 BTC, reinforcing Binance’s reputation at the time as a retail-driven platform. The surge to today’s levels represents a dramatic shift in market structure, with whales now shaping flows on what was once considered the most retail-heavy exchange. This evolution aligns with Binance’s position as the largest exchange by trading volume. For whales, liquidity is essential: moving tens or hundreds of millions in Bitcoin requires an environment where sizable orders can be executed without causing disruptive price slippage. Binance provides exactly that. The trend highlights a broader market transformation. With institutional adoption and whale accumulation rising, the very nature of exchange activity has changed, making Binance not just a hub for retail traders but also a key venue for large-scale players steering market direction. BTC Tests Critical Support Zone Bitcoin is trading around $109,800 after a sharp pullback, with the chart showing clear selling pressure weighing on price action. The rejection from highs near $123,000 earlier in August triggered a sustained downtrend, pushing BTC below both the 50-day ($115,654) and 100-day ($116,634) moving averages. These levels now act as firm resistance, reinforcing the bearish momentum in the short term. Currently, BTC is testing the 200-day moving average near $111,700, a key zone that could determine whether the market stabilizes or faces deeper losses. A confirmed breakdown below this level would expose Bitcoin to further downside, with the next major support around $106,000–$108,000. If this zone fails to hold, sentiment could sour further, opening the path toward $100,000. A rebound above $112,000 would ease immediate pressure and allow BTC to retest the $115,000 region. Reclaiming that area would be essential for bulls to regain control and rebuild momentum toward the $120,000–$123,000 resistance range.

50862991,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=812031,1756468813,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/50862991.jpeg,"XRP And Dogecoin On The Edge Of ‘Full Port’ Breakout, Says Raoul Pal",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/xrp-dogecoin-full-port-breakout-raoul-pal/,"Raoul Pal says two of crypto’s most-watched legacy altcoins—XRP and Dogecoin—are coiling for their next act. In a new X thread framed as “the Crypto Waiting Room,” the Real Vision and GMI co-founder argues that a broad swath of the market is consolidating before another leg higher, with capital already “full ported” into Ethereum and rotation risk building for assets lower down the stack. XRP And Dogecoin Are In The ‘Waiting Room’ “Let’s talk about the Crypto Waiting Room… many key parts of the crypto ecosystem are in the waiting room ready to launch,” Pal wrote, opening a chart-dense series that he says draws on Global Macro Investor’s probabilistic framework. He placed Total3—the market excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum—“ready to launch from the waiting room,” while stressing that “OTHERS (Outside of Top 10… purest form of Alts season where all shit rises) [is] still in the waiting room but longer to launch.” Related Reading: XRP Holds Golden Retrace At $2.90: Wave 3 Breakout To $5.4 In Sight He added, “ETH… Full Port. SOL… next to leave the waiting room… Sui in the waiting room, will follow SOL.” He was explicit on the two crowd favorites: “DOGE – in the waiting room. Will full port when OTHERS does…” and “XRP… in the process of Full Porting…” Pal’s “waiting room” metaphor is shorthand for a market structure he says rhymes with past cycles: liquidity first concentrates in the highest-quality, most institutionally accepted assets, then rotates down the risk curve as momentum broadens. “People need to learn patience. The path is clear… but never, ever expect tick for tick perfection. It’s the pattern that counts,” he cautioned with regards to the infamous M2 money supply chart, emphasizing that GMI’s approach is to seek “rhythm and rhymes of markets” rather than one-for-one chart overlays. “As ever, at GMI we are working with probabilistic frameworks and contextualisation… we use a framework of around 1,000 key charts which we then simplify and simplify.” The macro pillar of the thesis is liquidity. “The rate of change is only going to rise in the key metric of Total Global Liquidity… US, EU, China and Japan all need to roll debts,” Pal wrote, calling that confluence “an absurdly bullish backdrop, along with the reg changes, DAT’s and sovereign accumulation along with Wall Street acceptance.” In his timeline, the current crypto cycle “extends into Q1 2026 and possibly Q2 2026 due to slow business cycle forcing more liquidity for longer.” Or, as he put it more colloquially: “wen banana? We’ve been in it since Aug 2024 and the acceleration phase lies ahead.” Technically, the “waiting room” framing aligns with what long-horizon charts of XRP and Dogecoin have been telegraphing. Multi-year weekly structures on both assets show a repeating cadence of broad, descending consolidations that ultimately resolve into impulsive upside, followed by new, tighter coils beneath prior cycle highs. Related Reading: XRP Whales Unload Massive Bags: Distribution Or Trap? The current phase features exactly that kind of triangular compression: XRP’s post-spring surge has bled into a small symmetrical triangle under its 2025 peak, while Dogecoin’s 2021–2024 falling channel gave way to a higher base that is now narrowing into a wedge. Pal’s point is not that breakouts are guaranteed or imminent on a given candle, but that the setup is consistent with earlier “pre-rotation” conditions. The investor also invoked cycle analogs without over-promising precision. “And it looks similar to 2017…” he noted, before repeating that GMI is “not looking for perfect matches.” The probabilistic takeaway, he said, is that the market remains in an expansionary regime, with breadth likely to improve as non-BTC/ETH segments clear their bases. “The only question is… will your bags go up or do you have the wrong allocation? That is up to you my friends. Buy the ticket, take the ride.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.84.

This week, there’s renewed focus on where the price of LTC might go next. Traders and long-time holders are watching for a move that could break Litecoin out of its recent range. At the same time, a new project called Avalon X (AVLX) is drawing attention across crypto communities, not for what it promises in the future, but for what it’s already offering right now. Avalon X is behind two major giveaways, both designed to reward buyers of its AVLX token with prizes that feel more grounded than most. One gives away cash in the form of tokens. The other gives away a fully built townhouse in a luxury development. Both are grabbing the attention of people who are used to seeing crypto projects talk about far-off goals. With Avalon X, the appeal is immediate. Litecoin Price Update Litecoin has been trading just above the $110 mark, with short bursts of activity keeping things interesting. Recently, the coin showed signs of being oversold and then started climbing back toward more stable ground. Analysts are starting to mention it again as one of the few tokens that could still benefit from long-term attention, especially if trading volume returns. There’s also been chatter about Litecoin being next in line for an ETF. While nothing is confirmed and timelines are unknown, it’s keeping Litecoin in the news. The SEC has delayed decisions on several crypto ETFs including ones that mention LTC. But delays haven’t stopped the speculation. Analysts are still touting Litecoin’s stability, long history and reliable network as positives that will help it check the boxes down the line. At the same time, Litecoin’s mining position remains steady. Its network is considered strong especially with merge-mining setups that connect it to Dogecoin. A recent 51% attack on the Dogecoin network failed and analysts pointed out that Litecoin’s mining community is still intact. It may not be making the headlines like Bitcoin or Ethereum but LTC is still showing up where it matters. Avalon X: Real Estate Backed Presale While Litecoin holds its ground, Avalon X is making moves in a completely different direction. The project is giving away $1 million worth of AVLX tokens, with 10 winners receiving $100,000 each. To enter, participants need to purchase at least $100 in AVLX and link their wallet to the dashboard. Every friend referred to the platform earns the participant 10 extra entries. It’s a simple model that’s already drawing plenty of attention, especially from users looking to try something new without needing to stake or lock up their funds. The design of the site and the language around the campaign reflect a sense of lifestyle and opportunity. It feels less like a DeFi product launch and more like a membership to something exclusive. That sense of style and clarity is helping the campaign get shared widely, with users posting about the giveaway on social media and in group chats. In addition to the token giveaway, Avalon X is offering something even more unusual. One winner will receive a fully finished townhouse in the Avalon Eco Valley development. This is a real property in a real location, and it’s being handed over to one person who participates in the giveaway. To be eligible, a buyer needs to purchase at least $250 worth of AVLX tokens and link their wallet to the platform. Eco Valley Townhouse Giveaway The idea of giving away a home is unusual in the crypto world, where most rewards come in the form of digital tokens or future promises. Here, Avalon X is handing over something physical, something with long-term value. There’s no need to apply through a complicated interface. Users just need to buy the token, register a wallet, and they’re in. It’s this kind of clean, simple execution that’s helping Avalon X grow quickly across social media platforms. Where LTC and AVLX Stand Right now, Litecoin is being watched for a breakout. Technical analysis points to resistance near the $123 mark. If that gets broken, there’s room for the price to run higher. Some chart watchers say $183 could come into view if enough volume supports the move. Still, Litecoin isn’t the flashiest coin, and that’s part of its appeal. It keeps working in the background without chasing the spotlight. Avalon X, on the other hand, is making a bold entrance. The AVLX token is still early, but it’s already connected to two real campaigns with real outcomes. The difference in strategy is clear. Litecoin is reliable and proven. Avalon X is new and built around lifestyle, design, and immediate value. What they share is attention. Both are being talked about, one for where it might go next, and the other for what it’s offering right now. Whether someone’s holding LTC as a long-term bet or picking up AVLX for the giveaways, both coins are part of the current conversation. And in a market that moves fast, being part of the conversation matters. Closing Thoughts Litecoin continues to prove its strength in subtle ways. There’s no big headline, no sudden drama, just steady progress and a loyal user base. It may break out soon, or it may stay in this range a little longer. Either way, it’s not going away. Avalon X is approaching crypto from a different angle. Instead of asking users to wait, it’s giving them a reason to get involved right away.

As the number of institutions holding, staking, and purchasing Ethereum treasury strategies increases rapidly, the price of ETH is predicted to reach double-digit figures. At this point, Bitwise Chief Investment Officer (CIO) Matt Hougan evaluated the growing demand in Ethereum. Speaking on The Wolf of All Streets podcast, Bitwise’s CIO said that institutional investors are completely skipping Bitcoin and moving towards Ethereum. Stating that Ethereum is the latest trend in the market, Matt Hougan stated that ETH has attracted major institutional interest and is forcing investors to forget about Bitcoin for now. Stating that this change also affected ETFs, Hougan said that Etheruem ETFs witnessed a huge increase, recording 10 times more flow than Bitcoin ETFs. “Ethereum ETFs attracted $4 billion in investment last month and have recorded annual inflows of $50 billion. During the same period, Bitcoin ETFs experienced outflows. So, almost all the new money is flowing into Ethereum. Professional investors are skipping Bitcoin entirely and moving entirely into ETH.” Bitwise CIO Hougan explained the reasons why institutional investors prefer Ethereum and listed them as follows: “1- ETH's tokenization story, 2- the growth potential of stablecoins and 3- they prefer ETH because of its cash flow (income-generating) model.” Finally, Hougan added that the constant buying pressure on Ethereum will continue from now on. *This is not investment advice.

The tweet, which included a video clip, drew attention to how blockchain-based payment solutions and traditional financial infrastructures are converging. The claim suggests that XRP’s role in cross-border payments could extend into one of the largest and most established global financial networks. Details from the Attached Video In the video attached to the tweet, a speaker described SWIFT as the preeminent messaging system for the financial industry, handling payments, foreign exchange, trade, and securities. The speaker emphasized that SWIFT traditionally functions through a store-and-forward model, where messages are queued and processed in a structured timeframe based on service-level agreements. This model requires reconciliation steps and can delay the confirmation of whether funds have arrived, sometimes stretching into days. By contrast, the speaker explained that blockchain-based systems, such as those enabled by Ripple and XRP, introduce real-time settlement and transparency into the payments process. According to the remarks, with blockchain technology, banks would not need to wait for days to confirm the receipt of funds. Instead, instant movement of money and full visibility of transactions would be possible. This difference underscores how newer digital settlement mechanisms could enhance efficiency compared to legacy infrastructure. #XRP has already been successfully tested by 11,000+ banks within the SWIFT network! pic.twitter.com/cosOLlUkmr — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) August 28, 2025 Ripple’s Position in Relation to SWIFT The speaker in the video clarified that Ripple is not expected to replace SWIFT. Rather, Ripple’s technology and the use of XRP are described as complementary tools that can coexist with SWIFT’s infrastructure. Specifically, the commentary indicated that Ripple would provide institutions with real-time settlement options where such speed is required. Meanwhile, SWIFT itself is also evolving its network to offer real-time capabilities, suggesting a broader modernization across the payments landscape. The video further suggested the possibility of XRP being utilized within SWIFT transactions, particularly in areas such as foreign exchange. This implies that XRP could function as a bridge asset within the existing SWIFT framework, rather than operating as a standalone replacement. The coexistence model would allow financial institutions to benefit from both the established reach of SWIFT and the efficiencies of blockchain-based settlement.

If accurate, this would highlight significant engagement from the banking sector in exploring the utility of XRP for global financial transfers. While the claim has not been independently verified, it reflects the increasing attention being paid to how XRP and Ripple’s technology could integrate with or support traditional systems, such as SWIFT. The broader significance lies in the ongoing evolution of financial messaging and settlement infrastructure. With SWIFT enhancing its own real-time capabilities and Ripple continuing to promote XRP for cross-border liquidity , the future may involve a combination of both systems working together to deliver faster, more transparent financial transactions.

On active days, these ETFs collectively generate between $5 billion and $10 billion in daily trading volume, occasionally surpassing activity on some of the largest global exchanges. According to Moreno, this trend underscores a steady rise in institutional demand for BTC through regulated investment products. Binance Remains the Market Leader Despite the momentum of US ETFs, Binance still dominates global spot trading activity. The exchange handles around $4.1 billion in daily BTC trading volume, nearly 67% higher than the $2.77 billion attributed to the 11 US spot Bitcoin ETFs, data from CoinGlass shows. Binance’s total spot trading across all pairs averages roughly $22 billion per day, far outpacing any single ETF product. On peak days, Bitcoin trading volumes on the exchange have reached $18 billion, while Ether has seen up to $11 billion in volume. ETH trading, in particular, remains concentrated on centralized exchanges. Binance leads, followed by Crypto.com, while Ethereum ETFs account for just 4% of the spot market—ranking sixth in total activity. This indicates that institutional adoption of ETH through ETFs is progressing more slowly compared to BTC. Inflows Show Shifting Investor Preferences Recent trading flows highlight a divergence in investor sentiment between Bitcoin and Ethereum . Over the past four trading days, US spot BTC ETFs recorded inflows totaling $571.6 million, according to CoinGlass. The slowdown coincided with a 2.5% decline in BTC price since Monday, with the cryptocurrency trading around $111,600 at the time of writing. Ethereum ETFs attracted $1.24 billion in inflows during the same period—more than double the amount that flowed into BTC funds. Ether products have not recorded a single day of net outflows since Aug. 20 and have amassed over $4 billion in inflows this month alone. That represents 30% of the total inflows since their launch 13 months ago. While Bitcoin ETFs continue to lead in trading volume, the rapid rise in Ether ETF participation suggests institutional investors are broadening their exposure beyond BTC as confidence in crypto investment products grows.

Viral Meme Coin Pepenode Nears $500K In Presale,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/next-100x-crypto-viral-meme-coin-pepenode-nears-500k-in-presale,"The world’s first mine-to-earn meme coin is already going viral in the early days of its presale. Pepenode (PEPENODE) has raised nearly $500k in its ICO in short order as investors rush to invest in a new meme coin that offers engagement, excitement, utility and innovation, even during the early stages of its presale. PEPENODE holders don’t need to wait for the end of presale and token launch to get a half-baked product. Instead, they can build their own virtual mining rig from day one and earn rewards from a fully interactive, gamified crypto mining experience. Pepenode is a unique meme coin, blending the iconic Pepe the Frog theme with an innovative “mine-to-earn” model. As a low-cap token, it lowers the barrier to entry, giving small-scale investors the chance to participate early while unlocking multiple avenues for rewards. Unsurprisingly, prominent analysts and crypto influencers are bullish on the meme coin’s upside potential, with many calling it the next 100x crypto. Pepenode: The First Mine-to-Earn Meme Coin The crypto market is saturated with low-quality meme coins, especially after the popularity of launchpads like Pump.fun. Most meme tokens end up as pump-and-dump schemes, while others fail to deliver fair launches, with bots seizing the early advantage. Even presale tokens often struggle to build genuine hype. Despite bold promises, teams rarely communicate clear timelines for delivering real utility. Investors are usually left waiting until the presale and token launch are complete before seeing any product, by which point momentum has faded and whales and smart money investors have already exited their positions. On the contrary, Pepenode’s mine-to-earn platform flips the script by giving investors something tangible from day one. Instead of waiting for utility after launch, holders can immediately engage in gamified mining, build virtual server rooms, earn rewards, and contribute to deflationary burns, all while the presale is still live. Pepenode is bringing the concept of meme coin mining to investors. The process begins with buying nodes using $PEPENODE. These nodes fill the user’s server room, and each comes with unique properties that can be combined to boost mining efficiency. As the number of nodes increases, users can upgrade their facilities to scale output. The upgrades don’t require extra computing power, but they increase the mining capacity and trigger token burns that reduce supply. 70% of all the tokens used for upgrades will be burnt, creating a deflationary token supply. Once the setup is running, server rooms generate rewards in meme coins. Beyond multiplying $PEPENODE holdings, top miners can also receive bonuses in other popular tokens like Pepe and Fartcoin, making Pepenode the first gamified platform for virtual meme coin mining. Notably, the project reduces the complexity associated with crypto mining. There is no need for expensive equipment or competing with big corporations. Instead, users can control the entire workflow through a visually rich dashboard. Considering its unique value proposition, it is no surprise that Pepenode is being viewed as the next 100x crypto. Community-Centric Tokenomics, Audited Smart Contracts and Attractive Staking Yields Besides its gamified crypto mining, Pepenode has impressed smart money investors with its strong fundamentals. For instance, those who aren’t interested in the mine-to-earn utility and want to opt for a more passive setup can simply stake their coins and earn attractive returns. Early stakers gain the highest rewards, since yields gradually decline as more tokens are added to the staking pool. The Pepenode staking pool is currently offering a reward rate of over 3000% per annum. Similarly, the new meme coin has adopted community-centric tokenomics, with no separate allocation for the developer team or any VC round. Instead, 35% of the token supply will be used to develop the mine-to-earn platform, while another 35% has been reserved for business development and community outreach. The remaining token supply has been distributed between node rewards, infrastructure and exchange listings. Check out the project whitepaper for more details. Moreover, unlike most new meme coins, Pepenode doesn’t compromise on its security. Its trust and safety audit by CoinSult proves that investor funds aren’t at risk from hacks or centralization attacks. The contract ownership has been renounced, which means the developer team can’t mint new tokens, blacklist addresses or pause the contract. Is PEPENODE The Next 100x Crypto? Pepenode ticks all the boxes for being the next meme coin sensation. It is a low-cap investment, which means it won’t be affected by the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. The Pepe the Frog branding is bound to increase its reach, while also tying it to Pepe’s bullish prospects. Moreover, it is a high utility coin, bringing in a new mine-to-earn concept to the meme coin sector. Unsurprisingly, smart money investors are optimistic about Pepenode’s upside potential, with some even calling it the next 100x crypto. Interested buyers can purchase the meme coin through the OTC widget on its presale website, or through the Best Wallet app. Investors can also follow Pepenode’s X and Telegram accounts for more updates regarding the project.

However, the tailwinds cooled off during the first quarter, causing the total market cap to drop by nearly 19% before rebounding again in the second quarter. Supported by regulatory clarity in the U.S., landmark stablecoin bills, and growing institutional adoption, the renewed momentum generally continued in the summer. While the general picture does appear positive, the details naturally vary among different sectors, with some of them exponentially outperforming the others YTD and virtually carrying the market, based on data published by Binance Research on August 28. Crypto sector YTD performance. Source: Binance Research DeFi, tokenized equities, and stablecoins dominate This year, stablecoin supply rose 35%, hitting a record $277.8 billion amid renewed inflows and expanding use cases. Corporate treasuries are also accelerating adoption, with public company Bitcoin ( BTC ) holdings reaching 1.07 million BTC, around 5.4% of circulating supply, across 174 firms. Overall, stablecoins gained 38.6% YTD. Decentralized exchanges ( DEXs ) also hit a record market share, now accounting for more than 23% of spot and 9.3% of futures volumes, although their average daily volume remains relatively low at $1.9 million as of August. More notably, decentralized finance ( DeFi ) lending climbed some 65%, reaching $79.8 billion in total value locked, while tokenized equities are approaching $350 million, driven by stronger issuer infrastructure and clearer regulation. The growth is showing no sign of slowing down, with the number of active on-chain holders nearly tripling from 22,400 in July to 66,500 in August. In total, DeFi gained 44.6% YTD, while real-world tokenization ( RWA ) saw 38.7% returns over the same period. Daily trading volumes.

Exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ) have emerged as a leading catalyst, with U.S. spot BTC and Ethereum ( ETH ) products drawing $28 billion in net inflows.

50863322,569141,1756469422,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50863322.jpeg,Bitcoin Prognose: Wie sind die Aussichten für BTC und sind 250k möglich?,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-prognose-september-2025-hoskinson-250k/,"Wo geht Bitcoin hin? Diese Frage aller Fragen in der Krypto-Welt kann abschließend wohl nie beantwortet werden. Deshalb lohnt es sich, regelmäßig eigene Recherche zu betreiben, um die zukünftigen Aussichten der größten Kryptowährung der Welt wenigstens ein wenig voraussehen zu können. Wie immer bei Prognosen sollte man sich bewusst sein, dass die Realität dann doch oft anders kommt, als die Voraussagen der angesehensten Experten. Doch gehen wir rein in die Analyse. Bitcoin bleibt das Zentrum trotz Altcoin-Wachstum Altcoins haben zuletzt deutlich an Stärke gewonnen, doch Bitcoin hält seine Rolle als Leitwährung der Kryptoindustrie. Viele Analysten verweisen darauf, dass BTC trotz schwankender Dominanz weiter den größten Einfluss auf die Märkte hat. Risikokapitalgeber Tim Draper beschreibt Altcoins als Experimentierfelder, deren Innovationen langfristig Bitcoin stärken. Anleger kehren seiner Meinung nach am Ende immer zurück zur sichersten Plattform. Mit einer Dominanz von derzeit rund 57 Prozent besitzt Bitcoin weiterhin den stärksten Netzwerkeffekt. Das unterstreicht die Rolle des Coins als Basis der Branche und als Messlatte für die Entwicklung der gesamten Kryptomärkte. Trotz der Konkurrenz bleibt der Kapitalfluss in Richtung Bitcoin ungebrochen. Draper betont, dass der Kryptomarkt neue Ideen zwar begrüße, doch Vertrauen und Sicherheit nur BTC bieten könne. Dies sei entscheidend für langfristige Preissteigerungen. Bitcoin als Absicherung in unsicheren Zeiten Tim Draper weist immer wieder auf den Charakter von Bitcoin als Schutzmechanismus hin. Angesichts der massiven US-Staatsverschuldung von über 37 Billionen US-Dollar und einer expansiven Geldpolitik könnten traditionelle Märkte ins Wanken geraten. Währungen wie der US-Dollar verlieren langfristig an Kaufkraft. Gold bietet zwar Schutz, doch Draper sieht Bitcoin als flexiblere und zukunftssichere Alternative. Anleger können damit Inflationsrisiken ausgleichen und politische Eingriffe umgehen. Diese Sichtweise rückt Bitcoin in die Nähe eines „ digitalen sicheren Hafens “. In Zeiten geopolitischer Spannungen und instabiler Finanzmärkte verstärkt das die Nachfrage. Drapers Argument zeigt, warum selbst skeptische Investoren BTC zunehmend als strategisches Element im Portfolio sehen. 250.000 US-Dollar als Kursziel Draper bleibt bei seiner kühnen Prognose von 250.000 US-Dollar pro Bitcoin. Schon früher wurde er für solche Aussagen belächelt, doch mehrere Vorhersagen trafen am Ende ein. Auch jetzt glaubt er an eine massive Aufwertung, gestützt durch Liquidität und Netzwerkeffekte. Zwar liegt die Entwicklerbasis von Bitcoin mit 2.500 Aktiven hinter Ethereum zurück, doch das allein sei kein Risiko. Draper verweist auf den Wert von Akzeptanz und Sicherheit. Die Skepsis bleibt dennoch vorhanden. Analysten sehen fehlende Innovationen als Schwachpunkt. Draper widerspricht und verweist darauf, dass Stabilität und Vertrauen den Preis treiben werden, nicht die schiere Zahl an Entwicklern. Charles Hoskinson setzt auf Institutionen Cardano-Gründer Charles Hoskinson teilt Drapers Optimismus. Er sieht den entscheidenden Faktor für die Rallye in Staatsfonds und institutionellen Investoren. Länder wie Norwegen und die USA halten bereits erhebliche Mengen an Bitcoin. Hoskinson erwartet, dass diese Käufe die Märkte nachhaltig beeinflussen. Institutionelles Kapital könnte den Markt in eine völlig neue Dimension treiben. Für die kommenden fünf Jahre prognostiziert er sogar eine Verfünffachung der Marktkapitalisierung auf bis zu 10 Billionen US-Dollar. Damit würde Bitcoin nicht nur neue Rekorde erreichen, sondern als ernsthafte Alternative zu etablierten Anlageklassen auftreten. Technologische und regulatorische Treiber Neben Kapitalströmen spielen technologische Entwicklungen eine Rolle. Hoskinson verweist auf die Integration neuer Anwendungen und Layer-2-Lösungen. Projekte wie Bitcoin Hyper bringen Geschwindigkeit, Skalierbarkeit und Smart-Contract-Funktionalität in das BTC-Ökosystem. Diese Innovationen könnten das Netzwerk fit für die nächste Wachstumsphase machen. Auch die Regulierung ist entscheidend. Sollte die US-Notenbank Fed im September Zinssenkungen beschließen, würde zusätzliche Liquidität in den Markt strömen. Das könnte Bitcoin weiter antreiben. Bleiben die Zinsen stabil, dürfte BTC dennoch profitieren, da Sicherheit und Knappheit stärker ins Bewusstsein rücken. Bitcoin zwischen Risiko und neuer Ära Die Zukunft von Bitcoin hängt sowohl von globalen Märkten als auch von internen Innovationen ab. Draper und Hoskinson sind sich jedoch einig: Die Chancen überwiegen die Risiken. Beide erwarten, dass Bitcoin bis zum Ende des Zyklus in Richtung 250.000 US-Dollar steigen kann. Entscheidend wird das Verhalten institutioneller Investoren sein, die in einer Phase wachsender Unsicherheit nach alternativen Werten suchen. Ob kurzfristige Rückschläge kommen, bleibt offen. Doch die langfristige Prognose zeichnet ein klares Bild: Bitcoin könnte schon bald eine neue Ära betreten, in der er endgültig als globaler Wertspeicher anerkannt wird. Eine neue Ära will auch Bitcoin Hyper einläuten. Hast du schon von dem Projekt gehört? Bitcoin Hyper – Bitcoin auf Turbo Bitcoin ist stark, sicher und legendär – aber auch langsam und teuer. Genau hier setzt Bitcoin Hyper an: das erste echte Layer-2-Netzwerk für Bitcoin, das Geschwindigkeit, günstige Transaktionen und moderne Smart Contracts direkt ins Bitcoin-Universum bringt. Dank Solana-Technologie läuft alles blitzschnell, energieeffizient und bleibt dabei so sicher wie der Bitcoin selbst. Kurz gesagt: Bitcoin Hyper macht aus einem Oldtimer einen Sportwagen – ohne die Sicherheit zu verlieren.

Crypto investment firm Galaxy disclosed this in its latest report on the crypto lending sector. According to the report by Galaxy Research associate Zach Pokorny, the 42% increase means the dollar value of open loans on decentralized finance applications increased by $7.84 billion. However, loans on centralized finance crypto platforms also increased, although at a lower rate. As of June 30, the value of outstanding CeFi loans reached $17.78 billion, representing a 14.66% growth quarter over quarter. While this shows how DeFi continues to outpace CeFi regarding crypto loans, the centralized platforms have grown substantially in the past few years. Galaxy Research noted CeFi loans have grown by 147.5%, around $10.59 billion, since Q4 2023. Interestingly, the surge in crypto loan value during Q2 marks a resurgence after declining in Q1. This captures the renewed optimism in the crypto sector, which picked up around April. Thus, it was not just that more users were lending crypto assets. The value of cryptocurrencies also increased significantly during the period, contributing to the general rise in dollar value of crypto loans. Tether leads centralized lending Meanwhile, Tether is the clear leader for centralized lending activity as the stablecoin issuer, having a 57.02% market share with $10.14 billion in open loans as of June 30. It is followed by Nexo, which has an 11.01% share of $1.96 billion, while Galaxy is in the top three at $1.11 billion. The three firms account for 74.26% of all open loans from CeFi lenders. Still, the subsector shows a lot of diversity with CeFi lenders offering different kinds of loans across the board. While some offer only Bitcoin-collateralized loans, others allow altcoin collateral, and cash loans do not include stablecoins. CeFi lending market size by Q2 ending. Source: Galaxy For instance, Ledn, which was one of the top three issuers in Q1, has now fallen out of the top three due to its decision to focus exclusively on Bitcoin-backed lending as opposed to allowing Ethereum and other yield products before now. The variety of lenders and loans available in CeFi has allowed for increased competition in the sector, which, according to the Galaxy report, is starting to reflect in the cost of borrowing. The report observed that costs are improving, which, along with increasing crypto prices, further drives borrowing activity. Interestingly, another major driver of the increase in CeFi lending has been treasury companies, which now use centralized lenders to finance their crypto accumulation. However, Ethereum treasury companies have not really tapped into the lending market to finance their accumulation, with most of them relying on other means so far. Ethereum is driving DeFi lending activity Meanwhile, the Ethereum network is the major driving force behind DeFi lending. This is mostly due to Ethena and Aave Liquid Leverage program and increasing adoption of Pendle principal tokens on Euler Finance and Aave . The report noted that DeFi users are relying heavily on looping strategies through these options. It said: “Under the Liquid Leverage program and Pendle PT tokens, users enact “looping strategies” that allow them to arbitrage the yield of their collateral assets against the cost of borrowing assets against them.” Meanwhile, the value of deposits for DeFi lending continues to increase with a 33.91% growth since June 30 to now reach $79.22 billion by July 31. Ethereum alone accounts for 78.22% of all DeFi lending deposits as of that date, while Solana has only a 5.3% share. Interestingly, Ethereum also leads in borrows. In the month between June 30 and July 31, assets borrowed on DeFi lending applications increased by 33.94%, translating to $6.2 billion in additional borrows. Ethereum saw a 42.73% growth while layer-2 networks saw the second fastest growth at 24.71%.

Coinbase, Gemini, and Kraken facilitate public data access. Chainlink and Pyth oracles distribute government macroeconomic data. U.S. GDP Data Set to Go Blockchain The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) will begin publishing real gross domestic product (GDP) data on the blockchain, beginning with the July 2025 release. This marks the first time a federal agency has made economic data publicly available in a blockchain format, combining transparency, security, and innovation. Specifically, the DOC has already released the official hash of its 2025 quarterly GDP data on nine blockchains: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, TRON, Stellar, Avalanche, Arbitrum One, Polygon PoS, and Optimism. The data was also distributed via Pyth and Chainlink oracles, while cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase, Gemini, and Kraken helped release the information. Going forward, the agency plans to expand the scope of future datasets, including GDP, by engaging additional blockchains, oracles, and exchanges. Innovation and Federal Data Security “This is the first time a federal agency has published economic statistical data like this on the blockchain, and the latest way the Department is utilizing innovative technology to protect federal data and promote public use,” the DOC press release said. The initiative also builds on previous efforts by the administration of former U.S. President Donald Trump to position the U.S. as a global blockchain leader. Collaboration With Chainlink and Oracles Chainlink and the U.S. Department of Commerce have partnered to provide access to U.S. government macroeconomic data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. This collaboration ensures that GDP and other critical datasets are both secure and widely accessible, while enabling seamless distribution to the public and private sectors. With blockchain, users can verify data authenticity independently, making the system more transparent and resilient than traditional publication methods.",News|Blockchain,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BLOCKCHAIN|MACROECONOMICS|EXCHANGE|LINK,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-29 12:19:41

Any unused portion is typically re-escrowed to future months, which is why the effective net supply added tends to be far less than 1 billion. August was the anomaly that sparked speculation: the usual August 1 release didn’t appear on-chain immediately, and community trackers briefly wondered if Ripple had paused unlocks. That chatter ended on August 9 when Whale Alert flagged three escrow releases (500M, 100M, 400M XRP) in quick succession. Several outlets summarized the delayed trigger and noted that most of the unlocked XRP was promptly re-escrowed, consistent with past practice. Escrow balances after the August activity sat in the mid-30B range; reports that cited XRPScan put the figure at roughly 35.6 billion XRP remaining in escrow following the delayed unlock. That aligns with long-running patterns where 700–800 million of each month’s 1 billion is typically re-locked (June was cited at 670M). Ripple September XRP unlock For the September 1, 2025 event, the headline numbers are straightforward. Using a spot price around $2.87 and a circulating supply near 59.48B XRP, a full 1 billion XRP release equates to roughly $2.87 billion and about 1.68% of circulating supply. Historically, Ripple re-escrows the majority; if the usual 700 million goes back, the net 300 million that could circulate represents about 0.50% of supply ($861 million at $2.87). Supply and price references showing 59.48 billion circulating and price in the $2.85–$2.95 band corroborate those inputs.

As a result, cryptocurrencies trading under $0.01 are gaining attention as an increasing number of investors look to get into the crypto market. According to analysts, three tokens are standing out in this terrain: Polygon (POL), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and MAGACOIN FINANCE —an emerging presale that’s quickly gaining traction for its momentum and transparency. Here’s why these three make the list of the best cryptos to buy now under $0.01. 1. Polygon (POL): Layer-2 With Real Adoption Polygon, rebranded as POL, trades around $0.23 to $0.25 and processes over three million low-cost transactions daily, making it a leading Ethereum scaling solution. With brands like Starbucks, Nike, and Meta building on its network and whales accumulating on dips, confidence in its future remains strong. Analysts see a breakout above $0.34 as the next big move, with long-term forecasts targeting multi-dollar prices — keeping Polygon firmly on the list of the best cryptos to buy now ahead of the next rally . 2. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Community Power Meets Upgrades Shiba Inu is holding around $0.0000121, with whales quietly accumulating billions of tokens even as its burn rate slows. Recent Shibarium upgrades, including new governance tools, and Bybit’s confirmation of trillions in reserves, have boosted confidence despite weak trading volumes. Backed by its community and ongoing development, SHIB remains one of the best cryptos to buy now under a cent for investors willing to bet on its long-term roadmap. 3. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Presale Rocket Gaining Momentum MAGACOIN FINANCE is the project gaining the most attention on this list. The token is benefiting from a mix of strong branding, solid community backing, and analysts’ coverage. While investors often stay away from presales, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the project redefining the narrative. Outside of everyday investors, renowned whale traders are keying into the project and positioning for upcoming bull cycles. The major driver for the excitement around the token is its low entry price. With prices still under a penny, average investors do not have to break the bank to get into the project. Coupled with that are analysts’ predictions of a high upside for investors who get in early. With demand surging and many traders viewing MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the best cryptos to buy now under $0.01, the window of opportunity is fast ending. Market watchers say investors who do not get in now may be left chasing rallies when exchange listings go live after the presale. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Verified Altcoin With Long-Term Upside As one of the best altcoins to buy this year, MAGACOIN FINANCE earns its place through verified credibility. Unlike speculative launches, this project is backed by a Hashex audit and led by a KYC-compliant team, creating a solid foundation for long-term success. Its combination of security, transparency, and utility makes it highly attractive to forward-thinking investors. Final Take As the market narrows in on a speculated altcoin season, Polygon, Shiba Inu and MAGACOIN FINANCE are some of the cryptos under a penny seeing attention from investors. While Polygon relies on partnerships, and Shiba Inu continues to constantly evolve, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining traction as the presale rocket set to shake the crypto market. Together, these three tokens represent good choices for investors looking for the best cryptos to buy now under $0.01.

The Solana-based launchpad has taken more than 70% of market share and pulled in over $13 million in weekly revenue. Lifetime earnings just crossed $800 million. But while the platform is booming, many traders are rotating into tokens with stronger long-term potential. Analysts say XRP and MAGACOIN FINANCE are two of the biggest beneficiaries of this shift. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out is that it’s fully audited, safe, and backed by compliance—giving investors more confidence as they search for the best cryptos to buy now . XRP Sees Renewed Interest On-chain data reveals that the bulk of the transaction inflow into XRP and MAGACOIN FINANCE has come from Pump Fun traders. Interestingly, this rotation comes at a time when Pump Fun is seeing positive energy, which signals that a bigger play is happening elsewhere. Following a strong summer, XRP is trading near $3.29. The majority of the price boost the token saw came from the conclusion of the long SEC case against Ripple. With the court giving the final confirmation of XRP’s securities status, both institutional and retail confidence have gone up. With $3.00 acting as a strong support level, XRP is being called one of the best cryptos to buy now for 2025. Investors Show Renewed Confidence in MAGACOIN FINANCE Meanwhile, the capital infusion from Pump Fun traders appears not to be the only catalyst driving momentum in MAGACOIN FINANCE. An inflow of new investors in the project has also added to the excitement. On-chain data analysis reveals that a growing number of the earliest investors in the project are rapidly accumulating more tokens, especially as speculations of a price increase grow. This comes as analysts who track emerging tokens project gains of up to 5,000% for investors who buy MAGACOIN FINANCE before it lists on exchanges. As a result, many investors now believe the window to get into the project may be closing, and supply is running out fast. Analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE may be the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for investors who missed out on the early days of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. Right now, the project is earning multiple picks as the best crypto to buy now in 2025. Verified Altcoin With Analyst Support and Long-Term Upside As one of the best altcoins to buy this year, MAGACOIN FINANCE earns its place through verified credibility. Unlike speculative launches, this project is backed by a full audit and led by a KYC-compliant team, creating a solid foundation for long-term success. Its combination of security, transparency, and utility makes it highly attractive to forward-thinking investors. Final Take Pump Fun may dominate Solana’s launchpad market, but the real action is happening elsewhere. XRP offers utility and institutional adoption. MAGACOIN FINANCE provides early presale growth potential. For traders scanning the market for the best cryptos to buy now, these two tokens show how viral momentum can turn into opportunity.

Frequent capital market fluctuations and declining profits in traditional industries have left investors desperately seeking new stable channels amidst this difficult situation. At the same time, the US government has publicly announced its strategic plan to create a “global cryptocurrency capital,” explicitly encouraging the influx of long-term funds such as pension funds and insurance funds into the crypto industry, particularly the risk-free, controllable return model of cloud mining. This signal quickly shifted market attention to the prudent allocation of digital assets. BTC Miner Preemptively Launches “Guaranteed Principal and Interest Contracts” Against this backdrop, BTC Miner, a well-known UK-based compliant platform, announced the launch of a new “Guaranteed Principal and Interest Contract” designed for conservative investors. This product, protected by the platform’s smart contract mechanism, is unaffected by market price fluctuations, ensuring the safety of principal and the distribution of returns according to the agreed-upon ratio. A BTC Miner spokesperson stated: In turbulent times, investors most need safe and predictable returns, not high-risk, high-yield profits. Our Principal and Interest Guaranteed Contracts are a direct response to this need. Three Core Advantages of the Contract: No Principal Worry—Invested funds are fully protected, even in market declines; Fixed Income—Stable daily interest payments far exceeding returns from bank savings and bonds; Flexible Entry—Register and receive a $500 trial bonus , allowing you to experience real returns with zero barriers to entry.

Receive a 2% bonus on the amount invested by second-level investors. Expert Interpretation: Elena Dubois, a financial scholar in Paris, noted: With the release of favorable US policies, the influx of pension funds into cryptocurrencies is no longer a marginal phenomenon, but an inevitable trend. BTC miner’s principal-guaranteed and interest-guaranteed contracts offer a fixed return while protecting the principal, making these products a new favorite in the market. Cloud Mining: From Risky Speculation to Steady Returns For the past decade, cryptocurrency has been known for its high volatility and high risk, but cloud mining is changing this landscape. By leasing computing power, users can earn daily returns on digital assets without incurring expensive hardware and electricity costs. The addition of BTC Miner has transformed cloud mining from a “game for gamers” into an institutional investment, gradually becoming a safe haven for pension funds and insurance companies. Looking Ahead With the accelerated progress of crypto regulatory compliance in the US and Europe, cloud mining is expected to become a key pillar of the digital economy. BTC Miner stated that in addition to principal-guaranteed and interest-guaranteed contracts, it will gradually launch “flexible floating contracts” and “high-yield advanced contracts” to cater to all investor groups, from conservative to aggressive. About BTC Miner BTC Miner is a leading global cloud mining platform originating in the UK, dedicated to providing investors with a safe, transparent, environmentally friendly, and efficient way to increase the value of their digital assets. The platform combines artificial intelligence (AI) computing power optimization technology with clean energy-powered mining farms, allowing users to easily enjoy daily, automatically settled passive income without purchasing expensive equipment or complex operations.

50866247,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=794788,1756473962,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50866247.jpeg,BYD compounds Tesla's sales woes as revenue surges 14%,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/byd-posts-14-revenue-surge/,"BYD delivered a 14% profit jump in the first half of 2025, while Tesla’s sales in Europe dropped for the seventh straight month, exposing a growing gap between the two EV giants. The numbers came directly from BYD’s regulatory filing on Friday, confirming that net income hit 15.5 billion yuan ($2.2 billion) between January and June. Revenue jumped 23% to 371.3 billion yuan, backed by stronger EV demand and aggressive exports. The company didn’t just rely on its home market. BYD shipped EVs from its Thailand unit to new territories like the UK, Germany, and Belgium, as confirmed by Xinhua. The first half of the year saw 2.15 million cars sold, up 33% compared to 2024, but still short of the 5.5 million target it set for the full year. That sales figure includes both fully electric models and plug-in hybrids. But while battery EVs kept growing in Q2, hybrid sales dropped, pulling down momentum inside China. BYD sticks with discounts as Beijing warns automakers BYD’s momentum came with a cost. In late May, the automaker slashed prices across models, triggering an industry-wide shake-up. Beijing didn’t like it. Officials warned that deep discounts were killing long-term brand strength and putting financial strain on companies. Still, BYD kept the discounts through July. Some automakers made slight cuts. Others went even lower. The government’s effort to rein in the price war hasn’t changed much. These discounts have now become a problem. Companies like BYD are left trying to grow sales without relying on the one tool they’ve leaned on for years. But the firm hasn’t backed down. In July, it outpaced all its EV rivals in Europe. It registered 13,503 vehicles, a 225% rise year-on-year, data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association showed. Tesla , on the other hand, posted just 8,837 registrations, a 40% plunge compared to July 2024. That’s despite an overall rise in EV demand across Europe. Elon Musk’s company has now recorded seven straight months of falling sales on the continent. And it’s not just Europe where things are going south. Globally, Tesla’s auto sales revenue dropped in Q2, and Musk himself told shareholders that the company “could have a few rough quarters.” Musk blames brand drag and model delays as sales sink Tesla remains under pressure from intense local competition and political fallout tied to Musk’s public behavior, with his ties to President Donald Trump’s administration and controversial comments having alienated consumers in key European markets, giving competitors like BYD more room to grow. Internally, Tesla also has nothing new to show buyers. It hasn’t refreshed its lineup in years. The company said it’s working on a lower-cost electric model and hopes to begin volume production in the second half of 2025, but that’s too far out to help current numbers. Meanwhile, analysts watching BYD don’t seem too worried about its summer dip. Yuqian Ding, who leads EV research at HSBC, wrote that slower sales in July were caused by weak local demand and tighter control of dealership inventory. Ding said BYD’s stricter pricing policy was intentional and likely to “support more sustainable margin expansion ahead,” even if it means short-term volume pain. In the domestic market, BYD still leads but faces trouble from within. The hybrid decline in Q2 has made its overseas expansion more urgent. With price controls back home and the discount tool now restricted, the company is using exports to meet its targets. The fact that it moved vehicles into Western Europe from Southeast Asia shows how far the firm is willing to go to stay ahead. This year, BYD formally overtook Tesla in global EV production volume. But maintaining that lead will depend on how it handles the second half of 2025, when internal pressures meet external restrictions. On the other side, Tesla is bleeding market share even as the EV category grows without it. Unless Musk can turn the story around by 2025’s end, BYD’s lead won’t just be temporary — it’ll be permanent.

The firm’s asset management arm saw $170 million in net inflows, while its capital markets unit benefited from Ethereum staking income. CEO Jean-Marie Mognetti also said that the company is preparing for a US listing that could unlock even more value. CoinShares Posts Strong Q2 CoinShares reported strong second-quarter results for 2025, with its assets under management (AUM) climbing 26% to $3.46 billion despite facing large outflows. The increase happened during a quarter that saw $126 million withdrawn from the company’s XBT Provider products, though surging crypto prices offset those losses. Chief executive Jean-Marie Mognetti pointed out that Bitcoin and Ethereum’s continued rally into August positions the company for an even stronger second half of the year. He also revealed that CoinShares is preparing for a United States listing, which he said could “unlock substantial value” for shareholders. CoinShares Q2 financial highlights (Source: CoinShares ) Financially, CoinShares reported a net profit of $32.4 million in the quarter, which is an almost 2% increase from the $31.8 million a year earlier and a 26% jump from the $24 million that was recorded in Q1 . The performance followed a difficult first quarter, which saw profits drop 42.2% year-over-year. Mognetti explained that broader macroeconomic headwinds outpaced market movements during the period but mentioned that the crypto sector is undergoing a “wholesale transformation” of the global economic order. The firm’s asset management division brought in $30 million in management fees, driven by $170 million of net inflows into its CoinShares Physical products. This was its second-strongest quarter on record. Meanwhile, its capital markets arm generated $11.3 million in income and gains, bolstered by $4.3 million from Ethereum staking. As CoinShares moves closer to a potential US listing, competition in the crypto exchange-traded product (ETP) space is heating up. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart reported that 92 crypto ETPs are currently awaiting approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|MARKET|BTC|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-29 13:30:00

That’s what they called the Altseason in the good old days. But now institutions have stepped in, and they aren’t allocating funds toward low‑cap hidden gems. Take SharpLink Gaming, a Nasdaq-listed crypto treasury firm that just purchased $601 million worth of Ethereum (143,593 ETH), boosting its holdings to nearly 740,000 ETH (valued around $3.2 billion) and staking most of it for yield. The institutional capital locked into Ethereum as a strategic reserve play. And SharpLink isn’t alone. MicroStrategy continues to double down on Bitcoin, recently buying 3,081 BTC for $357 million . Its holdings now total an astonishing 632,457 BTC, valued at roughly $46.5 billion—cementing the company as the single largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with ambitions to boost yield targets into 2025. Even the most conservative institutions are stepping in. Harvard University’s endowment fund disclosed new exposure to Bitcoin through BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust. Regulatory filings show Harvard’s position alone at $116 million, a sign that even Ivy League treasuries are allocating to BTC in compliance-friendly vehicles. The implications are clear: big players aren’t rotating liquidity into microcaps the way retail once did. Every ETH SharpLink stake and every BTC locked by MicroStrategy or Harvard is capital permanently removed from circulation — and it’s staying there, not flowing into random altcoin pumps. That means the playbook of past bull runs, where profits from BTC and ETH cascaded into obscure tokens and created “altseasons,” is dead. The faucet has been turned off. Why Altseasons Will Be Shorter, Softer Or Never Even if there is an altseason, it won’t look like the old days. In 2017 or 2021, communities moved liquidity downstream. Some analysts don’t even believe there will be an altseason in 2025-2026 at all. At most, we get a “selective altseason” limited to a handful of majors. One of the most decisive shifts in this cycle is the selective nature of institutional flows . Unlike retail traders of past bull runs, institutions can’t—and won’t—throw money at speculative tokens with no liquidity or compliance track record. Funds have mandates. They need deep liquidity, regulatory clarity, and measurable security before deploying capital. That means assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, or BNB attract inflows, while the thousands of tokens sitting below a $1M market cap are effectively invisible. For institutions, these microcaps don’t even register as investable. This shift has two critical consequences: No downstream liquidity: In 2017 and 2021, ETH profits trickled down into meme coins and small alts, fueling altseason manias. Now, liquidity is captured and held in majors. Higher quality filter: Institutions are effectively raising the bar. Only tokens with transparent governance, strong exchanges, and compliance-ready profiles will see meaningful inflows. For the broader market, that means the “lottery ticket” days of random small-cap explosions are gone. Altcoin rallies, if they happen at all, will be shorter, more selective, and centered on majors. Where Multipliers Still Exist: ICO Fund Raising Does this mean no more 100x? Not exactly. The opportunity has simply moved. Today, the realistic path is structured presales where you enter at the absolute floor price. Why ICO-style tokens still make sense: Minimal entry price. Presales start at fractions of a cent, creating huge gaps to listing price. Clear mechanics. Transparent tokenomics, vesting, and liquidity locks build trust — something meme/celebrity coins lack. Growth runway. When a project lists at $0.10 after a presale at $0.001, the math alone gives early investors massive multiples. Unlike chasing altseason dreams, ICO tokens and product-driven presales still offer that explosive upside without relying on institutional liquidity trickling down. XYZVerse.io is one of such projects in presale with a massive upside potential. What’s the Upside for XYZVerse? XYZVerse ($XYZ) is an example of a project that might actually deliver on the promise of massive altcoin gains. Starting at just $0.0001 , XYZVerse’s presale applies a dynamic pricing model: every $100,000 raised increments the price, creating real-time upward momentum. So far, the XYZ price has been increased to $0.0053 , with over $15 million raised already. If the token lists at $0.10 , it could yield a 1,000× multiple for the earliest participants. Even if listing lands below that, the first one to two weeks could see a spike to $0.15–$0.25 , especially if exchange listings and FOMO kick in. If XYZ continues executing—building its sports-brand utility, locking liquidity, and rolling out its roadmap—there’s a realistic path to $0.20–$0.40 over the longer 6–12 month horizon . What the Multiples Could Look Like: Listing at $0.10 = a potential 1,000× from presale floor Conservative launch (e.g. $0.15–$0.25) = 1,500–2,500× If established across platforms and media buzz builds, longer-term upside to $0.20–$0.40 , or roughly 2,000–4,000× , could materialize. What is XYZVerse? XYZVerse is the latest meme coin making waves in 2025, positioning itself at the intersection of crypto culture and global sports fandom. The project ties directly into sports betting through a partnership with bookmaker.XYZ, offering token holders perks like exclusive rewards and play-to-earn experiences. Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype, XYZVerse is building out an ecosystem of staking apps, Telegram-based mini games, and deflationary tokenomics that aim to sustain long-term interest. Backed by community enthusiasm—boasting tens of thousands of followers across X and Telegram—and audited by leading security firms, the coin is quickly shaping up as a contender to watch when it lists later this year. Conclusion The 100×+ altcoin unicorns of old might be gone, but structured presales like XYZVerse are picking up the slack, combining community momentum, scarcity, viable utility, and early entry. If execution plays out, the upside could eclipse even classic altseason gains.

The cryptocurrency, ranked at position 62 by market capitalisation, fell 3.77% to $0.0243 in the past 24 hours, underperforming the broader crypto market. Despite solid progress in staking adoption and growing institutional interest, short-term traders appear to be taking profits, fueling a wave of sell-offs. Market pullback weighs on VeChain The broader crypto market has faced turbulence, with total capitalisation dropping 3.35% to $3.79 trillion and liquidity dipping 1.62% as investors shifted capital into Bitcoin (BTC), leaving altcoins under pressure. As a result, while VeChain’s trading volume climbed nearly 17% to $74.6 million, the increased volume reflected panic-driven selling rather than fresh accumulation. Notably, investor sentiment has cooled, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index holding at neutral levels while the Altcoin Season Index shows 57% of participants now prefer BTC over alternatives. This rotation has placed additional strain on mid-cap assets like VeChain, which remain highly correlated to market-wide shifts. Altcoin season index chart | Source: CoinMarketCap Resistance rejection sparks selling pressure Earlier, Vechain (VET) had rallied to an intraday high of $0.02585, according to Coinglass , briefly breaking through the resistance at the $0.02566 Fibonacci retracement level, though this breakout proved short-lived. The failure triggered a sell-off that pushed prices below short-term moving averages. On the four-hour chart, the EMA20 has also crossed beneath the EMA50, signalling a bearish turn, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has slipped to around 54, indicating fading buying pressure. Momentum indicators reinforce the cautious outlook. The MACD histogram, which had turned slightly positive, has begun to flatten, pointing to reduced bullish strength. VeChain price analysis | Source: TradingView VET staking adoption offsets long-term concerns Even as short-term technicals look fragile, VeChain’s underlying ecosystem continues to show progress. Since the launch of its StarGate staking program on July 1, more than $140 million in assets have been locked in smart contracts. The platform’s redesigned staking architecture, powered by the Galactica upgrade, uses non-fungible tokens to record positions, enhancing transparency and composability. More than 5.8 billion VET have already been locked, and blockchain data confirms that 515,000 VTHO tokens were burned over the past month, reducing overall selling pressure.

Vechain outlook remains cautious but hopeful With the VeChain price currently pinned below its 200-day EMA at $0.0265, a decisive break above that point could open the door to a rally toward $0.0338, representing a potential 32% breakout from current levels. For now, however, the failed breakout above $0.02566 has underscored persistent resistance, with sellers quick to act on signs of weakness. While fundamentals tied to staking adoption and institutional engagement strengthen the long-term case for VeChain, traders remain wary of near-term volatility.

US President Donald Trump is also pressuring Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to cut interest rates quickly, stating that they are late in reducing interest rates. At this point, FED member Christopher Waller, who is close to Trump and supports the interest rate cut, announced that he supports the interest rate cut in September. Speaking at the Miami Economic Club, Waller announced that he supports a 25 basis point cut in interest rates in September and said he expects additional cuts in the next 3-6 months. Christopher Waller, who is considered a potential candidate for the next Fed President, said in July that he also wanted to cut interest rates and that his determination on this issue has increased since then. At this point, Waller stated that reducing interest rates would be the right move and risk management due to the positive trend in core inflation and labor market risks. With core inflation running near 2%, market-based long-term inflation expectations firmly anchored, and the likelihood of undesirable labor market weakness increasing, the correct risk management strategy is for the FOMC to cut the policy rate now. “As of today, I expect further rate cuts within the next three to six months. The pace of rate cuts will be determined by incoming data.” Waller also commented on the recently enacted US stablecoin regulation bill, the GENIUS Act, saying he sees it as a good starting point. *This is not investment advice.

These innovative assets are bridging the gap between traditional safe-haven investments and the cutting-edge technology of blockchain. Recently, the combined market capitalization of two prominent Ethereum-based tokenized gold assets, Tether Gold (XAUT) and Pax Gold (PAXG), soared to an impressive $2.2 billion. This significant milestone, reported by Unfolded citing data from Token Terminal, highlights a growing investor appetite for digital representations of physical gold. What Exactly is Tokenized Gold, and How Does it Work? You might be wondering, what exactly is tokenized gold ? Simply put, it’s a digital token on a blockchain that represents a specific amount of physical gold. Each token is typically backed by real, allocated gold stored in secure vaults. For instance: Tether Gold (XAUT): Each XAUT token represents one troy ounce of physical gold held in a Swiss vault. Pax Gold (PAXG): Similarly, PAXG tokens are backed by one troy ounce of London Good Delivery gold bars. These tokens live on the Ethereum network, which means they benefit from its security, transparency, and global accessibility. Therefore, they are easy to buy, sell, and transfer, unlike traditional physical gold which can be cumbersome to manage. Why Are Investors Turning to Tokenized Gold? The surge in market cap for tokenized gold assets like XAUT and PAXG isn’t happening by accident. Several compelling reasons are attracting both individual and institutional investors: Accessibility and Liquidity: Unlike physical gold, which often requires brokers and specialized storage, tokenized gold can be traded 24/7 on various cryptocurrency exchanges. This offers unprecedented liquidity and ease of access. Fractional Ownership: Investors can buy small fractions of a gold bar, making gold investment accessible to a wider audience, regardless of their capital. Transparency: The blockchain ledger provides a transparent and immutable record of ownership, and issuers often provide regular audits of their physical gold reserves. Hedge Against Inflation: Gold has historically served as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. Tokenized versions offer this same benefit within a digital framework. Reduced Custodial Risks: While physical gold requires secure storage, tokenized gold holders can self-custody their assets in their digital wallets, reducing reliance on third-party custodians, though this also introduces personal responsibility for security. This combination of traditional asset stability with blockchain innovation presents a powerful proposition. What Challenges Lie Ahead for Digital Gold Assets? While the future of tokenized gold looks bright, it’s important to acknowledge potential challenges. The regulatory landscape for digital assets is still evolving globally. Different jurisdictions may impose varying rules on tokenized commodities, which could impact their widespread adoption. Moreover, while blockchain offers transparency, ensuring the physical gold backing is consistently audited and secure remains crucial. Investors must always conduct their due diligence on the issuer’s reputation and audit practices to mitigate risks. Unlocking the Future: What’s Next for Tokenized Gold? The impressive $2.2 billion market cap signals strong confidence in the concept of digital gold. As the cryptocurrency ecosystem matures, we can anticipate further innovation in the tokenized gold space. We might see new platforms, improved integration with decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, and even more institutional interest. The ease of transfer and settlement offered by blockchain technology could make tokenized gold an attractive option for cross-border transactions and collateral in various financial instruments. In conclusion, the journey of tokenized gold from a niche concept to a multi-billion dollar market is a testament to the power of blockchain to transform traditional assets. It offers a compelling blend of gold’s enduring value and the digital world’s efficiency. As investors seek diversified portfolios and accessible safe havens, tokenized gold is increasingly proving its worth as a significant player in the evolving financial landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the difference between Tether Gold (XAUT) and Pax Gold (PAXG)? Both XAUT and PAXG are tokenized gold assets backed by physical gold. The main differences lie in their issuers (Tether vs. Paxos), the specific vaults where the gold is stored, and potentially the fees and redemption processes associated with each token. 2. How is tokenized gold backed by physical gold? Each tokenized gold unit, such as XAUT or PAXG, represents a specific amount of physical gold (typically one troy ounce) held in secure, audited vaults by the issuer. The issuer maintains a reserve of physical gold that matches the number of tokens in circulation. 3. Can I really own a fraction of a gold bar with tokenized gold? Yes, absolutely! One of the key benefits of tokenized gold is fractional ownership. You can buy and sell small portions of a gold bar, making gold investment more accessible than purchasing a full physical bar. 4. What are the main benefits of investing in tokenized gold over traditional gold? Tokenized gold offers enhanced liquidity (24/7 trading), fractional ownership, greater transparency through blockchain, and easier transferability compared to physical gold. It combines gold’s traditional value with blockchain’s efficiency. 5. Are there any risks associated with tokenized gold? Yes, like any investment, risks exist. These include regulatory uncertainties in the evolving crypto space, potential smart contract vulnerabilities, and the need to trust the issuer’s physical gold reserves and auditing practices. Personal responsibility for wallet security is also crucial for self-custody. Did you find this article insightful?

And Solana whales are eyeing this presale. Instead of purchasing BTC directly, investors can now join a tokenized mining model that shares actual mining rewards. This puts Bitfrac on the radar of those looking for the best crypto presale to buy right now . Meanwhile, Solana whales have been buying the recent dip, signaling confidence in the broader crypto recovery. Together, these moves highlight how investors are balancing ecosystem-based growth with income-generating utility tokens like Bitfrac. For those browsing the latest crypto presale list or looking to buy presale crypto backed by real infrastructure, Bitfrac brings something unique. It’s not just another coin; it’s tied to Bitcoin mining revenue, making it one of the top crypto presales with tangible value. Bitfrac: Earn Bitcoin Without Buying BTC Bitfrac is reshaping how investors think about mining access. Through its new crypto token presale, anyone can own a piece of a large-scale industrial mining operation by simply purchasing BFT tokens. This allows people to benefit from Bitcoin earnings without directly managing hardware or holding BTC themselves. With more than 2,000 participants already involved, Stage 2 of the Bitfrac presale is gaining traction. Each BFT token is priced at $0.024, and the total raise stands at $4M. Investors are joining quickly, with limited availability remaining before the next pricing stage begins. This project joins a growing wave of crypto presale projects that deliver both access and utility. Bitfrac stands out among crypto coins on presale because it’s backed by real mining power. By joining early, investors lock in lower prices and begin their path toward monthly Bitcoin earnings. Solana Rally Continues Despite Market Pullbacks Solana (SOL) has been one of the top performers in July, surging nearly 50% to trade around $182. This movement is not random. It follows a golden cross and breakout from a symmetrical triangle pattern, both well-known bullish signals. Analysts are now tracking possible targets between $300 and $500 if the current momentum continues. Some even suggest that if ETF news and institutional flows grow stronger, a move toward $1,000 may enter the conversation. Solana’s network growth, along with rising adoption, makes it a key project on any investor’s watchlist. As large players continue buying dips, confidence in the ecosystem remains strong despite short-term volatility. Passive Bitcoin Earnings Made Simple With Bitfrac, token holders benefit from industrial Bitcoin mining operations. The infrastructure runs non-stop, managed by a dedicated team to maximize output and energy efficiency. Monthly payouts are delivered via smart contracts, meaning holders receive Bitcoin earnings directly into their wallets, no management or technical knowledge required. This is part of what positions Bitfrac among the most compelling token presales in 2025. For those interested in passive income from mining but without the traditional hurdles, Bitfrac brings clarity and consistency through automated on-chain rewards. Final Words on Bitfrac and Crypto Presales Bitfrac joins the growing category of utility-based crypto ICO presale options with real-world use cases. While many crypto presale tokens offer ideas, Bitfrac offers a functioning mining model that’s already operating at scale. At $0.024, the price is still within Stage 2, and over $4M has already been committed by early participants. This places Bitfrac firmly within the top crypto presales for those seeking transparency and passive income. If you’re evaluating the crypto presale list for 2025, Bitfrac deserves a close look. It offers the chance to buy presale crypto tied to real infrastructure, not speculation, and provides stable, on-chain payouts backed by Bitcoin mining.

At the time, bitcoin’s price had just retraced to under $112,000 after a week of downward pressure in anticipation of Jerome Powell’s speech from Jackson Hole. As the Fed Chair hinted about potential rate cuts as soon as September, BTC reacted with an immediate surge that drove it north by over five grand to over $117,000. Most altcoins followed suit, including ETH, which finally broke its previous all-time high and set a new one at around $4,900. However, these relief rallies were short-lived. The weekend was calm at first, with BTC retracing to $115,000, but then came Sunday evening, and the landscape changed for the worse. Before it did, though, ETH jumped to another ATH of $4,950, and then the entire market crashed within minutes, leaving over $300 million in longs liquidated in just one hour. After a brief bounce on Monday, the bears resumed control once again and drove bitcoin to its lowest position in almost seven weeks, at just under $109,000 on Tuesday morning. The fight for supremacy has continued ever since, with the bulls taking BTC to a weekly peak of $113,600 yesterday, only to lose the battle as the asset dipped below $109,500 earlier today. It has regained some traction now and stands above $110,000, but the overall market structure seems rather shaky. Its market cap has dropped to $2.2 trillion after a 1.5% weekly decline, while its dominance over the alts stands at 56.4%. Even ETH, which has been a top performer as of late, has lost a big chunk of its value since its peak on Sunday evening and currently fights for $4,400. In contrast, CRO became the top gainer this week, but more on this in a second.

Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) is making a bold move to solidify its position in the digital economy. They have proposed establishing a dedicated Japan’s FSA crypto unit , signaling a significant step forward in how digital assets are managed and regulated within the country. What is This Crucial Japan’s FSA Crypto Unit? The FSA recently included a groundbreaking proposal in its 2026 budget request. This proposal aims to create a brand-new department, specifically named the “Cryptocurrency and Innovation Division.” This division won’t just be another bureaucratic arm; it’s designed to be a focused hub for all things related to digital assets and the rapidly evolving landscape of cashless payments. This initiative underscores Japan’s proactive approach to the crypto space. By centralizing oversight, the FSA aims to: Enhance regulatory clarity: Providing clear guidelines for businesses and investors. Boost consumer protection: Safeguarding users from potential risks in the volatile crypto market. Foster innovation: Creating a supportive environment for new technologies while mitigating risks. This dedicated Japan’s FSA crypto unit reflects a growing global trend among major economies to bring more structure to the decentralized world of cryptocurrencies. Why is Japan’s FSA Crypto Unit Necessary Now? The cryptocurrency market has exploded in recent years, evolving from a niche interest into a significant financial sector. With this growth comes an undeniable need for robust oversight. Japan, known for its forward-thinking regulatory stance, recognizes this urgency. The creation of the Cryptocurrency and Innovation Division addresses several key factors: Market Maturation: Digital assets are no longer fringe; they are integrating into mainstream finance. Investor Protection: As more people engage with crypto, the need to protect them from scams, hacks, and market manipulation becomes paramount. Technological Advancement: The pace of innovation in fintech and digital payments demands specialized expertise within regulatory bodies. Indeed, a dedicated Japan’s FSA crypto unit ensures that regulators can keep pace with technological shifts, rather than playing catch-up. What Benefits Will Japan’s FSA Crypto Unit Bring? The establishment of such a specialized division promises a multitude of advantages for Japan’s financial ecosystem and its participants. Firstly, it will likely lead to more streamlined and efficient regulatory processes. Businesses operating in the crypto space can expect clearer guidelines, reducing uncertainty and fostering a more stable environment for growth. Moreover, enhanced oversight means greater investor confidence. When a robust regulatory body like the Japan’s FSA crypto unit is actively involved, it signals a commitment to market integrity. This can attract more institutional investment and legitimate businesses, further solidifying Japan’s position as a leader in digital finance. It also aims to facilitate the safe adoption of cashless payments, aligning with global trends towards a digital economy. What Potential Challenges Face the New Japan’s FSA Crypto Unit? While the prospects are bright, establishing and effectively operating a new division like the Japan’s FSA crypto unit will undoubtedly come with its own set of challenges. One primary hurdle will be attracting and retaining top talent with deep expertise in both traditional finance and cutting-edge blockchain technology. The crypto space evolves at an incredible pace, and regulators must stay agile and informed. Another challenge involves striking the right balance between robust regulation and fostering innovation. Overly restrictive rules could stifle growth, while insufficient oversight could expose investors to undue risk. The new unit will need to navigate this delicate equilibrium, ensuring that Japan remains a competitive and attractive hub for digital asset businesses without compromising on safety and security. Continuous education and adaptation will be key to its success. In conclusion, the proposed Japan’s FSA crypto unit marks a truly significant development. It underscores Japan’s commitment to creating a well-regulated yet innovative environment for digital assets and cashless payments. This proactive approach not only aims to protect consumers and foster market stability but also positions Japan as a formidable leader in the global digital finance landscape. It’s a clear signal that the future of finance is digital, and Japan is ready to lead the charge. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the main purpose of Japan’s FSA crypto unit? The primary purpose of the new Cryptocurrency and Innovation Division is to provide dedicated oversight for digital assets and cashless payments, ensuring regulatory clarity, consumer protection, and fostering innovation within Japan’s financial system. When is the Japan’s FSA crypto unit expected to be established? The proposal for this unit was included in the FSA’s 2026 budget request. If approved, its establishment would likely follow the budget’s implementation. How will this new unit impact crypto investors in Japan? The unit aims to enhance investor protection by creating a more stable and regulated environment, potentially reducing risks associated with scams and market volatility, thereby increasing confidence in digital asset investments. Will the Japan’s FSA crypto unit encourage innovation or strict regulation? The unit is designed to balance both. While it will establish clearer regulations for stability and protection, it also aims to foster an environment where innovation in digital assets and cashless payments can thrive responsibly. How does Japan’s approach compare to other countries? Japan has historically been proactive in crypto regulation.

This week, Cango unveiled an impressive milestone in its Cango BTC mining operations, successfully mining a total of 153.2 Bitcoin. This significant haul underscores the company’s growing presence and strategic commitment to the digital asset space. What Drives Cango’s Remarkable BTC Mining Success? Cango’s journey into large-scale Bitcoin mining began with a substantial investment. The company previously acquired a staggering $256 million worth of BTC miners from industry giant Bitmain. This strategic move signaled a clear intent to diversify its business model and tap into the lucrative world of cryptocurrency production. Furthermore, Cango’s consistent performance highlights the efficiency and scale of its current Cango BTC mining infrastructure. This week’s 153.2 BTC adds to an already considerable portfolio. It demonstrates a robust and well-managed operation, capable of consistent output. The commitment to such a large-scale endeavor also positions Cango as a serious player in the global Bitcoin ecosystem. Why Are Cango’s Bitcoin Holdings So Significant? Perhaps even more telling than the weekly mining figures is Cango’s current holding strategy. The company announced it made no sales during this period, bringing its total Bitcoin reserves to an astounding 5,126.8 BTC. This decision to hold, rather than sell, speaks volumes about Cango’s long-term outlook on Bitcoin’s value. Such substantial holdings have several implications: Asset Base: They provide Cango with a significant asset base, offering potential for future growth as Bitcoin’s value fluctuates. Market Confidence: By accumulating these assets, Cango showcases confidence in the cryptocurrency market’s trajectory. Sentiment Influence: This approach also influences broader market sentiment, as large institutional players like Cango signal their belief in Bitcoin’s enduring worth, impacting overall perceptions of Cango BTC mining and investment. The Mechanics of Large-Scale Cango BTC Mining Operating a large-scale Bitcoin mining facility requires sophisticated infrastructure and considerable resources. Companies like Cango invest heavily in specialized hardware, known as ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits), which are designed to solve complex computational problems required to validate transactions and mine new Bitcoin. These operations also demand significant energy consumption and efficient cooling systems to maintain optimal performance. For Cango, the strategic acquisition of Bitmain miners provides access to cutting-edge technology. Managing these resources effectively ensures consistent output and profitability. While challenges like fluctuating energy costs and hardware maintenance exist, the rewards, as seen in Cango’s weekly Cango BTC mining results, can be substantial. What Does Cango’s Strategy Mean for the Crypto Market? Cango’s decision to accumulate Bitcoin rather than sell immediately offers an interesting perspective on institutional investment trends. When major entities like Cango choose to hold their mined BTC, it reduces the available supply on exchanges, which can, in theory, exert upward pressure on prices over time. This strategy aligns with a long-term, “hodling” mentality often seen among seasoned crypto investors. For individual investors, observing such institutional moves can provide valuable insights. It suggests that large players anticipate future appreciation for Bitcoin. Therefore, understanding the strategies of companies involved in Cango BTC mining can help inform personal investment decisions and market analysis. This ongoing accumulation by Cango highlights a broader trend of institutional adoption and confidence in digital assets. In conclusion, Cango’s consistent and impressive Cango BTC mining performance, coupled with its strategic decision to accumulate rather than sell, firmly establishes it as a significant entity in the cryptocurrency landscape. The company’s substantial Bitcoin holdings reflect a bullish long-term outlook and provide a compelling example of institutional commitment to digital assets. As the crypto market evolves, Cango’s actions will undoubtedly continue to be a focal point for observers and investors alike, showcasing the potential for traditional businesses to thrive in the decentralized economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Cango’s primary business? Cango is primarily a Chinese auto trading service platform that has diversified its operations into cryptocurrency mining. How much Bitcoin did Cango mine this week? Cango announced it mined 153.2 Bitcoin (BTC) this week. What is Cango’s total Bitcoin holding? As of their latest announcement, Cango holds a total of 5,126.8 BTC, having made no sales this past week. Why is Cango holding onto its mined Bitcoin instead of selling it? Cango’s decision to hold its mined Bitcoin suggests a long-term bullish outlook on Bitcoin’s value, indicating confidence in its future appreciation. How does Cango’s Bitcoin mining operation impact the crypto market? When large entities like Cango accumulate Bitcoin, it can reduce the available supply on exchanges, potentially influencing market sentiment and price dynamics by signaling institutional confidence.

The steadiness of Bitcoin and institutional investment in crypto through the ETFs has provided an environment in which altcoins are beginning to excel. As an investor, this implies that opportunities are not limited to the market giants. Ethereum and Solana have already demonstrated their leading technology and adoption, and other new networks like SUI have been performing well in the market. With October fast approaching, investors are looking for the best altcoins to buy now, aiming to position themselves before the next big run. Analysts noted that Ethereum and Solana would bring returns with the approaching bull run. At the same time, however, lesser, yet high-potential tokens are gaining attention as well, even despite the insane potential mentioned above. One particular gem, still priced under $0.01, is turning heads for its explosive growth potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE has entered the spotlight thanks to whale activity and rising FOMO. Forecasts point to a staggering 500x upside, making it one of the most talked-about hidden opportunities heading into the final quarter of the year. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum is the backbone of non-fungible tokens NFTs, decentralized finance DeFi and business-related blockchain applications. In 2025, Ethereum has seen a positive change in the network efficiency through scalability developments like EIP-4844 (Proto-Danksharding) and the May Pectra upgrade. These advances have decreased the costs of gas and have increased network Layer-2 speeds and Ethereum is now more appealing to developers and to organizations. Institutional adoption is on the rise, with asset tokenization using Ethereum infrastructure seeing involvement of the likes of BlackRock and other financial giants. Ether too hit a new record high of more than $4950 earlier this year and remained around $4400. The ETF inflows are soaring nonetheless, which shows that the ETH wager is not lowered by institutions. Forecasts for December 2025 indicate that Ethereum price will trade in the range between $4,100 and $5,900 with a slight probability of $7,500. Investors will insist on maintaining Ethereum as a core position with a huge upside potential. Solana (SOL) Solana has made a comeback with impressive speed and efficiency after previously failed attempts and it is now among one of the fastest and most efficient blockchains. Firedancer validator client dramatically enhanced network reliability and performance. The real-world use cases are also increasing and Solana Pay has been implemented into Shopify, which brings the possibility of retail payments worldwide. Institutional interest is also a major driver. Galaxy Digital, Multicoin and Jump Crypto are in the process of raising $1 billion to create the largest Solana treasury, already approved by the Solana Foundation. At its current price of roughly $189, Solana has managed to cross above the mark of 200 all through this week. Analysts estimate a target range of between $60 and 120 by the end of 2025, with the possible approval of the ETF and large institutional-investor in flows driving it to a higher end of that range. The use of Solana as an investment option has already remained one of the leading choices among those considering October and further. SUI In 2025, SUI has emerged as a leading Layer-1 blockchain. Its mutable architecture, that relies on the Move programming language, allows it to run in parallel and to have low latency. This renders SUI suitable for high-performance dApps and digital assets. Adoption has gained momentum in Sygnum and AMINA, which offer custody and trade of SUI, and can now reach the institutional arena via pilot-program ice-breaking offerings, including the Athens Stock Exchange. Defi is also rising, it grew by 19% in 2023 and the cross-chain alliances, such as Wormhole and OKX Wallet are providing liquidity. It is estimated to reach the terminal price of $3-$4 at the end of 2025, and some long-term outlook projections place SUI price to exceed the $10 mark. With its ecosystem gaining momentum, it is clear SUI is one of the potential Layer-1s. MAGACOIN FINANCE — Hidden Gem Under $0.01 Analysts predict Ethereum and Solana could gain 20x to 30x by year-end, but a hidden gem priced under $0.01 is drawing even bigger attention . MAGACOIN FINANCE tokens could soar over 500x in value and the whales have already quietly been buying their position early, locking themselves into this before the masses wake up to what they have missed. With the visible rise in the bullish sentiment and the heightening of the FOMO, it is being celebrated as one of the best altcoins to buy in October 2025 . Unlike the bigger players, MAGACOIN’s appeal comes from its early-stage growth potential. Investors consider it an opportunity to enter the market at the bottom before the rest of the market does so, similar to the initial days of PEPE or SHIB. The excitement around MAGACOIN shows that investors are willing to diversify beyond established names, especially when the upside could be life-changing. Analysts Rank MAGACOIN FINANCE a Leading Crypto Presale for 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE is often featured in analyst watchlists as one of the top crypto presales for 2025 , and for good reason. The team’s commitment to full transparency — including public audits and KYC verification — builds unmatched trust. These fundamentals give investors peace of mind and separate the project from unverified alternatives in the market. Final Take Ethereum, Solana, and SUI all provide solid fundamentals, institutional support, and burgeoning ecosystems, which makes them solid bets this month. Their upgrade efforts, their integration, and increased use promise to keep them at the center of the broader crypto market offering stability and growth to investors. These three are the must-haves of those who want safer investments that will steadily increase over time. MAGACOIN FINANCE is, however, a different kind of opportunity. The altcoin has a low entry price and projections that could see it have a potential 500x increase , a figure that few coins in 2025 can offer.

Structure and Benchmarking According to the S-1 registration filed on Thursday, the ETF will track SEI’s market value using the CF SEI-Dollar Reference Rate, developed by CF Benchmarks. The benchmark aggregates pricing data from multiple cryptocurrency exchanges, ensuring standardized valuation. Shares of the fund will be priced daily based on this index. The ETF is designed as a passive vehicle, meaning it will reflect SEI’s spot price without employing leverage, derivatives, or speculative trading strategies. Coinbase Custody Trust Company has been appointed to safeguard the fund’s SEI holdings. About the SEI Network SEI is the native asset of the Sei Network, a Layer-1 blockchain launched in August 2023. The network specializes in high-performance trading infrastructure for decentralized exchanges and marketplaces. The token serves multiple roles, including gas fee payments and governance participation, while also being considered for staking rewards. Staking and Custody Considerations 21Shares stated in the filing that the fund may eventually stake SEI to enhance returns. However, it emphasized that such a step would only be taken after evaluating potential regulatory, legal, and tax risks. While staking remains under review, the firm has not ruled out exploring liquid staking options in the future if deemed compliant. All SEI transactions related to fund operations will be handled by vetted third-party counterparties. These entities must meet standards of financial strength, regulatory oversight, and settlement reliability. Subscription and Redemption Mechanisms Authorized Participants will be able to subscribe or redeem shares either through cash or in-kind transfers. For cash transactions, a designated counterparty will convert U.S. dollars into SEI before depositing them with Coinbase Custody. In in-kind transactions, SEI tokens will be delivered directly to the Trust, which will then issue corresponding shares after deducting fees. Redemptions will return SEI or its cash equivalent, depending on the arrangement. This dual-structure approach allows flexibility while maintaining regulatory safeguards. Seed Capital and Market Launch The filing also revealed that the Sponsor has seeded the ETF with an initial purchase of two shares priced at $50 each. An affiliate of the Sponsor is expected to acquire additional seed baskets following SEC approval. Once cleared, the ETF aims to list under a yet-to-be-determined ticker symbol. While the SEI ETF will not fall under the Investment Company Act or CFTC jurisdiction, it will operate within SEC regulatory parameters. The offering, unless extended, will remain open for up to three years. Investors trading on secondary markets will incur standard brokerage fees.

Key Takeaways: Eliza Labs has sued X Corp for allegedly abusing its platform power to copy proprietary AI technology. The suit claims X demanded a $600K annual license, then suspended Eliza’s account after refusal. Eliza alleges X used the access to replicate its no-code AI tools and suppress competition. The complaint, filed Wednesday in federal court in San Francisco, claims that X used its platform power to extract sensitive technical data from Eliza Labs before suspending the firm’s account without warning. X Corp Accused of Pressuring Eliza Labs Into $600K Annual License The filing alleges that X pressured Eliza Labs and its founder, Shaw Walters, to adopt an “Enterprise License” costing $50,000 per month, or $600,000 annually. After Eliza declined, its account, along with Walters’, was abruptly suspended. The suit claims this was part of a broader effort to eliminate competition and launch similar AI products under X’s own brand. “This case involves X Corp wielding its incredible monopoly power with perceived immunity from suit to deplatform users,” the complaint reads, adding that the company sought to “restrain competition” in the race to launch AI agents on its platform. Eliza Labs is known for elizaOS, an open-source protocol for autonomous AI agents reportedly valued at $2.5 billion. Shaw is suing X for anti competition the OG eliza repo used X’s graphQL endpoints (that our front ends query) to read and write to X. It did not use X’s paid API.

X… pic.twitter.com/E68UYuJUf1 — AzFlin (@AzFlin) August 29, 2025 In April, the company rolled out a no-code AI launchpad aimed at democratizing agent development for non-programmers. The lawsuit further accuses X of orchestrating a “coordinated, fraudulent, and anticompetitive effort” to gain access to Eliza’s development methods and leverage them for its own offerings. X has not publicly responded to the claims. Ethereum Gaming Network XAI Sues Elon Musk’s xAI Over Trademark Clash Last week, Ex Populus, the company behind the Ethereum-based gaming platform XAI, also filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company, xAI. The legal dispute centers on alleged marketplace confusion between Ex Populus’s federally registered “XAI” trademark and Musk’s similarly named venture, launched shortly after. Ex Populus claims Musk’s xAI crossed into its territory when he announced plans to launch an AI game studio in late 2024, amplifying confusion among consumers. The company noted instances where xAI’s chatbot Grok incorrectly referred to Ex Populus’s XAI brand as part of Musk’s operations, further blurring the line between the two. The lawsuit also cited reputational damage stemming from Musk’s controversial public persona and incidents involving xAI’s AI assistant making inflammatory remarks. Ex Populus argued that the confusion has undermined its brand identity and notes that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has already suspended some of Musk’s xAI trademark applications. Meanwhile, xAI has recently voiced plans to sue Apple over alleged antitrust violations, claiming the tech giant unfairly favors OpenAI’s ChatGPT in App Store rankings while suppressing xAI’s Grok chatbot.

The cryptocurrency market is once again capturing headlines as Bitcoin, the leading digital asset, experienced a notable Bitcoin price drop . According to recent market monitoring by Bitcoin World, BTC has fallen below the significant $110,000 threshold. This movement saw Bitcoin trading around $109,997.99 on major exchanges like Binance, marking a crucial moment for investors worldwide. This immediate shift has sparked widespread discussion and analysis across the crypto community. What Triggered This Bitcoin Price Drop? Understanding the forces behind a sudden market shift is essential. The recent Bitcoin price drop can be attributed to a confluence of factors. While no single event is solely responsible, market analysts often point to several key influences that contribute to such volatility. Profit-Taking: After periods of upward movement, some investors opt to sell their holdings to realize gains, naturally putting downward pressure on prices. Macroeconomic Concerns: Broader economic indicators, such as inflation data or interest rate changes, can influence investor sentiment across all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Regulatory Uncertainty: Ongoing discussions and potential new regulations in various jurisdictions can create apprehension among investors, leading to cautious trading. Liquidation Cascades: In highly leveraged markets, a small initial dip can trigger a chain reaction of forced selling, accelerating the Bitcoin price drop . These elements combine to create a dynamic environment where prices can fluctuate rapidly. Observing these underlying causes helps us better comprehend the market’s behavior. Navigating Volatility: What Does a Bitcoin Price Drop Mean for Investors? A significant Bitcoin price drop often brings mixed reactions. For short-term traders, it can represent increased risk and potential losses. However, for long-term investors, such dips are frequently viewed as opportunities. Understanding your investment strategy is key during these periods. Challenges for Short-Term Traders: Increased Risk: Rapid price movements make precise entry and exit points harder to predict. Emotional Trading: Fear and panic can lead to impulsive decisions, often resulting in losses. Margin Calls: Traders using leverage might face margin calls, forcing them to liquidate positions. Opportunities for Long-Term Holders: Accumulation Phase: Experienced investors often see a Bitcoin price drop as a chance to buy more BTC at a lower cost, a strategy known as ‘buying the dip’. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Regularly investing a fixed amount, regardless of price, can mitigate the impact of volatility over time. Re-evaluation: Dips provide an opportunity to re-evaluate portfolio allocations and long-term goals. Therefore, while the immediate dip below $110,000 might seem concerning, its implications vary greatly depending on an individual’s investment horizon and risk tolerance. Historical Context: Is This Bitcoin Price Drop Unprecedented? History shows that volatility is an inherent characteristic of the cryptocurrency market. The current Bitcoin price drop , while significant, is not an isolated event. Bitcoin has experienced numerous substantial corrections throughout its existence, often followed by periods of recovery and new all-time highs. Consider these points: Past Market Cycles: Bitcoin’s journey has been marked by dramatic peaks and valleys. Major corrections of 30%, 50%, or even more are not uncommon. Resilience: Despite these significant downturns, Bitcoin has consistently demonstrated resilience, eventually recovering and surpassing previous price levels. Growth Trajectory: Over its lifespan, Bitcoin’s overall growth trajectory has been upward, despite frequent short-term fluctuations. This historical perspective helps put the current market activity into context. It reminds us that market corrections are a natural part of any asset’s price discovery process, especially in a nascent and rapidly evolving sector like cryptocurrency. Expert Insights on the Recent Bitcoin Price Drop What are market experts saying about this latest Bitcoin price drop ? Many analysts suggest that such corrections are healthy for the market, flushing out excessive speculation and establishing a stronger foundation for future growth. They often advise investors to focus on the long-term fundamentals of Bitcoin rather than getting caught up in short-term price movements. Key takeaways from expert views: Long-Term Value: Experts reiterate Bitcoin’s role as a decentralized, scarce digital asset with increasing institutional adoption. Market Maturation: Volatility is expected to decrease as the market matures, but it remains a significant factor for now. Risk Management: Prudent risk management, including diversification and not investing more than one can afford to lose, is always recommended. The current dip below $110,000 serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic nature of the crypto market and the importance of informed decision-making. In conclusion, the recent Bitcoin price drop below $110,000 has undoubtedly created ripples across the crypto world. While it presents immediate challenges for some, it also highlights the market’s inherent volatility and cyclical nature. By understanding the contributing factors, navigating the implications for various investment strategies, and drawing upon historical context and expert insights, investors can approach these market movements with greater confidence and a clearer perspective. Staying informed and maintaining a long-term outlook remains paramount in the ever-evolving digital asset landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does a Bitcoin price drop mean for my existing investments? A Bitcoin price drop means the value of your existing holdings has temporarily decreased. However, it does not mean a permanent loss unless you sell your assets at the lower price. Many long-term investors view dips as opportunities to accumulate more. Q2: Is now a good time to buy Bitcoin after this dip? Whether it’s a good time to buy depends on your personal financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment strategy. A price dip can present an opportunity to buy at a lower cost, but it’s crucial to conduct your own research and consider your long-term goals. This is not financial advice. Q3: How often do such significant Bitcoin price drops occur? Significant Bitcoin price drops are a regular feature of the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin has experienced numerous corrections throughout its history, often several times a year. These are part of its natural market cycles and volatility. Q4: What are the main factors influencing Bitcoin’s price? Bitcoin’s price is influenced by a combination of factors, including market demand and supply, macroeconomic conditions, regulatory news, technological developments, institutional adoption, and overall market sentiment. These elements interact to create its dynamic price movements. Q5: Should I sell my Bitcoin if the price continues to fall? Selling during a downturn can lock in losses. It’s generally advised to avoid making emotional decisions. Revisit your original investment thesis and consider your long-term objectives. If you are concerned, consulting a financial advisor is recommended. Q6: How can I protect my investments during a Bitcoin price drop? Diversifying your portfolio, using dollar-cost averaging, setting stop-loss orders (if actively trading), and only investing what you can afford to lose are common strategies to manage risk during volatile periods. Staying informed and avoiding panic selling are also crucial. Did you find this analysis helpful?

However, within days of arriving at Meta, Shengjia Zhao, a co-creator of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, has already threatened to resign and even signed documents to rejoin OpenAI even after being named Meta’s chief AI scientist. FT reports that recent recruits left soon after joining, including machine-learning scientist Ethan Knight, former OpenAI researcher Avi Verma and research scientist Rishabh Agarwal. Meta has also recently lost generative-AI leaders Chaya Nayak and Loredana Crisan, who spent nine and ten years at the company, respectively. Earlier this year, Zuckerberg unveiled Meta’s Superintelligence Labs (MSL) as a moonshot meant to push the company to the front of the AI pack. Meta offered huge pay packages with hundreds of millions, as reported by Cryptopolitan, and somewhere near $1 billion to hire researchers from OpenAI, DeepMind, and Apple. Only a few months in, the unit is dealing with turnover . Wired also reported that at least three researchers have left. Meta scientist exits, quotes Zuckerberg on risk Rishabh Agarwal, hired from Google DeepMind on a reported $1 million salary, joined Meta in April and said on August 25 that this would be his final week at the lab. This is my last week at @AIatMeta . It was a tough decision not to continue with the new Superintelligence TBD lab, especially given the talent and compute density. But after 7.5 years across Google Brain, DeepMind, and Meta, I felt the pull to take on a different kind of risk.… — Rishabh Agarwal (@agarwl_) August 25, 2025 In a post on X, Agarwal said the choice was hard given the “talent and compute density” at MSL, but that he felt drawn to “a different kind of risk.” He also quoted Zuckerberg: “In a world that’s changing so fast, the biggest risk you can take is not taking any risk.” Reports pointed to restructurings, changing priorities and tight oversight at the highest level. The company recently divided its AI staff into four teams, creating more uncertainty inside MSL. DeepMind cofounder Demis Hassabis told Lex Fridman that frontier researchers want to “help influence how AGI plays out and steward the technology safely into the world,” rather than chase salaries. Anthropic cofounder Benjamin Mann put it bluntly that “My best case at Anthropic is we affect the future of humanity. My best case at Meta is we make money.” OpenAI gains from Meta’s losses OpenAI is benefiting from the departures. In addition to Verma and Knight, longtime Meta executive Chaya Nayak has joined OpenAI to work on special initiatives. OpenAI had criticized Meta’s recruiting style as “distasteful,” yet it is now taking in former Meta staff who say mission fit matters more than compensation. Meta has invested heavily to narrow the gap with competitors in AGI, tapping former Scale AI chief Alexandr Wang and ex-GitHub CEO Nat Friedman for leadership posts. Even so, the latest resignations indicate that big pay packages alone may not build or keep a unified frontier-AI group. For Zuckerberg, there is an irony in presenting himself as a bold risk-taker, as his hires now cite his own words as they exit. Whether Meta can stabilize its superintelligence push or keep shedding talent will set the tone for its next phase in the AI competition. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

In a move poised to redefine India’s technological landscape, billionaire Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries, has unveiled an ambitious plan to construct the nation’s AI backbone. This monumental undertaking isn’t a solo venture; it’s a strategic alliance forged with global tech titans Google Cloud and Meta, signaling a new era for innovation in the world’s most populous country. For anyone tracking the evolution of digital economies and the future of technology, this development represents a pivotal moment, promising to unleash unprecedented opportunities and reshape the global AI narrative. India AI Backbone: A New Era Dawns India is aggressively moving to assert its position in the global artificial intelligence arena, a space traditionally dominated by the U.S. and China. Mukesh Ambani’s announcement at Reliance Industries’ 48th annual general meeting marks the official launch of Reliance Intelligence, a new subsidiary dedicated to this monumental task. This venture is not just about building infrastructure; it’s about fostering a vibrant ecosystem for AI development, from enterprise tools to services across diverse sectors. Ambani emphasized that Reliance Intelligence will become a hub for “world-class researchers, engineers, designers, and product builders,” aiming to transform ideas into practical innovations for India and beyond. The establishment of a robust India AI Backbone is seen as crucial for national competitiveness and digital sovereignty. The vision extends to creating a national-scale AI infrastructure, leveraging Reliance’s vast network and energy assets. This strategic push is designed to ensure that India can not only catch up but also lead in specific areas of AI innovation, providing tailored solutions for its unique challenges and opportunities. The collaborative nature of this initiative, bringing in global expertise, underscores the scale of Ambani’s ambition and the critical importance of a unified national effort. Reliance AI: Powering India’s Digital Future The creation of Reliance Intelligence as a dedicated subsidiary underscores the seriousness of Reliance Industries’ commitment to artificial intelligence. This new entity will be the driving force behind the company’s comprehensive AI strategy, integrating advanced AI capabilities across its diverse portfolio. From telecommunications with Jio to retail and energy, the influence of Reliance AI is set to be pervasive, aiming to enhance efficiency, create new services, and deliver personalized experiences to millions of users. The company’s existing digital footprint, particularly through Jio, provides a unique advantage. Jio’s extensive network and user base offer an unparalleled platform for deploying and scaling AI solutions rapidly across the country. This integration will allow Reliance Intelligence to test, refine, and roll out AI-powered products and services at an unprecedented scale, making AI accessible to a broader population and fostering digital inclusion. The strategic move positions Reliance not just as a consumer-facing giant but also as a key enabler of enterprise-level AI transformation. Google Cloud India: Forging the Infrastructure Foundation A cornerstone of Ambani’s ambitious plan is the strategic partnership with Google Cloud. This collaboration is set to establish a dedicated AI cloud infrastructure within India, starting with a major data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat. This move is pivotal for several reasons: Localized Infrastructure: Bringing Google Cloud’s advanced AI capabilities directly to India ensures lower latency and better data governance, critical for sensitive applications. Scalable Solutions: The dedicated cloud region will empower businesses of all sizes, developers, and government bodies to access cutting-edge AI services without the need for massive upfront investments in hardware. Leveraging Jio’s Network: By combining Google Cloud’s expertise with Jio’s expansive network and Reliance’s energy assets, the partnership aims to support large-scale AI deployments efficiently and reliably. Google CEO Sundar Pichai himself lauded the partnership, stating, “As Reliance’s largest public cloud partner, Google Cloud is not only powering the company’s mission-critical workloads, but we are also innovating with you on advanced AI initiatives. This is only the beginning.” This strong endorsement from Google highlights the strategic importance of Google Cloud India in shaping the nation’s AI future and its potential for global impact. Meta AI India: Enterprise Solutions and Global Ambitions Beyond Google, Reliance has also cemented a significant joint venture with Meta, another major tech investor. This partnership focuses on building and scaling enterprise AI solutions, initially for customers in India, with an eye on select international markets. The financial commitment reflects the scale of this ambition, with a combined investment of ₹8.55 billion (approximately $100 million) under a 70:30 ownership split, respectively. What will this joint venture deliver? Llama-based Platform-as-a-Service: The core offering will be Meta’s Llama-based enterprise AI platform-as-a-service. This allows businesses to customize, deploy, and manage generative AI models. Diverse Use Cases: These AI models will cater to a wide array of business functions, including sales, marketing, IT, customer service, and finance, offering transformative capabilities. Pre-configured AI Solutions: The venture will also provide a suite of ready-to-use AI solutions, accelerating adoption for businesses seeking immediate AI integration. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta CEO, underscored the practical application of this partnership: “Through this joint venture, we’re putting Meta’s Llama models into real-world use.” This collaboration signifies a powerful push to democratize access to advanced generative AI tools for Indian enterprises, further solidifying the role of Meta AI India in the country’s technological advancement. The transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025. Mukesh Ambani’s Grand Vision: Beyond Partnerships Mukesh Ambani ‘s strategic moves extend far beyond these high-profile partnerships. His vision for Reliance’s role in the AI era is multifaceted, encompassing both domestic dominance and international expansion. Ambani also revealed plans for Reliance Jio Platforms to file for an initial public offering (IPO) in the first half of 2026, a highly anticipated event that could further fuel its growth and AI initiatives. Furthermore, Reliance is reportedly exploring a partnership with OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, with details potentially emerging during Sam Altman’s upcoming visit to India. Such a collaboration would add another layer of cutting-edge AI capabilities to Reliance’s arsenal, competing directly with other major players in the Indian market, such as Bharti Airtel’s partnership with Perplexity. Reliance is also integrating AI into its consumer-facing products: JioAICloud: A consumer-focused service offering 100GB of free storage, now enhanced with voice search and an AI Create Hub for turning photos into AI-powered reels and collages. It currently serves 40 million users. JioFrames: AI-based smart glasses, directly competing with Snap’s Spectacles and Ray-Ban Meta glasses, showcasing Reliance’s foray into augmented reality. JioHotstar: The streaming platform, with over 600 million users, is integrating AI features like the “Riya” voice assistant and content translation into Indian languages using AI-voice cloning and lip-syncing technology. These initiatives highlight a holistic approach to AI, touching upon infrastructure, enterprise solutions, and direct consumer applications, all driven by Ambani’s overarching strategy to make Reliance a global tech powerhouse. What Does This Mean for India’s Digital Future? The strategic alliances and ambitious plans laid out by Mukesh Ambani are nothing short of transformative for India. By establishing a robust AI backbone, the nation is positioning itself as a formidable player in the global tech landscape. This move promises: Accelerated Innovation: Access to world-class AI infrastructure and models will foster a new wave of innovation across industries. Economic Growth: The creation of new AI-powered services and solutions will drive economic growth and create numerous job opportunities for researchers, engineers, and developers. Digital Empowerment: Making advanced AI tools accessible to businesses and consumers will democratize technology and enhance digital literacy. Global Competitiveness: India’s proactive stance in AI will strengthen its position on the global stage, attracting further investment and talent. While challenges such as talent acquisition, ethical AI development, and regulatory frameworks remain, the foundational steps being taken by Reliance, Google, and Meta lay a strong groundwork. This collaboration is not merely about technological advancement; it’s about shaping India’s destiny as a leading digital economy. A Visionary Leap Towards an AI-Powered Nation Mukesh Ambani’s audacious vision to build India’s AI backbone through powerful alliances with Google and Meta marks a watershed moment. This isn’t just an investment in technology; it’s an investment in the future of an entire nation. By bringing together global expertise with local innovation, Reliance Intelligence is poised to unlock unprecedented potential, driving economic growth, fostering innovation, and cementing India’s place as a global leader in the artificial intelligence revolution.

After months of volatility and sharp rallies, traders now find themselves in a critical phase where consolidation and uncertainty dominate the narrative. While short-term sentiment leans cautious, on-chain insights shed light on the broader forces shaping this cycle. According to CryptoQuant analyst Dan, the percentage of Bitcoin held for over a year — measured by realized market cap — provides a reliable framework for understanding long-term market phases. In earlier phases of past cycles (cycles 1 and 2), this metric showed rapid growth as accumulation drove sharp surges, culminating in cycle peaks. In contrast, the current cycle (3) paints a different picture. The slope of the uptrend has begun to flatten, reflecting a slower pace of growth and signaling that the cycle is stretching longer than in previous years. This extended rhythm has raised questions about the structural changes behind today’s market. Why is the crypto market cycle slowing? Analysts point to new dynamics — from the rise of spot ETFs to growing institutional participation — as potential drivers reshaping how this cycle unfolds. Why The Crypto Market Cycle Is Slowing Down According to CryptoQuant analyst Dan, the slowdown in the current crypto cycle is closely tied to structural shifts in the market. One of the main reasons is the introduction of spot ETFs, which have changed how capital flows into Bitcoin. The involvement of large institutions and even some nations has further altered the rhythm, extending the length of the cycle compared to previous ones. These developments have created a more mature, but slower-moving, market environment. Another factor is the way capital rotation affects momentum. In this cycle, whenever funds begin to flow heavily into altcoins, Bitcoin’s upward momentum tends to stall. This pattern has repeated multiple times, highlighting how diversification across assets has a dampening effect on the speed of Bitcoin’s rallies. Unlike the 2023–2024 period, when Bitcoin’s dominance was clear, today’s market is showing gradual but steady capital migration into altcoins. Looking ahead, the macro backdrop also plays a key role. A rate cut expected in September, coupled with the potential approval of spot ETFs for altcoins in October, sets the stage for renewed optimism into fall and winter 2025. From a cycle perspective, current consolidation and any further corrections could present attractive entry opportunities for investors positioning for the next leg higher. Bulls Struggle To Hold $110K As Volatility Rises Bitcoin is trading near $110,000 after retreating sharply from its August peak around $123,200, with the daily chart showing a decisive shift in momentum. Price action has carved out a series of lower highs and lower lows, underlining the selling pressure that has weighed on the market since mid-August. The chart highlights that BTC is now sitting just above the 100-day moving average at $111,700, with the 50-day moving average at $116,500 acting as a ceiling in recent sessions. As long as Bitcoin remains below this zone, recovery attempts are likely to be capped by resistance. The $110,000 level is proving to be a critical area of support. A confirmed breakdown here could expose BTC to further losses toward $106,000–$108,000, while the 200-day moving average near $101,100 remains a last line of defense for the broader trend. Reclaiming $115,000 would be the first meaningful step toward regaining control. Only then could Bitcoin make another attempt to challenge the $120,000–$123,000 range. For now, however, the market remains under pressure, and whether BTC can hold $110K will likely define the short-term outlook.

As a layer-1 network focused on decentralized finance (DeFi) interoperability, Flare has been focused on expanding institutional adoption for XRP. A press release sent to CryptoPotato revealed that Everything Blockchain has entered a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to adopt Flare’s XRP DeFi (XRPFi) framework. This development comes after the Nasdaq-listed energy solutions provider VivoPower International committed $100 million in XRP to the Flare ecosystem. Everything Blockchain Embraces Flare’s XRPFi According to Flare, the XRPFi strategy will enable Everything Blockchain to deploy XRP in a compliant manner while earning yield. Flare already uses its smart contract infrastructure to unlock yield-generating opportunities for other traditionally non-yielding assets. Flare’s institutional-grade XRPFi framework will propel the coin’s emergence as a standard for corporate treasury yield. This will help establish XRP as a productive treasury tool, with solid institutional participation. “XRP, now a roughly $150 billion asset, has been a cornerstone of digital finance for more than a decade, yet institutions have had few ways to make it productive. Flare changes that by enabling a compliant, on-chain, non-custodial yield framework designed for corporate treasuries. With VivoPower and now Everything Blockchain, public companies are validating that XRPFi is not just a concept but an emerging institutional standard,” said Flare’s co-founder and CEO, Hugo Philion. From passive Holding to Yield-Bearing Everything Blockchain will shift from holding XRP as a passive asset to a compliant, yield-bearing strategy. Such a development could affect how public companies approach blockchain participation. Flare says it is ready to pioneer this shift through its trustless bridging system, FAssets, and decentralized restaking layer Firelight. The two protocols will allow Everything Blockchain to convert XRP to the Flare-native FXRP and allocate it to lending, staking, and liquidity protocols. “This is about unlocking the true financial utility of digital assets like XRP, not just as speculative holdings, but as yield-bearing instruments that can compound over time. Flare gives us the rails to do this in a way that meets the governance, security, and auditability standards required of public companies,” commented Arthur Rozenberg, CEO of Everything Blockchain Inc.

His short tweet on Wednesday got people talking and digging into the numbers behind both projects. Analyst Claims Chainlink Is Banking Coin According to Quinten, a top analyst and host at Coin Compass, Chainlink is better suited to work with banks than XRP. Related Reading: Could Pi Network Land On Coinbase? Hackathon Winner Thinks So Quinten also admitted that XRP is 10 times larger than Chainlink, a gap he says could narrow if LINK wins more institutional deals. Based on tracker figures, XRP currently trades around $3 with a market cap of a little over $178 billion, while Chainlink trades near $24 and sits at over $16 billion. XRP’s Role In Payments XRP’s case has long been tied to cross-border payments. Ripple’s tools let big banks move money on-chain in ways that aim to cut costs and speed up settlement. $XRP is 10 times bigger than $LINK Meanwhile Chainlink is the real banking coin $250 $LINK is the base case — Quinten | 048.eth (@QuintenFrancois) August 27, 2025 Some supporters say XRP could become central as traditional firms move toward blockchain settlement and even challenge systems like SWIFT. That view helps explain why XRP has a much bigger market value today. Partnerships With Institutions Reports have disclosed that Chainlink has links with several major institutions. Advocates point to connections with SWIFT and partnerships with Mastercard, the DTCC, and some central banks. Those ties are used to strengthen the contention that Chainlink can plug into the financial system in ways that go beyond payments, such as providing data, price feeds, and settlement information that banks need. Price Targets And Forecasts Quinten put a base target on LINK of $250, arguing that a move like that would make Chainlink more comparable to XRP’s value. He based that view on what he sees as stronger institutional fit. Other commentators agree. Rekt Fencer, for example, predicted a price band of $250 to $400 for Chainlink by the end of Q4 2025. My Q4 2025 targets:$BTC: $215K – $230K$ETH: $9K – $12K$BNB: $2.8K – $3.3K$SOL: $800 – $900$XRP: $8.5 – $9$DOGE: $1 – $2.5$LINK: $250 – $400$ENA: $2 – $3$PENGU: $0.7 – $1#FARTCOIN: $4.5 – $6.5 If this looks crazy to you, You’re a fool — Rekt Fencer (@rektfencer) August 19, 2025 At the same time, Rekt Fencer projects XRP could reach between $8.50 and $9 in the same period. These are bold calls. They rest on adoption and partnership wins that have not yet been locked in. Related Reading: Finance News Giant Outlines Where XRP Could Be In 2026 And Beyond Community Pushback And What To Watch Reactions in online forums were split. Some users say Quinten is just talking up XRP to get attention. Others took a calmer view, saying both chains could have their moments. LINK Price Looking Up Meanwhile, Chainlink is showing signs of steady strength, with forecasts pointing to a 7.53% rise that could lift the token to $26.12 by September 28, 2025, data from Coincodex show. Technical indicators lean bullish, though the Fear & Greed Index sits at a neutral 50, suggesting balanced sentiment. LINK has logged 16 green days out of the past 30, with volatility at 16.19%, signaling active but sometimes sharp price swings.

Details Here,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/ethereums-eth-monthly-trading-volume-reaches-highest-level-since-may-2021-details-here/,"The Ethereum ecosystem was notable for its record-breaking month of August. Ethereum's on-chain adjusted transfer volume surpassed $320 billion, reaching its highest level since May 2021. This represents the third-largest monthly volume in Ethereum history. Ethereum Network Transaction Volume Exceeds $320 Billion in August: Highest Level Since 2021 The data covers not only transfers but also DeFi interactions and other blockchain-based transactions. The 30-day transaction count also reached a new high in August, while active ETH addresses reached their second all-time high. Ethereum's total value locked (TVL) also remains near historical highs. The impact of institutional investors is the primary driver of this increase. Publicly traded companies' ETH reserves rose from $4 billion at the beginning of the month to $12 billion. BitMine Immersion and SharpLink Gaming, in particular, made significant purchases. Trading volumes and net inflows for spot ETH ETFs also accelerated during the same period. Ethereum transaction fees have fallen to their lowest levels in five years. The 2024 Dencun update (EIP-4844) reduced costs for rollups, while this year's Pectra upgrade focused on improving account abstraction and user experience. Validator exit requests hit a record high in August, while entry requests also reached a two-year high. Experts attribute much of this movement to fund flows into liquid retaking protocols. ETH price, on the other hand, is trading at $4,337 after the recent correction, trading 12% below its peak. *This is not investment advice.

Analyst Says This Chart Predicts Everything,https://timestabloid.com/big-xrp-breakout-coming-analyst-says-this-chart-predicts-everything/,"Crypto analyst Steph Is Crypto has released a new update focusing on XRP and HBAR, suggesting that both assets are positioned for significant moves in the near term. In a video linked to his tweet, he began by examining the three-day chart for XRP, noting that the price remains in a consolidation phase within what he described as a continuation pattern. According to his assessment, XRP is forming a bull flag structure, and he anticipates a major breakout as long as the token holds support near the $2.73 level. He added that the technical target from this pattern points to a potential rise toward the $5 region . He emphasized that the chart is showing compression, with XRP price action being pushed into an apex, which historically precedes large directional moves. Beyond the chart itself, he referenced additional on-chain and market indicators that strengthen his bullish stance. PROOF: This #XRP Chart Predicts EVERYTHING! Watch asap! https://t.co/oC7Lt5f1mK pic.twitter.com/VZAdTVrsot — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 28, 2025 HBAR Whale Activity and Market Structure While focusing heavily on XRP, Steph also dedicated time to Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR). He pointed out significant whale activity, citing that HBAR net flows recently shifted from a positive 3.2 million to negative 695,000 in a single day. He interpreted this as a sign of whales accumulating heavily, effectively draining tokens from exchanges. From a technical perspective, he explained that HBAR is forming a bullish descending triangle pattern, a continuation structure that, if broken to the upside, could see the asset target the $0.50 level. He compared current market behavior to HBAR’s 2021 cycle, noting that the token had previously broken above weekly EMA ribbons, rallied strongly, retraced into support, and then surged again to new highs. He suggested that the current market setup resembles that cycle, indicating the potential for a repeat performance in late 2025. Key Resistance Levels for XRP On XRP’s monthly chart, Steph highlighted the long-standing challenge of the $3 resistance area. Despite occasional breaks above this level since 2017, XRP has yet to secure a monthly close above it. With the August 2025 candle approaching closure in just a few days, he stated that whether XRP can finally achieve this milestone will be critical. According to his analysis, a confirmed monthly close above $3 would represent a significant development in the asset’s long-term technical outlook. Broader Market Outlook and Macro Conditions Steph also incorporated broader market factors into his analysis. He noted that much of XRP’s liquidity is positioned above the current price, suggesting the possibility of a short squeeze in the near term. He referenced upcoming monetary policy decisions, particularly the anticipated U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, as potential catalysts for a move higher. Citing past performance, he recalled that the September 2024 rate cut was followed by a nearly 500% rally in XRP within weeks. While he did not predict the same magnitude this time, he considered a significant move to the upside to be possible. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Caution Beyond the Next Leg Higher While maintaining an overall bullish outlook, Steph also urged caution. He explained that XRP’s current structure resembles a five-wave pattern similar to what occurred during the 2021 bull run, which ended in a bear market. If XRP does rise toward $4 to $5, he warned that investors should be prepared for a potential correction. He also pointed to bearish divergence signals on the RSI and a decline in retail interest, as measured by Google Trends data, as factors to monitor. In his conclusion, Steph reaffirmed that he remains bullish on both XRP and HBAR in the near term, expecting at least one more strong push upward. However, he stressed the importance of tracking technical signals carefully as the market approaches key resistance levels, particularly around the $5 mark for XRP.

According to analyst James Seyffart, eight applications are seeking approval for Solana funds, while seven are tied to XRP. Another popular analyst Eric Balchunas revealed in April that 72 crypto ETFs were pending with the SEC. Since then, another 20 have been added, highlighting renewed interest in offering regulated crypto investment vehicles. While three of the pending ETFs aim to provide exposure to Bitcoin and Ether, the majority focus on altcoins. A Growing Wave of ETF Filings Grayscale and 21Shares are among the most active ETF filers , seeking approval for Ether staking funds. The SEC recently clarified that certain liquid staking activities may not fall under its jurisdiction, potentially opening the door for products tied to staking yields. Grayscale is also pursuing the conversion of five of its trusts into ETFs, covering assets such as Litecoin, Solana, Dogecoin, XRP, and Avalanche. “Look at all the crypto ETF filings out there… What I mean by ‘crypto fund floodgates about to open soon,’” Nate Geraci said in a recent post. Still, analysts caution that approval delays could weigh on market sentiment. Researchers at Bitfinex noted this week that altcoins may struggle to rally significantly until more ETFs gain regulatory approval. BlackRock’s Dominance in the Market While issuers await SEC decisions, global asset management giant BlackRock continues to dominate the crypto ETF space. Its iShares Bitcoin Trust fund (IBIT) has accumulated $58.28 billion in net inflows since launch, while its iShares Ethereum Trust fund (ETHA) has recorded $13.12 billion, according to Farside Investors. Remarkably, ETHA may soon surpass Coinbase as the largest single holder of Ethereum. Meanwhile, IBIT now controls more than 3% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply , underscoring its outsized role in the market. The success of IBIT has also proven highly profitable for BlackRock. With an expense ratio of 0.25%, the fund generates more annual fee revenue than the company’s flagship iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), which has a far lower expense ratio of 0.03%. The rapid growth in filings, combined with BlackRock’s strong position, suggests that the U.S. could soon witness an expansion of available crypto ETFs beyond Bitcoin and Ether , potentially reshaping altcoin markets.

The total assets under management (AUM) in tokenized institutional funds have seen an astonishing 47% surge in just one month, reaching a staggering $1.74 billion. This rapid expansion signals a significant shift, showing how traditional investment structures are embracing blockchain technology. What’s Fueling This Explosive Growth in Tokenized Institutional Funds? We are witnessing a pivotal moment as institutional alternative investment funds (IAFs) increasingly leverage tokenization. These funds, which traditionally invest in asset classes outside of conventional stocks and bonds, are finding new efficiencies and opportunities through digital transformation. The recent jump from an already substantial base to $1.74 billion highlights growing confidence and adoption. This isn’t just a fleeting trend; it represents a fundamental change in how large-scale investments are managed and accessed. Tokenization offers enhanced liquidity, transparency, and fractional ownership, attracting a new wave of capital. Who Are the Dominant Players in the Tokenized Institutional Funds Arena? Several key platforms are leading this charge, driving the adoption of tokenized institutional funds . According to data from RWA.xyz, Centrifuge stands out as the market leader, showcasing robust growth and innovation.

Le sue parole arrivano mentre ETH si avvicina a un nuovo massimo storico (ATH), attirando nuovamente l’attenzione di investitori retail e istituzionali. Ethereum, essenziale per i trasferimenti di stablecoin Nella sua intervista, Van Eck ha sottolineato l’importanza di Ethereum non solo per l’andamento del prezzo, ma soprattutto per l’adozione concreta. Secondo l’amministratore delegato, le banche dovranno adottare la rete di smart contract di Ethereum per facilitare le transazioni in stablecoin . “Ethereum is the Wall Street token,” says @JanvanEck3 . pic.twitter.com/9NAqjh8r0x — VanEck (@vaneck_us) August 27, 2025 Per chi non lo sapesse, le stablecoin sono criptovalute legate a una riserva (come il dollaro USA) per mantenere un valore stabile. Offrono la velocità delle criptovalute con la stabilità delle valute tradizionali, rendendole ideali per pagamenti, trading e trasferimenti internazionali. Fino a poco tempo fa, molte banche erano caute verso le stablecoin a causa della mancanza di regole chiare e della loro associazione con la volatilità del mercato cripto. Ma, con l’approvazione del GENIUS Act , la situazione è cambiata: i regolatori hanno fornito un quadro normativo più definito e le istituzioni finanziarie hanno iniziato ad aprirsi all’uso delle stablecoin nella loro infrastruttura. Parlando a Fox Business, Jan van Eck ha ribadito: “Per muovere le stablecoin, le banche devono adottare una blockchain. E la scelta più forte è Ethereum o una tecnologia compatibile con Ethereum, detta EVM.” Ethereum oltre Bitcoin? Non è la prima volta che VanEck evidenzia il ruolo di ETH nell’economia digitale. In un recente report, la società ha ipotizzato che Ethereum potrebbe un giorno superare Bitcoin come principale riserva di valore , grazie al calo della sua emissione e all’ampliamento delle sue applicazioni. L’adozione delle stablecoin, inoltre, è accelerata dopo la vittoria di Donald Trump alle presidenziali USA del novembre 2024 . Lo stato del Wyoming, ad esempio, ha lanciato la sua stablecoin ufficiale FRNT , la prima iniziativa di questo tipo da parte di un governo statale. Il Segretario al Tesoro Scott Bessent ha stimato che il mercato delle stablecoin potrebbe raggiungere i 3.7 trilioni di dollari entro il 2030 , mentre Citigroup prevede una crescita di sette volte nei prossimi cinque anni. ETH: adozione più ampia di Bitcoin Ethereum offre un’utilità molto più diversificata rispetto a Bitcoin. BTC viene visto soprattutto come riserva di valore e copertura contro l’inflazione. ETH , invece, alimenta la finanza decentralizzata (DeFi) , gli NFT , e funge da infrastruttura globale per i pagamenti digitali. Sempre più aziende stanno aggiungendo ETH nei loro bilanci. SharpLink Gaming, ad esempio, ha acquistato altri 56.533 ETH, portando le sue riserve a quasi 800.000 token. I dati più recenti sugli ETF confermano il trend: per sette giorni consecutivi gli ETF su Ethereum hanno sovraperformato quelli su Bitcoin. Al momento della scrittura, ETH viene scambiato a 4.473 dollari, in calo del 3,2% nelle ultime 24 ore.",Uncategorized|Ethereum,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|BTC|ZRX|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-29 14:11:59
