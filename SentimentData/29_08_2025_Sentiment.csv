XRP and Ethereum remain central to market positioning, each supported by strong fundamentals and upcoming catalysts. Alongside them, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a breakout presale, drawing interest from both retail and whale investors. XRP — ETF Momentum and Institutional Inflows XRP continues to stand out as one of the most closely tracked tokens in 2025, thanks to its ongoing ETF narrative. Multiple proposals are before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and an approval in October could set the stage for a retest of XRP’s all-time high at $3.84. Bullish projections go even further, with some analysts pointing to a potential surge into the $4.50–$9 range if momentum builds through the fourth quarter. Beyond the ETF narrative, legal clarity has created a supportive backdrop for XRP. Court victories have reduced regulatory uncertainty, and new partnerships — particularly with Japan’s SBI Holdings — are strengthening its global profile. Analysts see this combination of legal progress and strategic alliances as a foundation for long-term adoption. Institutional accumulation has also been notable. On-chain data shows whales buying into dips, while trading desks continue to build exposure ahead of potential ETF approval. Analysts say this layered demand — from both speculative traders and long-term institutional players — could make September a critical month for XRP positioning. Ethereum — Constant Institutional Demand Ethereum remains the backbone of the decentralized finance ecosystem and a perennial analyst pick for presale buyers. The network has been bolstered by the rollout of ETH 2.0 upgrades, which improve scalability and reduce fees, reinforcing Ethereum’s dominance as the default smart contract platform. Institutional demand has been steady throughout the year, with spot ETH ETFs drawing billions in inflows. Analysts consistently describe Ethereum as a “core allocation,” arguing that its developer ecosystem, liquidity depth, and cross-chain integrations provide unmatched resilience. For September specifically, technical dashboards are flashing bullish signals. Rollup adoption and new integrations are driving usage, while DeFi activity continues to lock billions of dollars on-chain. Analysts forecast that Ethereum could trade between $5,000 and $7,000 by the end of 2025, making it one of the most stable yet rewarding long-term plays. While Ethereum does not offer the extreme multiples of smaller-cap tokens, its mix of institutional support and ongoing innovation keeps it firmly positioned as a must-have asset in any presale strategy. MAGACOIN FINANCE — High-Upside Play Analysts say September is shaping up to be pivotal for presales with real fundamentals. While XRP and Ethereum remain strong utility leaders, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining attention for its audited smart contracts, deflationary supply, and fast-growing ecosystem — positioning it as the best speculative presale to buy this month. The project has built momentum as whales and retail investors rotate capital into higher-upside opportunities. Presale allocations are rapidly disappearing, and analysts now describe MAGACOIN FINANCE as the top crypto presale to watch heading into the next market cycle. With forecasts ranging from 50x to even higher returns under bullish conditions, it is drawing consistent comparisons to the breakout performances of past meme-driven tokens. For investors looking to complement the stability of XRP and Ethereum with a high-risk, high-reward position, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being cited as the leading speculative play for September 2025. One of the Most Talked-About Crypto Presales of 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly become one of the most talked-about crypto presales for 2025 . With over 25,000 community members and consistent coverage from crypto analysts , its fundamentals suggest the kind of early-stage strength typically seen in top-tier altcoins before breakout moments. Final Takeaway September’s presale landscape reflects a balance between stability and speculation. XRP leads on ETF-driven catalysts and institutional inflows, while Ethereum remains the dependable core for long-term positioning. MAGACOIN FINANCE , meanwhile, offers the speculative upside that appeals to investors willing to take on higher risk. Analysts say combining these three provides a diversified approach to September’s opportunities, blending fundamental strength with breakout potential.

50838051,567583,1756422048,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50838051.jpeg,Bitcoin Liquidity Weakens As Stablecoin Growth Drops To $1.1 Billion,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-liquidity-weakens-stablecoin-1-1-billion/,"Data shows stablecoin market cap expansion has slowed to just $1.1 billion recently, signaling weakening liquidity for Bitcoin and other coins. Stablecoin Market Cap Growth Is Significantly Down Compared To Earlier Highs According to data from on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant , stablecoin growth has been cooling recently. “ Stablecoins ” refer to cryptocurrencies that have their price tied to a fiat currency, with US Dollars being the most popular option. Investors generally store their capital in the form of these tokens when they want to avoid the volatility that comes with coins like Bitcoin. Many holders who buy into stables, however, eventually plan to venture back into the volatile side of the market. Since stablecoins can potentially be swapped into BTC and other assets, their supply can be looked at as a sort of available “ dry powder ” for the cryptocurrency sector. As such, expansions in this supply can prove to be a bullish sign. Now, here is the chart shared by CryptoQuant that shows the trend in the 7-day change in the market cap of the major USD-based stables over the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the late 2024 bull run was accompanied by a sharp positive change in the market cap of the stablecoins. At the peak, these assets observed weekly net inflows of around $7.7 billion. Another wave of inflows occurred in January of this year, with the metric peaking at $6.6 billion. Since then, the market has seen a cooldown in interest, with inflows into stables staying far from the earlier highs. From the chart, it’s visible that the sharp burst in capital flows earlier this month could only manage a top of $4.8 billion. The interest also lasted quite briefly, and inflows disappeared soon after. At present, the metric is sitting at $1.1 billion, implying the market cap of the stablecoins is still growing, but clearly, the rate at which it’s happening isn’t close to the previous bull rally. “Liquidity tailwinds are weaker, limiting Bitcoin’s upside momentum,” explains the analytics firm. It now remains to be seen how long the muted stablecoin inflows would last and whether a pivot to outflows would follow next. In some other news, the Relative Unrealized Loss held by Bitcoin investors is still quite low even after the latest price decline, as on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has pointed out in an X post . The Relative Unrealized Loss is a measure of the total unrealized loss held by the Bitcoin investors represented as a percentage of the market cap. At present, the metric’s value stands at just 0.5%, which is quite low compared to past bear markets. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $113,400, up almost 2% over the 24 hours.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin liquidity|btc|BTCUSDT|Stablecoins|Stablecoins Growth,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-28 23:00:48

In a statement, the European Commission said that eliminating duties on industrial goods and granting “preferential market access” to certain U.S. seafood and agricultural products would secure U.S. tariff relief for the EU auto sector retroactive to August 1. The provisional arrangement eased tensions between the two largest trade and investment partners, though the terms are not balanced. The EU agreed to reduce its own tariffs and step up purchases of U.S. energy, while the United States continued to apply duties to roughly 70% of EU shipments. In February, Trump said the EU was “formed to screw the United States” and linked the new terms to shrinking the U.S. goods deficit with the bloc, which stood at $235 billion in 2024. Member governments indicated they accepted the arrangement as the less harmful option, pointing out that, without a deal, the White House had been prepared to slap 30% tariffs on almost all EU imports. Brussels agreed to open EU market to U.S. goods In the trade deal , reported by Cryptopolitan, Brussels included two legal measures. One scrapped EU tariffs on industrial goods and extended preferential access for U.S. seafood and selected agricultural items. The second continued duty-free treatment for lobsters, expanding it to include processed products. Together, the EU and the United States make up close to a third of world trade. Trump and von der Leyen announced the pact at the U.S. president’s golf course in western Scotland. “I think this is the biggest deal ever made,” Trump told reporters on July 27th, praising EU plans to invest about $600 billion in the United States and to sharply increase purchases of U.S. energy and military equipment. He argued the pact surpassed $550 billion agreement with Japan and would strengthen relations after years of what he described as unfair treatment of U.S. exporters. Von der Leyen described Trump as a tough negotiator and said the 15% tariff applied “across the board,” later noting it was “the best we could get.” “We have a trade deal between the two largest economies in the world, and it’s a big deal. It will bring stability. It will bring predictability,” she said. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Both Chainlink and Ethereum have seen multi-million-dollar inflows from large holders, highlighting their role as favorites heading into 2025. Yet beyond these giants, investors are starting to talk about a rising name: MAGACOIN FINANCE . With fresh projections and bold community incentives, it is positioning itself as a contender for the best altcoin to buy now . Whale moves raise eyebrows in 2025 Whales have returned to the spotlight in 2025 with massive purchases that signal confidence in crypto’s future. One of the most striking examples came from Chainlink whales , where a major buyer scooped up 938,489 LINK tokens worth $21.23 million across five wallets. Using 4,806 ETH, the whale locked in an average of $22.62 per LINK, showing conviction at scale. X post by SharpLink Meanwhile, Ethereum whales are setting records of their own. SharpLink Gaming recently executed its largest Ethereum buy of the year, spending $601.5 million to acquire 143,593 ETH at $4,648 each. This pushed their treasury holdings to 740,760 ETH, worth more than $3 billion at the time. These moves show whales are preparing for a longer-term cycle. For investors wondering about the best crypto to buy now , watching how whales position their capital provides strong clues. With Ethereum and Chainlink at the center, both tokens remain among the top cryptos for 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE tipped for a Crypto Moonshot 2025 While the spotlight shines on whales, another project is gathering rapid attention: MAGACOIN FINANCE . Analysts are linking whale activity with broader excitement in new coins, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is already being called the best altcoin to buy now before demand explodes. What sets it apart is a bold projection — experts suggest MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver a 99x ROI heading into the 2025 bull run. Early buyers are already locking in their positions with a 50% EXTRA allocation using code PATRIOT50X , an incentive that rewards fast movers. This momentum has sparked conversations about whether MAGACOIN FINANCE could become the next crypto moonshot 2025 . With whales pumping liquidity into major coins like Ethereum and Chainlink, the spillover effect often benefits fresh projects. MAGACOIN FINANCE appears to be one of those breakout opportunities. One of the Best Crypto Presales of 2025 According to Analyst Reports MAGACOIN FINANCE is often featured in analyst watchlists as one of the top crypto presales for 2025 , and for good reason. The team’s commitment to full transparency — including public audits and KYC verification — builds unmatched trust. These fundamentals give investors peace of mind and separate the project from unverified alternatives in the market. A whale-driven cycle with new stars The takeaway from recent whale actions is clear: big buyers are setting the tone for 2025. Chainlink whales and Ethereum whales are reinforcing confidence in established names, while their presence creates room for rising stars to shine. For investors balancing security with growth potential, having exposure to established players like ETH and LINK makes sense. But adding a project such as MAGACOIN FINANCE — a coin already labeled one of the best cryptos to buy now — offers the chance for higher returns. With whale influence steering the cycle and MAGACOIN FINANCE positioned as one of the best altcoins to buy now , the mix of stability and growth could be the formula investors look for heading into 2025.

The Solana-based launchpad has taken more than 70% of market share and pulled in over $13 million in weekly revenue. Lifetime earnings just crossed $800 million. But while the platform is booming, many traders are rotating into tokens with stronger long-term potential. Analysts say XRP and MAGACOIN FINANCE are two of the biggest beneficiaries of this shift. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out is that it’s fully audited, safe, and backed by compliance—giving investors more confidence as they search for the best cryptos to buy now. XRP sees renewed interest On-chain data reveals that the bulk of the transaction inflow into XRP and MAGACOIN FINANCE has come from Pump Fun traders. Interestingly, this rotation comes at a time when Pump Fun is seeing positive energy, which signals that a bigger play is happening elsewhere. Following a strong summer, XRP is trading near $3.29. The majority of the price boost the token saw came from the conclusion of the long SEC case against Ripple. With the court giving the final confirmation of XRP’s securities status, both institutional and retail confidence have gone up. With $3.00 acting as a strong support level, XRP is being called one of the best cryptos to buy now for 2025. Investors show renewed confidence in MAGACOIN FINANCE Meanwhile, the capital infusion from Pump Fun traders appears not to be the only catalyst driving momentum in MAGACOIN FINANCE. An inflow of new investors in the project has also added to the excitement. On-chain data analysis reveals that a growing number of the earliest investors in the project are rapidly accumulating more tokens, especially as speculations of a price increase grow. This comes as analysts who track emerging tokens project gains of up to 5,000% for investors who buy MAGACOIN FINANCE before it lists on exchanges. As a result, many investors now believe the window to get into the project may be closing, and supply is running out fast. Analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE may be the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for investors who missed out on the early days of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. Right now, the project is earning multiple picks as the best crypto to buy now in 2025. Final take Pump Fun may dominate Solana’s launchpad market, but the real action is happening elsewhere. XRP offers utility and institutional adoption. MAGACOIN FINANCE provides early presale growth potential. For traders scanning the market for the best cryptos to buy now, these two tokens show how viral momentum can turn into opportunity.

JPMorgan says the wild swings have cooled off. At the start of 2025, Bitcoin’s volatility sat at 60%. Now it’s around 30%. That’s not just a stat for nerds, that drop could pull big institutional investors back into the space. The kind that dipped the hell out when Bitcoin kept acting like a drunk teenager. Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, a strategist at JPMorgan, said Thursday that if Bitcoin’s volatility keeps falling and starts to match more traditional assets like gold, then investment allocations could follow. “Expect that the allocations to Bitcoin by institutional investors could match those of competing asset classes such as gold if there is convergence in volatilities,” he wrote. Right now, that convergence is real. According to him, the gap between gold’s and Bitcoin’s volatility is “the lowest on record.” Corporate pullback helps tighten volatility There’s a reason this is happening. Over the past year, a lot of corporate treasurers have been yanking their Bitcoin out of circulation. That’s not some small event. According to JPMorgan, this “intense withdrawal” has had a real effect. More coins are being held passively. Less trading. Less panic selling. Less hype buying. That’s been working like a brake on the madness. These treasurers, mostly copycat versions of MicroStrategy, have actually grabbed more than 6% of Bitcoin’s entire supply. They’re also getting added into global equity indices. That gives them even more legitimacy and more eyes. JPMorgan says this trend is “helping to make Bitcoin more attractive from a valuation point of view.” It all comes back to risk. Panigirtzoglou explains it clearly: institutional investors don’t like throwing their cash at anything that sucks up too much risk capital. He said: “The reason is that, for most institutional investors, the volatility of each class matters in terms of portfolio risk management and the higher the volatility of an asset class, the higher the risk capital consumed by this asset class.” Translation: calmer coins mean more comfortable investors. Bitcoin’s current market cap sits at about $2.2 trillion. To match gold’s $5 trillion in private sector investment, but adjusted for volatility, Bitcoin would need to climb 13% from where it is now. That would push the price up to around $126,000. That number isn’t just pulled from thin air. It’s only a little above the record Bitcoin already set last weekend. Right now, though, Bitcoin’s price is lagging behind. Panigirtzoglou said, “The gap between the Bitcoin price and our volatility-adjusted comparison to gold shifted from highly positive territory at the end of 2024,” back when it was around $36,000, “to negative territory currently,” meaning the current price is roughly $16,000 too low. That’s a big gap. According to him, that gap means one thing: “some upside potential for Bitcoin currently.” As of Thursday, Bitcoin was trading about 10% lower than its recent all-time high.

That’s the core of a lawsuit Lisa filed this week in federal court, directly challenging the president’s legal authority to remove her from the Fed Board. The case doesn’t spend much time discussing whether she actually filled out the mortgage application wrong. Instead, it hammers the claim that even if she did mess up, it still doesn’t give Trump the legal right to fire her. One of the filings in Lisa’s lawsuit says the issue might have come from a paperwork mistake. Her legal team insists this does not rise to the level of “cause,” the only justification the Federal Reserve Act allows for firing a sitting board member. That term has no clear legal definition and might now have to be interpreted by the Supreme Court. Lisa says this entire mortgage fraud accusation is just a distraction meant to hide what’s really happening: a push by Trump to stack the Fed Board of Governors with people who will support his demand for rate cuts. Lisa’s lawyers say Trump has no legal basis The lawsuit calls the mortgage fraud claims “pretextual” and says they are based on conduct that allegedly happened before Lisa was even confirmed by the Senate. It argues that no federal agency has ever investigated or proven anything about the claim. “This allegation about conduct that predates Governor Cook’s Senate confirmation has never been investigated, much less proven,” her legal team wrote. “This allegation is not grounds for removal under the [Federal Reserve Act].” The complaint says even if a mistake was made, it wasn’t serious enough to meet the legal bar required to fire a Fed governor. Trump and Bill Pulte, who runs the Federal Housing Finance Agency, have accused Lisa of giving false information about where she lived when applying for federally insured mortgages. But her lawyer, Abbe Lowell, fired back in the complaint, saying that even if the president had tried to hide his real reason for firing her, the excuse he cooked up still doesn’t qualify as valid under the law. “Even if the President had been more careful in obscuring his real justification for targeting Governor Cook,” Abbe wrote, “the President’s concocted basis for removal, the unsubstantiated and unproven allegation that Governor Cook ‘potentially’ erred in filling out a mortgage form prior to her Senate confirmation, does not amount to ‘cause’ within the meaning of the FRA and is unsupported by caselaw.” The filing also points out that neither Trump nor Bill ever claimed Lisa benefited personally from the alleged clerical error, or that it was done intentionally. Her lawyers added, “Even if Governor Cook had committed the infractions that the President alleges, which she did not, the President would lack ‘cause’ to remove her.” Critics question silence as markets stay calm Bill responded in a statement to Scott Wapner of CNBC, saying, “In her filing, Ms. Cook does not deny that these are her mortgage documents, so one has to wonder why she, or [Fed Chair] Jerome Powell, would want this to be a part of the Federal Reserve, which is supposed to have preeminent integrity and which is critical to the safety and soundness of the U.S. Mortgage Market.” His statement questions why Lisa didn’t directly challenge the documents or give an explanation. While all of this unfolds, the markets have mostly brushed it off. But that could shift. Krishna Guha, who leads global policy research at Evercore ISI, warned that the legal drama is distracting from what he calls the “Trumpification” of the Fed. “We have no privileged knowledge of the legal facts,” Krishna said in a note this week, “but believe if it were established Cook committed even accidental mortgage misrepresentation, she would have to go.” If Trump gets his way and Stephen Miran is confirmed by the Senate to fill an open seat, he will hold a 4–3 majority on the Fed board.

The South Korean newspaper Hankook Ilbo reported that the Bank of Korea (BOK) chief Rhee Chang-yong said the payments would be made as part of a new “digital currency pilot project.” Rhee was speaking during a press conference held in central Seoul on August 28 following a Monetary Policy Committee meeting earlier in the day. South Korean CBDC: Back From the Dead? The move has come as something of a surprise in Seoul. The BOK announced in late June this year that it was putting CBDC testing on hold in favor of developing stablecoin -powered alternatives. Rhee said the subsidy move was part of the greater Han River Project, the country’s wider CBDC pilot. The Bank of Korea’s offices in Gwangju. (Source: Neoalpha) The media outlet said that the new CBDC move was the brainchild of the Ministry of Strategy and Finance. The ministry thinks that CBDC-powered subsidies will help prevent fraudulent use and improve fiscal policy efficiency. Rhee explained: “This is part of the second Han River Project pilot. Using digital fiat to pay subsidies will let principal contractors better manage subsidies when entering into agreements with subcontractors.” The BOK and the ministry plan to issue contractors with CBDC tokens instead of bank transfers or vouchers. The parties think that blockchain technology will help trace funds and ensure they are not being misused. Rhee added: “During his recent visit to the BOK, Koo Yun-cheol, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Strategy and Finance, said he thinks this will increase the efficiency and transparency of subsidy payments.” On August 22, Deputy Prime Minister Koo Yun Cheol attended the joint ministerial briefing on the new government’s economic growth strategy and delivered a statement at the Government Complex Seoul. pic.twitter.com/RfSVzp8o0n — MOEF – Korea (@moefkorea_eng) August 22, 2025 We Only Want to Work with Banks That Favor CBDC Biz, Says BOK The BOK was keen to point out that the new project would differ from the “first” pilot, which wrapped up in the first half of this year. While the first pilot focused largely on commercial banks and their customers, the subsidy-focused pilot will be private sector-led. Many of the banks that took part in the first pilot expressed their displeasure with CBDC launch plans. They complained that they thought it unfair that they should shoulder the burden of making infrastructure investment costs. But Rhee left the door open to the banking sector, suggesting the BOK is happy to partner with lenders who are still keen on CBDC business. The Governor said: “Considering the scale of the project, at 110 trillion won, I believe this be attractive for banks. We plan to focus on working with banks with a strong willingness to invest [in the project].” The South Korean won strengthened after Bank of Korea Governor defended its foreign exchange interventions as efforts to stem the decline and said it is part of talks with the US government https://t.co/jUTgYGUiNh — Bloomberg (@business) August 28, 2025 ‘Accelerated’ Plans Rhee also suggested that Seoul’s stablecoin pivot has not sounded the death knell for the BOK’s CBDC plans. Indeed, the Governor explained that once lawmakers have finalized the creation of new crypto and stablecoin legislation, the BOK plans to “accelerate” the Han River Project. Rhee said: “We have discussed upcoming [crypto and stablecoin] legislation with the ministry. The BOK has also exchanged practical opinions with the [regulatory] Financial Services Commission. We hope that the BOK’s views will be well-reflected in these deliberations.” The BOK has previously said that it wants to see a phased CBDC and stablecoin adaptation process. It wants this to begin with traditional financial institutions, such as banks. Institutions like these are that are subject to strict BOK supervision, Hankook Ilbo remarked. South Korean financial and crypto chiefs are growing restless, however. They have complained that progress on stablecoin legislation has “slowed to a standstill.” This is because lawmakers cannot agree on the matter of whether or not tech firms should be allowed to issue KRW-pegged stablecoins. Conservative voices have urged Seoul to restrict issuance to the commercial banking sector. But progressive opponents say such a move would stifle innovation.

It wasn’t because of a new cancer drug. The company said it would buy $100 million of Litecoin for its cash reserves. After that, the share price went from $3 to almost $7. What was odd is that the stock had already risen in the days before the news, even though there were no SEC filings, no press releases, and little social media talk. Other small-cap names also posted sharp gains shortly before unveiling plans to hold crypto in corporate treasuries, a pattern that raises the possibility that some market participants traded on information that wasn’t public. Today’s “crypto treasury” wave traces back to billionaire Michael Saylor. In 2020, the founder and chairman of Strategy, formerly called MicroStrategy, announced the software company would hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Investors began to treat the shares as a stand-in for Bitcoin’s price. Imitators soon emerged. A budget hotel operator in Japan started buying Bitcoin in 2024, and others followed. The pace accelerated this year. Since January, 184 listed companies have disclosed crypto purchases totaling almost $132 billion, according to Architect Partners, a crypto M&A advisory and financing firm. “We’ve kind of hit this point of saturation,” said Louis Camhi in a Fortune’s report .He added that investors are now watching to see whether those positions generate returns. Not all of the gains appear to be going to retail traders In several cases, stocks jumped just ahead of announcements. SharpLink , a marketing firm serving sportsbooks and casinos, traded under $3 through April and early May. On May 27, it said it would add $425 million in Ethereum, sending the shares to nearly $36. Yet in the three trading days before that news, the stock doubled from $3 to $6 despite no filings or press releases. U.S. rules governing “material non-public information” require tight controls . Outsiders granted access to sensitive details are typically “wall-crossed” and logged so regulators can trace who knew what. While crypto treasury deals can take months to assemble, the final marketing push often happens just before the announcement through brief investor roadshows. SharpLink met with investors across three days ahead of its shift; those same days coincided with the stock’s move. Mill City’s two-day outreach lined up with its jump as well. Insider-trading prohibitions cover more than corporate officers; they also extend to anyone who trades after receiving material tips, said Elisha Kobre, a partner at Sheppard Mullin and a former federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York. Who is benefiting remains unclear A handful of executives filed notices of grants or purchases before pivots, but most did not sell, SEC records show. Companies are trying to tighten processes to stop leaks. “It’s a bad look for everyone here,” said Camhi, urging quick fixes. Mackintosh said his team shortened investor outreach on a separate transaction to two trading days. Some firms went further. In late July, CEA Industries said it raised $500 million to hold BNB. To reduce pre-announcement trading, dealmakers withheld the company’s ticker during outreach and disclosed it to investors only on Friday night after markets closed on July 25, said CEO David Namdar. The company, now called BNB Network Company, aimed “to minimize the risk of leaks or volatility” before releasing news the following Monday. A week later, Verb Technology revealed a $558 million raise to hold TON and used the same approach, keeping its ticker back until after the Friday close, according to an investor who asked not to be named. Even with those steps, the stock rose nearly 60% in the four hours before the Monday announcement went live. Get seen where it counts.

President Nayib Bukele shared market predictions that the country’s BTC holdings could reach $1B by the end of 2025. Currently, El Salvador holds 6,282 BTC, worth over $709 million. Prediction markets reacted quickly: Kalshi odds of hitting $1 billion before November surged from 20% to 38% before settling at 27%, while Polymarket showed 43% odds of the milestone by December 2025.

Bitcoin Price Forecast – Technical Outlook Bitcoin trades near $112,300, testing the upper boundary of a descending channel. Resistance looms at $116,850, a level that has capped rallies since August. A breakout could unlock $120,900–$124,450. Momentum is firming. The RSI is at 55, recovering from oversold territory, while the MACD has turned bullish. Long lower wicks near $111,000 suggest dip buyers remain active, weakening bearish conviction. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview If BTC fails to stay above the 50-SMA at $111,563, downside risks extend toward $108,695 and $105,150. However, a confirmed breakout above $116,850 with strong volume would mark the first clean trend reversal in weeks. For traders, the playbook is clear: aggressive bulls may target $120K-$124K, cautious investors may wait for confirmation. With ETF inflows back and institutional backing growing, Bitcoin’s structure is tightening up and a breakout is near – one that could propel the long term run to $130K and beyond. Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines Bitcoin Security With Solana Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Its goal is to expand the Bitcoin ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation. By combining Bitcoin’s unmatched security with Solana’s high-performance framework, the project opens the door to entirely new use cases, including seamless BTC bridging and scalable dApp development. The team has put strong emphasis on trust and scalability, with the project audited by Consult to give investors confidence in its foundations. Momentum is building quickly. The presale has already crossed $12.5 million, leaving only a limited allocation still available. At today’s stage, HYPER tokens are priced at just $0.012815—but that figure will increase as the presale progresses.

Solana and XRP have both made headlines with game-changing progress, but what’s really catching investor eyes right now is a brand-new meme coin presale — MAGACOIN FINANCE . Memecoins have consistently proven their ability to generate explosive gains when backed by strong communities and viral narratives. With Solana showing massive ecosystem growth and XRP finally securing long-awaited regulatory clarity, MAGACOIN FINANCE emerges as the best crypto presale set to ride the wave of retail excitement. Solana: Strength in DeFi, Institutions, and Memecoins Solana (SOL) has maintained its reputation as one of the most powerful blockchain ecosystems. Currently trading between $186–$202 , SOL is testing the critical $200 level after pulling back from resistance near $213–$215. According to analysts, the area from $210 to $220 will be the next important level that the price will break through, and it could reach the range of $250 to $270 if the rate of movement gets higher.4 What’s fueling this momentum? DeFi Expansion: Solana’s DeFi TVL has soared to $11.3 billion , marking a 30% quarterly increase and positioning Solana as the second-largest DeFi chain after Ethereum. Kamino Finance alone contributed nearly $2 billion in locked value. Institutional Demand: Major players like Pantera Capital, Galaxy Digital, and Jump Crypto are raising over $2 billion combined for Solana treasury funds. This level of institutional backing cements Solana’s credibility. ETF & Regulatory Progress: With a Solana ETF decision due by October 16, 2025 , confidence for approval stands at 95%. The REX Shares Solana Staking ETF has already surpassed $150 million AUM , reflecting strong demand. Memecoin Ecosystem: Solana continues to dominate memecoin activity, with projects like Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) and Dogwifhat (WIF) leading multibillion-dollar markets. Solana’s combination of scalability, institutional adoption, and memecoin culture makes it a strong growth leader in Q4. XRP: Regulatory Clarity and Institutional Breakthroughs For XRP, 2025 will be remembered as the year of ultimate clarity. On August 8, 2025 , Ripple and the SEC officially ended their long-running lawsuit, confirming XRP is not a security in secondary market transactions. This ruling immediately boosted institutional confidence, putting XRP in the same legal category as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Key bullish developments for XRP include: ETF Applications: Seven major asset managers, including Grayscale and Franklin Templeton, updated their XRP ETF filings on August 22, 2025 . Analysts believe approval odds are now above 95%, with mid-October as the decision deadline. Price Growth: XRP is currently trading near $2.93–$2.95 , up almost 400% YTD from Q4 2024 lows. Analysts project year-end targets of $3.70–$5.50 . Utility Expansion: Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service is processing $15 billion annually , while the new Gemini XRP Credit Card offers up to 4% cashback in XRP. Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin is also gaining traction globally, particularly in Japan. With legal clarity, ETF momentum, and real-world utility , XRP is entering a golden era of growth and adoption. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Meme Coin That Could Outshine Them All While Solana and XRP continue to dominate institutional headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is making waves in the retail sector. Riding on the unstoppable force of memecoins, MAGACOIN FINANCE combines viral community culture with real DeFi utility — a powerful formula for exponential growth. Like DOGE and SHIB in past cycles, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building a grassroots movement with strong meme energy designed to attract retail attention.This makes MAGA the best crypto presale for long-term holders. MAGACOIN FINANCE successfully completed a full smart contract audit by HashEx, passing with no problems. This clear approval has boosted investor confidence, showing that the project is safe and reliable. With strong foundations in place, the audit adds another layer of trust to MAGACOIN FINANCE’s growing reputation. With Solana leading memecoin trading activity and XRP unlocking new liquidity via ETFs, the timing couldn’t be better for a fresh meme coin narrative. Traders have also started adopting the PATRIOT50X code as a way to secure a 50% bonus. If history repeats itself, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the next skyrocketing token that defines Q4 2025’s retail bull run. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is One of the Best Crypto Presales to Buy in 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining recognition as one of the best crypto presales to buy in 2025 thanks to its focus on long-term investor safety and transparency . The project’s smart contract has been audited by Hashex , reinforcing trust in its code and structure. Combined with a fully KYC-verified team and growing investor traction, MAGACOIN FINANCE is not just trending — it’s being built to last. Final Thoughts: Best Crypto Presale to Watch The cryptocurrency environment in the 4th quarter of 2025 has a multitude of opportunities to explore: Solana is positioned for further institutional adoption and DeFi growth. XRP has finally achieved clarity, unlocking massive institutional inflows. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands at the intersection of meme power and early presale hype — giving investors a shot at outsized gains. With Solana and XRP paving the way for mainstream adoption, the MAGACOIN FINANCE presale represents the most exciting entry point for investors who want exposure to the next big meme coin success story.

Recently, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller, a key voice in financial policy, offered a significant perspective on the future of cryptocurrencies, specifically concerning stablecoin regulation . He described a proposed U.S. stablecoin bill, known as the GENIUS Act, as a “good starting point.” This sentiment signals a positive, albeit incremental, path forward for digital assets in the mainstream financial system. Why is Effective Stablecoin Regulation So Important Right Now? You might be wondering, what exactly are stablecoins, and why do regulators like Governor Waller care so much about them? Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar. This stability makes them a crucial bridge between the volatile crypto market and traditional finance. However, their growing popularity also brings potential risks. If a stablecoin were to lose its peg or face a significant liquidity crisis, it could have broader implications for the financial system. Therefore, clear and robust stablecoin regulation is seen as essential for protecting consumers, preventing illicit activities, and ensuring overall financial stability. What Does “Good Starting Point” Really Mean for Stablecoins? When Governor Waller stated the GENIUS Act is a “good starting point,” he implied that while the current proposal is a strong foundation, it’s likely not the final word on the matter. This perspective suggests an adaptive and evolving approach to policy-making. Regulators understand that the digital asset space is dynamic, and legislation needs to be flexible enough to address future innovations and challenges. Here are some key aspects of this incremental approach: Building Consensus: It allows various stakeholders – from lawmakers to industry experts – to refine the rules. Learning and Adapting: As the market matures, regulations can be updated to reflect new realities. Ensuring Robustness: Incremental steps help create comprehensive and resilient regulatory frameworks. This careful consideration aims to foster innovation while mitigating risks, a delicate balance in the rapidly advancing crypto sector. The goal is to ensure that stablecoin regulation supports growth rather than stifles it. Navigating the Challenges of Effective Stablecoin Regulation While the prospect of clearer stablecoin regulation is generally welcomed, crafting effective policy is not without its hurdles. One major challenge involves balancing strict oversight with the need to allow for technological innovation. Overly restrictive rules could push development offshore or stifle the very benefits stablecoins can offer, such as faster, cheaper payments. Other challenges include: Jurisdictional Issues: Cryptocurrencies operate globally, making it complex to enforce national regulations. Defining Scope: Deciding which entities fall under which regulatory umbrella (e.g., banks, money transmitters). Technological Nuances: Understanding the underlying blockchain technology to create appropriate rules. Addressing these complexities requires ongoing dialogue and collaboration between regulators, industry leaders, and technical experts. The aim is to create a regulatory environment that promotes safety and soundness without hindering progress. Governor Waller’s comments underscore a measured and pragmatic approach by the Federal Reserve. It signals that policymakers are actively engaged in understanding and shaping the future of digital currencies. This ongoing effort to establish clear stablecoin regulation is vital for the broader acceptance and integration of digital assets into the global financial ecosystem. As these issues are addressed incrementally, we can anticipate a more defined and secure landscape for stablecoins. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly are stablecoins? Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to minimize price volatility. They achieve this by pegging their value to a stable asset, such as the U.S. dollar, gold, or other fiat currencies, often through reserves. Why is the Federal Reserve interested in stablecoin regulation? The Federal Reserve is concerned about financial stability and consumer protection. As stablecoins grow in popularity and usage, they could pose systemic risks if not properly regulated, similar to traditional financial instruments. What is the GENIUS Act? The GENIUS Act is a proposed piece of U.S. legislation aimed at creating a regulatory framework specifically for stablecoins. It seeks to define stablecoins, establish oversight, and ensure their stability and transparency. How might stablecoin regulation affect me as a crypto user? Effective stablecoin regulation could lead to increased trust and security when using stablecoins. It might also introduce new requirements for stablecoin issuers, potentially affecting how you acquire or redeem them, but ultimately aiming for a safer environment. What are the next steps for stablecoin regulation in the U.S.? Following discussions like Governor Waller’s, the GENIUS Act or similar proposals will likely undergo further debate and amendments in Congress. The process typically involves legislative review, committee hearings, and potential votes, leading to the eventual establishment of new laws or guidelines. Did you find this article insightful?

Experts think that these tokens could go up by as much as 2500% in this bull cycle. Cronos has just broken out with a lot of strength, and a new Layer 2 memecoin called Layer Brett is getting a lot of attention in its presale. In this article, we look at recent changes in the Bitcoin price while some whales are investing significantly in Cronos and Layer Brett. Bitcoin Tests Support Amid Pullback The Bitcoin price has dropped more than 2% over the past week, going below $110,000. The Bitcoin price chart has been displaying lower lows and lower highs since mid-August, which is a hint of a bearish structure after losing its last trendline support. Traders are being careful because the Bitcoin price is having trouble keeping its bullish momentum. Nonetheless, many are keeping a close eye on the next major rise. Even when the Bitcoin price seems bearish in the short term, macro indications are still strong. The global M2 money supply is growing at a record rate, and Bitcoin has always gone up a lot after such expansion. The next four months could be very important, but there is usually a 12-week delay. As more money flows into risky assets, experts think the Bitcoin price might rise to between $180,000 and $220,000 in this cycle. Layer Brett: Meme Energy Meets Real Utility Layer Brett is made to turn meme culture into genuine blockchain power. This project is made for speed, scale, and incentives, unlike the first Brett, which had no use. Layer Brett is fully interoperable and will make it easy for users and developers to move across chains without any problems. It’s easy to set up: just connect your wallet, pick a payment token, buy $LBRETT, and start staking right away. Layer Brett’s Layer 2 design decreases expenses down to cents, while Ethereum gas fees are generally between $10 and $20. The presale for $LBRETT is going on right now for $0.005; however, the price will go up soon. The project has already raised more than $1.5 million within a few weeks, which shows that there is a lot of investor interest. At launch, people will be able to claim tokens through the official site, and they can stake them right away to get incentives. The project combines viral culture with a clear roadmap of social contests, engagement campaigns, and growth incentives. Layer Brett is making its own way by competing with Layer 2 leaders like Optimism, Arbitrum, and zkSync. Many people think it’s one of the best cryptos to buy before the presale ends. Cronos and Layer Brett Set To Yield More Gains Than Bitcoin The Bitcoin price may be testing support, but smart investors are already shifting into assets that are likely to grow quickly. Cronos has been recently strongly bullish, but Layer Brett has taken the focus with its tremendous presale momentum. For only $0.005, $LBRETT gives investors a rare chance to get in on a Layer 2 project that combines meme energy with genuine blockchain use. Prices are going up in the presale, and the project has already raised over $1.5 million. If you wait, you could miss out on gains that could change your life. Don’t miss out—join the Layer Brett presale today to make sure you grab your spot before the next price increase.

Traders are closely watching both, but another project is drawing even more attention: BlockDAG (BDAG). Unlike meme-driven rallies or oracle-focused moves, BlockDAG is built to appeal to large-scale financial adoption. Its hybrid design combines DAG scalability with Proof-of-Work security, enabling 15,000 TPS, which is the type of performance needed for global payments and enterprise networks. The focus now is on what happens if institutions start using BDAG. Large capital inflows could change its price outlook quickly. That is why projections around $7 are gaining traction for 2025. With over $386 million already raised, BDAG is turning heads and setting the stage for long-term momentum. BlockDAG on Road to $7: Presale Crosses $386M! The key factor behind BlockDAG’s growing attention is its ability to meet institutional standards. The hybrid DAG plus Proof-of-Work setup delivers 15,000 TPS with strong security, making it a real option for enterprise payments and financial services. That level of throughput is more than a technical talking point; it is the kind of infrastructure that large banks and payment firms demand. If these players start to adopt BDAG, the liquidity moving in could quickly push it toward that $7 target. The presale itself is a strong indicator of traction. BlockDAG has already raised more than $386 million, selling over 25.5 billion coins across 30 batches. The current presale price is $0.03, and batch one buyers are already looking at paper returns of about 2,900%. Miner sales have added another $7.8 million, with more than 19,400 units sold, building a community that extends beyond just coin holders. Market projections suggest BDAG could list at $0.05, with potential paths toward $1 by 2027 and $5 by 2030. With institutional adoption added to the mix, the $7 forecast starts to look far more realistic than speculative. The presale’s structure adds another layer of urgency, as each batch increase tightens access and rewards early buyers. Combined with confirmed listings on MEXC, LBank, and BitMart, BlockDAG is positioning itself as one of the strongest entries of 2025. For those looking at long-term upside, BDAG’s blend of technology and adoption drivers makes it a prime candidate. Shiba Inu Bearish Momentum Persists The Shiba Inu price chart is flashing clear signs of weakness. A Death Cross confirmed on August 20 has weighed heavily, with SHIB sliding below its 20-day moving average and now testing support near $0.00001252. If this breaks, the next likely zone is $0.0000118. On-chain signals are also negative, with the burn rate collapsing by more than 98% in a single day, showing supply cuts have lost traction. Daily declines of around 0.6% and a 17% drop over the past month point to bearish momentum, while volume has dropped by more than 24%, suggesting thinning participation. Indicators like MACD and Parabolic SAR also align to the downside. Without a clear reversal or stronger support, Shiba Inu remains under pressure, and short-term forecasts lean toward more weakness before stability returns. Chainlink Bullish Momentum Builds Toward $30 Chainlink has shown the opposite trend, with price momentum turning positive. LINK has climbed near $27, and a Golden Cross on August 22, where the 5-day average crossed above the 20-day, confirmed the bullish setup. Analysts are watching short-term targets at $30, with possible moves to $33.75 and even $50 if resistance breaks. Backing this rally, whale accumulation has surged, with over $1.2 billion moved into cold storage in just a week. This aligns with trading sentiment, as the Fear & Greed Index at 68 reflects strong confidence. Volume has tripled in recent days, showing broad support. Technical indicators across multiple timeframes are also positive. Unless LINK drops below $21, the outlook remains bullish, with near-term breakout potential backed by both on-chain and market signals. Final Thoughts Shiba Inu is locked in bearish momentum, with technicals and on-chain data pointing to weakness. Chainlink is moving in the opposite direction, with bullish signals suggesting a breakout toward $30 and beyond. These two examples highlight how quickly sentiment can flip in the market. But the bigger story lies with BlockDAG. Its 15,000 TPS network, $386 million raised, and over 25.5 billion coins sold show both scale and adoption. With miner sales passing $7.8 million and over 19,400 units sold, BDAG has traction across multiple fronts. If institutions embrace it, the $7 projection shifts from speculation to a real possibility. This mix of strong tech, presale momentum, and adoption potential is why many are calling BDAG the best crypto to watch for 2025.

50838082,https://timestabloid.com/?p=80654,1756425645,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Solana Price Prediction 2025 — Analysts Call $1,000 Target One of the Best Long-Term Crypto Bets",https://timestabloid.com/solana-price-prediction-2025-analysts-call-1000-target/,"Solana’s network growth is once again in the spotlight, but analysts and traders are also paying attention to MAGACOIN FINANCE , a legitimate project that combines meme appeal with security-first infrastructure. With Solana forecasts soaring, some investors are weighing whether new altcoins like MAGACOIN can deliver even greater upside. Solana’s DeFi Ecosystem Hits New Highs Solana’s DeFi ecosystem has seen a dramatic surge in activity during 2025. Reports confirm its total value locked (TVL) jumped 30.4% in Q2 to $8.6 billion, reaching multi-year highs. By March, the figure climbed to $13 billion, highlighting a recovery that pushed Solana to the second-largest position in the DeFi sector. Alongside this TVL growth, Solana’s DEX volume reached $100 billion in March alone, eclipsing many rival networks. By April, that number hit $107 billion, doubling year-over-year. Solana teams also captured 57% of all dApp revenue, showing just how much of the activity was staying inside its ecosystem. For many traders, this backdrop has renewed confidence in Solana’s longer-term price trajectory. Institutional Backing and Technology Upgrades Institutional interest is also reshaping Solana’s outlook. VanEck projects the token could hit $520 by year-end 2025, while JPMorgan recently raised its own target to $500. A major driver here is the growing likelihood of a Solana spot ETF approval, which analysts place at around 85%. At the same time, developments like Visa integration, along with Firedancer and Alpenglow upgrades, are expected to expand efficiency and attract new users. Analysts suggest these advancements could fuel adoption at a scale comparable to Ethereum’s earlier cycles. With this foundation, price forecasts from Finbold and others range from $520 to as high as $1,500, with some traders eyeing the round number target of $1,000. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Security, ROI, and Missed Opportunities While Solana gains headlines, traders are also noticing MAGACOIN FINANCE . The altcoin is currently trading under $0.0005 and has already established itself as a legitimate project through security audits and verified transparency. For early entrants, the math is simple: even a move toward $0.02 would represent around a 40x return. This type of upside draws parallels to stories of investors who missed early entries into Solana before it became a household name. But unlike meme coins with no structure, MAGACOIN emphasizes trust with its audited smart contract , community ownership, and KYC-verified team . For traders, it blends relatability with credibility, making it more than just another trend coin. The question many are asking is whether passing on MAGACOIN now could feel like missing Solana at $1 in hindsight. Analysts Rank MAGACOIN FINANCE a Leading Crypto Presale for 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE is often featured in analyst watchlists as one of the top crypto presales for 2025, and for good reason. The team’s commitment to full transparency — including public audits and KYC verification — builds unmatched trust. These fundamentals give investors peace of mind and separate the project from unverified alternatives in the market. Conclusion: How to Position in This Market Solana’s 2025 forecasts suggest it could climb into four figures if institutional demand stays strong. At the same time, altcoins like MAGACOIN present early-stage entry points with audited security and clear upside math. For traders who want to balance established plays with new opportunities, this may be the time to act.

50838046,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=811508,1756425654,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/50838046.jpeg,Crypto Bull Run Dead? Analyst Says The Real Top Isn’t Here Yet,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-bull-run-dead-real-top-isnt-here-yet/,"Top analyst Miles Deutscher says the crypto market’s apparent fatigue is being misread. In a new video titled “Why The Crypto Bull Run Is Far From Over (Data Says This Happens Next),” the commentator—who has more than 630,000 followers on X—argues that both macro and market-structure signals point to an extended cycle, with Ethereum poised to lead even if Bitcoin cools. Crypto Cycle Dead? Deutscher opens by cutting against a swelling narrative that Bitcoin “has potentially put in a top,” acknowledging that spot price action “objectively looks quite weak at the moment.” Yet, he stresses, “I don’t believe the cycle is over,” and lays out what he considers the telltale sign of a real top—one that he says has not materialized. On the shorter time frame, he notes BTC slipped below a channel low but is attempting to reclaim the mid-range, highlighting a near-term “bearish retest at the H4 money noodle.” He calls the $111.5k area a line in the sand, with a push and hold back above ~$114k needed to repair structure. For clarity, he describes his “noodle” as a custom moving-average style trend gauge: “just our custom indicator which is basically a moving average.” Where Bitcoin looks “a little bit toppy,” Deutscher says Ethereum’s daily structure “paints a very different picture.” ETH, he argues, is showing a classic compression beneath major resistance around its prior all-time high while “grinding above the money noodle,” a configuration he believes sets up “the next expansive leg to the upside” if the daily trend base is maintained. Related Reading: Nearly $1B Wiped Out in Crypto Liquidations: Are Whales Turning the Crash Into a Buying Opportunity? A central plank of his thesis is the cycle’s alignment with broader risk indicators. Reading from a post by trader Nik (@cointradernik), he underscores that several risk-on ratios look like they are bottoming, not topping—US micro caps versus small caps, emerging markets versus the FTSE 100, ARK-style growth versus gold—suggesting the business cycle is still advancing rather than rolling over. In that context, Deutscher contends it would be unusual for crypto to peak now unless it consciously decoupled from equities. He further frames a policy backdrop he sees as supportive, pointing to political rhetoric favorable to crypto assets and the prospect of rate cuts later this year; he characterizes the current market “jitteriness” as a function of timing uncertainty rather than a structural turn. Related Reading: This Altcoin Is A 12,500% Crypto Bet Until 2028, Says Arthur Hayes He also revisits Bitcoin’s higher-time-frame rhythm since 2023 as a sequence of “rally-base-rally” phases with recurring retests of a weekly trend marker. In that pattern, he argues, even a drop toward ~$100,000 would be a textbook bull-market pullback, not a terminal break, especially given what he calls today’s comparatively modest extension above long-term averages versus 2021 and late-2024. “Anyone whose view is that Bitcoin has topped for the cycle here at $124,000 will be deeply disappointed in the relative shallowness of this correction,” he says, asserting that distance to key moving averages leaves less room for a deep retrace. The Altcoin Rotation The most controversial—and for crypto traders, arguably the most consequential—part of Deutscher’s analysis is historical altcoin rotation. He says prior cycles show that Ethereum often does its strongest work after Bitcoin tops. “In 2017 Bitcoin topped and traded 47% lower as Ethereum rallied 100% higher in the next 30 days,” he claims. “In 2021, Bitcoin topped [and] went 27% lower as ETH rallied…83% higher in the next 30 days.” While he is not declaring a BTC top now, he argues the crypto market is already exhibiting a “decoupling” in which ETH and other altcoins are grinding higher against BTC even as Bitcoin softens—proof, in his view, that “using Bitcoin as your ultimate bull-market indicator” for alts can be misleading when Ethereum’s structure is this strong. That view informs his positioning. Rather than longing Bitcoin at support, he says he’s increasingly using BTC dips as “confluence to take a trade on Ethereum because I think Ethereum outperforms from here on out.” On camera, he disclosed a growing ETH long in a public “fun trading account,” while emphasizing that “most people would be better off sticking mostly to spot” and that any use of leverage should be small, deliberate and within strict risk parameters. “There were many times where I’ve screwed up by being over-leveraged,” he cautions. Beyond trade setup and crypto cycle theory, Deutscher returns to his original premise: a genuine cycle top generally coincides with a topping business cycle, deteriorating breadth in risk assets, and blow-off dynamics he says are absent today. Summarizing his stance, he concludes that neither Bitcoin nor altcoins have topped “due to where we are in the business cycle,” and even if BTC does mark a high sooner than he expects, “I wouldn’t necessarily take that as the ultimate bear signal for ETH and alts.” At press time, BTC traded at $113,028.

50840157,568083,1756425659,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50840157.jpeg,"115 DeFi, Crypto Companies Tell Senate: Protect Developers Or No Deal On Market Bill",https://bitcoinist.com/115-defi-crypto-companies-tell-senate-protect-developers-or-no-deal-on-market-bill/,"A broad coalition of crypto builders, investors and advocates has asked two Senate committees for clear federal rules to protect software creators and non-custodial service providers working on blockchain networks. According to the letter , 115 groups signed the appeal to the Senate Committee on Banking and the Committee on Agriculture, and they made one demand plain: without explicit protections, they will not back market structure legislation. Call For Federal Protections The signers want lawmakers to make it clear that writing, publishing, or maintaining open-source blockchain software is not the same as running a bank or exchange. Reports have disclosed concerns that developers could be treated as financial intermediaries even when they never hold user funds. The letter asks Congress to shield developers from being prosecuted or misclassified under laws such as 18 U.S.C. § 1960. It also asks that any federal law preempt conflicting state rules so companies and contributors are not left juggling 50 different legal standards. Bills Praised But Not Enough According to the coalition, drafts in both chambers already include two measures that move in the right direction: the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act and the Keep Your Coins Act. But the groups argue those drafts fall short on some points and need clearer, stronger language. Based on reports from the signers, the protections must be explicit and nationwide, not partial or open to varying state interpretations. Without that clarity, the letter warns, developers may choose to work elsewhere. Developer Loss And Talent Flight The group cited data showing a slide in the share of open-source developers based in the US, from 25% in 2021 to 18% in 2025. According to a recent report by the President’s Working Group on Digital Assets , reversing that decline is central to making America a leading hub for blockchain work. The signers say those numbers show how regulatory uncertainty can change where people live and where code is built. Legal Clarity As A Business Need The coalition argues that clear rules are also a practical business need. When the legal line between building software and operating financial services blurs, companies and contributors face possible legal exposure. That creates a cost for startups and volunteers alike. If developers face the risk of civil or criminal action for routine open-source work, projects can slow or stop. The letter asks Congress to state plainly that creating interfaces or tools that let people self-custody their funds is not, by itself, an activity that should trigger money-transmitter rules. Bipartisan Support And Next Steps Signers pointed to past bipartisan moves to protect developers. They noted that 294 members of Congress supported the CLARITY Act when it passed, signaling broad backing for basic safeguards. Based on the letter, the groups want the Senate to strengthen those protections now, and to do so in a way that covers all states uniformly.

While established tokens often get the most attention from analysts, MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the emerging contenders gaining traction and popularity in the market. Why? Analysts tracking MAGACOIN FINANCE say it is one of the rare early-stage projects that combines strong security and a safe environment, making it one of the standout choices. Here are seven altcoins that investors and analysts are closely watching. 1. Bitcoin (BTC) — Still the Market Leader Bitcoin’s price continues to see volatile movement, which is not surprising considering that the token has experienced multiple rallies in 2025. With the recent pullback taking its price to around $110K, analysts have spotlighted the drop as a chance for smart investors to buy low before prices rise again. 2. Chainlink (LINK) — Oracles Driving Growth Chainlink has become a top pick thanks to new partnerships with ICE and Mastercard, plus its buyback program, reducing supply. LINK broke past $26 for the first time in seven months, making it one of the top altcoins 2025 for long-term DeFi adoption. 3. AAVE — Multi-Chain Liquidity Expansion AAVE jumped nearly 19% to $355 after launching on the Aptos blockchain, marking its first move beyond Ethereum. With a $1.5 billion liquidity fund and V4 upgrades in progress, AAVE is strengthening its role as DeFi’s liquidity backbone. Analysts are watching the $400 mark as the next big milestone. 4. Arbitrum (ARB) — Scaling Ethereum’s Future Arbitrum continues to lead Ethereum scaling, rolling out instant cross-rollup access and supporting more than 900 dApps. Its recent Robinhood listing added fuel, positioning ARB as a critical player in Ethereum’s growing layer-2 ecosystem. 5. Polkadot (DOT) — Building for the Long Term Polkadot remains in focus with upgrades like Elastic Scaling and parachain adoption. While DOT trades around $4, forecasts point toward $7–$8 by 2026 if ecosystem growth accelerates. Developers and institutions alike are watching Polkadot 2.0 closely. 6. Avalanche (AVAX) — Institutional and Public-Sector Adoption Avalanche is gaining traction with hedge fund tokenization and Wyoming’s new stablecoin launch. Technical upgrades like the Octane hard fork cut fees by 96%, while ETF filings suggest stronger institutional demand ahead. A breakout above $25 could signal a bullish run. 7. MAGACOIN FINANCE — The Rising Ethereum Gem With attention turning away from big names, MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the few emerging contenders earning a spot on analysts’ watchlists. Market conditions show the project is set to benefit from the capital rotating from leading tokens into smaller high-potential projects. While analysts often caution investors about early-stage projects, experts say MAGACOIN FINANCE is different, highlighting the trust, safety, and growing confidence in the project. Added to that is the 5x return early investors can make on their investments. Such high-potential opportunities are rare, and that is why MAGACOIN FINANCE is the name on every analyst’s list as the best altcoin to buy in 2025. Analysts Say MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Among the Best Altcoins to Buy in 2025 Analysts consistently rank MAGACOIN FINANCE among the best altcoins to buy in 2025 for one key reason: long-term potential . The project is gaining momentum with thousands of early investors , strong social growth, and a transparent development roadmap . It’s the kind of asset seasoned buyers watch before the next bull market cycle kicks off. Bottom Line Opportunities in the cryptocurrency market emerge in every cycle. However, what makes the difference is those investors who get on the projects before the rest of the market does. Right now, this list of tokens represents the best altcoins to buy now. From proven leaders to an emerging contender like MAGACOIN FINANCE that is drawing in thousands of investors daily, 2025 is shaping up to be a year of both stability and bold innovation.

The city has also pursued onerous regulations to rein in the dealings of digital assets to protect investors and control financial risks. The two-day event attracted more than 17,000 ticket registrations, nearly three times last year’s attendance, revealing the meteoric development of Asia’s crypto society. It’s expected that around 15,000 fans will attend — making it the second biggest Bitcoin-focused event on the planet. The right-wing Goethel men have said that the event’s star speaker would be Eric Trump, the son of U.S. President Donald Trump. He commanded attention with his appearance, but he prompted some late withdrawals, too. Eric Yip Chee-hang, executive director of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), and Johnny Ng Kit-ch, a pro-Beijing lawmaker, withdrew from the panel. Officials reportedly recommended they steer clear of Eric Trump amid ongoing political sensitivities. While the pullbacks, Bitcoin Asia is also a platform for regulators, entrepreneurs, and crypto firms to debate the tension between innovation and supervision. Speakers push treasury use and tighter regulation One of the main themes of this year’s Bitcoin Asia 2025 conference is how digital asset treasuries can mature beyond token-bag-holding into a healthier financial ecology. Abel Seow, head of APAC and managing director of BitGo, said companies should view their treasuries as more than passive storage for crypto assets. He explained that firms should use these resources to drive innovation and build sustainable markets. Seow noted that while many companies were still focused on accumulating tokens, the next stage would involve creating ecosystems that attract institutional investors and strengthen trust in crypto. Clarence Shen, a fintech policy manager at the SFC, said Hong Kong aimed to be at the forefront of setting global rules for digital assets. He explained that the city had actively engaged in multilateral and bilateral discussions with regulators. According to him, Hong Kong should take part in these efforts and act as an active writer of the global rulebook. Other speakers concurred with the sentiment that regulation is now the heart of where crypto is going. With the United States and Europe already establishing new benchmarks, many believe Asia — particularly Hong Kong — will be the next front in a global race to harmonize rules for the world of cryptotrading. Hong Kong chases stablecoin rules on its crypto dreams The Bitcoin Asia 2025 conference followed one of the most significant new laws that Hong Kong has introduced in months. On May 21, 2025, the city introduced the stablecoin law , which would have required the operators of Hong Kong dollar-backed stablecoins to be licensed by the HKMA. The law imposes strict rules on reserves, redemption rights, and risk management. The ordinance reflects Hong Kong’s efforts to ensure protection for investors while instilling trust in its financial system. But it has also dampened some initial excitement, as companies contend with higher compliance costs and limits on issuing or marketing stablecoins without the appropriate licenses. In February 2025, the SFC also looked at rules on crypto derivatives and margin financing for professional investors. Hong Kong has granted nine licenses for digital asset trading, with eight more applications under review. The measures are part of the city’s balancing act between wooing international investment in crypto and hedging systemic risks in its financial system. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Today, a staggering Bitcoin options expiration event is set to unfold, involving contracts worth an immense $11.6 billion. This isn’t just a big number; it represents a moment where market dynamics could shift, influencing how Bitcoin and even Ethereum perform in the short term. Understanding these events is crucial for navigating the evolving digital asset landscape. What Exactly is Bitcoin Options Expiration, Anyway? You might be wondering, what exactly happens when options expire? Simply put, a crypto option is a contract that gives a buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) a cryptocurrency at a specific price on or before a certain date. When that date arrives, the options either get exercised, or they expire worthless. Today, at 8:00 a.m. UTC on August 29, we’re seeing a massive expiry. Data from the leading crypto options exchange, Deribit, indicates that $11.57 billion in Bitcoin options are reaching their maturity. Alongside this, Ethereum options valued at $3.13 billion will also expire, adding another layer of intrigue to the market. This simultaneous Bitcoin options expiration and Ethereum event makes it particularly noteworthy. Understanding the Numbers: Put/Call Ratio and Max Pain These large-scale expirations come with some important metrics that traders and analysts closely watch. Let’s break them down: Put/Call Ratio: For the Bitcoin options expiration, this ratio stands at 0.78. This number tells us the volume of put options (bets on price going down) compared to call options (bets on price going up). A ratio below 1, like 0.78, generally suggests that more call options are open than put options, indicating a slightly bullish or neutral sentiment among options traders. For Ethereum, the ratio is 0.77, signaling a similar sentiment. Max Pain Price: This is a fascinating concept. For Bitcoin, the max pain price is $115,000. For Ethereum, it’s $3,800. The max pain price is the strike price at which the largest number of open options contracts (both puts and calls) will expire worthless. In essence, it’s the price point that causes the maximum financial loss for options holders, and conversely, the maximum gain for options sellers (often market makers). While not a guaranteed price target, markets sometimes gravitate towards this level as the expiration approaches. How Might This Bitcoin Options Expiration Impact the Market? Large options expirations, especially those involving significant notional values like today’s Bitcoin options expiration , can introduce volatility into the market. Here’s why: Hedging Activities: Options sellers, or market makers, often hedge their positions by buying or selling the underlying asset (Bitcoin or Ethereum). As expiration nears, they might adjust these hedges, leading to increased buying or selling pressure. Price Discovery: The ""max pain"" theory suggests that the price of the underlying asset might gravitate towards the max pain point. While this isn’t a hard rule, it’s a phenomenon many traders observe. Sentiment Shift: The outcome of the expiration – whether many calls or puts expire in the money – can influence overall market sentiment for the coming days. It’s important to remember that while these events can create short-term fluctuations, the broader market trend is influenced by many factors, including macroeconomic news, regulatory developments, and institutional adoption. Therefore, while significant, the Bitcoin options expiration is one piece of a larger puzzle. Navigating the Volatility: What Should Investors Consider? With such a substantial Bitcoin options expiration , prudent investors and traders might consider a few things: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on real-time price action around the 8:00 a.m. UTC expiration time. Volatility can be swift. Risk Management: If you are actively trading, ensure your risk management strategies are in place, such as setting stop-loss orders. Protect your capital from unexpected swings. Long-Term Perspective: For long-term holders, these short-term volatility events are often just noise. Focus on your investment thesis rather than daily price swings. Today’s event highlights the growing maturity and complexity of the cryptocurrency derivatives market. As more sophisticated financial instruments become available, understanding their impact becomes crucial for all participants. The ongoing development of this market brings both opportunities and challenges. Conclusion: A Day of Anticipation for Crypto Markets The expiration of $11.6 billion in Bitcoin options and $3.13 billion in Ethereum options today marks a significant moment for the crypto derivatives landscape. While it doesn’t guarantee dramatic price movements, it certainly sets the stage for potential short-term volatility and increased market activity. Keeping an eye on the put/call ratios and max pain prices offers valuable insights into the prevailing market sentiment. As always, informed decision-making and robust risk management are your best allies in navigating these exciting market events, especially around a major Bitcoin options expiration . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a Bitcoin options expiration? It’s the specific date and time when Bitcoin options contracts cease to be valid. At this point, holders must decide whether to exercise their right to buy or sell Bitcoin, or let the options expire worthless. 2. What is the significance of the put/call ratio? The put/call ratio indicates the relative volume of put options (bearish bets) to call options (bullish bets). A ratio below 1, like 0.78, suggests more bullish sentiment, while a ratio above 1 points to more bearish sentiment. 3. What does ""max pain price"" mean? The max pain price is the strike price at which the largest number of options contracts (both puts and calls) will expire worthless, causing maximum financial loss for options holders and maximum gain for options writers. 4. Will the Bitcoin options expiration definitely cause a price crash? Not necessarily. While large options expirations can introduce volatility and influence short-term price action, they do not guarantee a price crash. Many factors contribute to market movements, and options expiration is just one of them. 5. Where can I find data on crypto options expirations? Leading crypto options exchanges like Deribit, CME, and others provide data on open interest, put/call ratios, and expiration schedules for Bitcoin and Ethereum options.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a powerful barometer, offering a snapshot of investor psychology. Currently holding steady at 50, this key indicator signals a fascinating neutral stance in the market. But what exactly does this equilibrium mean for your crypto strategy? What Exactly is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is an essential tool designed to measure the prevailing emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. It ranges from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed). When investors are overly fearful, it can present a buying opportunity. Conversely, excessive greed might indicate a market correction is on the horizon. A score of 50, as we see today, suggests a balanced, neutral outlook among participants. This index provides a valuable perspective beyond just price movements. It helps you gauge whether the market is reacting emotionally or rationally. For instance, a sudden dip might cause widespread panic (fear), while a rapid surge could ignite FOMO (greed). The current neutral position of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index suggests neither extreme emotion is dominating. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? Ever wondered what factors contribute to this insightful indicator? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is not based on a single metric but a sophisticated combination of several market data points, each weighted differently to provide a comprehensive view. This multi-faceted approach ensures a more accurate reflection of sentiment. Here are the primary components that determine the index’s value: Volatility (25%): This measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average values over the last 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility often indicates a fearful market. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): The current trading volume and market momentum are compared with average values. High buying volumes in a positive market often signal greed. Social Media (15%): This factor analyzes the number of posts and interactions related to cryptocurrencies on various social media platforms, especially Twitter. A surge in positive sentiment can push the index towards greed. Surveys (15%): While currently paused, surveys historically involved weekly polls to gather direct investor sentiment. This direct feedback offered unique insights. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): An increase in Bitcoin’s market cap dominance often suggests a shift from altcoins to Bitcoin, which can be a sign of fear or uncertainty in the broader altcoin market. Google Trends (10%): This component examines search query data for crypto-related terms. For example, a spike in searches for “Bitcoin price manipulation” might indicate fear. Decoding the Neutral Crypto Fear & Greed Index Reading A score of 50 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index signifies a perfectly neutral market. This means neither extreme fear nor extreme greed is prevalent. Investors are not panicking, nor are they exhibiting irrational exuberance. Instead, the market is in a state of balance, weighing both positive and negative developments carefully. For many, a neutral reading can be a moment of introspection rather than immediate action. It suggests a period where the market might be consolidating or waiting for a clearer catalyst. This balanced sentiment could indicate a pause before a significant move in either direction, making it a crucial time for careful observation. Understanding this neutral Crypto Fear & Greed Index helps inform a measured approach. Actionable Insights: Navigating a Neutral Market with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index sits at 50, what should investors consider? This neutral zone offers unique opportunities and challenges. It encourages a strategic, rather than emotional, approach to crypto investing. Benefits of a Neutral Market: Reduced Volatility: Often, a neutral index correlates with less drastic price swings, providing a calmer environment for analysis. Opportunity for Accumulation: Smart investors might use this period to gradually build positions in projects they believe in, without the pressure of extreme market emotions. Time for Research: It’s an excellent time to conduct thorough due diligence on various cryptocurrencies and emerging technologies. Challenges and Considerations: Lack of Clear Direction: A neutral market can sometimes feel stagnant, lacking obvious trends for short-term traders. Waiting Game: Patience becomes key, as significant price movements may not occur immediately. Vulnerability to News: The market can be more susceptible to sudden shifts based on major news events or regulatory announcements. In this neutral environment, focusing on long-term fundamentals and risk management becomes paramount. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 50 provides a chance to refine your strategy. Conclusion: The Enduring Value of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, currently holding a neutral score of 50, remains an indispensable tool for anyone navigating the cryptocurrency markets. It distills complex market dynamics into a simple, understandable metric of investor sentiment. While it should not be the sole basis for investment decisions, it offers a powerful complementary perspective, helping you to identify potential overreactions or complacency. By understanding its components and what a neutral reading implies, you empower yourself to make more informed, less emotional choices. Keep an eye on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index ; it’s a window into the collective psyche of the crypto world, guiding you through its unpredictable currents. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool that measures the current emotional state of the cryptocurrency market, ranging from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed). It helps investors gauge whether the market is behaving rationally or emotionally. How is a “neutral” reading defined by the index? A neutral reading on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, specifically a score of 50, indicates that neither extreme fear nor extreme greed is dominating the market.

The index is calculated based on several factors, including market volatility, trading volume, social media sentiment, surveys (historically), Bitcoin’s market cap dominance, and Google search trends related to cryptocurrencies. Should investors make decisions solely based on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? No, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index should be used as a complementary tool.

The regulator issued an advisory confirming that U.S. residents can now legally access non-U.S. crypto exchanges through its Foreign Board of Trade (FBOT) registration framework. The move is a tectonic shift for digital asset markets. For years, gray areas in the regulations and aggressive enforcement pushed U.S. traders offshore. Some exchanges blocked access to customers in the United States, relegating them to smaller domestic platforms with a smaller range of options. Now that FBOTs have been registered, international exchanges can compete again in the U.S. markets on a level playing field. The advisory reminds the market that FBOT enrollment applies to non-U.S. exchanges to gain market access to their U.S. traders. This approach, CFTC noted, has worked well for the universally decentralized market for global derivatives and works just as well for crypto. The decision provides long-sought-after clarity on what is and is not a public company, said Caroline D. Pham, the interim chairwoman. She argued that American traders should be free to choose and tap those deep global liquidity pools. According to Pham, American businesses that were previously required to form operations abroad to facilitate trading of cryptos now likely have the opportunity to bring those functions back home. However, market observers say it would effectively reopen the American market to major trading platforms like Binance, Bybit, and OKX, which have rebuffed Americans in recent years. Advisory clears years of regulatory fog. The CFTC also tried to clarify the confusion it had caused around its most recent enforcement actions. Certain overseas exchanges were also unsure if they would want to leverage a bulkier domestic status as a Designated Contract Market (DCM) instead of an FBOT. The uncertainty stifled innovation, leading companies to turn their backs on American customers. Pham said that was due to “novel interpretations” contradicting decades of CFTC practice. With the FBOT rules reaffirmed, regulatory clarity has returned. Non-U.S. exchanges now know the process: register as FBOTs, operate under supervision, and legally serve American traders. The US traders have a lot riding on the CFTC’s decision. For years, they were stuck on a handful of domestic exchanges with fewer options and poor liquidity. U.S. traders can enter global markets, join global pools of liquidity, and enjoy a wider variety of tradable instruments – trade with the world on an equal footing. For the foreign exchanges, the advisory was a long-sought legal path back into the lucrative United States marketplace. Some of the largest platforms, including Binance and Bybit, had stopped or blocked U.S. users at some point to keep from running afoul of enforcement actions. Now that the FBOT registration and structuring framework is clear, these entities can return to the U.S., dealing with a clearly established regime of rules and the overhang of regulatory squandering behind the market. The entire crypto industry will benefit as well. And in indicating an intention to signal a pull back from current forbearance and toward regulatory clarity, the CFTC has solidified the U.S. as a leader in world digital asset markets. If the country reverses course, it will likely restore confidence among market participants and convince more innovation and investment to flow back into the country. Politics drives the market backdrop The announcement comes in a “crypto sprint,” as CFTC insiders describe it, to modernize America’s rules around digital assets. It is also consistent with similar efforts across government to compete globally, after Singapore, Hong Kong, and the European Union created more flexible regulatory regimes. The move was seen as carrying political weight in Washington. Pham described it as a victory for U.S. leadership in financial markets and framed the rule as both pro-innovation and pro-trader. Market reaction was swift. Analysts added that the guidance could contribute to trading volumes on major offshore platforms and drag U.S. traders into the global mix. Some even went as far as to predict that it may serve as a way to help Bitcoin and Ethereum liquidity grow in the coming months. Get seen where it counts.

Due to demand from institutions and activity related to ETF, Bitcoin continues to trade above the six-figure mark. Avalanche, meanwhile, is experiencing sharp swings in price as volatility grips its ecosystem. However, experts claim that the most appealing opportunity this quarter is not found in either of these giants, but rather a new presale token, MAGACOIN FINANCE , which is being tagged as one of the year’s best opportunities. Bitcoin: Stability With a Ceiling Bitcoin is moving sideways between $110,000 and $111,400 with a loss of about 2% in 24 hours. The daily trading volume has ranged between $79 to $87 billion, and the market cap is around $2.19 trillion. Miner and whale profit-taking after a new all-time high above $123,000 triggered the dip, experts say. Even with this correction, analysts believe that ETF inflows are a strong catalyst and think a move towards $150,000 is possible if momentum picks up. However, there are signs of shifting dynamics. The overall crypto market dominance of Bitcoin is slipping gradually as other assets, such as Ethereum and XRP, are catching up by displaying capital rotation. Bitcoin is the gold standard and main store of value, but it does not have much upside compared to new plays. Avalanche: Volatility and Growth Potential Avalanche (AVAX) is currently trading in the range of $23.35 – $23.50, down nearly 8.9% in the last 24 hours. The market cap of Terra ranges between $9.8 and $10.7 billion, with the daily trading volume of around $825 million to $855 million. The dip highlights the network’s recent volatility. Technical indicators suggest that AVAX has encountered strong resistance on multiple occasions, and today’s dramatic drop was not unexpected. In fact, previous supports were tested again in this movement at roughly $18.03. Simultaneously, Avalanche has been added as a candidate to Wyoming’s new WYST stablecoin mainnet launch despite the increasing irrelevance of stablecoin infrastructure. Short-term exposure poses considerable risks, as evidenced by the price pullback, despite on-chain meme coin activity driving engagement. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Safer, Smarter Play While Bitcoin and Avalanche remain popular, analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE is the smarter investment this quarter. With a double audit by HashEx and CertiK, it is rated safe, secure, and fully transparent, having passed every audit. According to the experts, this dual-layer verification makes it one of the safest presale investments today. Furthermore, the increase in whale inflows and the expansion of the community are speeding up the adoption rate of early-stage projects. Investors who secure allocations now are essentially buying at a fraction of its anticipated listing price, which is why the countdown effect is building urgency around this opportunity. With forecasts of 40x–50x upside, a KYC-verified team, and thousands of investors joining in, it’s being ranked as one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025 . Limited supply and rising demand make this presale one of the year’s biggest opportunities. Analyst Rankings Put MAGACOIN FINANCE Among the Best Cryptos to Buy in 2025 Recognized as one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE combines smart contract security with operational transparency. The presale has been thoroughly audited by Hashex, confirming its safety for early participants. With open tokenomics, a public-facing team, and rising investor confidence, MAGACOIN FINANCE checks all the boxes for long-term potential. Conclusion While Bitcoin offers strength and institutional security, Avalanche offers technical innovation and growth potential; neither possesses the unique combination of safety and explosive upside found in MAGACOIN FINANCE. MAGACOIN FINANCE is being termed as the smartest buy of the quarter and, more importantly, one of the most defining opportunities of 2025 thanks to double audits, a verified team and increasing presale momentum.

This significant jump signals a potentially lucrative period for alternative cryptocurrencies, moving us closer to what many investors eagerly anticipate: a full-fledged altcoin season. Understanding this key metric is crucial for navigating the evolving digital asset landscape. What is the Altcoin Season Index and Why Does it Matter? The Altcoin Season Index , provided by CoinMarketCap, is a vital tool for gauging the overall performance of altcoins against Bitcoin. It helps investors determine if the market conditions favor Bitcoin or a broader range of altcoins. A higher index score suggests that a greater percentage of altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin, indicating a shift in market sentiment and potential investment opportunities. This index offers a snapshot of current market momentum. It guides strategic decisions for crypto portfolios. A rising score often precedes significant altcoin rallies. Decoding the Altcoin Season Index: How is it Calculated? The calculation behind the Altcoin Season Index is straightforward yet powerful. It compares the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization against Bitcoin’s performance over the last 90 days. Importantly, stablecoins and wrapped coins are excluded from this analysis to provide a clearer picture of organic altcoin growth. For a period to be officially declared an “altcoin season,” at least 75% of these top 100 altcoins must outperform Bitcoin during that 90-day timeframe. A reading closer to 100 signifies a stronger and more widespread altcoin trend, suggesting broad-based gains across the altcoin market. The recent jump to 57, while not yet 75, certainly indicates a strong upward trajectory. Is it Truly Altcoin Season? Navigating Market Dynamics While the Altcoin Season Index reaching 57 is certainly encouraging, it’s important to understand what this number truly implies. We are not yet in a definitive “altcoin season” as per the 75% threshold. However, an 11-point increase overnight is a powerful indicator of shifting market dynamics and growing investor interest in altcoins. This movement suggests that a substantial portion of the top altcoins are currently showing stronger performance relative to Bitcoin. Investors should view this as a period of heightened potential and careful observation. It’s a time to: Research promising projects: Look beyond the usual suspects. Diversify wisely: Spread investments across different sectors. Monitor market trends: Stay updated on news and developments. Seizing Opportunities in the Rising Altcoin Season Index The current momentum indicated by the Altcoin Season Index presents exciting opportunities for those looking to capitalize on potential market shifts. Historically, periods leading up to an official altcoin season have seen significant gains in various altcoin categories, including DeFi tokens, NFTs, metaverse projects, and Layer-1 solutions. To navigate this environment effectively: Focus on fundamentals: Understand the technology and use cases of projects. Manage risk: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider dollar-cost averaging: Smooth out entry points over time. Stay informed: Follow reputable crypto news sources and analysts. The current Altcoin Season Index rise is a clear signal that the market is evolving. This could be the prelude to a broader altcoin rally, offering investors the chance to explore assets beyond Bitcoin. The recent surge in the Altcoin Season Index to 57 marks a pivotal moment in the cryptocurrency market. While we await the official declaration of an altcoin season, this significant increase highlights strong underlying momentum and growing investor confidence in alternative cryptocurrencies. It underscores the importance of staying informed and strategically positioning your portfolio to potentially benefit from these dynamic market shifts. The crypto landscape is ever-changing, and the rising index offers a compelling glimpse into its exciting future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does an Altcoin Season Index of 57 mean? A: An Altcoin Season Index of 57 means that 57% of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. It indicates strong momentum for altcoins, though it’s not yet the official “altcoin season” threshold of 75%. Q2: How is the Altcoin Season Index calculated? A: The index compares the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) against Bitcoin’s performance over the preceding 90 days. Q3: When is it officially considered an “altcoin season”? A: An official altcoin season is declared when 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin during a 90-day period. Q4: Should I invest in altcoins when the index rises? A: A rising Altcoin Season Index suggests favorable conditions for altcoins. However, always conduct thorough research, understand the risks involved, and consider your investment strategy before making any decisions. Q5: What are “stablecoins” and “wrapped coins” and why are they excluded? A: Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to an asset like the USD, designed to maintain a stable value. Wrapped coins are tokenized versions of other cryptocurrencies (e.g., Wrapped Bitcoin, WBTC) on a different blockchain. They are excluded from the index to focus on the organic price movements of independent altcoins. Did you find this analysis of the Altcoin Season Index insightful?

Ethereum New Contract Activity Booming – Will Price Follow? According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor PelinayPA, a sharp rebound in Ethereum contracts could be seen in 2024 and 2025. This year specifically, new contracts surged dramatically as ETH price climbed beyond $4,500. The CryptoQuant contributor highlighted that during the 2016-17 market cycle, new contract activity remained relatively muted. Despite the subdued activity, ETH price entered a strong uptrend. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Lags Despite All-Time High In Daily Transactions – What’s Next For ETH? On the contrary, following the 2018 bull run, ETH entered a price downtrend despite a rise in new contracts. ETH’s price reaction to a growth in new contracts showed that usage growth could not offset the bursting of the speculative bubble surrounding digital assets. Meanwhile, during the 2020-21 bull market, Ethereum contract creation spiked significantly, in-line with the decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFT) boom. At the time, increased network activity served as a key catalyst in aiding ETH’s rally. Later – during the 2022 bear market – both contract number and ETH price dropped. The digital asset’s price and network activity was also adversely impacted due to dwindling developer interest and user demand during the market cycle. The aforementioned examples confirm that over the long-term, growth in contract creation shows rising confidence and adoption within Ethereum’s ecosystem. These factors play out positively for ETH’s price. That said, sudden surge in contract creation have not always directly resulted into price gains. This was evident from the price corrections observed during 2018 and 2021 cycles. What Does The Current Outlook Indicate? In her analysis, PelinayPA remarked that the latest surge in new Ethereum contracts signals renewed network activity, primarily driven by DeFi, NFT, and institutional adoption. If the trend sustains, it could fuel the next ETH bull run. Related Reading: Ethereum Average Daily Outflow Hits 40,000 ETH Amid Rising Buying Pressure – Details As far as long-term effects are concerned, the analyst said that consistent growth in new contracts highlights Ethereum’s rapidly expanding real-world use-cases. This gives immense support to ETH’s price. However, hype-driven contract spikes can lead to short-lived price corrections. Recent predictions point toward further room for growth for Ethereum. For instance, Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee forecasted that ETH may climb to $5,500 “in the next couple of weeks.” In the same vein, Standard Chartered’s digital assets research chief, Geoffrey Kendrick, noted that ETH could rise to $7,500 by the end of the year. At press time, ETH trades at $4,582, down 0.2% in the past 24 hours.

Whale Alert, a renowned blockchain tracking service, recently reported a colossal USDC transfer of 499,999,990 USDC. This staggering sum, valued at approximately $500 million, originated from Coinbase Institutional and landed in an undisclosed wallet. Such a significant USDC transfer naturally sparks curiosity and speculation about its potential implications. What Does This Massive USDC Transfer Mean? When nearly half a billion dollars in stablecoins moves, it’s rarely a trivial matter. This particular USDC transfer from Coinbase Institutional, a platform catering to large institutions, suggests a high-level transaction. Understanding the nature of such a large movement is key to grasping its potential impact on the broader crypto market. Institutional Activity: Coinbase Institutional serves major players like hedge funds, asset managers, and corporations. A transfer of this magnitude indicates significant institutional involvement. Stablecoin Utility: USDC, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, is often used for large-scale settlements, hedging, or as a safe haven asset during market volatility. Market Speculation: While the destination remains ‘unknown,’ this doesn’t necessarily imply nefarious activity. It could be an over-the-counter (OTC) trade, a treasury management move, or even a large investor rebalancing their portfolio. Who is Behind Such a Significant USDC Transfer? The identity of the ‘unknown wallet’ holder is the central mystery surrounding this event. In the world of blockchain, while transactions are transparent, the entities behind the wallets often remain pseudonymous. However, we can infer some possibilities based on the scale of the USDC transfer : This kind of movement is typically associated with: Large Institutional Investors: Perhaps a fund is deploying capital into other assets, moving funds to a different custodian, or preparing for a major investment. OTC Desks: These platforms facilitate large, off-exchange trades that might not immediately impact spot prices. The funds could be moving to settle such a deal. Corporate Treasuries: Companies increasingly hold stablecoins for various operational or investment purposes, and this could be a treasury management decision. High-Net-Worth Individuals: While less common for such a precise, large sum from an institutional arm, wealthy individuals also make significant moves. The Broader Implications of a Half-Billion Dollar USDC Transfer A USDC transfer of this size, while not directly impacting the price of USDC itself (as it’s a stablecoin), can hint at broader market sentiment and future movements. It signals that significant capital is actively being deployed or repositioned within the crypto ecosystem. For instance, if this capital is preparing to enter volatile assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum, it could indicate bullish sentiment. Conversely, if it’s being moved to a cold storage wallet for long-term holding, it might suggest a more cautious approach. This event underscores the growing adoption of stablecoins for large-scale financial operations within the digital economy. It also highlights the transparency of blockchain, where even anonymous movements are recorded for all to see, allowing services like Whale Alert to track and report them. The sheer volume of this transaction is a testament to the increasing maturity and scale of the institutional crypto market. What’s Next After This Mammoth USDC Transfer? While the exact purpose of this USDC transfer remains speculative, its occurrence reinforces several key aspects of the current crypto landscape. We are witnessing a continuous flow of institutional capital into the digital asset space. Investors and market watchers will be keenly observing subsequent movements from this ‘unknown wallet’ to discern any patterns or further actions. Such large transfers often precede other significant market activities, making them important indicators for market sentiment and potential trends. In conclusion, the nearly $500 million USDC transfer from Coinbase Institutional to an unknown wallet is a powerful reminder of the substantial financial activity taking place in the institutional crypto world. It highlights the critical role stablecoins play in facilitating large-scale transactions and underscores the ongoing evolution of digital finance. While the immediate impact is a subject of discussion, the event undoubtedly signifies robust and dynamic capital movements within the blockchain ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is USDC? USDC (USD Coin) is a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, meaning its value is intended to remain stable at $1.00. It is backed by fully reserved assets, ensuring its stability and reliability for transactions. Q2: What is Coinbase Institutional? Coinbase Institutional is a suite of services provided by Coinbase, designed for large institutional clients like hedge funds, asset managers, and corporations. It offers advanced trading tools, custody solutions, and prime brokerage services for digital assets. Q3: Why are large USDC transfers significant? Large USDC transfers are significant because they often indicate major institutional activity, such as large-scale investments, portfolio rebalancing, over-the-counter (OTC) trades, or treasury management decisions. They can provide insights into market sentiment and potential future movements. Q4: Does an ‘unknown wallet’ imply illegal activity? Not necessarily. While the identity of the wallet owner is not publicly disclosed, many legitimate large-scale transactions occur between anonymous or pseudonymous wallets. It could be an OTC desk, a cold storage wallet, or an institutional investor moving funds. Q5: How can I track such large crypto transactions? Services like Whale Alert specialize in tracking and reporting significant cryptocurrency transactions across various blockchains. They provide real-time updates on large movements, offering transparency into the crypto market. If you found this analysis insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

Arbitrum and PEPE remain in focus, while MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a legitimate project pushing a safety-first approach in a space often clouded by scams. Arbitrum (ARB): Ethereum’s Scaling Powerhouse Arbitrum is one of Ethereum’s most relied-upon Layer-2 solutions, priced at around $0.54. It uses optimistic rollups to process faster and cheaper transactions while still benefiting from Ethereum’s core security. This has made it one of the busiest L2 networks, handling more daily volume than Ethereum mainnet itself. Adoption continues to accelerate, with institutions like BlackRock’s BUIDL network and Franklin Templeton’s OnChain fund integrated into its ecosystem. In terms of activity, Arbitrum has seen nearly 12 million weekly transactions and over half a million new weekly users during peak months. With this level of usage, it’s not surprising that many view ARB as one of the best crypto to buy under $1. ARB also carries weight in governance. As the token of the Arbitrum DAO, it allows holders to participate in shaping upgrades and fund allocations. While risks like large unlock events exist, retail sentiment on platforms like Reddit suggests traders see it as a strategic play on Ethereum’s future. PEPE: Meme Hype Keeps It Alive PEPE coin continues to live up to its reputation as a high-risk, high-reward altcoin. The meme-driven token has seen extraordinary levels of speculative activity, with $87 million worth of PEPE trading hands in just a single day. On-chain data shows that over 96% of holders were in profit after a monthly jump of nearly 90%, sparking renewed retail buzz. Exchange support also plays a role—Binance added PEPE to its Super Stake program, which immediately lifted its price by about 7%. Forecasts for PEPE vary wildly. Some analysts suggest moderate gains toward $0.0000198, while others envision much larger moves fueled by speculative rallies. What’s clear is that, despite the volatility, PEPE remains one of the top altcoins under $1 that traders keep a close eye on. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Safety-First Ethereum Altcoin While hype coins dominate headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE differentiates itself by putting security at the forefront. Built on Ethereum, it comes fully audited (HashEx completed, CertiK ongoing) and operates with anti-phishing protocols. Scam protection is a core message, and its verified compatibility with wallets like MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet adds legitimacy in a market where trust is often lacking. Thousands have already joined the project, making it more than just another meme-driven token. To encourage early participation, MAGACOIN is currently offering a 50% EXTRA bonus with the coupon code PATRIOT50X . For those scanning the best crypto to buy under $1, its safety-first approach paired with a clear growth push sets it apart from speculative meme coins. Analyst Rankings Put MAGACOIN FINANCE Among the Best Cryptos to Buy in 2025 Recognized as one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025 , MAGACOIN FINANCE combines smart contract security with operational transparency. The presale has been thoroughly audited by Hashex , confirming its safety for early participants. With open tokenomics, a public-facing team, and rising investor confidence, MAGACOIN FINANCE checks all the boxes for long-term potential. Conclusion: How to Position in This Market Arbitrum and PEPE continue to offer traders exposure to scaling tech and meme hype under the $1 mark. Yet, MAGACOIN FINANCE brings something the space often lacks—an audited, scam-protected framework.

50842251,568122,1756429258,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50842251.jpeg,Philippines Explores Blockchain-Based Budgeting System Amid Transparency Push,https://bitcoinist.com/philippine-bill-place-national-budget-on-blockchain/,"Efforts to integrate blockchain technology into government operations may soon advance in the Philippines. Senator Bam Aquino announced plans to introduce a bill that would place the country’s national budget on a blockchain platform, aiming to enhance transparency and accountability in public spending. Speaking at the Manila Tech Summit on Wednesday, Aquino explained that the proposed measure seeks to log all government budget transactions on-chain , where they would be viewable by citizens. “No one is crazy enough to put their transactions on blockchain, where every single step of the way will be logged and transparent to every single citizen. But we want to start,” Aquino said at the event, according to local media. In a separate Facebook post , the senator highlighted his interest in using blockchain-based budgeting to ensure that “every peso” in government spending is accounted for. Aquino noted that if successful, the Philippines could become the first country to implement such a system at a national scale, though he acknowledged uncertainty about the level of support the proposal will receive. Blockchain in Philippine Public Sector Initiatives The senator’s remarks follow a recent blockchain-related rollout by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM). Last month, the DBM launched a document validation system on Polygon, which Undersecretary Maria Francesca Del Rosario said was designed to help counter the rise of AI deepfakes and prevent the falsification of official documents. While it remains unclear whether Aquino’s proposed budget system would be tied directly to this initiative, both efforts suggest a growing interest in applying distributed ledger technology to strengthen public governance. Globally, governments are experimenting with blockchain to improve transparency, reduce fraud, and streamline processes. For example, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick recently announced plans to begin publishing official economic statistics, including gross domestic product (GDP) figures, on a blockchain. Similar initiatives are being tested in countries such as Estonia and South Korea, where blockchain has been used for digital identity systems and voting trials. If implemented in the Philippines, a blockchain-based budget system could introduce new standards of traceability in fiscal management. Each allocation and expenditure could be immutably recorded, enabling oversight bodies, auditors, and the general public to verify the flow of government funds in near real time. Opportunities and Challenges Ahead While the potential benefits of blockchain integration in government budgeting are evident, significant challenges remain. Implementing such a system would require strong technical infrastructure, comprehensive legal frameworks, and widespread political backing. Questions also remain about how sensitive budgetary data would be managed, and whether a fully public ledger or a permissioned blockchain would be more suitable. Senator Aquino emphasized that the ultimate goal is to build a more accountable public finance system through technological innovation . However, he admitted uncertainty about whether Congress and other stakeholders would support the initiative. “If we’re able to do this, I think we’ll be the first country to have our budget on the blockchain. Of course, I don’t know what kind of support I will get,” he said.

Both meme coins are drawing heightened interest from retail traders, while analysts expect broader market repricing to amplify their volatility. Dogecoin is leaning on its status as the original meme coin, while Shiba Inu continues to build out new utilities and community-driven governance. Yet as these two battle for dominance, analysts note that some early investors are already scouting new opportunities. MAGACOIN FINANCE , which has attracted strong presale inflows and is is widely recognized for being legitimate and audited, is being discussed as a third force that could challenge the established meme coin order in the next cycle. Doge and Shib’s Investor Sentiment Dogecoin is currently trading around $0.213 as of August 2025. Forecasts for October point to a range between $0.239 and $0.274, with an average projection near $0.261. Bullish scenarios, fueled by celebrity endorsements and waves of retail enthusiasm, suggest possible moves to $0.80 or even $2 by the end of the year. Backed by Elon Musk’s public support and a long history of liquidity, DOGE retains an edge as the sector’s legacy asset. Shiba Inu, meanwhile, trades near $0.0000146. Analysts expect October levels to sit between $0.00004899 and $0.00005999, a potential leap tied to ongoing upgrades and DAO-led community development. SHIB’s strength lies in its innovation pipeline and grassroots engagement, though short-term momentum depends heavily on holding key support zones and sustaining trading activity. For SHIB holders, October is shaping up as a critical test of both technical resilience and market confidence. Meme Coin Market Dynamics The meme coin market overall is expanding, with retail traders and viral campaigns driving rapid cycles of price action. Regions such as North America and Asia-Pacific are proving pivotal, where tech-savvy populations and strong cultural momentum fuel adoption. Market watchers also highlight how integrations, celebrity visibility, and regulatory developments could sharply influence meme coin trajectories through Q4 2025. Dogecoin benefits most from cultural recognition and external endorsements, while Shiba Inu’s bet on added utility continues to attract a loyal base. However, the sector remains highly speculative, where momentum can shift overnight based on online trends or macro headlines. Analysts caution that volatility will remain elevated as October’s repricing nears. A Shifting Investor Outlook to This Crypto Presale While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are locked in a tight battle, presale momentum elsewhere is drawing early capital flows. Traders seeking exposure to the next breakout are increasingly turning toward MAGACOIN FINANCE, citing its strong community traction and exchange-ready positioning. Market analysts argue that the meme coin’s surge of presale demand signals a potential to separate itself from legacy meme plays during the next cycle. This shift in sentiment highlights how meme coin investors often hedge by diversifying across both established names and high-upside entrants. For many, Dogecoin provides short-term liquidity and visibility, Shiba Inu offers longer-term innovation potential, and MAGACOIN FINANCE presents a fresh opportunity that could capture the kind of exponential upside seen in earlier meme coin waves. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is a Trusted Crypto to Buy for 2025 Growth Investors searching for a trusted early-stage project have found a strong contender in MAGACOIN FINANCE, widely ranked among the best cryptos to buy in 2025. Its smart contract passed auditing standards, and the public team has completed full KYC verification. Combined with growing community traction, these strengths make it a top-tier choice for those prioritizing safety and growth. Strategic Outlook Dogecoin appears positioned for stronger near-term moves, particularly if celebrity-driven speculation intensifies into year-end. Shiba Inu is leaning on its innovation roadmap and community strength, which could sustain it if utility upgrades deliver as promised. But analysts stress that crypto presale challengers like MAGACOIN FINANCE should not be overlooked, given the speed with which capital rotates in the meme sector. Ultimately, October 2025’s repricing will be determined by broader market sentiment, the flow of retail money, and unexpected events ranging from policy developments to high-profile endorsements. For investors navigating the meme coin arena, active monitoring and careful positioning in MAGACOIN remain essential.

Analysts now forecast Bitcoin reaching six-figure prices by 2026, with whales showing renewed interest, sparking discussions on where traders should position next. Analysts’ Conservative to Mid-Range Bitcoin Predictions Forecasts for Bitcoin in 2026 cover a wide spectrum. CoinMarketCap places the average near $120,000, with highs around $150,000. Analysts note the 2024 halving event, regulatory clarity, and institutional adoption as key drivers. InvestingHaven adds a wider band, projecting between $99,910 and $200,000, suggesting that gradual adoption trends could support the higher end of that scale. SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci sees a path to $170,000 by mid-2026, citing inflation factors and supportive U.S. policies. Likewise, investor sentiment tracked by MarketWatch options data indicates an expectation around $174,000. Together, these more measured forecasts create a consensus view of Bitcoin stabilizing well above its historical highs by 2026. More Bullish Bitcoin Forecasts for 2026 Some platforms publish even more ambitious estimates. Changelly projects Bitcoin averaging $202,000 in December 2026, with a maximum near $239,000. DigitalCoinPrice is more optimistic, targeting $261,000 to $282,000 averages, with highs around $308,000. MicroStrategy-linked analysts expect BTC to climb toward $225,000 by year-end 2026, reinforcing the role of corporate treasuries in adoption. Meanwhile, algorithm-driven platforms like PricePredictions.com go further, modeling mid-year levels of $500,000 and year-end targets of $562,000. While such extremes are speculative, they highlight the scale of enthusiasm for Bitcoin’s multi-year trajectory. Strategic Investment with MAGACOIN FINANCE: Best Altcoin to Buy Alongside Bitcoin forecasts, many traders are comparing altcoins for strategic positioning. MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining attention for offering a “FOMO-proof” path, where its price ticks up hourly during active sales phases. Built for secure entry and a transparent structure, it has quickly become a top altcoin to watch. As Bitcoin pushes toward six-figure levels, history shows that altcoins often ride the wave, delivering sharper percentage gains. This places MAGACOIN FINANCE in a prime spot to benefit from renewed liquidity flowing into the market. For traders looking beyond Bitcoin alone, MAGA combines meme appeal with utility, making it one of the best crypto plays to consider while the broader market gears up for the next cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Verified Altcoin With Long-Term Upside As one of the best altcoins to buy this year, MAGACOIN FINANCE earns its place through verified credibility. Unlike speculative launches, this project is backed by a Hashex audit and led by a KYC-compliant team, creating a solid foundation for long-term success.

Meanwhile, factory output slipped in July, and retail sales rose far less than anticipated, highlighting the fragility of Japan’s economic recovery as pressure from U.S. tariffs mounted. Analysts say lingering inflationary pressures, coupled with mounting growth risks, underscore the challenge facing the Bank of Japan (BOJ) in deciding when to move on its next rate hike. “Core consumer inflation is likely to slow as a trend as the yen’s rise and moderating increases in import costs weigh on prices,” said Masato Koike, senior economist at Sompo Institute Plus. He noted that while lowered under Japan’s trade deal with Washington, U.S. tariff rates remain high compared with last year’s levels and thus will keep hurting output for a while. Utility subsidies slow Tokyo inflation, but core prices stay elevated Tokyo’s core consumer price index (CPI) increased by 2.5% in August YoY. This figure excludes volatile fresh food but includes fuel costs, government data showed, matching a median market forecast. The CPI was sluggish after a 2.9% rise in July, mostly due to government fuel subsidies that reduced utility bills. An index excluding both volatile fresh food and energy costs—closely monitored by the BOJ as a key measure of underlying inflation—climbed 3.0% in August from a year earlier, following a 3.1% increase in July. Food inflation, excluding fresh produce such as vegetables, held at 7.4% in August, unchanged from the previous month, underscoring persistent pressure from higher prices of staples like rice, coffee beans, and other groceries. Overall, goods prices climbed 3.2% year-on-year, while service costs rose 2.0%, reflecting continued pass-through of rising labor expenses, government data showed. Factory output drops as U.S. tariffs weigh on Japan’s recovery The Bank of Japan (BOJ) ended its decade-long ultra-loose stimulus last year. It lifted short-term interest rates to 0.5% in January, signaling confidence that the economy was nearing a durable achievement of its 2% inflation target. Still, while inflation has remained above 2% for more than three years, BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda has emphasized a cautious approach to further tightening, warning of downside risks to growth from the impact of U.S. tariffs . Highlighting these concerns, government data on Friday showed Japan’s factory output fell 1.6% in July from the previous month, a sharper decline than the market’s median forecast for a 1.0% drop, driven by weakness in the automobile and machinery sectors. The manufacturers that the government surveyed expect production to increase by 2.8% in August and fall by 0.3% in September, the data showed. Other data brought more bad news, with retail sales barely gaining 0.3% in July, much lower than market forecasts for a 1.8% rise, indicating that the increasing cost of living was undermining consumption. With a tightening labor market, pressure on wages is increasing. Government data showed on Friday that the jobless rate eased to 2.3% from 2.5% in June, the lowest level since December 2019. Some 65% of economists questioned by Reuters in August forecast the BOJ will lift its key rate by another 25 basis points or more later this year compared with just over half a month ago.

If so, you’ve likely noticed some truly fascinating trends, especially concerning Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. A significant development has emerged: ETH accumulation addresses have reached an astonishing all-time high! This isn’t just a fleeting statistic; it signals a powerful and growing surge in long-term investor confidence in Ethereum’s future. What’s Driving This Unprecedented ETH Accumulation Phenomenon? When we talk about ETH accumulation addresses, we’re referring to specific wallets that acquire and hold Ethereum for the long term, with a clear intent to avoid frequent selling. These addresses serve as a crucial barometer for long-term market sentiment and investor conviction. According to Burak Kesmeci, a respected contributor at CryptoQuant, this particular metric is a key indicator of robust investor confidence in the market’s enduring potential. The growth in these holdings has been nothing short of dramatic. Consider the data: just last May, before the widespread anticipation of spot ETF approvals , these accumulation addresses held approximately 8.9 million ETH. Fast forward to this August, and that figure has skyrocketed to an astonishing 24.3 million ETH. That represents a threefold increase in just over a year, clearly showcasing a profound shift in how savvy investors are approaching their Ethereum holdings. Is Institutional Demand Fueling the ETH Accumulation Race? Indeed, the recent surge in ETH accumulation isn’t happening in isolation. Kesmeci’s insightful analysis strongly suggests a direct connection to institutional funds. He posits that the increasing interest in Ethereum spot ETFs is likely prompting these large entities to purchase substantial amounts of spot ETH and then strategically move them into secure, long-term storage solutions. This behavior isn’t about short-term gains; it underscores a calculated, strategic approach to Ethereum as a foundational asset. The pace of this accumulation has accelerated dramatically since June, indicating a growing urgency among buyers. Daily inflows, which previously amounted to a few thousand ETH, now frequently reach hundreds of thousands. There have even been multiple instances where over 500,000 ETH flowed into these dedicated accumulation addresses in a single 24-hour period. Kesmeci aptly describes this as the “beginning of an accumulation race,” primarily driven by substantial and sustained institutional demand. This intense activity highlights a deep and growing conviction in Ethereum’s long-term value proposition. Understanding the Significance of the Average $2.5K ETH Accumulation Price It’s also incredibly insightful to consider the average purchase price for these accumulating addresses, which stands at approximately $2,500. This particular detail is significant because it places a substantial portion of these long-term holders, both large institutions and individual investors, in a very comfortable profit position. What does this mean for the market? Historically, investors who are already “in the green” tend to act as a powerful support system for upward price movements. They are far less likely to panic-sell during minor market corrections or dips. Instead, they typically choose to hold onto their valuable assets, thereby reinforcing market stability and contributing to positive momentum. This average buy-in price, combined with the strong commitment to hold, paints a robust picture for Ethereum’s price stability and potential for future appreciation. Key Takeaways from the ETH Accumulation Trend Let’s break down the core insights from this exciting development: Strong Confidence: The record high in ETH accumulation addresses unequivocally signals robust long-term investor confidence in Ethereum’s future potential and its role in the evolving digital economy. Institutional Backing: Institutional funds, likely influenced by the anticipation and eventual approval of spot ETF products, are a major driving force behind this accelerated accumulation. This indicates a maturing market. Market Stability: Long-term holders, many of whom are already in profit from an average buy-in price of $2,500, are historically known to support upward price trends by steadfastly maintaining their positions. This creates a solid floor. Strategic Holding: This isn’t merely speculative trading. Instead, it represents a deliberate and strategic approach to acquire and hold Ethereum for sustained, long-term growth, recognizing its fundamental value. Positive Momentum: The sheer volume and consistency of inflows suggest a strong, underlying bullish sentiment that could continue to propel Ethereum forward. In conclusion, the remarkable surge in ETH accumulation addresses to an all-time high is far more than just a number; it’s a powerful narrative of growing confidence and strategic investment in Ethereum. With institutional players increasingly moving substantial amounts of ETH into long-term storage and existing holders sitting on comfortable profits, the foundation for sustained growth appears remarkably strong. This trend paints a compelling and optimistic picture for Ethereum’s future trajectory, suggesting a maturing market where deep conviction is translating into significant and enduring long-term holdings. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are ETH accumulation addresses? A1: ETH accumulation addresses are cryptocurrency wallets specifically identified as holding Ethereum for the long term, typically without significant outgoing transactions, indicating a strategy of buying and holding rather than frequent trading. Q2: Why is the increase in ETH accumulation significant for the market? A2: An increase in ETH accumulation signifies strong long-term investor confidence. It suggests that more investors believe in Ethereum’s future value and are committing to holding the asset, which can contribute to market stability and upward price momentum. Q3: Are institutional investors playing a role in this ETH accumulation trend? A3: Yes, according to CryptoQuant’s analysis, institutional funds, possibly influenced by the anticipation of spot Ethereum ETF approvals, are a major driving force behind the accelerated pace of ETH accumulation, moving large volumes into long-term storage. Q4: What is the average purchase price for these accumulated ETH holdings? A4: The average purchase price for ETH in these accumulation addresses is approximately $2,500. This places many long-term holders in a profitable position, making them less likely to sell during market fluctuations and more inclined to support upward trends. Q5: How does long-term holding typically affect Ethereum’s price? A5: Long-term holding by a significant number of investors can create a strong support floor for Ethereum’s price. It reduces selling pressure and demonstrates conviction, which often encourages further investment and contributes to sustained price appreciation over time.

Current figures show 9.69 million active wallets, with an impressive 5,000-6,000 new addresses joining daily. Related Reading: XRP’s Biggest Doubter Just Dropped Close To $5 Price Bomb — Here’s Why This growth reflects more than retail speculation as it signals meaningful enterprise adoption in payments, tokenized deposits, and cross-border transactions. Unlike different hyped assets, Stellar has quietly built its reputation as a trusted blockchain solution. The network’s focus on compliance and financial-grade use cases is drawing banks, fintech firms, and remittance providers. With over $150 million in total value locked and consistent wallet creation, Stellar is showing signs of steady, sustainable growth that could lay the groundwork for a major price rally. Why Institutions Are Going Big on Stellar Institutional money is playing a key role in Stellar’s momentum. From partnerships with MoneyGram and Circle to recent pilots with central banks and fintechs like VersaBank, XLM is becoming a practical tool for global finance. VersaBank, for example, has begun testing tokenized deposits (USDVB) on Stellar alongside Ethereum and Algorand, mirroring confidence in Stellar’s scalability and compliance. This steady inflow of enterprise adoption is critical. Unlike retail-driven spikes, institutional backing provides consistent liquidity and long-term confidence. Analysts suggest that the growth of network growth and enterprise demand could act as the spark for XLM’s next breakout, especially if it pushes past psychological resistance at $0.50. XLM Price Forecast: $0.48 to $0.57 in Sight Currently Stellar trades around $0.38, hovering near its key support levels. Technical indicators suggest the cryptocurrency is preparing for a bullish reversal. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits in neutral territory, while narrowing MACD patterns hint at fading bearish momentum. XLM's price moving sideways on the daily chart. Source: XLMUSD on Tradingview Analysts project short-term targets between $0.42 and $0.44, with a medium-term breakout toward $0.48–$0.57 by late September. If XLM clears resistance at $0.50, institutional demand could push the price higher, with some models pointing to the $0.60–$0.77 range as the next major battleground. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Price Is Set To Hit $4 If It Breaks This Resistance Line However, failure to hold above $0.37 could expose Stellar to a deeper pullback toward $0.29. For now, the bullish case outweighs the bearish scenario, and with Stellar nearing 10 million accounts, many traders see this as a defining moment for XLM’s long-term trajectory.

A staggering 92 cryptocurrency Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) applications are currently sitting before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), awaiting their crucial review. This massive wave of filings highlights a growing interest in bringing digital assets to traditional investment vehicles. The prospect of Crypto ETF Approval could unlock significant mainstream adoption and reshape the investment landscape. The Race for Crypto ETF Approval: Which Assets Lead the Pack? Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart recently shed light on this exciting development. His data reveals a diverse range of digital assets vying for a spot on the traditional market. It’s a clear indication that institutions and issuers see immense potential in these innovative financial products. Solana (SOL): Leading the charge with an impressive 16 filings, Solana shows strong institutional interest. Its high transaction speed and low fees make it an attractive candidate for various financial products. XRP: Following closely, XRP has 15 applications. This reflects ongoing efforts to integrate XRP into the broader financial system, despite past regulatory uncertainties. Mixed-Asset Funds: Nine applications focus on diversified crypto portfolios, offering investors exposure to multiple digital assets through a single product. Ethereum (ETH): With six filings, Ethereum continues to be a top contender, building on its strong ecosystem and recent upgrades. Bitcoin (BTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Litecoin (LTC): Each of these well-known cryptocurrencies has four pending applications. Their established market presence makes them perennial favorites for such investment vehicles. Why Does Crypto ETF Approval Matter So Much? The potential for Crypto ETF Approval is a game-changer for several reasons. ETFs offer a regulated and accessible way for traditional investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without directly holding the underlying assets. This ease of access can significantly broaden the investor base. Moreover, these products could attract substantial institutional capital. Large investment firms and pension funds, which often face restrictions on direct crypto investments, find ETFs a compliant and appealing alternative. Therefore, a green light from the SEC could signal a new era of legitimacy and growth for the entire digital asset market. Navigating the SEC’s Stance on Crypto ETF Approval The SEC has historically maintained a cautious stance on cryptocurrency products, primarily citing concerns about investor protection and market manipulation. However, the landscape is evolving. The recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs set a significant precedent, demonstrating a shift in regulatory comfort. Each new application for Crypto ETF Approval undergoes rigorous scrutiny. The SEC evaluates factors such as market surveillance capabilities, the underlying asset’s liquidity, and the potential for fraud. Issuers must demonstrate robust safeguards to meet these stringent requirements. This careful approach aims to protect investors while fostering innovation in the financial sector. What’s Next for Digital Asset ETFs and the SEC? The sheer volume of 92 pending applications underscores the industry’s persistence and belief in the future of crypto ETFs. While there is no guaranteed timeline, the increasing number of filings, particularly for assets like Solana and XRP, suggests a growing momentum. Observers are keenly watching for any signals or decisions from the SEC. The potential approval of these diverse Crypto ETF Approval applications could lead to greater market stability and wider acceptance of digital assets. Investors and enthusiasts alike should stay informed about these developments, as they will undoubtedly shape the future of cryptocurrency investing. In conclusion, the ongoing review of 92 cryptocurrency ETF applications by the SEC marks a pivotal moment for the digital asset space. With Solana and XRP leading the pack, the industry is eagerly anticipating decisions that could usher in a new era of mainstream adoption and institutional engagement. The path to Crypto ETF Approval is complex, but the potential rewards are monumental for investors and the crypto ecosystem as a whole. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a Crypto ETF?

MAGACOIN FINANCE Attracts PEPE, BTC and ETH Whales",https://timestabloid.com/best-crypto-presale-for-100x-roi-magacoin-finance-attracts/,"The crypto market in 2025 is seeing a new pattern of whale accumulation that analysts say could mark the next leg up. Crypto whales are busy with the profits and new ETFs. Ethereum whales are rotating to other opportunities after pushing ETH to multiyear highs. Even PEPE whales are moving money towards bigger upside plays. These movements above indicate that smart money is preparing for another wave of presale-driven returns, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly mentioned in this conversation. Bitcoin: ETF Demand Meets Profit-Taking Bitcoin leads the market again at $110,000–$111,000 near the recent high of $123,000 earlier this year. Whales and miners took profits while inflows into BlackRock and Fidelity ETFs show institutional demand remains strong. If momentum resumes, analysts say then $150,000 is possible. Bitcoin has grown to such an extent that its market size has provided a sustainability aspect to the growth curve. Thus, investors with a 100x upside potential are rotating towards smaller projects that have room for exponential growth. Ethereum: Network Strength but Limited Multiples Previously, Ethereum skyrocketed over $4,800 before a rebound over $4,400. With an increase in on-chain transactions of 63% in the last 30 day and treasury firms including Bitmine added tens of millions in ETHs the fundamentals of ETH are simply unmatched. Yet, whales are also signaling diversification. In only two days, more than 200,000 ETH left exchanges, some of which went to presales. Analysts consider Ethereum to be the leading smart contract platform. However, it is no longer a 100x play as it was for early investors. PEPE: Meme Coin Whales Look for Rotation Investors with large amounts of PEPE have begun to cash out following a big price movement. Despite the heightened trading volumes, it has been noted that large holders have started rotating their capital into presales that offer better perception of safety and stronger fundamentals. According to analysts, the trend indicates that even meme coin investors are becoming increasingly aware that investing in presales early can yield outsized gains compared to riding well-established narratives. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Analysts Say This May Be the Moment Bitcoin, Ethereum, and PEPE whales may be signalling a major rotation that analysts believe is the time for MAGACOIN FINANCE. Analysts are forecasting 100x upside potential for this presale crypto, and it has been dubbed the best crypto to buy for 2025 . Furthermore, the project has also been audited twice by HashEx and CertiK. This means its smart contract is rated as safe, secure, and fully decentralised, making it one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025. Analysts highlight that whale-backed inflows are growing, retail demand is accelerating, and the project is already being mentioned in smart money reports as a standout opportunity. With supply tightening, many believe this is one of the rare presales that could replicate Ethereum-style early returns in the coming cycle. One of the Best Crypto Presales of 2025 According to Analyst Reports MAGACOIN FINANCE is often featured in analyst watchlists as one of the top crypto presales for 2025, and for good reason. The team’s commitment to full transparency — including public audits and KYC verification — builds unmatched trust. These fundamentals give investors peace of mind and separate the project from unverified alternatives in the market. Conclusion The market is still mainly centered around Bitcoin and Ethereum, but PEPE shows just how quickly meme coin capital can be shifted around. But what really matters to investors looking for returns of over 1000% is where the whales go next. With whale accumulation on the rise, dual audits ensuring safety, and 100x upside predicted, MAGACOIN FINANCE has been earmarked as one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025 — and analysts warn that time is running out before early allocations close.

50842631,568336,1756432850,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50842631.jpeg,$40M Bitcoin Treasury Launch Marks South Korea’s First Institutional Crypto Move,https://bitcoinist.com/40m-bitcoin-treasury-marks-south-koreas-first/,"South Korea has officially entered the institutional Bitcoin race with Bitplanet, a rebranded firm formerly known as SGA, unveiling a $40 million BTC treasury. This historic move aligns Bitplanet as the first company in the country to integrate Bitcoin into its corporate reserves, marking a major shift in financial strategy and signaling growing institutional adoption of digital assets. The transition to Bitplanet followed a corporate restructuring led by Asia Strategy Partners, now the firm’s largest shareholder. The rebranding reflects a bold pivot toward blockchain-driven financial planning, aligning with global trends where corporations increasingly treat Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. South Korea’s First $40M Bitcoin Treasury By committing $40 million to Bitcoin , Bitplanet has become the first institutional-grade treasury in South Korea to embrace digital assets at scale. The move goes beyond simple diversification; it represents confidence in Bitcoin as a hedge against traditional market risks. Backed by Asia Strategy Partners, the initiative bridges conventional finance with the digital economy. Analysts suggest this could inspire other South Korean corporations to follow suit, reshaping treasury management practices in the region. If successful, Bitplanet’s model may serve as a blueprint for future institutional crypto adoption across Asia. Challenges and Opportunities Ahead Despite its unique move, Bitplanet faces hurdles. South Korea’s regulatory stance on cryptos remains cautious, requiring firms to deal with evolving compliance rules. Added to this are Bitcoin’s price volatility and heightened investor scrutiny, which could test Bitplanet’s long-term strategy. Still, the significance of this launch cannot be overstated. As Asian firms like Japan’s Metaplanet and Korea’s own K Wave Media increase Bitcoin holdings, Bitplanet’s entry solidifies South Korea’s place in the global race toward institutional Bitcoin adoption. The outcome of its $40 million bet will be closely monitored by investors, regulators, and competitors alike. Bitplanet’s $40 million Bitcoin treasury marks a turning point in South Korea’s financial history. With strong backing and a bold strategy, the firm positions Bitcoin as more than speculation, emerging as a preferred digital asset in Asia.

In a significant development, Bloomberg reports that Coinbase is rapidly emerging as a dominant force in Coinbase crypto lending to the demanding crypto mining industry. This transformation marks a pivotal moment, especially after the dramatic collapses of previous industry giants like Celsius and BlockFi left a substantial void. The Rise of Coinbase Crypto Lending in a Shifting Landscape Coinbase, traditionally known for its robust exchange and secure custody services, is now expanding its financial infrastructure to become a crucial lifeline for mining companies. This strategic move positions the company beyond its core offerings, demonstrating its adaptability and ambition within the broader crypto ecosystem. Indeed, the need for stable financial partners has never been more critical for miners. Several prominent mining firms are already leveraging this new opportunity: CleanSpark (CLSK) : Expanding its credit lines, indicating strong confidence. Riot Platforms (RIOT) : Bolstering its financial capacity for growth. Hut 8 (HUT) : Strengthening its operational funding with reliable support. These expansions highlight the trust and reliance the industry is placing on Coinbase’s new lending capabilities. Therefore, Coinbase is not just filling a gap; it’s redefining the landscape of financial support for crypto miners. Why Mining Firms Need Robust Coinbase Crypto Lending Solutions Crypto mining is an incredibly capital-intensive endeavor. Brian Dobson, a managing director at Clear Street, a New York-based fintech firm, aptly explains the immense financial demands. Mining companies require substantial capital for various critical aspects: High-cost equipment : Advanced ASIC miners are expensive, requiring significant upfront investment. Power needs : Operating these machines consumes vast amounts of electricity, leading to considerable ongoing costs. Transition to AI infrastructure : As the industry evolves, miners are increasingly looking to diversify into AI, which also demands substantial capital outlay. Consequently, having a reliable and well-capitalized lender like Coinbase is paramount for these companies to not only sustain their operations but also to innovate and expand. The availability of consistent Coinbase crypto lending allows these firms to plan for long-term growth and stability, rather than facing uncertainty. Navigating the Future: Regulatory Tailwinds and Coinbase Crypto Lending The timing of Coinbase’s expansion into lending is particularly noteworthy. Brian Dobson also pointed out that Coinbase’s acceleration in building out its financial infrastructure is partly fueled by a more favorable regulatory environment. Specifically, the potential for a pro-cryptocurrency stance under a future Trump administration is creating optimistic conditions for growth and innovation within the sector. This supportive regulatory outlook could provide several benefits: Increased clarity : Clearer rules reduce uncertainty for lenders and borrowers alike. Reduced risk : A more predictable environment can lower the perceived risk associated with crypto-related financial services. Enhanced growth : Easier access to capital can spur further investment and expansion across the crypto mining industry. Therefore, as the regulatory landscape potentially becomes more accommodating, the role of Coinbase crypto lending is set to become even more central to the industry’s continued development and success. A New Era of Financial Stability for Crypto Mining Coinbase’s emergence as a premier lender to the crypto mining industry represents a significant evolution. By stepping into the void left by former lenders, Coinbase is not merely offering loans; it is actively shaping the future stability and growth of a crucial sector within the digital asset economy. This strategic pivot solidifies its position as a multifaceted financial powerhouse, ready to support the next wave of innovation in cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What prompted Coinbase to enter crypto lending for miners? A1: Coinbase stepped into this role following the collapse of previous major crypto lenders like Celsius and BlockFi, which left a significant gap in financial services for mining companies. Q2: Which major mining companies are utilizing Coinbase’s lending services? A2: Prominent firms such as CleanSpark (CLSK), Riot Platforms (RIOT), and Hut 8 (HUT) are expanding their credit lines with Coinbase. Q3: What are the primary capital needs of crypto mining companies? A3: Mining companies require substantial capital for high-cost equipment, significant power needs, and the ongoing transition toward advanced AI infrastructure. Q4: How does the regulatory environment impact Coinbase’s lending expansion? A4: A pro-cryptocurrency regulatory environment, such as the one potentially fostered by a future Trump administration, is accelerating Coinbase’s expansion by creating more favorable and predictable conditions for crypto-related financial services. Q5: What makes Coinbase a reliable lender compared to previous firms? A5: Coinbase’s established reputation as a leading exchange and custody provider, coupled with its strategic expansion into robust financial infrastructure, positions it as a more stable and trustworthy lending partner for the industry.

At the same time, altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE are gaining traction for diversification, offering a fresh option for traders seeking ROI beyond Layer 1 giants. Avalanche’s Institutional Push and Real-World Integration Avalanche has been securing notable wins in institutional adoption. AVAX recently became the second-largest holding in BlackRock’s BUIDL Fund, with over $53.8 million tokenized on-chain. Bloomberg analysts estimate a 90% chance that the SEC will approve Grayscale’s Avalanche Trust ETF by December 2025, which would mark a key milestone for mainstream adoption. The ecosystem is also expanding. Avalanche Bridge V2 strengthens cross-chain functionality, while AVAUSD, a native stablecoin, boosts participation in DeFi. Partnerships add further weight — from FIFA integrations to the launch of the Avalanche Card, a Visa-backed payment solution. These developments have led to projections of AVAX trading between $25.13 and $50.80 by mid-2026, underlining its near-term recovery path. Cardano’s Governance and Institutional Momentum Cardano is prioritizing governance upgrades and network transparency. The Chang hard fork, expected by December 2024, introduces community-driven decision-making, enabling ADA holders to vote on core protocol changes. The Ouroboros Leios consensus model further enhances scalability, aiming to attract developers and strengthen its DeFi footprint. Institutional adoption is also part of the story. Grayscale has allocated 18.5% of its Smart Contract Fund to ADA, while discussions around a Cardano ETF could open the door to mainstream investors. Partnerships are equally diverse, ranging from NASA to the UNDP and FC Barcelona, signaling wider applicability in governance and supply chain sectors. Analysts expect ADA to target $25.89 by 2035, framing it as a longer-term play compared to Avalanche’s nearer-term push. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Diversification and Strategic ROI Play While Avalanche and Cardano work to regain trust, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving out its own lane as a diversification choice. Priced under $0.0005, it sits in a range that allows for easy price movements with minimal capital inflow, benefiting those who join early.

The proposal, submitted through an S-1 registration statement, would use price data from CF Benchmarks, which aggregates information across multiple crypto exchanges. If approved, the fund would mark the first SEI-linked ETF available to U.S. investors. What is SEI? SEI is the native token of the Sei blockchain, a layer-1 network launched in August 2023. The platform focuses on decentralized exchange trading infrastructure and marketplace activity. The token itself can be used to pay transaction fees and participate in governance decisions. As of now, SEI trades around $0.30, placing it in the mid-70s by market capitalization rankings. Custody and Staking Options Under the plan, Coinbase Custody Trust Company would serve as the custodian for SEI held by the ETF. In its filing, 21Shares also raised the possibility of staking SEI to generate extra income for the fund. However, the firm emphasized it is still assessing whether staking could expose investors to legal or tax complications. Competing Applications The move comes just months after Canary Capital filed for its own SEI ETF in April. That proposal would give both institutional and retail investors exposure to staked SEI, with returns boosted by staking rewards. Justin Barlow, executive director of the Sei Development Foundation, welcomed the idea of ETFs tied to the project. He said they act as “a gateway for broader adoption, providing a vital bridge between crypto and mainstream markets.” Broader ETF Landscape Currently, the only spot crypto ETFs approved in the U.S. track Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, there is a growing wave of applications for products tied to other blockchains. 21Shares itself already operates the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF and has applied for funds covering assets such as SUI, XRP, and Ondo Finance. Other major issuers including VanEck, Grayscale, and Bitwise are pursuing ETFs linked to Solana, Cardano, and even memecoins like Dogecoin. Regulatory Developments In an effort to streamline the process, the SEC is reportedly considering a system that would automatically approve certain ETFs after 75 days unless the agency raises formal objections. This would reduce the lengthy back-and-forth that has often slowed crypto ETF approvals in the past. 21Shares, for its part, described its SEI filing as a “key milestone in our vision to expand exchange-traded access to the SEI Network.” Outlook With two filings now on the table, the race is on to see which firm, if any, will bring the first SEI ETF to U.S. markets. While regulatory hurdles remain, the growing number of applications suggests rising demand for diversified crypto investment products that go beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. For SEI, approval of such a fund could mark a major step in its journey from a newly launched blockchain to a mainstream investment asset.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SEI|MARKET|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-08-29 02:31:51

The episode, hosted by Camilla Araujo and fellow influencer Julia Filippo, combined casual conversation with discussions about investment strategies. During the show, Filippo sought guidance on investing, to which Araujo responded by recommending cryptocurrency. She then revealed that her XRP holdings are valued at approximately $1.3 million. Araujo also expressed optimism regarding XRP’s future price potential. Based on her calculations, she suggested that if the token reaches $10 per unit, her holdings could increase fivefold. Given that XRP was trading near $2 at the time of her disclosure, this implies she owns roughly 500,000 XRP. The announcement quickly spread across social media, sparking conversations among investors and analysts. While some members of the community treated the revelation as a humorous or ironic signal, others interpreted it as an indication of rising mainstream interest in the token. ""I have $1.3 million in XRP."" pic.twitter.com/RXwbh2TCTS — Altcoin Daily (@AltcoinDaily) August 28, 2025 Institutional Interest in XRP The discussion surrounding Araujo’s holdings coincides with an increase in institutional activity in XRP markets. CME Group’s XRP futures contracts recently surpassed $1 billion in open interest within three months, reflecting growing institutional engagement. Additionally, futures-based XRP ETFs have accumulated over $800 million in assets, with daily trading volumes steadily increasing since their launch. Despite this momentum, the absence of major asset managers from the XRP ETF market remains notable. Nate Geraci, President of ETFStore, commented on the podcast that BlackRock has yet to file for an XRP ETF, though it has successfully launched products for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Geraci emphasized that this delay is unusual given the asset’s growing adoption and market capitalization. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Context and Outlook XRP’s recent performance has reinforced interest from both retail and institutional investors. The token’s market capitalization recently reached $185 billion, briefly surpassing BlackRock’s $177.8 billion, and securing a position among the top 100 global assets. Analysts, including crypto commentator Zach Rector, have suggested that BlackRock may eventually pursue an XRP ETF to capitalize on the asset’s rising prominence. While regulatory clarity remains a key factor for institutional participation, market observers note that BlackRock’s absence could limit broader adoption in the short term. The resolution of Ripple’s lawsuit against the SEC has reignited expectations for XRP-focused financial products, highlighting a growing gap between retail enthusiasm and institutional engagement. Camilla Araujo’s public disclosure underscores this trend, demonstrating that interest in XRP extends beyond traditional cryptocurrency circles. As attention from influencers and the broader public grows, the market will continue to monitor both regulatory developments and institutional responses to assess XRP’s long-term potential.

Despite price pullbacks, Solana’s ecosystem continues to see industry-leading adoption. Meanwhile, Dogecoin holds up well in the meme coin space as liquidity and volumes continue to be strong. Analysts, however, reckon the strongest upgrade this quarter goes to MAGACOIN FINANCE , which is viewed as a rare hybrid of safety and explosive upside. Solana: Revenue Leader Despite Market Volatility The current price of Solana is around $188. The price of Solana has dropped by more than 3% in the last 24 hours. Over the last few sessions, the price corrected as the market faced technical rejections. The price of Solana has dropped by around 8-10% during that time. Support has developed at $200, and resistance is $211–$215. Despite this temporary setback, Solana remains one of the strongest ecosystems in the industry. During the last 23 weeks, the network remains ahead in blockchain revenue, generating over $1.3 billion so far this year, beating all L1 and L2 competition in H1 2025. Further institutional adoption is highlighted by Sharps Technology’s $400 million digital asset treasury on Solana. The Solana Foundation confirms that a company is buying Solana for $50 million at a discount, which illustrates growing confidence by public companies. The analysts are concerned about the futures positioning and open positionsin the Solana market, however they remain bullish on fundamentals. If the SOL manages to reclaim the $211 level, the technical upside could lead to it reaching $215 and beyond, owing to its DeFi and institutional backing. Dogecoin: Meme Coin Liquidity and Retail Demand At present, Dogecoin is trading at just above $0.211, which is up just above 0.7%. Amid a market capitalization of $30.8 billion and a daily trading volume of about $2.7 billion, retail is still participating. Meme coin demand is steady. Over the last 48 hours, there haven’t been any major protocol upgrades and partnership announcements for Dogecoin, however, Dogecoin continues thriving as a community and meme-driven asset. Due to its traditional retail following and liquidity, it is often ranked as one of the highest networks by engagement. Traders who are looking for a meme coin to trade have DOGE in mind, which has remained stable during the market consolidation. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Analysts Deliver Major Price Prediction Update As Solana and Dogecoin gather momentum, analysts have made a major upgrade to MAGACOIN FINANCE, deeming it a safer high-upside play. The project has passed all tests and is rated completely safe, secure, and fully transparent following double audits from HashEx and CertiK. MAGACOIN FINANCE is unique in that it balances safety and growth. It offers a perfect mix of security and accelerating community adoption, unlike speculative meme coins. Whale inflows are on the rise, early retail momentum is strong, and its presale structure is designed to ensure scarcity. Analysts say this convergence of demand and transparency explains why it is being framed as one of the smartest plays of the year . Forecasts suggest 300x growth potential, and with a KYC-verified team plus thousands of investors already on board, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being positioned as one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025 before allocations run out. One of the Best Crypto Presales of 2025 According to Analyst Reports MAGACOIN FINANCE is often featured in analyst watchlists as one of the top crypto presales for 2025, and for good reason. The team’s commitment to full transparency — including public audits and KYC verification — builds unmatched trust. These fundamentals give investors peace of mind and separate the project from unverified alternatives in the market. Conclusion Solana continues to impress with institutional adoption and ecosystem strength, while Dogecoin remains a key retail-driven asset with consistent liquidity. Yet, analysts argue that the strongest upgrade this quarter belongs to a presale project. With double audits, a transparent team, and forecasts of 40x upside, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being recognized as the safer high-upside play — and one of the most compelling cryptos to buy in 2025 before allocations disappear.

These investment vehicles are capturing considerable attention, especially after a remarkable streak of positive performance. What does this consistent inflow mean for the future of Ethereum and the broader crypto market? What’s Driving the Momentum in US Spot ETH ETFs? Recent data highlights a compelling story for US spot ETH ETFs . On August 28, these funds collectively saw a net inflow of an impressive $39.63 million. This wasn’t a one-off event; it marked the sixth consecutive trading day of positive flows, signaling sustained investor confidence. This consistent demand underscores a growing institutional appetite for exposure to Ethereum without directly holding the cryptocurrency. Understanding these inflows is crucial. They represent real money entering the market, suggesting that investors are increasingly comfortable with the regulatory framework and the long-term potential of Ethereum. This trend could indicate a maturing market for digital asset investments. Which Funds Are Leading the Charge in US Spot ETH ETFs? While the overall picture for US spot ETH ETFs is positive, the flows aren’t evenly distributed. BlackRock’s ETHA product emerged as a clear leader, attracting a substantial $68.09 million in inflows. This significant figure demonstrates BlackRock’s strong market presence and investor trust. Grayscale’s Mini ETH also contributed positively, recording $6.27 million in inflows. These two funds together accounted for the bulk of the positive movement. However, it’s not all green across the board: BlackRock’s ETHA: $68.09 million in inflows, leading the pack. Grayscale’s Mini ETH: $6.27 million in inflows, adding to the positive momentum. Conversely, some funds experienced outflows, indicating a rebalancing or shifting of investor capital within the sector. Fidelity’s FETH saw net outflows of $33.45 million, and Bitwise’s ETHW recorded $1.28 million in outflows. This dynamic shows that while the sector as a whole is gaining, individual fund performance can vary significantly based on investor preferences and strategies. Why Are Consistent Inflows into US Spot ETH ETFs Significant? The consistent net inflows into US spot ETH ETFs are more than just numbers; they represent several key implications for the cryptocurrency ecosystem: Increased Institutional Adoption: The steady flow of capital, especially from major players like BlackRock, signals a growing acceptance of Ethereum as a legitimate investment asset by institutional investors. This legitimization can attract even more traditional finance participants. Market Maturation: ETFs provide an accessible and regulated pathway for investors to gain exposure to crypto. Their success suggests the market is becoming more sophisticated and integrated with traditional financial structures. Potential Price Impact: While not a direct one-to-one correlation, sustained buying pressure from ETFs can contribute to price stability and potentially upward movement for Ethereum, as more ETH is effectively taken off the open market by these funds. Enhanced Liquidity: Higher trading volumes and capital in ETFs generally lead to better liquidity for the underlying asset, making it easier for large investors to enter and exit positions without significant price impact. These factors collectively paint a promising picture for Ethereum’s role in the evolving financial landscape. The continued positive sentiment around US spot ETH ETFs could set a precedent for other digital assets. What Challenges Do US Spot ETH ETFs Still Face? Despite the exciting growth, the journey for US spot ETH ETFs isn’t without its hurdles. Regulatory scrutiny remains a primary concern. Governments worldwide are still grappling with how to best regulate the volatile and rapidly evolving crypto space. Changes in policy could impact the operational framework and investor appeal of these ETFs. Furthermore, market volatility is inherent to cryptocurrencies. While ETFs aim to provide a more stable investment vehicle, they are still exposed to the price swings of Ethereum. Economic downturns or unexpected crypto-specific events could trigger outflows, challenging the sustained growth observed recently. Investors must consider these risks when evaluating US spot ETH ETFs . In conclusion, the consistent six-day streak of net inflows totaling $39.6 million into US spot ETH ETFs is a powerful indicator of shifting tides in the investment world. It reflects a growing confidence among investors and a significant step towards the mainstream adoption of digital assets. As major players continue to attract capital, the narrative around Ethereum’s role in diversified portfolios strengthens, promising an exciting future for this innovative asset class. Frequently Asked Questions About US Spot ETH ETFs Q1: What are US spot ETH ETFs? A: US spot ETH ETFs are exchange-traded funds that directly hold Ethereum (ETH) as their underlying asset. They allow investors to gain exposure to ETH’s price movements without needing to buy and store the cryptocurrency themselves. Q2: Why are the recent inflows into US spot ETH ETFs significant? A: The recent, consistent inflows are significant because they indicate growing institutional and retail investor confidence in Ethereum as an asset, signaling increased market maturity and potential for broader adoption within traditional finance. Q3: Which funds are currently leading in net inflows for ETH ETFs? A: According to recent data, BlackRock’s ETHA has led the inflows, followed by Grayscale’s Mini ETH, demonstrating strong investor interest in these particular offerings. Q4: What are the potential risks associated with investing in US spot ETH ETFs? A: Key risks include market volatility inherent to cryptocurrencies, regulatory changes that could impact the funds, and the potential for economic downturns to trigger outflows. Investors should be aware of these factors. Q5: How do US spot ETH ETFs differ from directly owning Ethereum? A: ETFs offer a regulated and accessible way to invest in Ethereum without the complexities of managing private keys, wallets, or dealing with cryptocurrency exchanges directly. However, direct ownership gives you full control and potential for staking rewards, which ETFs may not pass on. If you found this analysis of US spot ETH ETFs insightful, don’t keep it to yourself!

An insightful analysis suggests that the long-awaited Bitcoin bull market could finally kick off this autumn. For investors closely watching the digital asset space, understanding the forces at play is crucial. This deep dive explores why an expert anticipates a significant shift in market dynamics. Is the Bitcoin Bull Market Finally Here? According to CryptoDan, a respected contributor to on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, the current Bitcoin market cycle is showing unique characteristics. We are experiencing a more prolonged cycle compared to historical patterns. This extended phase has led many to question the timing of the next major uptrend. One key observation from CryptoDan’s analysis involves on-chain data. The proportion of Bitcoin held for over one year is increasing, but at a noticeably slower pace than in previous cycles. This metric often signals conviction among long-term holders, and its current trajectory indicates a nuanced market sentiment. Why is This Bitcoin Bull Market Different? Several factors contribute to this evolving market landscape. CryptoDan highlights a few significant influences that are shaping the upcoming Bitcoin bull market : Spot ETF Introduction: The approval and launch of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have dramatically altered market structure. These financial products provide traditional investors with easier access to Bitcoin, changing capital flows. Institutional and National Adoption: Increased interest and adoption from institutions and even nations are also playing a role. This growing mainstream acceptance brings new money and long-term commitment into the ecosystem. Altcoin Capital Flows: Interestingly, Bitcoin’s rallies have repeatedly stalled when funds shift into altcoins. This dynamic suggests a more diversified investor base, where capital can quickly move between different digital assets, impacting Bitcoin’s momentum. These elements collectively create a market that behaves differently from past cycles, demanding a fresh perspective on future movements. Key Catalysts for the Autumn Bitcoin Bull Market Looking ahead, the analysis points to specific events that could ignite the anticipated Bitcoin bull market this autumn and winter. These potential catalysts are already on investors’ radars: September Interest Rate Cut Expectations: There is growing anticipation for a potential interest rate cut in September. Such a move by central banks typically makes risk assets, like cryptocurrencies, more attractive. It can signal a loosening of monetary policy, encouraging investment. Potential Spot Altcoin ETF Approvals: October could bring another significant development: the potential approval of spot altcoin ETFs. While focused on altcoins, this would likely be a net positive for the entire crypto market. It could attract more institutional capital, benefiting Bitcoin indirectly. These macroeconomic and regulatory shifts are expected to foster a more positive market sentiment, paving the way for a robust uptrend. Seizing Opportunities in the Next Bitcoin Bull Market For savvy investors, understanding these market dynamics offers a clear path forward. CryptoDan concludes that any further market corrections could present highly favorable buying opportunities. This perspective emphasizes a long-term strategy rather than short-term trading. The prolonged cycle, while perhaps frustrating for some, allows for more accumulation at potentially lower prices. Therefore, keeping an eye on market dips and having a clear investment strategy during this period could prove beneficial when the full force of the Bitcoin bull market eventually arrives. Summary: Preparing for the Anticipated Bitcoin Bull Market In conclusion, while the current Bitcoin market cycle is longer than previous ones, this complexity is driven by new factors like spot ETFs and broader adoption. Analyst CryptoDan’s insights suggest that upcoming economic and regulatory developments could set the stage for a powerful Bitcoin bull market this autumn and winter. Smart investors will view any dips as strategic entry points, positioning themselves for the next significant rally in the crypto space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is causing the current Bitcoin market cycle to be prolonged? The current cycle is prolonged due to factors such as the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs, increased institutional and national adoption, and capital flows frequently shifting into altcoins, which can temporarily stall Bitcoin’s momentum. Who is CryptoDan and what is CryptoQuant? CryptoDan is an analyst and contributor to CryptoQuant, a reputable on-chain analytics platform. CryptoQuant provides data and insights into cryptocurrency markets based on blockchain activity. How do spot Bitcoin ETFs impact the market? Spot Bitcoin ETFs provide traditional investors with an accessible way to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. This has introduced new capital into the market, influencing its structure and dynamics. What are the key catalysts expected to trigger the Bitcoin bull market? Key catalysts include the expectation of a September interest rate cut, which could make risk assets more attractive, and the potential approval of spot altcoin ETFs in October, which could boost overall crypto market sentiment. Why are altcoin capital flows relevant to Bitcoin’s price? When funds move into altcoins, Bitcoin’s rallies have often stalled. This suggests a market where capital can quickly diversify, temporarily diverting momentum from Bitcoin and influencing its short-term price action. What does ‘favorable buying opportunities’ mean for investors in a Bitcoin bull market? ‘Favorable buying opportunities’ refers to periods of market correction or dips. According to the analysis, these corrections could be strategic entry points for investors looking to accumulate Bitcoin before the anticipated bull market fully takes hold.

BlockDAG’s Price Jumps to $0.03 while Pi Network Sees Growth and Cardano Goes Bullish,https://thecoinrise.com/new-batch-out-blockdags-price-jumps-to-0-03-while-pi-network-sees-growth-and-cardano-goes-bullish/,"The altcoin market is buzzing with new updates, but only a few names are making real moves. Cardano and Pi Network are trying to hold their momentum, but challenges remain. Cardano (ADA) trend analysis shows a bullish setup, yet it needs to maintain support levels and break resistance to keep the rally alive. Meanwhile, Pi Network (PI) news updates highlight progress through Stellar’s strong growth, but also reveal growing tension within its community. In contrast, BlockDAG is making progress that feels far more concrete. With more than $386 million raised, over 25.5 billion coins sold, and pricing now at $0.03 in Batch 30, BDAG continues to place itself firmly among bullish altcoins in 2025. Cardano Trend Analysis Shows Golden Cross Momentum Cardano (ADA) has caught market attention after a nearly 20% rise this week, climbing close to $0.95. The latest Cardano trend analysis points to a golden cross, with the 9-day moving average pushing above the 21-day. This setup has often signaled major rallies. The last time ADA posted a golden cross in late 2023, it jumped 236% in weeks, moving from $0.30 to almost $1.00. The bullish case grew stronger when ADA broke through a resistance line holding since December 2023. If ADA can stay above $0.90 and push past $1.00, the next resistance may come at $1.20–$1.30. That would confirm a broader uptrend. Still, risks remain. A break under $0.90 could undo momentum and test lower support before another push higher. Optimism exists, but sustained growth will depend on buyers keeping pressure at crucial points. Pi Network News Update Shows Growth and Friction Pi Network is moving on a different track compared to ADA. The project’s base, Stellar, recently surpassed 100 million smart contract transactions, showing it can handle scale and wide adoption across DeFi projects. This milestone reflects positively on Pi, as its growth links directly to Stellar’s proven infrastructure. But community pressure is building. Many Pioneers want the Pi price to climb quickly, hoping for immediate gains. On the other hand, the Pi team is focused on longer-term goals, such as inclusivity, sustainability, and growing a fair digital economy. This clash of short-term expectations and long-term plans has created friction. Still, Stellar’s progress strengthens Pi’s case, showing it has the technical ground to deliver. The challenge lies in patience, as Pi balances fast-rising demand from its community with its own vision for structured growth. BlockDAG: Security, Academy, and Buyer Battles Drive Results BlockDAG is not only part of the bullish altcoin list in 2025, it is leading it. The presale has already raised more than $386 million, with over 25.5 billion coins sold. The coin started at just $0.001 in Batch 1 and has now risen to $0.03 in Batch 30, showing a 2,900% ROI so far. The confirmed launch price of $0.05 sets the stage for more growth. Three main features have set BDAG apart. First, its strong focus on security. BlockDAG has cleared audits from CertiK and Halborn, both known for finding hidden risks. With multi-signature measures and parallel Proof-of-Work processing, BDAG has shown that security remains a top priority. Second, the BlockDAG Academy is bringing education into its ecosystem. This three-tier learning platform issues on-chain credentials, helping users learn blockchain basics and advanced tools. By teaching and certifying people directly, BlockDAG builds trust and grows a skilled community ready to use its network. Finally, Buyer Battles have turned presale buying into a competitive event. Each day, the largest buyer receives unsold coins at no extra cost. This has kept the presale active and engaging, boosting both demand and community spirit. Miner adoption adds another layer. More than 19,500 miners have been sold, generating over $7.8 million in revenue. With the X1 mobile app and hardware miners like the X10, BlockDAG’s ecosystem is already active at multiple levels. Wrapping It Up Altcoin updates show different paths. Cardano trend analysis highlights bullish setups, but execution depends on holding support and breaking through resistance. Pi Network news points to growth tied to Stellar, but its community tension continues to shape its journey. BlockDAG, however, shows clear progress. With more than $386 million raised, a current presale price of $0.03, and over 25.5 billion coins sold, it has proven its momentum. Security audits, the BlockDAG Academy, Buyer Battles, and more than 19,500 miners sold demonstrate real adoption rather than just promises. For those tracking bullish altcoins in 2025, the contrast is sharp. Cardano has potential, Pi has its community debates, but BlockDAG shows measurable delivery. Its mix of growth, education, and market-ready systems gives it a foundation that feels built to last.

On-Chain Data Shows Bitcoin Momentum Slipping,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/warning-signs-on-chain-data-shows-bitcoin-momentum-slipping/,"Bitcoin’s price remains under pressure after retreating from its record high above $124,000 earlier this month. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $113,146, reflecting a decline of 8.7% from its recent peak, though it has recorded a modest 1.8% daily increase. The movement highlights ongoing volatility, as investors weigh both on-chain metrics and broader market sentiment to determine whether the bull cycle can regain strength. Analysts have pointed to a shift in behavior among large traders, particularly on Binance, the world’s largest exchange by volume. According to Arab Chain, a contributor to CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, the activity of whales, investors with large holdings, has played a significant role in recent corrections. His analysis of August trading activity suggests that weakened momentum and renewed selling pressure may explain the inability of Bitcoin to sustain its highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin And The September Curse: Can This Time Be Different? Whale Activity on Binance Signals Weakening Momentum Arab Chain noted that throughout July, Bitcoin fluctuated between $118,000 and $122,000 in what he described as a “trendless” market, with low volatility and limited directional moves. During this period, inactive deltas, which measure the circulation of older coins, declined, suggesting whales had paused selling or temporarily exited the market. However, by mid-August, the trend reversed as inactive deltas surged, signaling that long-held coins were again being moved and potentially sold. This activity coincided with Bitcoin’s drop below $112,000, with the Delta indicator remaining near zero, an absence of clear buying pressure. Arab Chain explained that the lack of demand amid increased coin circulation typically results in corrections. “Large investors are selling again without a strong wave of new buyers emerging to balance the effect. This isn’t the end of the bullish cycle, but the momentum is starting to lose steam,” he said. He added that future price movements may depend on whether new catalysts, such as macroeconomic developments or institutional inflows, can reignite demand. Bitcoin Exchange Data Highlights Mixed Sentiment Another CryptoQuant analyst, TraderOasis, examined several metrics to provide further context. He observed that the Coinbase Premium Index, which compares trading activity between US exchanges and global platforms, showed accumulation even as prices fell. This suggests some investors, possibly institutions, were buying during the dip. However, he flagged caution given that the funding rate remained positive, a sign that traders were still leaning bullish even as prices declined, raising concerns about the risk of a liquidity reset. TraderOasis also pointed to open interest, or the number of outstanding derivatives contracts, as a key factor. He argued that open interest often acts as support or resistance relative to spot price. Currently, open interest sits above the market price, which could act as resistance unless broken. “If this level is broken, the price will continue to rise,” he noted. Together, these insights reveal a complex backdrop. While long-term adoption metrics and institutional buying remain supportive, short-term dynamics show cautious sentiment and potential for volatility. With whales selling, stablecoin inflows rising, and derivatives markets heating up, Bitcoin’s next move will likely depend on whether demand can reassert itself strongly enough to offset recent profit-taking.

Technical studies show XRP holding strong around the $2.90 support, with Elliott Wave models pointing to a 74% upside. Beyond XRP, newer projects are starting to make noise. MAGACOIN FINANCE , recently audited by HashEx, is being tipped as one of the top altcoins for 2025 . Many investors now weigh whether to chase the $5 XRP target or pivot toward a rising star that could rival the best crypto to buy now. Analysts Double Down on XRP Price Forecast Toward $5 A growing number of technical analysts maintain confidence in the XRP price forecast climbing to $5 in 2025. Market data shows XRP holding strong around $2.90 with consistent buy-side demand, reinforcing the case for a bullish breakout. XRP 1Y price chart Beyond technical signals, the looming XRP ETF approval remains the most influential factor. Institutional access to a regulated product would open the doors for pension funds and asset managers. Analysts argue that once these inflows begin, XRP could position itself among the best altcoin to buy now , especially for investors seeking regulated exposure rather than speculative trading. With Gemini launching an XRP credit card and rumors of JP Morgan acquiring XRP , the XRP price could potentially pump. Source At the same time, comparisons with XRP vs Bitcoin 2025 highlight how altcoins may outperform in percentage terms. While Bitcoin often dominates headlines, investors searching for higher upside are keeping XRP firmly on their watchlist. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Rising Contender With 1700% Potential While XRP is chasing its $5 milestone, MAGACOIN FINANCE has started to capture attention as a fresh contender. Market projections suggest a potential 1700% upside, backed by a structured roadmap and fundamentals that appeal to long-term investors. Unlike legacy assets, MAGACOIN FINANCE positions itself as a growth play where early adoption could bring the highest returns. Importantly, the project underwent a full security audit by HashEx, one of the most respected smart contract audit firms in blockchain. Passing all checks adds a layer of trust for new investors who often weigh risk heavily when selecting the best crypto to buy now . With interest shifting away from older large-cap coins, MAGACOIN FINANCE is often mentioned alongside the top altcoins for 2025. Touted as One of the Best Altcoins to Buy by Analysts Touted as one of the best altcoins to buy by crypto analysts, MAGACOIN FINANCE is earning that title through its unique mix of credibility and upside potential . Its presale is attracting strong demand from long-term holders who value security , team transparency , and a roadmap built for serious scalability in 2025 and beyond. Final Word: Is XRP or MAGACOIN the Best Bet for 2025? The race toward XRP price prediction 2025 hinges on whether the SEC grants XRP ETF approval . If approved, analysts expect XRP to surge toward $5, reinforcing its place among the best altcoin to buy now for institutional investors. That said, the conversation has expanded beyond XRP alone. With bold forecasts of 1700% growth, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving out space as a rising star. Strong fundamentals, a HashEx audit, and a clear roadmap push it into discussions about the best crypto to buy now , especially for those who want exposure to projects outside the traditional top ten. In short, XRP remains a strong candidate for institutional-driven growth, but MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a high-upside alternative.

50846466,568390,1756436449,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50846466.jpeg,Chainlink Partners With US Department Of Commerce To Bring Macroeconomic Data On-Chain,https://bitcoinist.com/chainlink-us-department-of-commerce-data-on-chain/,"Chainlink and the US Department of Commerce (DOC) announced their collaboration to deliver key government macroeconomic data on-chain, aiming to improve transparency and unlock new use cases for blockchain markets. Chainlink Brings Economic Data On-Chain On Thursday, the US Department of Commerce and decentralized oracle provider Chainlink unveiled that they had partnered to bring crucial macroeconomic data on-chain from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). The new Chainlink Data Feeds aim to deliver critical information around key US economic data points, including Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, and Real Final Sales to Private Domestic Purchasers. Data on the level and percentage change of Real GDP, PCE Price Index, and Real Final Sales to Private Domestic Purchasers are now available on-chain for consumption. This data will be updated monthly or quarterly as applicable. Additionally, the data will be available across ten blockchain ecosystems initially, including Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, Botanix, Ethereum, Linea, Mantle, Optimism, Sonic, and ZKsync. The announcement highlighted that bringing the US government data on-chain “unlocks innovative use cases for blockchain markets,” like automated trading strategies, increased composability of tokenized assets, the issuance of new types of digital assets, real-time prediction markets for crowdsourced intelligence, transparent dashboards powered by immutable data, and DeFi protocol risk management based on macroeconomic factors. “As the industry-standard oracle platform, Chainlink supports one of the largest ecosystems in Web3, leveraging secure data oracles to build advanced onchain applications—making this work a natural step forward in expanding the scope of trusted data available onchain,” Chainlink wrote. Earlier this week, US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick revealed that the DOC “is going to start issuing its statistics on the blockchain,” adding that the goal is to create a more open and accessible framework for global markets. Lutnick shared his plan to bring Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on-chain for enhanced transparency and data distribution across US government departments. He also highlighted that the initiative aligned with President Trump’s vision to make America the “crypto capital of the world.” Institutional Adoption Of Blockchain Technology This development follows the recent push to integrate blockchain technology into federal institutions. As reported by Bitcoinist, the US House of Representatives passed a bill in June to establish a Blockchain Deployment Program, aiming to develop best practices and explore the adoption of blockchain in multiple areas. Introduced in February by Republican Representative Kat Cammack, HR 1664, also known as the Deploying American Blockchains Act of 2025, directs the US Secretary of Commerce to lead the national efforts, requiring him to serve as the President’s principal advisor for the deployment, use, application, and competitiveness of blockchain and other DLT, and take the actions necessary to support the US leadership in this sector. The bill, co-sponsored by Democratic Representative Darren Soto, establishes that the Secretary of Commerce must encourage and improve coordination among Federal agencies for the deployment of these technologies to offer federal support. It’s worth noting that Chainlink Labs has also met with several key US government officials and regulators to provide policy recommendations aimed at accelerating the growth of the blockchain industry. Notably, their team had several meetings with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) staff to address core issues on broker-dealer and transfer agency compliance using public blockchain infrastructure. Moreover, Chainlink’s founder, Sergey Nazarov, recently met with Tim Scott, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, to discuss the highly anticipated market structure bill and how it could enable the rapid growth of the blockchain industry in the US.",Crypto News|Blockchain Adoption|Blockchain Technologhy|chainlink|Chainlink blockchain|Chainlink ecosystem|LINK|LINKUSDT|US Department of Commerce|US DOC|US Secretrary of Commerce,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|LINK|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-29 03:00:49

Referencing Mr Pool, Tuck described a $1,000 target for 2030 as FUD, suggesting that XRP could reach the five-digit range before the end of 2025. Understanding the Target Range The numbers referenced carry significant implications. A five-digit XRP value would place the token far beyond previous forecasts, suggesting unprecedented capital inflows and institutional adoption. Traditionally, XRP has been discussed in the context of cross-border payments and tokenization. For the digital asset to achieve such a valuation, adoption at the scale of global financial infrastructure would likely be necessary, along with deep integration into payments, liquidity management, and potential use as tokenized assets. While some analysts are confident that the digital asset can reach $1,000 by 2030 , the conversation now extends into whether those figures might actually underestimate XRP’s trajectory. If Mr Pool’s coded messaging is to be interpreted literally, the implication is that the timeline has been significantly accelerated, and the asset could surpass $10,000 this year. The Final Piece of FUD: ""XRP $1,000 by 2030"" Bro … ALL AT ONCE XRP 5 Digits – 2025 #XRP pic.twitter.com/s6irbPIVc2 — Tuck Ricco (@dde_mo2442) August 27, 2025 Reactions From XRP Community The community responses to Ricco’s post reflect a mix of optimism and skepticism. One commenter pointed out that even if $1,000 by 2030 were true, XRP would still outperform all other tokens. The potential to hit $10,000 before the end of the year would set XRP apart in an unprecedented way. Another commenter attempted to break down Mr Pool’s message, setting a timeline that would see the digital asset reach double digits in September, triple digits in October, quadruple digits in November, and finally hit the five-digit range in December. Other participants approached the claim with caution. One commenter questioned whether regulation, institutional adoption, and the tokenized asset markets could realistically align within such a short period. Similarly, another user described the projection of five digits by 2025 as unrealistic, though he acknowledged that the symbolism in Mr Pool’s message seemed to point toward this outcome. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Road Ahead The debate over XRP’s long-term valuation remains ongoing. On one hand, expectations of a price surge to five digits by 2025 highlight the deep conviction among segments of the community. On the other hand, skepticism remains strong, with questions about how rapidly global adoption and institutional-scale liquidity can materialize. Whatever path XRP follows, the worst-case scenario would send it to the top of the crypto market. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

They offer convenience, liquidity, and often lower entry barriers compared to direct crypto purchases. Furthermore, the regulatory oversight associated with these products provides an added layer of security and transparency. However, investors should always consider the broader market dynamics.

ETH is now showing bearish signs and might gain bearish momentum if it declines below $4,400. Ethereum is still struggling to settle above the $4,630 zone. The price is trading below $4,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a bullish trend line with support at $4,550 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could extend losses and dive if there is a close below $4,400 in the near term. Ethereum Price Dips Again Ethereum price started a recovery wave after it tested the $4,320 zone, like Bitcoin . ETH price was able to climb above the $4,400 and $4,450 resistance levels. The price surpassed the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the key decline from the $4,955 swing high to the $4,310 low. However, the bears remained active near the $4,630 resistance zone. There were two attempts, but the bulls failed to gain strength. The 50% Fib retracement level of the key decline from the $4,955 swing high to the $4,310 low is acting as a barrier . The price reacted to the downside below $4,600. Besides, there was a break below a bullish trend line with support at $4,550 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $4,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $4,550 level. The next key resistance is near the $4,600 level. The first major resistance is near the $4,630 level. A clear move above the $4,630 resistance might send the price toward the $4,720 resistance. An upside break above the $4,720 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,800 resistance zone or even $4,880 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $4,550 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $4,440 level. The first major support sits near the $4,400 zone. A clear move below the $4,400 support might push the price toward the $4,320 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $4,250 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $4,150.

Traders are eyeing XRP and Hedera as two of the strongest movers heading into the month, while MAGACOIN FINANCE is being flagged as one of the best altcoins to buy in 2025. The potential is high, considering 100x gains are possible and the bonuses offered to early buyers will already be locked-in. Analysts say this may make September one of the most critical entry points of the year. XRP Analysis In 2025, XRP made history by becoming the fastest contract to hit 1 billion in open interest on a CME Group derivatives market. That places it in the same category as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana and it indicates just how quickly institutional investment is lapping up XRP. The increased liquidity translates into narrower spreads and more stability in prices, which contributes to confidence. The $1.25 billion acquisition of Hidden Road by Ripple contributed to the current trend but made it easier to connect XRP with conventional markets at institutions. In the meantime, Ripple released its stablecoin RLUSD on the XRP Ledger, which increased its usage. More than 300 banks have already implemented RippleNet to make payments, thus its adoption is not slowed down. The regulatory side: SEC case is now a thing of the past of Ripple. That removed a big obstacle and made a way to more listings, funds, and ETFs. As Bitcoin surges and lifts the entire market, watchers anticipate XRP to breach a resistance at about $3.10. In case it successfully penetrates the price, price targets between $3.34 and more are possible; and a drop beneath the price values of $2.80 indicates a temporary correction. Hedera (HBAR) Analysis Hedera also comes under the limelight but due to its different kind of set up. It is operated by a council of international corporations, a feature that makes it special in terms of governance compared to most of the other blockchains. With the ability to process quick low-cost transactions, the network has been increasing its presence in supply chains, DeFi, and digital identifications. Network activity is on the increase with increased number of users and transactions being recorded on a monthly basis. The above growth along with the staking rewards keeps its holders busy and makes the system more resilient. Analysts are optimistic of HBAR given that its market cap is yet to be compared to the size of its technology. As 2025 brings the attention back to those platforms that can really scale, Hedera is well positioned. Provided that the current resistance levels are overcome, HBAR could continue its gains into September along with other altcoins. MAGACOIN FINANCE — Analysts Say It’s the Best Altcoin to Buy Right Now With the predicted bull run expected in September, MAGACOIN FINANCE is standing out as the best altcoin to buy right now . Even investing a small amount of $2,500 when the whales have yet to move in could give an investor up to 100x returns , analysts suggest. A meticulous roadmap, complete transparency and a smart contract audit endorsed by top blockchain companies have seen MAGA already gain thousands of investors. Early buyers are also securing a 50% EXTRA BONUS with code PATRIOT50X — adding to the urgency as FOMO builds around one of 2025’s most talked-about altcoins. Analysts Rank MAGACOIN FINANCE a Leading Crypto Presale for 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE is often featured in analyst watchlists as one of the top crypto presales for 2025, and for good reason. The team’s commitment to full transparency — including public audits and KYC verification — builds unmatched trust. These fundamentals give investors peace of mind and separate the project from unverified alternatives in the market. Conclusion As September begins, the setup across altcoins is looking stronger than it has in months. As RP currently finds itself squarely back in the spotlight, following the clearing of its regulatory hurdles and gaining substantial traction with institutions alike, what could be the next step on the roadmap? Hedera is encouraging adoption via its enterprise-based governance structure and rapidly expanding application niches that may allow the network to become one of the most usable in practical use. Both coins have solid upside potential going into September. But it is MAGACOIN FINANCE that analysts say could turn the book around the investors. With its roadmap already in motion, its security audit passed, and forecasts pointing to gains as high as 100x, it’s being talked about as the altcoin to watch during this next rally. Provided that the market meets the bullish forecasts of September, it is possible that MAGA would turn out to be the greatest beneficiary among the three.

How can these groundbreaking concepts truly reach the masses and achieve their full potential? UXLink, a prominent Web3 social platform, offers a compelling and insightful answer: robust social infrastructure . The Distribution Dilemma: Why RWAs and Stablecoins Struggle to Thrive? Imagine a future where real-world assets, from property to art, are easily tokenized and traded on a blockchain. Or stablecoins, offering digital currency stability, are used globally without friction. These visions are powerful. However, achieving them demands more than just cutting-edge technology. A recent analysis by UXLink points out a critical limitation: the need for public recognition and, crucially, trust. Traditional financial markets have established trust models, often centralized. Web3, built on decentralization, requires a fundamentally new approach to trust. The core challenge for both RWAs and stablecoins lies in their distribution. It’s not enough to simply create these digital assets; people need to: Discover them: How do potential users find out about these new offerings? Understand their value: What benefits do they offer over traditional alternatives? Feel secure using them: How can users be confident in their safety and reliability? Without effective channels for reaching potential users and fostering genuine belief, even the most innovative Web3 solutions can struggle to gain traction and achieve widespread adoption. Unlocking Adoption: How Can Social Infrastructure Build Trust in Web3? UXLink argues persuasively that social networks are inherently trust-based ecosystems. Think about it: we often adopt new ideas or products when friends, family, or trusted community members introduce them. This fundamental human behavior is precisely what Web3 needs to harness. By leveraging existing social connections, powerful social infrastructure can bridge the gap between complex blockchain technology and everyday users. Web3’s core principle of decentralization necessitates a trust model distinct from traditional finance. Instead of relying on centralized authorities, Web3 can build trust through transparent, community-driven interactions. Platforms like UXLink, serving as vital social infrastructure , provide the essential environment where this new trust model can flourish. They allow users to engage, learn, and collectively validate new technologies and assets. UXLink’s Real World Social (RWS) Protocol: A Game-Changer for Distribution? With over 54 million users, UXLink is already a significant player in the Web3 space. The platform recently introduced its Real World Social (RWS) protocol, specifically designed to tackle these critical trust and distribution challenges. RWS aims to integrate social graphs and connections directly into the fabric of Web3, creating a more intuitive and trustworthy onboarding experience for users. By connecting individuals within trusted communities, the RWS protocol can significantly accelerate the adoption of RWAs and stablecoins. Consider these advantages: Peer Validation: Users are more likely to engage with assets recommended by their trusted social circle. Simplified Onboarding: Social connections can streamline the process of understanding and using new Web3 products. Organic Growth: Distribution becomes more natural and viral, spreading through existing networks. UXLink emphasizes that its comprehensive social infrastructure is uniquely positioned to address these dual hurdles of trust and widespread adoption effectively. Beyond Distribution: The Broader Impact of Robust Social Infrastructure The implications of strong social infrastructure extend far beyond just distributing RWAs and stablecoins. It lays the groundwork for a truly decentralized internet where communities, not corporations, drive innovation and growth. This fosters a more inclusive Web3 ecosystem, where diverse voices can contribute and benefit collectively. Robust social layers can enhance user experience across all Web3 applications, making them more engaging and user-friendly. From decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to NFT communities, the ability to connect and interact within trusted groups is paramount. This foundational layer is crucial for Web3’s long-term success and its promise of a more equitable and accessible digital future. In conclusion, UXLink’s insightful analysis into the power of social infrastructure offers a compelling roadmap for overcoming some of Web3’s most persistent challenges. By recognizing the inherent trust within social networks and building innovative protocols like RWS, platforms can unlock the vast potential of real-world asset tokenization and stablecoin adoption. This approach is not just about technology; it’s about empowering people, fostering genuine trust, and building strong communities, ultimately paving the way for a truly decentralized and widely accessible Web3 for everyone. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are Real-World Assets (RWAs) in Web3? Real-World Assets (RWAs) refer to tangible or intangible assets from the traditional financial world, such as real estate, commodities, art, or even intellectual property, that are tokenized and represented on a blockchain. This allows them to be traded and managed digitally, offering increased liquidity and accessibility. Why is distribution a problem for RWAs and stablecoins? The main challenge is gaining widespread public recognition and adoption. Unlike traditional assets, Web3 assets lack established distribution channels and often face a trust deficit from new users. People need to understand their value and feel secure enough to use them. What is Web3 social infrastructure? Web3 social infrastructure refers to decentralized platforms and protocols that facilitate social interactions, community building, and trust creation within the Web3 ecosystem. It leverages social connections to drive adoption and engagement for various Web3 applications and assets. How does UXLink’s Real World Social (RWS) protocol work? The RWS protocol integrates existing social graphs and connections into Web3. It uses the inherent trust within social networks to accelerate the adoption and distribution of digital assets like RWAs and stablecoins, making them more accessible and less intimidating for users. What role does trust play in Web3 adoption? Trust is foundational for Web3 adoption. Since Web3 operates on decentralization, it needs a new trust model, distinct from traditional centralized systems. Social infrastructure helps build this trust by allowing users to adopt new technologies within communities they already know and rely on. Found this analysis insightful?

In just 24 hours, millions of dollars in leveraged positions were wiped out, painting a vivid picture of the inherent volatility in digital asset trading. This significant financial movement affects not only individual traders but also influences broader market sentiment. What Are Crypto Futures Liquidations? For those new to the concept, a crypto futures liquidation occurs when an exchange forcibly closes a trader’s leveraged position. This happens because the trader no longer has sufficient margin to keep the position open. Essentially, if the market moves sharply against a highly leveraged bet, the exchange steps in to prevent further losses to the trader and itself. These events are common in futures trading, where investors can amplify their potential gains (and losses) by borrowing funds. However, this also means smaller price movements can trigger substantial losses, leading to liquidations. Decoding the 24-Hour Crypto Futures Liquidations Data The past day brought particularly striking figures for crypto futures liquidations , with three major cryptocurrencies bearing the brunt: Ethereum (ETH): A staggering $89.14 million in ETH futures was liquidated. Notably, long positions accounted for 73.05% of this total. This indicates that a significant number of traders were betting on ETH’s price to rise, only for it to move downwards, forcing their positions to close. Bitcoin (BTC): The flagship cryptocurrency saw $39.33 million in liquidations. Here, long positions also dominated, making up 57.86% of the total. This suggests a similar scenario to ETH, where bullish bets on Bitcoin faced a market downturn. Solana (SOL): SOL experienced $27.90 million in liquidations. Interestingly, short positions accounted for 57.97% of this figure. This implies that many traders were expecting SOL’s price to fall, but it moved upwards, leading to their short positions being liquidated. These figures highlight the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market, where both upward and downward price movements can trigger massive liquidations. Why Do These Crypto Futures Liquidations Happen So Rapidly? The rapid occurrence of these crypto futures liquidations is primarily due to several interconnected factors: High Leverage: Many traders use high leverage in futures markets, meaning they control a large position with a relatively small amount of their own capital. While this can magnify profits, it also dramatically increases the risk of liquidation with even minor price fluctuations. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile assets. Sudden news, macroeconomic shifts, or large institutional trades can trigger swift and significant price changes, catching leveraged traders off guard. Cascading Effects: Large liquidations can sometimes trigger further price movements. As positions are forcibly closed, market sell orders (for long liquidations) or buy orders (for short liquidations) are executed, potentially pushing prices further in the direction that triggered the initial liquidations, creating a cascade. Navigating Volatility: Insights from Recent Liquidations Understanding these recent crypto futures liquidations offers crucial lessons for traders. It underscores the importance of robust risk management strategies, especially when dealing with leveraged products. Manage Leverage Wisely: Avoid excessively high leverage. While tempting, it drastically increases your exposure to liquidation risk. Use Stop-Loss Orders: Implement stop-loss orders to automatically close your position if the price moves against you beyond a certain point, limiting potential losses before a full liquidation occurs. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, technical indicators, and broader economic trends that could influence cryptocurrency prices. Diversify: Spreading investments across different assets can mitigate risk, though it’s less direct for individual futures positions. These strategies help traders navigate the challenging landscape of crypto futures, aiming to protect capital even amidst extreme market swings. The recent wave of crypto futures liquidations serves as a powerful reminder of the risks associated with leveraged trading in volatile markets. While the allure of amplified gains is strong, the potential for rapid losses is equally significant. Responsible trading practices, including careful risk management and a deep understanding of market dynamics, are paramount for anyone engaging in crypto futures. Frequently Asked Questions About Crypto Futures Liquidations What is a crypto futures liquidation? A crypto futures liquidation is the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange when their margin balance falls below the required maintenance level, preventing further losses. Why did Ethereum (ETH) have higher liquidations than Bitcoin (BTC) in this period? The higher liquidation volume for ETH suggests that a larger amount of leveraged capital was positioned in ETH futures, or that ETH experienced a more significant price movement against the dominant long positions compared to BTC during the 24-hour period. What does it mean when “long positions” account for most liquidations? When long positions account for most liquidations, it means that a majority of traders were betting on the asset’s price to increase. The market then moved downwards, causing these bullish bets to be closed out. How can traders avoid crypto futures liquidations? Traders can avoid liquidations by using lower leverage, setting stop-loss orders, maintaining sufficient margin in their accounts, and carefully managing their risk exposure based on market volatility. Does a high volume of crypto futures liquidations impact the broader market? Yes, significant liquidation events can increase market volatility, contribute to price cascades, and negatively affect overall market sentiment as traders become more cautious.

With XRP making headlines after its historic legal victory and Shiba Inu pushing forward with major ecosystem updates, investors are once again reminded of how early presales can deliver life-changing gains. Now, a new contender has entered the stage — MAGACOIN FINANCE — quickly being called the best crypto presale opportunity of 2025. If you missed out on XRP at under $0.50 or Shiba Inu before its 2021 rally, MAGACOIN FINANCE might just be your second chance. Let’s dive into why this presale is generating so much hype and why many investors are calling it the best crypto presale of the year. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Best Crypto Presale of 2025 As XRP and SHIB prove, early adoption in presales can transform small investments into massive gains .

Massive Hype Cycle — The project is gaining traction across the crypto market, echoing the viral growth of meme tokens but with a utility-driven roadmap. Strategic Timing — Launching during a bullish 2025 market, when institutions are embracing altcoins and retail sentiment is turning positive again. MAGACOIN FINANCE recently went through a full smart contract audit by HashEx — and it passed without issues. This successful audit has given investors more confidence that the project is built on solid foundations. On top of that, the team’s focus on transparency and a well-structured roadmap sets it apart from many other presale tokens. Where to Buy MAGACOIN FINANCE Since fake tokens often pop up using the MAGACOIN FINANCE name, investors should stay alert when making purchases.

Analysts see it as a low-risk, high-reward entry for those positioning ahead of the 2025 altseason . XRP (Ripple) Updates: Regulatory Clarity Sparks Institutional Wave The crypto world recently celebrated a groundbreaking moment — the conclusive end of the Ripple-SEC lawsuit . On August 8, 2025, both sides filed for dismissal of appeals, officially confirming that XRP is not a security in secondary market transactions . Ripple agreed to a final $125 million civil penalty, but the verdict has removed years of uncertainty hanging over XRP. This decision places XRP in the same regulatory class as Bitcoin and Ethereum , opening doors for institutional adoption like never before. Current Price : $2.93–$2.95, with support at $2.90 and resistance around $3.05–$3.20. Year-to-Date Gains : Nearly 400% since Q4 2024 lows of $0.50. Price Predictions : Analysts target $3.70–$4.70 by year-end, with some expecting $7–$10 in 2026. XRP ETF Momentum Seven major asset managers, including Grayscale, WisdomTree, and Franklin Templeton , have filed updated XRP ETF applications. Experts suggest approval odds have surged to 95% , potentially making XRP the first altcoin ETF approved. This combination of legal clarity, ETFs, and mainstream adoption has created a strong bullish case for XRP’s future. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Updates: Ecosystem Growth Despite Volatility Shiba Inu, the original meme coin phenomenon, continues to evolve far beyond its meme origins. Currently trading between $0.00001210–$0.00001281 , SHIB shows resilience after a weekend crash, with critical support at $0.00001247 . Burn Mechanism Volatility August 2025 has been a rollercoaster for SHIB’s token burns : Aug 24–25 : Burn rate surged 4,547% , destroying 3.7M SHIB. Following Days : Burn activity collapsed by 95%, creating uncertainty. Whale & Exchange Activity A whale recently withdrew 132.3B SHIB ($1.66M) from Coinbase. Over 4.66T SHIB removed from exchanges, reducing selling pressure. Shibarium Ecosystem Growth 1.53B transactions processed in two years. 5-second block times with ultra-low fees. Over 29,572 smart contracts now live. Upcoming AI integration, Layer-3 rollout, and SHIB-backed stablecoin by 2026. Despite recent turbulence, SHIB remains a favorite among retail and whale investors, with predictions ranging from $0.000015 to $0.00005 in 2025. Final Thoughts: The Next XRP or SHIB? XRP’s legal clarity and ETF prospects, alongside Shiba Inu’s thriving ecosystem, show how the right project can generate incredible returns for early adopters. MAGACOIN FINANCE is now being compared to these giants — and it’s still in presale. If you’re searching for the best crypto presale of the year, this could be it.

James Seyffart, a well-respected voice in the industry, believes that numerous altcoin exchange-traded products are simply destined to fail. This isn’t just a casual observation; it’s a crucial insight into the evolving landscape of crypto investments, prompting both caution and strategic thinking among market participants. Why Many Altcoin ETPs Face a Dire Future James Seyffart, a prominent Bloomberg ETF analyst, recently shared a rather sobering outlook for the burgeoning market of altcoin ETPs . He clearly stated his prediction: a substantial number of these products will likely not succeed. This forecast stems from a deep understanding of market dynamics and the specific characteristics of the assets these ETPs aim to track. Seyffart specifically highlighted “long-tail assets” as the primary culprits. He describes these as tokens with small market capitalizations and, more importantly, low liquidity. Such assets, according to his analysis, are almost certain to struggle in attracting the significant capital inflows needed to sustain an ETP. Without substantial investment, these products become economically unviable, making their long-term survival questionable. Understanding the Liquidity Challenge for Altcoin ETPs The core issue for many altcoin ETPs lies in the fundamental economics of financial products. ETPs require a certain level of trading volume and investor interest to remain viable. When a product fails to gather sufficient investment levels, it becomes a burden for its issuer. Seyffart warns that products with consistently low investment are highly susceptible to delisting. This is a critical point for both issuers and potential investors. Think about it: an ETP aims to provide easy access to an underlying asset. If that asset itself is hard to buy or sell in large quantities without moving its price significantly, the ETP faces operational hurdles. Market makers, who ensure the ETP’s price tracks the underlying asset, struggle in low-liquidity environments, increasing costs and reducing efficiency. Therefore, the lack of robust liquidity directly impacts the product’s attractiveness and feasibility. The Impact of a Crowded Market on Altcoin ETPs The situation becomes even more precarious when multiple entities are vying for approval for the same altcoin. Imagine five or more applicants awaiting ETP approval for an identical altcoin. This fierce competition, coupled with the inherent low liquidity of the underlying asset, creates an environment where only a select few, if any, can truly thrive. The market simply cannot support such a crowded field for niche assets, leading to a scramble for limited capital. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) currently has a staggering 92 crypto ETFs pending review. This large number indicates a strong interest from financial institutions to offer crypto exposure to a broader investor base. However, Seyffart’s prediction serves as a stark reminder that not all applications, even if approved, will lead to successful products. Even with regulatory green lights, market demand and asset characteristics ultimately determine an ETP’s fate. What Should Investors Consider Before Investing in Altcoin ETPs? For investors, this forecast carries significant implications. It means a careful evaluation of the underlying altcoin’s fundamentals, its market cap, and its liquidity profile is paramount. Don’t be swayed solely by the novelty or hype surrounding an altcoin ETP . Instead, focus on products tracking well-established, liquid assets if you seek stability and a higher chance of long-term viability. Key Challenges and Actionable Insights for Altcoin ETPs: Low Liquidity: Small market cap altcoins often lack the trading volume necessary for efficient ETP management. Action: Prioritize ETPs tracking assets with substantial daily trading volume. Limited Investor Interest: Niche altcoins may not attract a broad enough investor base to achieve significant Assets Under Management (AUM). Action: Research the overall community and institutional interest in the underlying altcoin. Intense Competition: Multiple ETPs for the same altcoin can dilute capital inflows. Action: Be wary of highly competitive segments, as this increases the risk of delisting for weaker products. Operational Costs: Maintaining an ETP involves costs. Low AUM makes it harder to cover these expenses, increasing the risk of closure. Action: Look for ETPs that have already achieved a reasonable AUM. Understanding these challenges helps investors make more informed decisions. It’s not about avoiding all altcoin ETPs , but rather about approaching them with a realistic understanding of the risks involved, especially for those tracking less established digital assets. In conclusion, while the expansion of crypto ETPs offers exciting new avenues for investors, the warnings from experts like James Seyffart are invaluable. The future of many altcoin ETPs , especially those tied to illiquid, long-tail assets, appears bleak. Understanding these challenges is crucial for making informed investment decisions in the dynamic world of digital assets. We encourage both issuers and investors to approach this evolving market with prudence and a clear understanding of the inherent risks, prioritizing robust market fundamentals over speculative appeal. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Altcoin ETPs Q1: What are altcoin ETPs? A: Altcoin ETPs (Exchange-Traded Products) are financial instruments that allow investors to gain exposure to the price movements of various altcoins (cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin) without directly owning the underlying digital assets. They trade on traditional exchanges. Q2: Why does James Seyffart predict many altcoin ETPs will fail? A: Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart predicts failure primarily due to their focus on “long-tail assets” – altcoins with small market capitalizations and low liquidity. These assets struggle to attract sufficient capital inflows to sustain the ETPs, making them economically unviable. Q3: What are “long-tail assets” in the context of ETPs? A: In this context, “long-tail assets” refer to cryptocurrencies that have relatively small market capitalizations and low trading volumes. They are less established and less liquid compared to major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Q4: How does low liquidity affect altcoin ETPs? A: Low liquidity means it’s difficult to buy or sell large quantities of the underlying altcoin without significantly impacting its price. This creates operational challenges for ETP issuers and market makers, increasing costs and making it harder for the ETP to accurately track the altcoin’s price, ultimately deterring investors. Q5: What should investors consider before investing in an altcoin ETP? A: Investors should carefully evaluate the underlying altcoin’s fundamentals, market capitalization, and liquidity profile. Prioritize ETPs tracking well-established, liquid assets and be wary of products for niche altcoins with intense competition among issuers. Q6: How many crypto ETFs are currently pending SEC review? A: According to James Seyffart, a total of 92 crypto ETFs are currently pending review by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), indicating a significant interest in offering these products.

Spot Ether ETFs have recorded nearly $10 billion in inflows since July, far surpassing Bitcoin ETF demand over the same period. Related Reading: XRP Whales Unload Massive Bags: Distribution Or Trap? According to K33 Research, Bitcoin’s open interest has surged to a two-year high of $34 billion, raising concerns about excessive leverage, while Ethereum’s consistent capital inflows highlight growing confidence in its long-term role. Notably, a Bitcoin whale recently swapped 22,400 BTC for ETH, pushing Ethereum to a new all-time high near $4,956. This move accelerated the ETH/BTC ratio to 0.041, signaling that institutional money may be repositioning toward Ethereum’s ecosystem. Why ETH is Wall Street’s Favorite Crypto Wall Street has increasingly embraced Ethereum as the preferred blockchain for stablecoin settlements, decentralized finance (DeFi), and tokenized assets. VanEck CEO Jan van Eck even called ETH “the Wall Street token,” citing its programmable smart contracts and staking yields that set it apart from Bitcoin’s passive “digital gold” narrative. Data shows that over 19 public companies now hold 2.7 million ETH in their treasuries, leveraging staking for steady income. Similarly, investment advisers hold $1.3 billion in Ether ETF exposure, with Goldman Sachs accounting for more than half the amount. The GENIUS Act stablecoin legislation, passed earlier this year, has further boosted institutional confidence by cementing Ethereum’s role in regulated financial systems. ETH's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview Ethereum Price Predictions: $6K–$12K Targets Analysts are increasingly bullish on Ethereum’s projections. Short-term targets point to a breakout above $5,200 and potentially $6,000 in September, with some projections extending as high as $12,000 by year-end. This optimism stems from Ethereum’s dominance in stablecoin infrastructure (over $145 billion), strong ETF flows, and improving technical setups. Historically, Ethereum rallies have coincided with altcoin seasons, but experts caution that the broader market has yet to show signs of overheating. With ETH currently trading around $4,620, analysts note that holding above $4,500 support could be the launchpad for the next major leg higher.

The company is embarking on a substantial capital raise, signaling an ambitious strategy for its Luxfolio LTC investment . This development could reshape perceptions around institutional interest in Litecoin and its broader market implications. What Drives This Ambitious Luxfolio LTC Investment? Luxfolio is actively pursuing a capital increase of $73 million , as reported by Decrypt. This substantial funding is earmarked for a clear and strategic purpose: to significantly boost its holdings in Litecoin (LTC). The company has set an impressive long-term goal, aiming to secure one million LTC by 2026 . This target highlights a strong belief in Litecoin’s future trajectory and its role in Luxfolio’s portfolio. Capital Injection: Luxfolio aims to raise $73 million. Primary Use: The funds are intended to purchase additional Litecoin (LTC). Long-Term Vision: The company targets holding one million LTC by 2026. As a crypto infrastructure provider, Luxfolio plays a vital role in the digital asset ecosystem, often involved in services like mining, staking, or custody. Its decision to allocate such significant capital towards a specific asset like LTC underscores a calculated business strategy. Furthermore, Luxfolio has demonstrated transparency in its acquisition strategy, consistently disclosing its purchase information since July of last year. This consistent reporting allows investors and market observers to track the company’s progress toward its ambitious Luxfolio LTC investment goals. Why Litecoin? Unpacking Luxfolio’s Strategic LTC Investment Many might wonder why Luxfolio is placing such a significant bet on Litecoin. Often referred to as “digital silver” to Bitcoin’s “digital gold,” Litecoin offers several attractive characteristics for institutional investors. It boasts faster transaction times and a larger coin supply compared to Bitcoin, potentially offering different risk-reward profiles. Moreover, Litecoin’s established network and consistent development make it a stable, albeit sometimes overlooked, asset in the volatile crypto market. Luxfolio’s decision likely stems from a strategic analysis of Litecoin’s fundamentals and its potential for growth. Investing heavily in LTC could be seen as a move to diversify crypto portfolios, capitalize on perceived undervaluation, or simply a belief in the network’s enduring utility and adoption. This calculated approach underscores the seriousness of Luxfolio’s strategic Luxfolio LTC investment , aligning with its role as an infrastructure provider that benefits from a robust and liquid ecosystem. What Potential Market Ripples Could Luxfolio’s LTC Investment Create? A capital raise of $73 million, specifically aimed at acquiring one million LTC, is no small feat and could certainly send ripples through the Litecoin market. Such a significant institutional accumulation could lead to several outcomes: Increased Demand: A large buyer like Luxfolio consistently entering the market could create sustained buying pressure. Price Appreciation: While not guaranteed, increased demand often contributes to price appreciation for an asset. Enhanced Legitimacy: A major infrastructure provider making such a substantial Luxfolio LTC investment could signal increased institutional confidence in Litecoin, potentially attracting other large investors. However, challenges also exist. Market volatility remains a constant in the crypto space, and large-scale acquisitions always carry inherent risks. Fluctuations in price or changes in market sentiment could impact the timing and cost of Luxfolio’s purchases. Despite these, Luxfolio’s transparent and long-term strategy provides a fascinating case study in institutional crypto adoption, potentially adding significant liquidity and depth to the LTC market. A Pivotal Moment for Institutional Crypto Adoption? Luxfolio’s commitment to building out its Litecoin reserves represents more than just a company’s investment strategy; it highlights a broader trend of increasing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. This move by Luxfolio could inspire other infrastructure providers or investment firms to explore similar opportunities, further integrating digital assets into traditional financial frameworks. The company’s proactive approach in disclosing its purchases also sets a precedent for transparency in the evolving digital asset landscape, fostering greater trust and understanding. In conclusion, Luxfolio’s pursuit of a $73 million capital increase to fuel its ambitious Luxfolio LTC investment is a noteworthy development. With a clear target of one million LTC by 2026, the company is positioning itself as a major player in the Litecoin ecosystem. This strategic move not only signifies Luxfolio’s confidence in LTC but also underscores the growing institutional appetite for diverse digital assets, potentially paving the way for further mainstream adoption and stability in the crypto market.

50846468,568463,1756440038,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50846468.jpeg,VanEck CEO Calls Ethereum ‘The Wall Street Token’ As Institutional Adoption Rises,https://bitcoinist.com/vaneck-ceo-ethereum-wall-street-token/,"Investment management firm VanEck’s CEO, Jan van Eck, said on Fox Business yesterday that Ethereum (ETH) is very much “the Wall Street token.” His comments come as ETH hovers near a potential new all-time high (ATH), drawing renewed attention from both retail and institutional investors. Ethereum Essential For Stablecoin Transfers In a recent interview with Fox Business, VanEck CEO shared thoughts on ETH’s current momentum – both in terms of price and adoption. The executive said that banks must adopt the smart contract network to facilitate stablecoin transactions. For the uninitiated, stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a reserve asset like the US dollar. They combine the speed of crypto with the stability of traditional currencies, making them widely used for payments, trading, and remittances. Until recently, banks were cautious about stablecoins due to regulatory uncertainty and their association with the broader, volatile crypto market. However, following the passage of the GENIUS Act, attitudes have begun to shift. Regulators are now offering a clearer framework for digital asset operations, and commercial institutions are increasingly open to adopting stablecoins as part of their financial infrastructure. Speaking on Fox Business, Jan van Eck said it is essential for banks and commercial institutions to adopt a blockchain to enable stablecoin movements. Among the several potential candidates, the VanEck CEO thinks Ethereum holds a competitive advantage. He added: So the winner is, who’s going to be building on these blockchains? It’s going to be Ethereum or something that uses Ethereum kind of methodology, which is called EVM. This is not the first time VanEck has highlighted Ethereum’s role in the evolving digital economy. In a recent report, the firm suggested that Ethereum could one day surpass Bitcoin (BTC) as the preferred store of value, citing ETH’s declining issuance rate and expanding network utility as key drivers. Stablecoin adoption has accelerated since Donald Trump’s victory in the November 2024 US presidential election. The state of Wyoming recently launched its own stablecoin, FRNT, marking the first such initiative by a US state government. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent projected that the stablecoin market could grow to as much as $3.7 trillion by 2030. Investment banks are also weighing in as Citigroup recently estimated the market could expand sevenfold within five years. ETH Adoption Outshines Bitcoin Ethereum’s broad utility continues to give it an edge over Bitcoin. While BTC remains primarily a store of value and an inflation hedge, ETH powers decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and functions as a global settlement layer for digital payments. Against that backdrop, an increasing number of firms are actively adding ETH to their balance sheets. For example, SharpLink Gaming recently purchased another 56,533 ETH, increasing its total holdings close to 800,000 tokens. Recent exchange-traded funds (ETF) data also shows ETH ETFs outperforming their Bitcoin counterparts for seven consecutive days. At press time, ETH trades at $4,473, down 3.2% in the past 24 hours.",Ethereum|Altcoin|bitcoin|blockchain|btc|Cryptocurrency|digital currency|ETH|ethereum etf|ETHUSDT|GENIUS Act|smart contract|Stablecoins,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|BTC|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-29 04:00:38
50846484,https://timestabloid.com/?p=80666,1756440045,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Solana and Chainlink May Outperform BNB Despite $900 Price Target, Analysts Say",https://timestabloid.com/solana-and-chainlink-may-outperform-bnb-despite-900-price/,"BNB is once again approaching the $900 mark, trading near $876.94 in late August and setting up for a potential push into the $905–$920 range in September 2025. While this rally has captured attention, market experts consistently caution that Solana and Chainlink could deliver stronger returns this quarter due to network upgrades, institutional flows, and real-world adoption milestones. Alongside these two established leaders, analysts are also pointing towards the safe and audited MAGACOIN FINANCE as a standout presale altcoin for 2025, with early buyers positioning for outsized upside. BNB: Highs, But Facing Competition BNB continues to benefit from its role as the utility token of Binance’s exchange ecosystem. Price momentum has been resilient, with support holding around $816–$835 and upside resistance expected near $900–$1,000. Technical scenarios suggest that a short-term breakout is possible if ETF speculation gains traction, potentially driving average September prices toward $890. Still, analysts note that BNB’s growth ceiling appears lower than peers with stronger innovation pipelines. Without fresh catalysts beyond exchange demand and ETF speculation, BNB may remain in a sideways accumulation pattern, consolidating gains while investors rotate toward altcoins with more dynamic growth narratives. Solana: Technical Innovation and Institutional Adoption Solana has been described as a dominant force in the third quarter of 2025, thanks to a string of upgrades that continue to separate it from competitors. The Alpenglow proposal, bringing settlement speeds of 100–150 milliseconds and throughput of over 4,000 transactions per second, has made the network an attractive option for DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise settlement. Price forecasts for Solana remain wide-ranging, with bearish targets near $130–$150 and bullish scenarios climbing toward $520–$750 by the end of the year. Much of this optimism is rooted in the steady rise of institutional adoption, especially after the approval of Solana-linked ETFs and regulatory clarity around stablecoin issuance. Analysts highlight Solana’s combination of scalability, developer activity, and low transaction costs as reasons it remains one of the top altcoin picks of the quarter. Chainlink: Bullish Breakout and Ecosystem Partnerships Chainlink is also gaining momentum, with analysts pointing to a potential 60% rally in the months ahead. Price targets for Q3 sit between $26.46 and $32, with extended rallies possibly driving LINK toward the $35–$50 range. The bullish thesis centers on Chainlink’s evolving role as the backbone of decentralized finance. Recent upgrades to its Data Streams, enhanced cross-chain interoperability, and partnerships with institutional players have strengthened its positioning. Meanwhile, treasury accumulation has reduced circulating supply, providing an added layer of bullish momentum. For many, Chainlink remains not just an altcoin trade, but an essential piece of infrastructure for the future of decentralized markets. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale Contender for 2025 While Solana and Chainlink are being tipped as outperformers this quarter, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly building its case as the best altcoin to buy for 2025. Analysts highlight its growing presale base and completed audits as critical signals of long-term viability, with forecasts suggesting it could deliver stronger percentage gains than larger-cap tokens. Momentum has been building steadily as early buyers secure allocations using the PATRIOT50X code, which still unlocks a 50% presale bonus. Traders who previously focused on BNB and Solana are beginning to diversify into MAGACOIN, seeing it as a chance to replicate the type of exponential upside that smaller-cap tokens can achieve in early cycles. More than just another presale, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being positioned by market watchers as a strategic play — one that combines strong community traction with an early-mover advantage. As Solana and Chainlink strengthen their fundamentals, MAGACOIN’s appeal lies in its ability to multiply returns for those entering at this stage of the market. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is a Trusted Crypto to Buy for 2025 Growth Investors searching for a trusted early-stage project have found a strong contender in MAGACOIN FINANCE, widely ranked among the best cryptos to buy in 2025. Its smart contract passed auditing standards, and the public team has completed full KYC verification. Combined with growing community traction, these strengths make it a top-tier choice for those prioritizing safety and growth. Strategic Outlook BNB may test the $900–$950 range again in September, but its growth story is increasingly overshadowed by competitors. Solana’s technical progress and ETF-fueled adoption, Chainlink’s breakout potential, and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale momentum offer more compelling upside narratives for investors. Analysts conclude that rotating exposure toward Solana, Chainlink, and MAGACOIN FINANCE aligns with Q3’s broader innovation and adoption themes, while keeping a measured allocation in BNB to capture any ETF-driven moves remains a balanced approach for portfolios.

He described XRP as now “powering real-world data on-chain,” tying the observation directly to Ripple’s latest move in integrating oracle technology into the XRP Ledger (XRPL). This step reflects a broader trend where blockchain networks are prioritizing transparent and auditable access to external data. Partnership Between Ripple and DIA The initiative is being carried out in collaboration with DIA, an open-source oracle provider. The integration is based on DIA’s Lumina platform, which is a decentralized oracle framework. Ripple and DIA aim to deliver reliable oracle services to the XRPL , creating a system where financial data is both transparent and fully auditable. Ripple’s partnership with DIA aims to enhance how decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, tokenized assets, stablecoins, and banking systems interact with blockchain infrastructure. DIA’s Lumina framework removes reliance on “black-box” models by running all oracle activity on-chain. This ensures participants can verify data sources, giving the XRPL both transparency and compliance while maintaining an open and decentralized structure.

While the usual big names are still in the spotlight, more and more attention is shifting toward early-stage projects with fresh upside potential. Analysts are pointing to Ethereum, Binance Coin, Sui, and Pepe—with MAGACOIN FINANCE also creeping into the conversation as a new contender gaining a reputation for being one of the safest plays in the market. Here’s a closer look at why these five tokens are making waves in August 2025 and why some traders believe this presale wildcard could be one to watch closely. 1. Ethereum (ETH) – Institutional Demand Drives Record Highs Ethereum has been one of the highest-rallying cryptocurrencies this year, all thanks to the success of the ETF launches and sustained institutional demand. In August alone, ETFs have pulled in nearly $3 billion, indicating the level of institutional interest in ETH. With more than 30% of ETH staked and a DeFi TVL of $95 billion, Ethereum remains the backbone of altcoin momentum. Analysts expect ETH to reach $7,500 to $10,000 by late 2025, making it a frontrunner among the best altcoins to buy now. 2. Binance Coin (BNB) – Utility and Ecosystem Growth BNB trades near $850 with strong support around $820. Its value comes from Binance’s ecosystem — powering exchange fees, DeFi staking, and treasury programs. Analysts see potential for $940 in the near term and $1,770 by 2026. BNB’s consistent growth makes it a staple in many portfolios of the top altcoins to buy in 2025. 3. Sui (SUI) – Gaming and Real-World Assets Sui is proving itself as a scalable blockchain built for gaming and real-world assets. The network surpassed 4 billion transactions and boasts $2.72 billion in DeFi TVL. Gaming protocols like Jackson.io and tokenized gold via Matrixdock’s XAUm are expanding its ecosystem. With SUI trading near $3.5 and targets of $5, it’s one of the more innovative altcoins to buy now. 4. Pepe (PEPE) – Meme Coin With Breakout Potential PEPE is consolidating near $0.00001001, with analysts watching resistance at $0.0000125. A breakout could double its price, though risk remains high. Still, viral community energy keeps PEPE relevant, and spinoffs like Little Pepe raising $21 million prove the brand has staying power. For traders who embrace volatility, PEPE is still among the best altcoins to buy now. 5. MAGACOIN FINANCE – Secure Presale With Growing Momentum MAGACOIN FINANCE’s momentum has kept it in the spotlight. The token is moving faster across crypto circles than established tokens, with some now comparing it to the early stages of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. What sets the token apart is its growing community. Investors and traders alike are excited by the potential of the token as one of the standout altcoins. Alongside that, large investors are exiting their positions in other tokens to key into MAGACOIN FINANCE based on its low entry price and solid roadmap. For smart investors, that sends a signal as to where the market is going. MAGACOIN FINANCE may not have the backing of BNB or the institutional demand of Ethereum, but it surely has a momentum that positions it as one of the best altcoins to buy now, ahead of the altcoin season. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is the Best Crypto to Buy in 2025 If you’re searching for the best crypto to buy in 2025 , MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out for its real utility , verified transparency , and surging community interest. From clear tokenomics to an accountable team , it’s checking every box investors demand in a future billion-dollar altcoin . This is why industry insiders are watching it closely. Final Take Ethereum and Binance Coin continue to show strength backed by big institutions, Sui is carving out its place with real-world utility, and PEPE is proving that meme culture still has a seat at the table. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is stepping in as a newer, more secure option that’s starting to gain traction with investors. So, for investors wondering what are the best altcoins to buy now? This mix of proven giants and up-and-coming tokens could give traders a balanced approach heading into the next altcoin season.

Five opposition parties are actively pushing to reopen a crucial Milei LIBRA investigation into President Javier Milei’s involvement with the memecoin, LIBRA. This move comes amidst claims of substantial financial losses suffered by investors who allegedly acted on the president’s previous promotions. Why is the Milei LIBRA Investigation Being Relaunched? The core of the issue stems from President Milei’s past actions. He had openly promoted the memecoin LIBRA on his X account, drawing considerable attention to the digital asset. However, following a dramatic crash in the token’s price, many investors found themselves in a difficult financial situation. This situation initially triggered an inquiry by Argentina’s Anti-Corruption Office. Interestingly, the task force assigned to this case was later disbanded, leading to questions and concerns among the public and political figures. The opposition now seeks to revive this dormant Milei LIBRA investigation , aiming for greater transparency and accountability. Understanding the Controversy: What is LIBRA Memecoin? Memecoins are a unique and often volatile segment of the cryptocurrency market. They typically gain popularity through social media hype rather than underlying technological innovation or utility. LIBRA, in this context, appears to be one such token. The controversy surrounding the Milei LIBRA investigation highlights the inherent risks associated with these digital assets, especially when public figures endorse them. Investors, drawn by high-profile promotions, often face significant financial exposure if the token’s value plummets. The Role of Presidential Endorsement in Crypto When a head of state promotes a specific cryptocurrency, it carries immense weight and can significantly influence public perception and investment decisions. This raises important ethical and regulatory questions. For instance, is it appropriate for political leaders to endorse speculative assets? What responsibilities do they bear if their endorsements lead to investor losses? These are critical considerations that the renewed Milei LIBRA investigation seeks to address, potentially setting precedents for future engagements between politicians and the crypto space.

They spend months building credibility through presale updates, technical whitepapers, or developer showcases. BlockDAG is taking a different route altogether. By securing a sponsorship deal with Inter Milan, alongside rugby and cricket partnerships, the project is pushing itself into stadiums and TV broadcasts before its mainnet even arrives. This strategy signals more than just brand awareness; it shows that BlockDAG is positioning itself as a household name rather than a niche blockchain. With over $386M raised, 25.5B coins sold, and 200,000 holders already onboard, the scale of early adoption is undeniable. Analysts point out that visibility at this stage is exceptionally rare. For most projects, consumer-facing recognition takes years, but BlockDAG is already embedding itself into popular culture. This unusual move could prove decisive in its bid to attract global retail audiences at a pace most Layer-1s can only dream of. Sports Sponsorship as a Brand Strategy The partnership with Inter Milan, one of Europe’s most storied football clubs, instantly puts BlockDAG in front of millions of fans weekly. Add to that the Seattle Seawolves in rugby and the Seattle Orcas in cricket, and BlockDAG gains exposure across two major U.S. sports markets. These deals push the brand beyond the crypto bubble, into arenas where loyalty, culture, and visibility drive adoption. For comparison, Solana leaned heavily on NFTs before branching into branding, while Avalanche and Aptos focused primarily on developers in their early phases. BlockDAG is skipping that incremental process, moving straight into mainstream sports branding before its listing. This signals a project confident in its trajectory and determined to capture attention outside of crypto-native communities. Visibility in global sports serves a deeper purpose than recognition, it builds trust. Many everyday participants unfamiliar with crypto are more likely to engage when they see familiar names like Inter Milan associated with a project. By aligning itself with these teams, BlockDAG builds legitimacy in the eyes of an audience that traditional crypto marketing often fails to reach. Unlike projects such as Aptos ($350M in VC funding) or Avalanche ($230M raised with institutional backing), BlockDAG has built momentum without leaning on venture capital. Its $600M presale target is being fueled primarily by grassroots participation, making it one of the most decentralized fundraising models of 2025. Sponsorships accelerate this strategy by drawing attention from new demographics, people who may never have heard of a presale but recognize trusted sports institutions. Meanwhile, adoption is being reinforced by accessible participation tools. The X1 Mobile Miner app, with over 2.5M downloads, enables users to mine from their phones, making entry easy. On the hardware side, the X10 miner has sold 19,000 units, appealing to those who want deeper network engagement. This combination ensures BlockDAG converts sports-driven visibility into active participants, bridging brand awareness with practical involvement. This dual-track approach, global recognition plus onboarding tools, is the secret behind BlockDAG’s unusually high adoption figures for a presale project. Most competitors only dream of achieving this blend years after launch. Analysts on the Value of Early Visibility Analysts argue that cultural positioning is just as important as technical infrastructure. Ethereum achieved dominance not only through scalability but by becoming central to DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 branding. Solana experienced rapid growth because of its cultural alignment with NFT projects and strong retail engagement. BlockDAG is adopting a similar playbook but starting far earlier. With 4,500 developers building 300+ dApps on its EVM-compatible system, technical foundations are strong. By pairing that with mainstream sports sponsorships, BlockDAG ensures growth is being seeded both from the developer side and the cultural side. This dual appeal boosts confidence in its presale performance. At $0.03 in batch 30, with a confirmed listing target of $0.05, early participants already have a clear ROI path of 3,025%. Long-term analyst speculation places potential valuations at $1–$10, with cultural branding playing a critical role in accelerating adoption. Visibility in sports expands the reach beyond crypto circles, feeding into stronger demand post-listing. From Presale to Prime Time BlockDAG’s decision to secure sponsorships with Inter Milan and U.S. sports teams before its listing reflects an ambitious strategy: to position itself not as a niche Layer-1 but as a global consumer brand. Combined with its $386M presale, 2.5M mobile miners, and thousands of developers, the project is stepping into exchanges not just with hype, but with recognition already baked in. For most projects, achieving mainstream visibility pre-launch is nearly impossible. BlockDAG has already pulled it off. That kind of momentum doesn’t just make it a project to watch in 2025; it makes it one of the most culturally visible launches in crypto history.

The token is currently priced at $0.3486, reflecting a 19.2% decline from its all-time high of $0.4313 recorded late last year. Over the past week, the market has seen limited upward movement, with TRX trading in a narrow range, suggesting muted buying pressure. On-chain analysts are closely watching TRON’s market dynamics as it approaches a potential inflection point. According to data shared on CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, TRX is exhibiting conditions that mirror earlier phases in its history where heightened optimism preceded corrections. The combination of rising sentiment indicators and technical positioning has sparked debate on whether TRX is preparing for a breakout or facing increased risk of retracement. Related Reading: TRON Defies the Market: Outpaces Ethereum, XRP, and Solana in BTC Pair Performance Market Conditions and On-Chain Metrics CryptoQuant contributor CryptoOnchain explained that TRX is at the edge of a critical zone, with “Extreme Greed” sentiment levels dominating investor behavior. Historically, such phases have led to either price discovery above resistance or sharp pullbacks when momentum fails to sustain. The analyst noted that the gap between TRX’s spot price and its realized price has widened, indicating substantial unrealized gains in the market. This divergence often increases incentives for holders to secure profits, adding to potential selling pressure. The on-chain data further highlights that TRX is approaching its upper value band, an area typically associated with overbought conditions. CryptoOnchain noted: TRX is at a critical juncture: a breakout above the all-time high could lead to further upside, but there is also a real risk of a correction. Traders should proceed with caution. To mitigate risks, strategies such as trailing stop-losses and partial profit-taking were recommended, especially given the heightened levels of speculative optimism. Stablecoin Dominance on the TRON Network While price performance has drawn attention, another significant factor shaping TRON’s trajectory is its growing role in stablecoin settlements. CryptoQuant analyst Burak Kesmeci recently emphasized that stablecoin transfers heavily dominate TRON’s ecosystem in 2025. Data shows: USDT: over 383 million transfers. Wrapped TRX (WTRX): 3 million. PayNet Coin: 1.88 million. USDD: 585,000. This activity shows TRON’s positioning as the leading blockchain for USDT transactions, benefitting from its relatively low fees and high throughput. The passage of the US Genius Act, which reinforced the role of certain blockchains in stablecoin settlements, further boosted TRON’s relevance in global payment flows. The analyst argues that while speculative trading around TRX’s price dominates headlines, its utility-driven demand in stablecoin transfers provides a strong foundation for long-term resilience.

Nasdaq-listed Caliber is the latest to join this trend, having recently announced the formal approval of its new Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) Strategy, which features decentralized oracle provider Chainlink (LINK) at its core. LINK Tokens As Reserve Assets The announcement came from Caliber’s Board of Directors, which outlined its intention to not only purchase LINK tokens but also engage in activities aimed at maximizing returns from these digital assets. With a focus on the token’s long-term appreciation potential, the real state-focused asset manager plans to hold the cryptocurrency as part of its equity portfolio and generate yield through staking, further diversifying its investment strategy. To support the implementation of this digital asset approach, Caliber has established the Caliber Crypto Advisory Board (CCAB). This dedicated advisory group, composed of experts in digital assets and blockchain technology, will provide guidance on the DAT Strategy and Policy.. The DAT Policy itself outlines a framework for the acquisition, custody, and management of digital assets, including specific protocols for security and internal controls. The Board believes that adopting this strategy will not only enhance shareholder value but also strengthen the company’s balance sheet and improve liquidity. By holding LINK as a reserve asset. Additionally, the integration of Chainlink’s technology is expected to streamline key business processes, such as asset valuation and fund administration, further benefiting the company. Chainlink’s Partnership With US Commerce Department Chris Loeffler, Chief Executive Officer of Caliber, emphasized the importance of this strategic move, stating, “We believe that implementing a digital asset treasury strategy strengthens our balance sheet and aligns Caliber with the future of digital finance.” He noted that this initiative positions Caliber at the forefront of innovation in the real estate and investment management sectors, reinforcing its commitment to becoming a “diversified alternative asset manager.” To ensure the responsible execution of this strategy, the asset manager said it has collaborated with a team of experts, including legal advisors from Perkins Coie and Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, as well as its existing audit firm, Deloitte. Caliber’s announcement precedes a significant breakthrough for the Chainlink network, which recently partnered with the US Commerce Department to bring critical macroeconomic data on-chain . NewsBTC reported earlier today that following the disclosure of the partnership, LINK’s price experienced a notable surge, reaching approximately $25, reflecting a 6% increase. As of this writing, the Chainlink’s price has dropped toward $24.86, losing earlier gains to a 1.8% increase now recorded in the 24-hour time frame.

Here’s why",https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-xrp-it-will-take-some-days-but-it-will-pump-hard-heres-why/,"Over recent weeks, XRP price has been consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern, as shown on the four-hour chart shared by the crypto analyst Maxi (@Maxi_Dec2020). The structure is defined by lower highs pressing against a gradually rising support trendline. This type of narrowing formation often signals that a decisive move is approaching, with volatility likely to follow once the price breaks beyond the converging boundaries. The analyst believes XRP will “pump hard once” it breaks above the triangle in a few days. $XRP It will probably take some days, but it will pump hard pic.twitter.com/NEnImdWKnk — Maxi (@Maxi_Dec2020) August 27, 2025 Is a Breakout Coming? The chart indicates that XRP has already tested both the upper and lower bounds of this range multiple times. The most recent retest of the upper trendline happened in July when the asset reached an all-time high , and it tested the lower boundary when it fell below the $3 support level in early August. Each retest has reinforced the strength of these levels, adding weight to the idea that the eventual breakout could be significant. While the current movement remains contained, the reduction in price swings is a common precursor to stronger directional momentum. Technical Indicators and Market Context Supporting the tightening formation on price, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator also displays a similar symmetrical triangle structure . The MACD and signal lines have been following a downtrend while simultaneously narrowing into their own triangle. This alignment between price action and momentum indicators suggests that the market is preparing for a larger move. Although no explicit price targets are displayed on the chart, the setup points toward an imminent breakout scenario. A close above the descending resistance trendline would typically be interpreted as bullish, while a failure to hold the rising support would shift the outlook to the downside.

All Eyes Are On XRP Maxi is confident that the consolidation phase is temporary and that XRP could soon experience a strong upward reaction once the triangle resolves. He expects this to happen in a few days and anticipates a massive pump. As XRP edges closer to the apex of the triangle pattern, pressure continues to build, and market participants will be watching for its next move.

SOL price is now consolidating above $212 and might aim for more gains above the $220 zone. SOL price started a fresh upward move above the $200 and $212 levels against the US Dollar. The price is now trading above $212 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a bullish trend line forming with support at $212 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could extend gains if it clears the $220 resistance zone.

Speaking at BTC Asia in Hong Kong, CZ said moves by public companies to hold bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets — following the example set by MicroStrategy — mark a breakthrough moment. “In the world’s largest economy, 90%-95% of the money is managed by institutions,” he noted. “Until ETFs and treasury companies, those guys couldn’t participate in crypto in a large way.” By bringing crypto exposure to equity markets in the U.S., Hong Kong, Japan and beyond, CZ said the industry is effectively “bringing the equity markets to crypto, or bringing crypto to them — depending how you look at it.” Tokenization Push Beyond bitcoin treasuries and ETFs, Zhao pointed to the surge in tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) as another transformative trend. Stablecoins, treasury bills, commodities, real estate and even personal income streams are being tokenized, funneling “hundreds of millions and billions” into the crypto economy. “We’re going both ways,” CZ said. “Equity markets now have access to crypto, and we’re bringing real-world assets into crypto. This is fantastic.” Risks of Overreach Despite his enthusiasm, CZ warned that not every company pursuing this strategy will succeed. Some firms may use crypto treasuries as a way to “pump up their stock price,” while others lack the expertise to manage complex baskets of digital assets or investments in crypto startups. Failures are inevitable, he said, especially when markets turn. “Right now we’re in a bull market,” Zhao said. “But eventually there will be a winter, there will be a bear market. Treasury companies will have to go through at least one cycle.” MicroStrategy (MSTR), he noted, endured a painful first cycle but benefited later as its average bitcoin cost basis dropped. Stability vs Speculation CZ argued that in the long run, larger inflows of capital from institutional and equity markets should reduce volatility. “Basically, the larger the market cap, the less volatility it has,” he said. “It’s just physics. A bigger ship is more stable.” But he acknowledged that equity markets are full of speculative traders, meaning short-term volatility could increase even as the overall asset class stabilizes over time. Beyond bitcoin While bitcoin remains the centerpiece of most treasury strategies, CZ noted that other tokens are being adopted too — including a recently launched BNB treasury company. For smaller and newer tokens, however, the risks are magnified. “The more mature the ecosystem, the less risk,” Zhao said. “Newer ones may have higher risk and higher returns, but the established ones are safer bets.”re For CZ, the fusion of crypto with traditional markets — through bitcoin treasuries, ETFs and tokenized RWAs — is overwhelmingly positive. Still, he urged caution. “Not every treasury company is going to multiply in value,” he said. “Investors need to evaluate them carefully, understand the risks, and be prepared for cycles.” Read more: Bitcoin Remains Under Pressure as Gold Quietly Targets New Record High",Markets|Binance|Tokenization|Bitcoin ETF|Treasury|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MARKET|BTC|BNB,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-29 05:13:00

The world’s richest Indian businessman, who normally prefers to control narratives from inside his Reliance boardroom, is now being dragged into the messy standoff between Washington and New Delhi over one thing: Russian oil. And also, Putin. Trump’s decision to double tariffs on Indian goods directly targets Reliance’s massive, discounted oil imports from Russia, which have allegedly saved the company hundreds of millions of dollars this year. But here’s the thing: Russian oil isn’t sanctioned, so technically no laws are being broken. Still, the optics are brutal. Buying from Rosneft under a long-term supply deal now looks like a geopolitical gamble, especially since that deal is tied to Reliance’s cutting-edge Jamnagar refining complex. Washington fumes, Delhi deflects, Reliance ducks Now let’s be real, Reliance doesn’t want any part of this. Their refining ops are world-class, and the Jamnagar site can process everything from sweet light crude to the gunk scraped off a pirate ship’s bilge. But the lifeblood of that business is cheap oil. And Russia’s been handing out discounts like it’s a Diwali sale. A 10-year supply pact with Rosneft went live earlier this year, locking in rates well below market. According to Bloomberg’s math here , Reliance saved at least $571 million in the first half of 2025 alone. That’s before you even count shipping or insurance. Yet that savings now has a cost. The U.S. wants India to stop buying Russian barrels and switch to American supply. But ditching Rosneft means breaching a deal, ceding market advantage, and (more importantly) undercutting the Indian government’s position. India never joined Western sanctions. It’s been loud and clear that it will keep buying where the prices work. So Reliance is basically being asked to walk a diplomatic tightrope on stilts. Fun, huh? And while the Trump administration hasn’t named names, they’re never exactly subtle. White House trade advisors have called out India’s richest families for “war profiteering,” again, not naming Mukesh, but come on. His company is the single biggest importer of Russian crude in the country. What more needs to be said? Jio, clean energy, and the quiet oil shuffle At Reliance’s much-hyped investor meeting, you’d think oil would be the hot topic, but according to Bloomberg, Mukesh plans to stay away from that landmine, in that his keynote won’t even mention Russia at all. Instead, the spotlight will be on Jio’s AI innovation. But make no mistake, the company’s transition away from fossil fuels has been a decade in the making. Oil, gas, and chemicals still account for over 50% of Reliance’s revenue, and 40% of its EBITDA. The digital services arm only overtook refining in profitability recently. So, for all the AI and EV chatter, crude oil still pays the bills. That’s why Reliance isn’t throwing away Russian barrels just because the U.S. is angry. The company has always hunted for deals that give it a competitive edge. Back in 2012, they locked in a 15-year deal to buy Venezuelan crude, notoriously heavy and dirty. They ran with it until U.S. sanctions killed the trade. Then came a waiver from Biden. But even that lifeline dried up in May. So, what’s the next move? The company’s been testing new waters. West Africa. Middle East. U.S. Earlier this week, they quietly bought 2 million barrels of American crude, set to load in October. Some say it’s a peace offering. Others call it hedging. Mukesh, true to form, is saying nothing publicly. But his actions speak loud. No flashy statements on oil. Just deals being made in the background while the spotlight shifts to digital and green energy. Internally, the company is focused on buying whatever crude works on the spreadsheet, regardless of where it comes from. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

While these giants battle for positioning, MAGACOIN FINANCE has also entered the conversation, giving early buyers a unique alternative. Ethereum ETF-Driven Climb Toward Market Leadership Ethereum’s climb in 2025 has been anchored by spot ETFs and the vast capital flowing into them. In early June alone, inflows topped $240 million in a single day, with BlackRock’s ETHA capturing most of it. Across multiple providers, cumulative ETF inflows exceeded $1.2 billion in just a matter of weeks, lifting confidence across the market. Momentum has only accelerated. In August, Ethereum ETFs absorbed $2.3 billion in six days, highlighted by ETHA’s purchase of 150,000 ETH. Daily inflows even peaked at $727 million, underscoring investor appetite. Since April, Ethereum’s price has doubled, notching a 40% gain in July and outperforming Bitcoin. Regulatory clarity, supported by frameworks like the GENIUS Act, has strengthened Ethereum’s positioning. Spot ETFs now account for nearly $123.5 billion in trading activity, up by 30–49% over recent months. On-chain fundamentals also remain resilient: $150 billion worth of ETH is staked, with Ethereum controlling 65% of DeFi’s total value locked. Looking ahead, analysts are revising projections. Standard Chartered now targets $7,500 by 2025, citing institutional inflows and DeFi dominance. If regulators approve staking-inclusive ETFs later this year, Ethereum could see its role expand further, combining long-term yields with its already established market scale. Avalanche Riding ETF Speculation and Institutional Inroads Avalanche’s 2025 story has centered on speculation of ETF approval. Its token climbed roughly 15% in July, driven by anticipation of a Grayscale AVAX ETF decision. By August, Bloomberg placed the likelihood of approval at 90% by year-end, inviting comparisons to Bitcoin’s surge after ETF approval. Institutional participation is adding weight to the narrative. BlackRock allocated $240 million to Avalanche projects under its BUIDL fund, while VanEck announced a $100 million RWA fund targeting the AVAX ecosystem. On-chain, Avalanche reached 20 million daily transactions—a 20× increase from 2021—cementing its claim to scalability. Adoption is also expanding through partnerships and technical upgrades. FIFA tapped Avalanche subnets for NFT ticketing, while the Octane upgrade trimmed transaction fees, driving further engagement. Price action has mirrored this activity, with AVAX trading around $24–25 and testing the $27 level. Analysts view $33 to $54 as possible targets if ETF approval arrives before December. Forecasts vary, with some projecting $25 in 2026 while others stretch targets toward the mid-$30s. The ETF decision remains the defining catalyst. If greenlit, Avalanche could gain market share rapidly, but without it, Ethereum’s established ETF-driven dominance keeps it ahead in the Layer 1 race. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Early Access With Audit-Safe Infrastructure Beyond the Layer 1 spotlight, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving out space as an altcoin worth watching. Built on a security-first foundation, the project has already passed audits by CertiK and HashEx, giving buyers confidence in its infrastructure. For a limited window, early participants can unlock a 50% bonus by using the code PATRIOT50X, though availability is capped and prices adjust upward every hour. This time-sensitive offer is why many are moving quickly rather than waiting. With thousands already on board, MAGACOIN FINANCE presents itself as a secure, strategic entry point in today’s altcoin landscape. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is a Top Altcoin to Buy in 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to lead lists of the top altcoins to buy in 2025 because it’s built on verified trust. From its Hashex-audited smart contract to a fully KYC-certified team, every aspect of the project prioritizes investor protection. These foundations make it more than a trend — they establish it as a serious, secure contender for major upside. Conclusion: How to Position in This Market Ethereum leads today with ETF inflows driving adoption, while Avalanche is on the cusp of a breakout pending SEC approval. For those diversifying beyond the major players, MAGACOIN FINANCE provides a timely entry point—with bonuses still live and the price climbing by the hour.

Further, the company stated that it may engage in staking if tax status permits. The proposed product aims to “reflect rewards from staking a portion” of the ETF’s SEI tokens “without undue legal or regulatory risk.” The filing comes at a time when the US regulatory agency is keen on reviewing several altcoin ETF applications . Among other crypto ETF filings, funds tracking the price of XRP have gained momentum, particularly after the token has long been at the center of legal and regulatory debates. The filing has named Coinbase Custody Trust Company as the ETF’s custodian, with Coinbase acting as prime broker. SEC’s Recent Crypto ETF Delays Are Possibly Not Denials Following several delays, the SEC is expected to issue decisions on several pending applications in October, including products tied to Trump Media and Solana (SOL). Altcoin ETF issuers are pressing forward with new amendments, hoping that October deadlines could be a turning point for the crypto ETF landscape. The SEC recently delayed decisions on the approval of Truth Social’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, besides XRP and Litecoin funds. The US watchdog has marked Oct. 8 as its next deadline for both Truth Social’s crypto ETF products.

SEI Token Surges Past 4% – Will it Go Further? Following the 21Shares’ spot SEI ETF filing, the native token rose 4.06% in the past 24 hours. The move signals bullish chart structure after a 60% 90-day gain. Parallelly, SEI’s TVL hit $682 million with DeFi protocols like Dragonswap driving usage. The surge is also attributed to the recent institutional adoption drive. Circle’s IPO filing reveals that by the end of 2024, the company held 6.25 million SEI tokens. The holdings make the most significant token on its balance sheet compared to other crypto. Besides, the state of Wyoming shortlisted SEI for its state-backed stablecoin (WYST) . SEI is seen trading at $0.302 at press time, per CoinMarketCap data . The token’s price trajectory hinges on technical upgrades, institutional adoption, and ecosystem growth.

Meanwhile, Caliber’s shares skyrocketed 162% after the company announced plans to establish a Chainlink-based treasury despite facing a Nasdaq delisting notice for failing to meet equity requirements. IREN Shares Jump on Record Results Bitcoin mining firm IREN delivered its strongest quarter on record after reporting $187.3 million in revenue for the three months ended June 30. The stellar performance helped push its full-year revenue to $501 million, a new company high, while net income swung sharply into positive territory at $176.9 million. The results were released on Thursday, and ignited investor enthusiasm. The company’s shares shot up 3.1% to $23.04 by market close and surged by close to 14% in after-hours trading, according to Google Finance data. IREN’s share price over the past 24 hours (Source: Google Finance ) The impressive turnaround was fueled primarily by rapid growth in IREN’s Bitcoin mining operations, which positioned the firm among the top players in the industry. In July, IREN outpaced rival MARA Holdings in monthly production after mining 728 BTC compared to MARA’s 703 BTC. The company also scaled its installed Bitcoin mining capacity to 50 exahashes per second, though it has since paused further expansion in that area to sharpen its focus on artificial intelligence. Under current mining economics, IREN estimates its annualized revenue potential at $1 billion. IREN’s pivot toward AI has been a key driver of its growth story this year. The company expanded its GPU fleet to 1,900 during the quarter, which is a 132% increase year-on-year, while becoming a “Preferred Partner” to Nvidia, granting it greater access to advanced hardware. Revenue from AI services—primarily renting GPU power for machine learning, training large language models, and supporting enterprise workloads—already reached around $25 million per month. The firm now plans to spend $200 million to scale its GPU count to 10,900 by year-end, targeting $200 million to $250 million in annualized AI revenue by December. Longer term, IREN wants to install 60,000 of Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs at its British Columbia site. IREN’s growth outlook The company’s success is a stark reversal from just a year ago, when short-selling firm Culper Research branded IREN as “wildly overvalued.” It even mocked its AI aspirations as ill-prepared. Shares subsequently tumbled to $5.59 in April before mounting a dramatic 312% rally in the past four months. IREN also recently resolved a long-standing dispute with creditor NYDIG over $105 million in defaulted equipment loans tied to 35,000 Antminer S19s, and reached a confidential settlement that removed a lingering overhang. For now, IREN seems to have silenced its critics. Caliber Jumps With LINK Pivot Meanwhile, shares of real estate asset manager Caliber also soared on Thursday after the Nasdaq-listed company revealed plans to pivot toward a Chainlink-based digital asset treasury, even as it faces the risk of delisting. The firm’s board of directors approved a policy to allocate a portion of its funds toward acquiring LINK tokens. Alongside the move, Caliber also announced the creation of a crypto advisory board to guide its management on digital asset strategy and related initiatives. Investors welcomed the news as Google Finance data showed Caliber’s stock jumping 162% over the past 24 hours, trading at $4.46 at press time. Caliber’s share price over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) The announcement was made just one day after Caliber disclosed that it received a written notice from Nasdaq stating that the company was no longer in compliance with Listing Rule 5550(b)(1), which requires firms to maintain at least $2.5 million in stockholders’ equity. According to its second-quarter SEC filing, Caliber reported a deficit of $17.6 million in stockholders’ equity, placing it at risk of being delisted from the exchange. The company has 45 days to submit a compliance plan, and up to 180 days to address the shortfall if its plan is accepted. Establishing a Chainlink treasury could be a means to raise capital and regain compliance. Caliber delisting notice Caliber’s strategy is part of a wider shift in the corporate treasury space, which was first pioneered by Strategy when it became the first public company to hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset. While early corporate treasuries were largely Bitcoin-focused, a growing number of firms are now experimenting with altcoin allocations. This week alone, Trump Media and Technology Group launched a $6.42 billion Cronos treasury, while Sharps Technology almost doubled in value after unveiling a $400 million Solana treasury. However, not all companies have benefited from the trend. Windtree Therapeutics, which established a BNB treasury last month, lost 77% of its value after Nasdaq confirmed it would be delisted . While the immediate market reaction has been positive for Caliber, the firm’s long-term survival on Nasdaq may hinge on whether this strategy actually generates enough capital to fill its equity deficit.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BUSINESS|MACROECONOMICS|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-29 05:30:00

In the video, Schwartz explained Ripple’s progression toward broader institutional utility. He described the current stage as one where market infrastructure is being built to support major participants and deep liquidity. According to Schwartz, Ripple is working toward an environment where money can move efficiently across borders and between currencies. He noted that this liquidity would provide “easy ways to get money in and out,” making it a settlement system of high value. The Path Ahead for XRP XRP Governor emphasized that, based on Schwartz’s comments, years of patience are about to pay off. Schwartz tied these developments to XRP, stressing that as liquidity increases and cross-border pathways expand , the token will gain value as a settlement asset. By positioning XRP at the center of this framework, Schwartz suggested it could eventually serve as a core mechanism for large-scale transactions.

The Role of Liquidity and Utility Schwartz’s remarks describe liquidity as a determining factor in the next phase of XRP’s adoption. The ability for financial institutions to enter and exit positions quickly is vital for any asset intended for settlement. By emphasizing both cross-currency and cross-border applications, he highlighted areas where XRP’s speed and cost efficiency may address longstanding challenges in global payments. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The discussion also reinforced Ripple’s strategy of building infrastructure that appeals to established players in finance. Schwartz referenced the transition to a stage involving “big players and lots of liquidity,” indicating that widespread institutional participation would be necessary for XRP to achieve its intended function. For the XRP community, Schwartz’s comments add weight to expectations that the token will evolve beyond speculative trading into a utility-driven role . The prospect of becoming the backbone of a high-value settlement system aligns with Ripple’s long-standing narrative of bridging gaps in cross-border finance. While such outcomes depend on adoption by major institutions and the successful integration of the digital asset into global payment systems, the framework described suggests a clear direction that could bring significant growth.

According to Martinez, Solana is testing a critical resistance area again and this time the breakout may be more likely to be sustained. After three failed attempts, Solana broke through the $205-$207 resistance range today, rising to $212. This prompted investors to wonder, “Will this time be different?” Martinez noted that, from a technical perspective, repeated tests of the same resistance level typically weaken the region, but previous attempts above $207 were short-lived. What makes this move different, according to Martinez, is the shift in social sentiment. While previous attempts have seen excessive optimism ahead of local peaks, this time, a cautious tone prevails across the market. Social sentiment is well below the 230 level, and there's no overly enthusiastic buying pressure.

According to the analyst, on-chain data suggests a strong accumulation area below the $207 level. These supports extend from $206 to $165. However, since there is no historically strong resistance above $212, Martinez notes that a volume-supported breakout could bring the $300 target into play. In addition to technical signals, Martinez also highlighted Solana's network upgrades. The Alpenglow consensus upgrade, currently up for vote, will reduce transaction finality from 12 seconds to approximately 150 milliseconds, providing near-instant confirmation for users. This could significantly improve network performance. *This is not investment advice.

Eyes are also on today’s US July Core PCE report, which is one of the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauges. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s batch of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 0.79, meaning that there are more long contracts expiring than shorts, as bullish momentum returns. There is a max pain point of $116,000 where most losses will be made on expiry. Open interest (OI), or the value or number of BTC options contracts yet to expire, is highest at $140,000, which has surged to over $2.8 billion at this strike price on Deribit . There is also around $1.9 billion OI at $120,000 and $130,000 strike prices as the bull speculators load up on contracts, but $110,000 and $95,000 are still popular strike prices for short sellers.

Meanwhile, XRP has gained new momentum after long-awaited regulatory clarity, bringing fresh eyes to its potential. Institutional adoption, ETF filings, and technical upgrades are driving bold forecasts for these tokens. Yet in this scaling battle, a new challenger is turning heads — MAGACOIN FINANCE , backed by a clean HashEx audit and major targets. XRP Price Prediction 2025 — Regulatory Clarity Sets the Stage Few assets have seen such a turnaround story. After Ripple’s settlement with the SEC ended over a decade of uncertainty, XRP finally gained the green light for mainstream adoption. The ruling confirmed XRP sales on exchanges are not securities, sparking a surge in institutional interest. XRP all-time price chart This shift is why XRP price prediction 2025 stands at $5.50 in bullish forecasts. The possibility of spot ETFs being approved later this year could bring $5–8 billion in capital inflows, pushing adoption even further. Combined with real-world usage, such as cross-border payments and even an XRP-branded credit card offering 4% cashback, the token is no longer just about speculation — it’s utility-driven. For investors scanning the best altcoin to buy now , XRP’s clarity and growing payment use cases put it on the shortlist. Avalanche Crypto Price — Layer 1 Blockchain 2025 Bets Institutional adoption has been Avalanche’s biggest weapon. From SkyBridge Capital tokenizing $300 million in hedge fund assets to Wyoming launching the first state-backed stablecoin on its rails, Avalanche is positioning itself as an enterprise hub. This explains the Avalanche crypto price target of $32 by Q4 2025, as institutional capital deepens its footprint. AVAX all-time price chart If its ETF filing gains approval, it would mark the first yield-bearing altcoin ETF thanks to staking features, a huge differentiator against other Layer 1 blockchain 2025 rivals. Technical improvements like the Octane upgrade cutting transaction fees by 96% also keep AVAX competitive. For investors eyeing top altcoins for 2025 , Avalanche checks both adoption and infrastructure boxes. Polygon MATIC Price Prediction — Sidechain Crypto Projects Push Ahead Polygon continues to thrive as one of the most successful sidechain crypto projects . This move consolidates staking, governance, and gas fees under one banner, streamlining the ecosystem. Analysts see Polygon MATIC price prediction hitting $1.57 in 2025 , supported by DeFi inflows and upgrades like Heimdall v2, which cut transaction finality from 90 seconds to just 4–6 seconds.

Key Takeaways: Luxxfolio filed to raise up to $73 million as it deepens its Litecoin treasury strategy. The company aims to acquire 1 million LTC by 2026, with Charlie Lee now on its advisory board. Despite ambitions, Luxxfolio faces mounting losses and warned of survival risks without new funding. The filing, submitted Thursday with Canadian regulators (excluding Québec), will allow Luxxfolio to issue a mix of securities, including shares, debt, and warrants, over a 25-month window. Luxxfolio CEO Says Capital Raise Will Boost Flexibility and Litecoin Expansion CEO Tomek Antoniak said the move gives the company “financial flexibility” to scale operations and accelerate Litecoin adoption. “In our sector, scale is critical — the larger our treasury, infrastructure, and ecosystem footprint, the greater our ability to capture market share,” Antoniak said in the company’s announcement. The fundraising plan comes just months after Luxxfolio became the first publicly traded company to formally anchor its corporate treasury in Litecoin. The firm began disclosing its Litecoin purchases in July and has outlined an ambitious goal of acquiring 1 million LTC by 2026. Litecoin creator Charlie Lee joined the company’s advisory board in June, further cementing its alignment with the 12-year-old blockchain network. Luxxfolio has filed a preliminary short form base shelf prospectus. Once finalized, it could allow us to raise up to CAD $100M over 25 months for future growth. No securities are being issued at this time.

In its most recent quarterly report, the company posted a Q2 net loss of $197,000, up from just $8,000 a year earlier. Over the nine-month period ending that quarter, losses more than doubled year-over-year. With only $112,000 in cash on hand as of the quarter’s end, the company relied on an $844,000 private placement to remain operational. Since its founding in 2017, Luxxfolio has accumulated nearly $19 million in total losses. Its management has already flagged “significant doubt” about the company’s ability to continue without securing new capital. The shelf prospectus, once finalized, is intended to give the company room to raise capital quickly as market conditions shift, and as it attempts to grow its Litecoin infrastructure footprint despite mounting financial pressure. Galaxy, Jump, and Multicoin Plan $1B Solana Treasury Bet As reported, Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto, and Multicoin Capital are in talks to raise around $1 billion to build the largest Solana treasury to date. Bloomberg reported that Cantor Fitzgerald has been tapped as the lead banker, with the Solana Foundation backing the deal, which could close in early September. The plan involves taking over a publicly traded company and converting it into a digital asset treasury vehicle dedicated to Solana. Likewise, Pantera Capital is preparing to raise as much as $1.25 billion to transform a Nasdaq-listed company into “Solana Co.,” a public vehicle built to accumulate Solana (SOL) as a treasury asset The plan reportedly involves an initial $500 million raise, followed by $750 million through warrants. If completed, it would mark one of the largest dedicated efforts to create a public Solana treasury vehicle. The move follows Pantera’s disclosure earlier this month that it has already deployed about $300 million into digital asset treasury (DAT) firms.

This trend involves companies integrating digital assets, such as Bitcoin, into their balance sheets. While this growing adoption is a positive sign for the crypto market’s maturity, a crucial warning from Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) urges caution. Speaking at the BitcoinAsia event in Hong Kong, Zhao highlighted both the immense potential and the inherent dangers of these innovative strategies. Understanding the Rise of Corporate Crypto Treasuries What exactly are corporate crypto treasuries ? Simply put, these are strategies where traditional companies allocate a portion of their treasury reserves into cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin being a popular choice. This strategic move offers several key advantages. For traditional stock market investors, it provides an indirect way to gain exposure to the rapidly expanding digital asset space without needing to purchase cryptocurrencies directly. Moreover, this institutional embrace plays a vital role in the broader adoption and legitimization of crypto and Bitcoin. When established corporations begin to hold digital assets, it sends a powerful signal to the wider financial community. This encourages more mainstream acceptance and investment, reflecting a growing confidence in the long-term viability and value proposition of cryptocurrencies. What Are the Risks of Corporate Crypto Treasuries? Despite these undeniable benefits, Zhao’s warning serves as a critical reminder of the crypto market’s inherent volatility. He specifically cautioned that if the market enters a downturn, companies holding significant crypto assets could experience a simultaneous drop in their stock prices and the value of their digital holdings. This ‘double whammy’ effect has the potential to amplify losses for investors. Consider a scenario where a company’s core business performance is already facing challenges. If its corporate crypto treasuries also decline sharply in value, the combined impact on its financial health and stock performance could be severe. Therefore, investors in such companies must remain vigilant, carefully monitoring both market volatility and the structural risks associated with these new treasury strategies. Navigating Volatility: Actionable Insights for Investors So, how can investors effectively navigate this evolving landscape? Zhao’s advice emphasizes the need for a diligent and informed approach. It is not enough to simply invest in companies that have adopted corporate crypto treasuries ; understanding their specific exposure and risk management practices is paramount. Here are some actionable insights: Assess Exposure: Research the percentage of a company’s treasury allocated to crypto. A higher percentage might indicate greater risk. Examine Risk Management: Look for companies with clear policies on managing their digital asset holdings, including diversification strategies or hedging mechanisms. Monitor Market Trends: Stay informed about both the traditional stock market and the cryptocurrency market. Pay attention to macroeconomic factors that could impact both. Understand Correlation: Recognize that during periods of market stress, correlations between traditional assets and crypto assets can increase, leading to synchronized declines. Being informed and proactive can help investors make more sound decisions when considering companies with digital asset exposure. The Future of Corporate Crypto Treasuries: A Balanced Perspective The integration of corporate crypto treasuries into mainstream finance is undoubtedly a landmark development. It signifies a maturation of the crypto space and opens new avenues for investment and growth. However, as Changpeng Zhao wisely points out, innovation always comes with its own set of challenges and risks. The key lies in maintaining a balanced perspective: embracing the potential while meticulously preparing for the pitfalls. For companies, this means developing robust risk frameworks and transparent reporting. For investors, it means conducting thorough due diligence and maintaining a keen awareness of market dynamics. Ultimately, the successful evolution of corporate crypto adoption will depend on a collective commitment to transparency, prudent management, and continuous education. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are corporate crypto treasuries? A: Corporate crypto treasuries involve companies allocating a portion of their cash reserves or balance sheets into cryptocurrencies, typically Bitcoin, as part of their treasury management strategy. Q2: Why are companies adopting crypto treasury strategies? A: Companies adopt these strategies to gain exposure to potential growth in digital assets, provide indirect crypto exposure to traditional investors, and signal innovation, which can aid in broader crypto adoption. Q3: What is Changpeng Zhao’s main warning about corporate crypto treasuries? A: CZ warned that in a market downturn, the stock prices of companies with crypto treasuries could fall simultaneously with the value of their crypto assets, amplifying losses for investors. Q4: How can investors mitigate risks when investing in companies with crypto treasuries? A: Investors should assess a company’s crypto exposure, examine its risk management policies, monitor both traditional and crypto market trends, and understand potential correlations during market stress. Q5: Are there any benefits to corporate crypto treasuries for the broader market? A: Yes, corporate adoption lends legitimacy to the crypto space, encourages institutional investment, and facilitates broader mainstream acceptance and understanding of digital assets.

With the U.S. SEC’s final deadlines approaching in October, optimism is building that approval could unlock historic inflows. Analysts like Kwok even argue that regulated XRP ETFs could attract more capital than Bitcoin or Ethereum products, citing XRP’s massive global holder base and consistent dominance in exchange volumes. At the same time, some investors are diversifying into Remittix (RTX) , a PayFi altcoin dubbed “XRP 2.0,” which has raised over $21 million while preparing for major exchange milestones. XRP ETFs Could Change the Game Currently, the XRP Price hovers above $3 with short-term support intact. A breakout could be triggered by SEC approval of XRP ETFs, which Polymarket odds peg at 84% by year-end. If granted, the product could rival Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in size. With whales already accumulating, traders expect the XRP Price to retest its July high at $3.60 and possibly enter new price discovery zones if institutional flows surge. The XRP Price outlook is tied closely to the ETF narrative. XRP already ranks as one of the most heavily traded tokens worldwide, with a daily trading volume of $6.6 billion, the majority of which comes from centralized exchanges. On CME, XRP futures hit $1 billion in open interest just three months after launch, underscoring growing institutional appetite. If spot ETFs follow, experts say the XRP Price could rally beyond current levels as regulated inflows create fresh demand. Why Remittix Is Being Dubbed XRP 2.0 While ETF speculation drives XRP, attention is shifting toward Remittix , a PayFi altcoin now dubbed “XRP 2.0” by early backers. Priced at $0.0987, the token has already raised over $21.8 million with more than 625 million tokens sold. A confirmed BitMart listing and a second exchange reveal planned at the $22 million milestone provide liquidity milestones. Meanwhile, its Q3 2025 wallet beta aims to connect over 40 cryptocurrencies with more than 30 fiat currencies, routing crypto directly to bank accounts in over 30 countries. Why Traders Call It XRP 2.0 Real-world remittance focus, solving a $19T global payments problem Flat fees and real-time FX quotes for predictable transactions Merchant-focused Remittix Pay API for business adoption Exchange listings set to boost liquidity and visibility Deflationary model supporting long-term token value Remittix Has 50x ROI In Store: Get In Now The XRP Price recovery above $3 sets the stage for an ETF-driven breakout if regulators approve products later this year. However, as the institutional appeal of XRP becomes stronger, whale capital is pouring into Remittix , which top ICO analysts are calling XRP 2.0 and is set for over 50x returns to early adopters. With XRP riding regulatory catalysts and Remittix targeting adoption milestones, investors now see two parallel paths that could deliver outsized gains before the end of 2025.

Bitcoin Users Will Have Native Access To USDT Via RGB Protocol As revealed by Tether in a website announcement , its stablecoin USDT will be coming to the RGB protocol. RGB allows users to create, send, and manage smart contracts directly on the BTC blockchain. The protocol launched on the BTC mainnet in July with its 0.11.1 release. Thanks to this release, stablecoins, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and community tokens are all now possible natively on the BTC network, just like on Ethereum and other newer blockchains. Something to note is that RGB isn’t a network layer on top of Bitcoin. Rather, it makes use of only client-side validation to confirm transactions. “RGB operates with no trusted third parties, no federations, no validators, and no coordinators,” said RGB Hub in the 0.11.1 launch announcement. USDT is the largest stablecoin in the cryptocurrency sector, circulating on a slew of networks, and with Tether’s latest move, the token would finally become accessible to users of the original digital asset, Bitcoin. Tether noted in the press release: This announcement underscores Tether’s leadership in expanding the reach of stablecoins and its commitment to ensuring Bitcoin remains not only the original cryptocurrency but also the bedrock for global, everyday money. So far, the stablecoin issuer hasn’t confirmed any date, but once launched, users will be able to hold and transfer both BTC and USDT directly from the same wallet. Paolo Ardoino, Tether CEO, said: Bitcoin deserves a stablecoin that feels truly native, lightweight, private, and scalable. With RGB, USD₮ gains a powerful new pathway on Bitcoin, reinforcing our belief in Bitcoin as the foundation of a freer financial future. In some other news, the Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen their largest drawdown from the all-time high (ATH) since April, as CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has pointed out in an X post . As displayed in the above chart, the spot ETFs currently have their holdings around $813.9 million down since the peak. These latest outflows have occurred alongside BTC’s price decline. Another thing that has come with the drawdown in the cryptocurrency is a surge in long liquidations. As quant Frank has noted in an X post , long liquidations recently hit their highest level of dominance in four years. The last time that long liquidations were this dominant was in May 2021. Back then, bulls were flushed by a massive crash in the Bitcoin price that put the bull run on pause for a few months. BTC Price Bitcoin has slowly been climbing up since its low earlier in the week as its price has now reached the $112,400 mark.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin RGB|btc|BTCUSDT|Tether|USDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|USDT|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-29 06:00:09

Solana Is Now Observing 5.8 Bullish Comments For Every Bearish Post In a new post on X, analytics firm Santiment has discussed about the latest trend in the Positive/Negative Sentiment for Solana. This indicator tells us about how the bullish and bearish comments related to SOL currently compare on the major social media platforms. The metric uses a machine-learning model to judge whether a given post/thread/message is positive or negative. Once it has separated the texts into the two categories, it counts them up and finds their ratio. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Over? CryptoQuant’s Bull Score Index Turns Bearish Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Solana Positive/Negative Sentiment over the last couple of months: As displayed in the above graph, the Solana Positive/Negative Sentiment has witnessed a sharp increase recently, indicating that positive comments related to the cryptocurrency have ramped up. Currently, there are 5.8 positive posts appearing for every negative post. This is the highest that the ratio’s value has been since June 11th, more than two months ago. The rise in bullish sentiment is a result of the 16% price surge that SOL has enjoyed over the past week. While some excitement after rallies is normal, an excess of it can be something to watch out for. This is because digital assets have historically tended to move in a way that goes contrary to the expectations of the majority. This means that a large amount of hype among social media users can lead to tops. Similarly, widespread fear can facilitate the formation of a bottom. With the Positive/Negative Sentiment sitting on an 11-week high, it now remains to be seen whether trader FOMO would become an obstacle in the Solana rally. In some other news, Santiment has shared an update on how projects on the SOL blockchain currently rank up against each other in terms of the Development Activity. The “Development Activity” refers to a metric that measures, as its name suggests, the total amount of work that the developers of a given cryptocurrency project are putting in on its public GitHub repositories. Related Reading: Bitcoin & Ethereum Whale Populations Quietly Growing, On-Chain Data Reveals Below is a table that shows the 30-day value of the metric for the top projects in the SOL ecosystem.

Wormhole (W) and Drift (DRIFT) are the next best projects with metric values of 41.47 and 31.9, respectively.

Despite efforts to sustain traction, selling pressure and reduced speculative hype have weighed heavily on its price. Chainlink holders too have seen limited upside recently, leaving many searching for higher-growth opportunities. This shift has opened the door for PayFi-focused projects like Remittix (RTX), which offers a very different value proposition compared to meme-style or oracle-driven tokens. Where Pi coin relies on mass community participation and LINK focuses on smart contract infrastructure, RTX directly addresses cross-border payments with measurable real-world adoption potential. Comparing Remittix’s Narrative To Pi and Chainlink: Clear Difference In Utility And Adoption While Pi coin has community strength, its price struggles show the difficulty of sustaining long-term value without robust use cases. Chainlink remains essential for smart contract infrastructure but may lack the exponential upside that early investors now demand. Source: TradingView Remittix fills that gap, combining real-world adoption with early-stage investment potential. It offers the kind of high-growth opportunity that LINK once represented in its infancy, but with a clearer payments utility. This mix of utility and speculative upside explains why experts are tipping RTX as the best crypto presale 2025 . Why Remittix is the Best Crypto Presale of the Year Remittix (RTX) is currently priced at $0.0987 and has already raised more than $21.9 million, selling over 625 million tokens. Unlike Pi coin’s speculative narrative, Remittix is targeting the $19 trillion remittance industry with a wallet set to launch in Q3 2025, enabling crypto-to-bank transfers in over 30 countries. Analysts expect gains of 7,500% to 8,000% if adoption accelerates. Its deflationary tokenomics, burning 10% of transaction fees, coupled with a confirmed BitMart listing provide a structural advantage over both Pi and Chainlink. Holders frustrated with stagnant performance are increasingly moving capital into RTX as the next 100x crypto. Beta wallet with 40+ crypto and 30+ fiat pairs Transaction fees under 1%, far below traditional remittance costs Exchange listings already secured, expanding global reach Deflationary design driving long-term scarcity Strong traction with freelancers and small businesses This Could Be the Presale That Changes Everything: Remittix is not just another hype-driven project but a payments-first crypto positioned as one of the best DeFi projects 2025. Remittix Is The Top Altcoin To Buy Now With Pi coin sitting at $0.34 and Chainlink showing modest movement, smart investors are eyeing Remittix’s path toward potential 8,000% returns. Its cross-border payment focus, upcoming wallet launch, and growing liquidity make it stand out as both a utility token and a speculative play.

According to the data he shared, the transfer originated from an unknown wallet and was sent to Coinbase. At the time of the transfer, the amount was valued at $91.4 million. While large transactions from whales on the blockchain are not unusual, the context of this movement caught attention due to its timing and the scale involved. Xaif described it as a “suspense move” and questioned whether it represented a sell-off or a strategic play. Such a transfer into Coinbase, one of the largest crypto exchanges, often leads to speculation about whether the purpose is immediate liquidation or positioning for a future strategy.

At the same time, such moves can also reflect internal exchange operations or preparation for institutional trades. The transparency of the XRPL means that transactions of this scale are visible in real time. However, with no identifying information tied to the sending wallet, the motive remains unclear. What stands out is the size of the transfer, which places it among recent whale sell-offs , suggesting that these large investors may be reassessing their positions or anticipate a short-term bearish move. Community Observations Community members responded with varying perspectives, ranging from cautious interpretation to outright suspicion. X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull), a prominent crypto figure, suggested that the transfer could be routine, but left open the possibility that something is brewing behind the scenes. Another response viewed it as consistent with prior large movements, stating it appeared “just like the rest.” Not all reactions were neutral. Some participants considered the move potentially suspicious and emphasized the importance of monitoring it closely. Others pointed to the most straightforward explanation, asking why such a transfer would occur unless the purpose was part of a sell-off.

Whether the $91.4 million transfer signals downside for XRP depends on how the funds are used. Large inflows to exchanges can indicate that selling may follow, which often pressures the price in the short term . However, without confirmation of the sender’s intent, it cannot be assumed that the move reflects an imminent sell-off. Subsequent activity will ultimately determine whether this transaction contributes to a decline or remains a neutral event.

According to the company's report, the price of Bitcoin could reach $1.3 million by 2035. Bitwise bases this prediction on three key factors: Increased institutional demand: It is stated that Bitcoin will increasingly become an institutional investment vehicle, resulting in continuous net inflows. The need for protection against inflation: It is argued that the demand for “hard assets”, especially from institutional investors, will bring Bitcoin to the forefront. Limited supply: The fact that Bitcoin's new supply is extremely limited and inelastic is seen as the most important factor supporting the price in the long term. Related News: Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Gives Date for Potential Deadly Threat Facing Cryptocurrencies Bitwise notes that Bitcoin's compound annual return over the next decade could reach 28.3%, but that significant volatility will likely follow. However, the company predicts that these fluctuations will remain below historical averages. The report states that Bitcoin will maintain its low correlation with stocks, bonds, and other major asset classes, making the “four-year cycle” approach obsolete. However, potential regulatory and legislative risks, political uncertainty, and Bitcoin's relatively new nature are cited as the biggest threats. Bitwise states that technological risks (e.g., those arising from quantum computing) are less likely, but should not be ignored. The company describes Bitcoin's transformation from “zero to a $2.4 trillion asset” in 16 years as the most critical threshold and describes the upcoming period as “the transition process from 1 to 100,” in the words of Peter Thiel. *This is not investment advice.
