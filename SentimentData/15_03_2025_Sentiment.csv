With a 10% increase from January, the total supply now stands at almost $205 billion. The spike, according to data from Glassnode, comes after a dip in late 2024, when the supply of stablecoins fell from $187 billion to $185 billion. Related Reading: Bitcoin And S&P Decline Together, But Data Predicts A Turnaround Stablecoins See A Strong Rebound For trading cryptocurrencies, stablecoins—like USDT and USDC—often act as a reserve for investors expecting the right time to buy assets like Bitcoin. The most recent rise shows that investor interest has surged, especially in view of last year’s slow down. Since Jan 1, the aggregate #stablecoin supply has increased by $20.17B (+10.9%), now reaching more than $205B. For comparison, the December peak clocked in at $187B but the supply actually contracted in the last two weeks of 2024 and dropped to $185B by January 2025. pic.twitter.com/gQbdMEDisb — glassnode (@glassnode) March 13, 2025 Given the previous fall, this comeback is especially notable. For most of 2024 the market has been losing stablecoins; but, this trend has lately reversed. Although past patterns suggest that Bitcoin’s price may be impacted, it is unknown whether this increase will lead to a rise in purchases of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin Investors Watching Closely A growing stablecoin supply is often seen as a bullish sign for Bitcoin. Historically, the price of Bitcoin has risen in line with the stablecoin count. The reasoning is simple: more stablecoins mean more potential capital just waiting to be entered into the market. Some analysts believe this fresh injection could push Bitcoin higher. However, not all stablecoins are used for trading. Many are held for remittances, payments, or as a hedge against inflation, especially in countries where local currencies are unstable. As of today, the market cap of cryptocurrencies stood at $2.65 trillion. Chart: TradingView Stablecoin Exchange Holdings Drop 21% While the total supply is rising, only 21% of stablecoins are currently sitting on exchanges. This is a significant drop from 2021, when over 50% of the supply was available for immediate trading, Glassnode disclosed. This shift suggests that while new coins are being issued, they are not all being deployed into crypto markets right away. Related Reading: TRUMP Token Takedown—Did Insiders Plan The Crash? This could point to one of two possibilities: either stablecoins are being used more often outside of exchanges or investors are still waiting for the suitable moment. Should the latter prove right, the impact on Bitcoin could be less notable than expected. What This Means For Bitcoin’s Future The stablecoin market is currently experiencing a resurgence, which is generally a favorable development for the cryptocurrency sector. However, it is uncertain whether this will result in a short-term increase in the price of Bitcoin. Stablecoin utilization has fluctuated, and additional economic variables will contribute to this development. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at 82,264, down 1.1% and 6.9% in the daily and weekly frames.

The one exception is the category of analytics tokens, which is thriving in Q1. Most narrative tokens are down in 2025, driven by the overall stagnation of the altcoin market. Investors have lost their taste for risk, and for assets that may go down to zero, with no fundamental value. Most narratives, which peaked in late 2024, are now back to negative performance. The only exception is the class of analytics tokens, tied to data platforms or AI analytics tools. As the crypto market grows more complex, data and patterns are key to discovering the next viable trade or investment. This allowed analytics tokens to rally as the next possible type of project with real utility. Analytics tokens are the best-performing narrative in 2025. | Source: DeFi Llama According to DeFiLlama, analytics tokens have expanded by over 162% in the year to date, at one point reaching a high of 659% growth. Analytics is a relatively new category, which appeared after the proliferation of millions of new assets and thousands of trading pairs. The rise of a narrative does not mean a rally or liquidity for all tokens. The DeFiLlama narrative average covers a total of 84 analytics tokens, but the bulk of growth comes from the top projects. As with other categories of altcoins, traders remain selective and move into the most liquid assets with the potential of preserving their earnings. SQD was the leading analytics token with rapid growth, trending after its recent launch. SQD is trading at $0.08, still in early price discovery, rising by over 39% in the past 24 hours. DataBot is up over 21% on the day, trading at $0.0008. DATA is a relatively older token, trending now in one of its regular rallies. The third best performer is SoSoValue (SOSO), which recently bounced from its lows at $0.058. Analytics tokens can also outperform the market briefly, if some of the smaller niche assets have outsized rallies. Analytics sector expands with new token launches Analytics tokens combine data platform assets with projects that combine AI agents and on-chain data. Currently, the whole category is valued at over $2.3B, growing by 5.4% in the past 24 hours. Not all analytics tokens were noticed in the past few months. The sector became visible after some of the leading social media analytics accounts also launched tokens. The current leaders for the sector are KAITO and the native token of Bubblemaps, BMT. Both assets are still in their early stages following a recent airdrop. KAITO remains pressured by selling, but BMT was among the day’s top gainers. BMT expanded by over 30% in the past 24 hours to trade at $0.11. The analytics sector is also notable for setting expectations for additional airdrops. Some of the leading tools for on-chain analytics are closely watched for launching their own token. After Arkham, Kaito and Bubblemaps performed their airdrops, others are expected to follow. Analytics platforms offer a real user base and utility in navigating the thousands of tokens with both centralized and decentralized trading. The analytics space also includes The Graph (GRT), a token with years of history in previous bull markets. CookieDAO and ChainGPT are among the trending assets. Most of the analytics tools are pointed toward on-chain data, DEX activity and automated analysis. The analytics narrative thus combines tokens from other categories, carrying rebranded AI agents as well. Analytics tools are becoming more sophisticated, including on-chain data on whale wallets and trading activity. Other tools seek alpha in chats and social media content, sifting through trends too complex to discover and analyze for a human trader. As with other hot sectors, the success of several analytics tokens can lead to the creation of multiple copycat projects. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

A snippet of the S-1 filing was shared on social media on March 14 by Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, who has been closely monitoring developments in the crypto ETF industry. Source: James Seyffart The proposed VanEck Avalanche ETF intends to “reflect the performance of the price of “AVAX,” the native token of the Avalanche network, less the expenses of the Trust’s operations,” the prospectus read. The proposed fund will hold AVAX and will “value its Shares daily based on the reported MarketVector Avalanche Benchmark Rate,” the prospectus said. As Seyffart noted in a follow-up post, the Trust’s registration “was shared widely earlier this week, But this is the first actual filing with the SEC.” Avalanche is the 16th largest crypto asset, with a total market capitalization of $7.7 billion. The blockchain is notable for its high throughput and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility. Related: US Bitcoin ETFs break outflow streak with $13.3M inflow ETF race heats up The overwhelming success of the US spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) exchange-traded funds and the election of a pro-crypto administration in Washington have triggered an influx of crypto fund applications at the SEC. As Cointelegraph recently reported , nine issuers have filed for an XRP ( XRP ) ETF, with Franklin Templeton joining the race on March 11. Issuers are also vying to list ETFs linked to Solana ( SOL ), Litecoin ( LTC ) and Dogecoin ( DOGE ). Although the SEC has punted its decision on these offerings, opting to designate a longer period for review, Seyffart and fellow Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchinas say there are “relatively high odds of approval” later this year. A January report by JPMorgan said the approval of altcoin ETFs will likely trigger billions of dollars in inflows, underscoring the pent-up demand for cryptocurrencies. In particular, SOL and XRP products could attract the most institutional interest. Assuming modest adoption rates, SOL and XRP ETFs could attract billions in their first 12 months. Source: JPMorgan “When applying these so-called “adoption rates” to SOL and XRP, we see SOL attracting roughly $3 billion-$6 billion of net assets and XRP gathering $4 billion-$8 billion in net new assets,” the report said.

On March 14, the anonymous whale, referred to on X as “ETH 50x Big Guy,” took out long positions in LINK worth approximately $31 million with 10 times leverage, according to Lookonchain, a Web3 analytics service. He placed the bets on Hyplerliquid and GMX, two popular perpetuals exchanges, Lookonchain said in a March 14 X post. Additionally, the whale accumulated roughly $12 million in spot LINK. In the ensuing hours, the whale gradually reduced his LINK holdings through small swaps back into stablecoins, as per onchain data . Source: Lookonchain Related: Hyperliquid ups margin requirements after $4 million liquidation loss Massive trading gains On March 12, the unidentified trader intentionally liquidated a roughly $200 million ETH long position, causing Hyperliquid’s liquidity pool, HLP, to lose $4 million . The trader’s profits topped roughly $1.8 million. According to Lookonchain, the trader has earned nearly $17 million in the past month on Hyperliquid. The incident highlighted the challenges facing perpetual trading platforms such as Hyperliquid, which enable traders to take long or short positions many times larger than their deposited capital. Hyperliquid said the trader’s actions did not qualify as an exploit and were instead a predictable consequence of the mechanics of its trading platform under extreme conditions. In response to the losses, Hyperliquid announced on March 13 revised collateral rules for traders with open positions to guard against similar edge cases in the future. Launched in 2024, Hyperliquid’s flagship perpetuals exchange has captured 70% of the market share, surpassing rivals such as GMX and dYdX, according to a January report by asset manager VanEck. Chainlink, the most popular decentralized oracle service, saw the price of its native LINK token increase by more than 150% in the weeks after President Donald Trump prevailed in the US election. It has since given up much of those gains, declining from highs of nearly $30 per token in December to less than $14 as of March 14, according to data from CoinGecko. Chainlink’s market capitalization is currently around $8.7 billion.

Solayer ( LAYER ) is a blockchain network designed for high throughput and near-zero latency. The network bills itself as “infinitely scalable” and is designed to handle 1 million transactions per second (TPS). Explains the project, “Solayer is a protocol for developers who want to enhance their decentralize application’s performance on Solana. It aims to increase the reliability of network access while reducing associated costs by up to 50x.” Solayer’s new native token, LAYER, is trading at $1.21 at time of writing, up from $0.857 one week ago. The 216th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is also up more than 18% in the past 24 hours alone. LAYER launched in February. That same month, the Singapore-based crypto exchange Bitget and the Seychelles-based exchange MEXC both rolled out trading services for the asset. Earlier this month, the San Francisco-based exchange Kraken listed LAYER, and this week the Hong Kong-based HashKey Global also made the token available for traders. Despite LAYER’s gains this week, the asset remains more than 14% down from its all-time high of $1.41, which it set shortly after launching last month, according to data from CoinGecko .

Will the Uptrend Continue?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/why-has-bitcoin-rebounded-will-the-uptrend-continue/,"Bitcoin has surged over 4% in the past 24 hours, reaching above $84,000, according to cryptocurrency data provider CoinGecko. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap briefly touched $85,000 earlier in the day before pulling back. The rally coincided with a broader recovery in risk assets as markets responded positively to signs of macroeconomic stability and the apparent success of the U.S. government in averting a shutdown. Bitcoin’s rise reflects renewed confidence in financial markets, according to Strahinja Savic, head of data analysis at crypto consultancy FRNT Financial. “Some renewed macro stability suggests that Bitcoin and crypto are recovering alongside other risk assets,” Savic said in a Telegram message. “Lower-than-expected inflation figures and the perception that geopolitical risks are easing are contributing to easing macro concerns and providing a tailwind for Bitcoin.” He also noted that some Bitcoin investors are fueling the recovery by taking the opportunity to “buy the dip.” Related News: Is the Recovery in Solana (SOL) Permanent or Could Further Declines Be Coming? Analytics Firm Reveals Critical Points Bitcoin’s gains came after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer expressed support for a Republican measure to fund the government. A government shutdown could add further uncertainty to markets already grappling with concerns about stagflation, an economic scenario in which growth slows while inflation remains high. Risk assets have been under pressure for weeks due to trade war fears sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on major trading partners. Additional macroeconomic concerns, including the government's controversial cost-cutting measures, have also weighed on investor sentiment. The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index fell to its lowest level since 2022, signaling declining confidence in the U.S. economy. The survey also found that inflation expectations rose to their highest level in more than two years. Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto asset manager BitBull Capital, said the data is driving investors to Bitcoin as a hedge against economic uncertainty. He also noted that institutional confidence remains strong, with BlackRock resuming its Bitcoin purchases and making a $25 million investment. Despite the current bullish momentum, DiPasquale warned that volatility remains a concern and warned of potential significant corrections ahead. *This is not an investment recommendation.

The cryptocurrency market presents two enticing opportunities through ADA and XRP and MUTM stands out due to its high demand during the presale phase. Analysts have set out projections for ADA to reach $2 and XRP to achieve $10 and MUTM to surpass $5 while indicating that these tokens represent core investments for people desiring high return potential. Cardano (ADA) Nears Critical Development Milestones Organizational capital has started to gravitate toward Cardano due to the systematic development of its blockchain infrastructure which focuses on scalability improvements along with energy efficiency measures. ADA surpasses its former role as a speculative instrument because decentralized applications are spreading rapidly into finance and digital identity markets. Market experts predict ADA token value will extend to $2 in late 2025 provided the market shows expansion paths which parallel its growth trajectory. The long-term stability of Cardano receives increased validation from institutional stakeholders because of its compliance-oriented framework. Despite price swings ADA continues to demonstrate its capability as a solid asset in the pursuit of elevated market valuations because of its research-based value additions. Ripple (XRP) Navigates Resistance Amid Bullish Forecast The current resistance level of $2.10 hinders XRP price growth yet experts have positive expectations that it may rise to $10. Crypto strategist ElmoX has identified an important point where XRP could move to $1.20 before a potential parabolic rise requires breaking through $2.90. The market shows signs that regulatory explanations and enhanced inter-banking payment usage will together serve as motivational factors. The token shows fundamental strength through its successful rebound from important support points despite recent price drops. Bullish market activity that picks up speed following a correction may create conditions for XRP to replicate its previous upward patterns in moving past $10 while institutions and retail investors build their similar interests. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Momentum Sparks Frenzy Mutuum Finance (MUTM) establishes itself as a prominent decentralized finance project because its Phase 3 presale heads toward a complete sell-out. 5,500 investors purchased MUTM tokens which resulted in $3.2 million worth of investment while expanding the tokenholder base to 5,500. The price rise in Phase 4 to $0.025 will provide immediate profits of 25% to existing participants. The Tokenomics system presents a mathematical expansion blueprint where Phase 3 investors can expect 200% growth through a $0.06 listing price but the added $5 prediction represents an enormous 24,900% potential return. The lending model of Mutuum Finance that uses mtTokens for interest accrual together with its buy-and-distribute mechanism establishes ongoing demand for MUTM. The presale opportunities enable the first users to lock in positions that become more valuable when mainstream exchange listings bring greater market exposure. The fast growth of Phase 3 investments accelerates the time before the MUTM token at its current price of $0.02 will become unavailable. The price movements of Cardano alongside Ripple experience market complexities but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides investors with a current advantageous presale situation. The well-planned tokenomics system and practical DeFi uses make MUTM stand apart from many speculative protocols thus enabling it to deliver substantial value fluctuation. The upcoming MUTM presale stages present a scarce occasion for purchasing tokens ahead of market demand intensification during the future. Act Now Before Phase 3 Concludes Time is short for potential investors who want to enter Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at its current price point of $0.02. Delaying the purchase at this time could result in missing the current all-time low price which becomes available during Phase 4 as MUTM approaches its expected $5 value. Purchase your position now because an upcoming market increase is expected. Visit Mutuum Finance’s official website to participate before the next price hike.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, the top US-based crypto exchange platform by volume says that it has added the meme asset doginme ( DOGINME ) to its listing roadmap. Coinbase’s listing roadmap is used to increase transparency and to prevent the front-running of new tokens. Being added to the list means the crypto exchange is considering adding support for the asset soon. News of the addition sent DOGINME flying as the memecoin went from a low of $0.000366 on March 13th to a peak of $0.00106 just a day later. It has since retraced and is trading for $0.00091 at time of writing, a staggering gain of 106% during the last 24 hours. Doginme – which launched in February 2025 – was created by Dan Romero, the founder of the decentralized social media network Farcaster, when he was asked if he owned a dog, according to the crypto asset’s official website. “Doginme came to life in February 2024 when Farcaster founder Dan Romero (DWR) was asked if he owned a dog. DWR replied affirmatively: ‘No, but I got that dog in me.’ Extending far beyond our roots on Farcaster, doginme is now representative of the community’s collective efforts to embrace and embolden that dog in them.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Stone Sentenced to 45 Months for Fraud,https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-influencer-t-j-stone-sentenced-to-45-months-for-fraud/,"Key Takeaways: Crypto influencer faces a prison sentence for deceiving property and digital asset backers. The scheme unfolded over years using false business fronts and exploited personal ties. The case shows the risk of investing without independent verification. Thomas John Sfraga, known as T.J. Stone, was sentenced to 45 months in federal prison for wire fraud after defrauding real estate and cryptocurrency investors out of over $2 million, according to the U.S. Department of Justice on Friday. Brooklyn Podcaster and Cryptocurrency Personality Known as “T.J. Stone” Sentenced to 45 Months’ Imprisonment https://t.co/lbWYVDHqtz (Announced with @NewYorkFBI ) — US Attorney EDNY (@EDNYnews) March 14, 2025 According to a press release from the U.S. Department of Justice, Sfraga defrauded real estate and cryptocurrency investors out of more than $2 million. He was also ordered to forfeit $1,337,700, with restitution to be determined later. His sentencing took place in Brooklyn, presided over by U.S. District Judge Frederic Block. The case, led by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York and the FBI’s New York Field Office, exposed a years-long fraudulent scheme in which Sfraga exploited personal relationships and investor trust to fund a series of sham businesses. T.J. Stone’s Fraud Targeted Close Contacts U.S. Attorney John J. Durham condemned Sfraga’s actions, stating in a press release that he “stole from friends, neighbors, and even parents of children who played on sports teams with his own kids.” Sfraga ran fraudulent businesses, including Build Strong Homes LLC and Vandelay Contracting Corp.—a name referencing the fictional “Vandelay Industries” from Seinfeld. Under the alias “T.J. Stone,” he portrayed himself as a real estate developer, media personality, and cryptocurrency expert, even acting as an emcee at major crypto events in New York. Stone’s Fraudulent Activities Spanned Years Between 2016 and 2022, Sfraga convinced at least 17 victims in Brooklyn, Staten Island, and Long Island to invest in fraudulent ventures, including real estate flipping projects and cryptocurrency investments , promising returns of up to 60% in just three months. One of his schemes involved persuading a victim to lend him $100,000 for a construction project that did not exist. In another, he promoted a fictitious crypto “virtual wallet,” enticing victims with the prospect of high returns. Rather than investing the funds, Sfraga spent the money on personal expenses and used some to repay earlier victims in a Ponzi-style scheme. As authorities began investigating, Sfraga fled to Arizona and assumed a false identity. Law enforcement arrested him in Las Vegas after he failed to pay a bill at the Wynn Casino. The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney John Vagelatos, with support from Paralegal Specialist Madison Bates, culminating in Sfraga’s sentencing. The post Crypto Influencer T.J.

But the move has sparked fierce divisions within the Democratic Party over how to counter President Donald Trump's efforts to expand executive power. The Senate approved the funding package by a 62-38 vote, putting congressional Democrats in a position to give up what they see as their strongest leverage to curb Trump and billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk’s aggressive cost-cutting measures, which include drastically reducing the federal workforce and abolishing entire government agencies. With legislative options dwindling, opponents are expected to shift their efforts to legal challenges in the courts. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer played a critical role in the decision-making process. With less than 30 hours left before the shutdown, the veteran lawmaker announced he would drop his party’s hold on the spending bill, prioritizing the continuation of government services over political wrangling. Related News: Why Has Bitcoin Rebounded? Will the Uptrend Continue? Schumer’s reversal marks a significant victory for Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, paving the way for the spending measure’s final approval. The bill ensures Musk’s newly created Office of Government Efficiency retains the authority to make sweeping budget cuts while securing government funding through the fiscal year-end on Sept. 30. The political impasse coincides with turmoil in financial markets as Trump’s tariff policies have stoked widespread investor uncertainty. By Thursday, the S&P 500 had entered a correction, losing more than 10% in three weeks. But news that the Senate was making progress on the spending bill sparked a 2% recovery on Friday. Nine Democrats and one independent joined forces with nearly all Senate Republicans to pass the bill with a simple majority later in the day, passing the 60-vote threshold. *This is not investment advice.

This was after the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) published a report suggesting such talks had taken place. Details From The Statement Following the report’s release, Zhao addressed the claims in a March 13 post on X, stating, “I have had no discussions of a Binance US deal with … well, anyone.” The former Binance CEO explained that more than 20 people had told him they had been contacted by WSJ and another media outlet, who were attempting to verify whether he had struck a deal for clemency. The article alleged that Zhao was seeking a presidential pardon from Trump, which could allow him to take on an operational or management role at Binance. According to the WSJ, Binance approached Trump’s allies last year with a business proposal as part of its plan to strengthen its U.S. operations. Zhao denied these claims, suggesting that the report was politically motivated and intended as “an attack on the President and crypto.” He also asserted that “residual forces of the ‘war on crypto’ from the last administration are still at work.” CZ, who served time after pleading guilty to violating U.S. anti-money laundering laws, noted that he is the only individual in U.S. history to receive a prison sentence for a single Bank Secrecy Act violation. “No felon would mind a pardon,” he said, adding that he remains dedicated to advancing cryptocurrency both in the U.S. and globally. Implication of CZ’s Possible Return In November 2023, Binance settled with U.S. authorities, agreeing to pay $4.3 billion in fines. As part of the agreement, Zhao pleaded guilty to failing to implement an effective anti-money laundering program at the exchange. The company also committed to fully exiting the United States market. CZ later resigned as CEO, with reports indicating that he was permanently barred from operating or managing Binance under the terms of the settlement. A presidential pardon would possibly change the platform’s ability to conduct business in the country. Since Trump took office, his administration has taken a more supportive stance on digital assets, reversing the strict regulatory approach of the previous government. Under acting Chair Mark Uyeda, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has softened its enforcement efforts against crypto firms. Several high-profile cases, including those involving Binance and Coinbase , have been paused or dropped.

LIBRA Memecoin Scandal The request, made by prosecutor Gregorio Dalbón, reviewed by Fortune, accuses Davis of being a key figure behind the LIBRA memecoin. The token gained significant attention after President Milei endorsed it on Valentine’s Day. Following Milei’s endorsement, LIBRA’s market capitalization soared to over $4.5 billion. However, its value quickly collapsed, plummeting by more than 99% to approximately $18 million. Blockchain analysts later revealed that certain insiders sold large amounts of the token shortly after Milei publicly supported it. Related Reading: Solana Price Crash To $90? Why A 26% Decline Could Rock This Crypto In his request for the Red Notice, Dalbón expressed concerns that Davis might evade justice, citing his financial resources that could facilitate his flight or concealment. “The possibility that Davis will abandon his country of residence or hide to avoid answering for his alleged acts appears to be aggravated by the economic resources he possesses,” Dalbón stated, emphasizing the urgency of the situation. Interpol, the International Criminal Police Organization, facilitates international cooperation among law enforcement agencies in its 196 member countries, including the US and Argentina. A Red Notice serves as a request for member countries to locate and provisionally arrest individuals pending extradition. Federal Investigation Launched Into Javier Milei’s Endorsement Davis has not publicly responded to the allegations, nor have his family members, including his brother Gideon and father Charles, who are involved in their family crypto venture, Kelsier Ventures, Fortune reported. Yet, the controversy surrounding LIBRA is further complicated by its connection to former President Donald Trump, who recently launched his own memecoin named TRUMP. Trump’s endorsement of cryptocurrency has been characterized as part of his broader strategy to position himself as a pro-crypto advocate. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bottom Confirmed? Data Shows 87.5% Chance The Worst Is Over Following Milei’s endorsement, Davis openly acknowledged his role as an advisor to the Argentine president, stating, “I am indeed Javier Milei’s advisor.” He also claimed responsibility for the launch of a separate memecoin associated with Melania Trump. The fallout from the LIBRA launch has prompted legal inquiries, including a federal investigation into Milei’s actions. Both Milei and Davis have denied any wrongdoing, but the political implications of this incident are significant, as it raises questions about the accountability and regulation of cryptocurrencies in Argentina. At the time of writing, the memecoin is trading at $0.060, down over 90% from its all-time high reached on Valentine’s Day.

This decision has approved the collapsed hedge fund liquidators’ increase in the claim against FTX from $120 million to a massive $1.53 billion. This new development could affect how FTX’s remaining assets are shared and impact creditors who are still waiting for their payouts. 3AC’s Uncovers $1.53 Billion Loss in FTX Collapse Three Arrows Capital was once a big name in the crypto industry, managing over $3 billion before collapsing in 2022. Its downfall shook the crypto market, exposing major financial problems. At the time, it had strong financial ties to FTX, which also went bankrupt later that year after fraud accusations against its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried. In July 2023, 3AC’s liquidators filed a claim for $120 million, thinking that was what FTX owed them. Fast-forward to November 2024, and they found new evidence showing that FTX had actually liquidated $1.53 billion of 3AC’s assets just two weeks before 3AC collapsed. This discovery changed everything. FTX’s Defense Falls Apart in Court FTX argued that liquidating 3AC’s assets was justified because the company owed it $1.3 billion as loan collateral. However, the court ruled that FTX did not have enough proof to support this claim, allowing 3AC to increase its claim to a huge amount. Meanwhile, FTX emphasized that it had already started paying creditors and argued that 3AC’s claim came too late. However, the court said the delay was understandable since 3AC’s liquidators had trouble accessing financial records. The judge said the lack of help from 3AC’s founders, Zhu Su and Kyle Davies, made it even harder to uncover the full claim earlier. When 3AC collapsed, its founders also ran into legal trouble. Zhu Su was jailed four months in Singapore for refusing to cooperate with liquidators, while Kyle Davies avoided legal consequences. In 2023, they tried to return to the crypto scene by launching OPNX, a platform for trading bankruptcy claims, but it shut down in early 2025. What’s Next for FTX Creditors? With the court’s recent decision, 3AC’s liquidators have a much bigger position in FTX’s bankruptcy case. This raises questions about how the larger claim will affect payments to other FTX creditors, as another repayment round should start by May 30. Many also wonder whether 3AC will actually recover the full $1.53 billion. This raises concerns about hidden financial dealings between 3AC and FTX, making the case even more complicated. Meanwhile, Sam Bankman-Fried is trying to appeal his 25-year prison sentence, adding more uncertainty to one of the biggest bankruptcy cases in crypto history.

Creative displays and digital experiments offered fresh views on asset use. The event connected tech experts with everyday users. The crypto sector had a small presence at South By Southwest (SXSW) this year. However, a few standout panels and marketing campaigns managed to make an impact. SXSW has been a tech, music, and film festival held in Austin, Texas, since 1987. While brands and creators have focused on non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in recent years, crypto companies arrived at SXSW 2025 with a focus on mainstream adoption. Bitcoin-Themed Drone Show Lights Up Austin Sky A highlight of SXSW 2025 was Gemini’s record-breaking drone show . The US-based exchange set a Guinness World Record on March 13 by deploying 1,000 drones to create the largest-ever aerial display of a currency symbol, forming the Bitcoin (BTC) logo over Austin. The drone show also featured images of spaceships, an astronaut placing flags on Mars, and a woolly mammoth. In case y’all missed it… I just watched the BEST drone show of my life here at SXSW, with a world breaking record for the largest currency symbol in the sky, Bitcoin!! Thank you @Gemini for this absolutely incredible experience that I watched from my balcony!!! Go where… pic.twitter.com/yP4tPWGe1N — Rachel Wolfson (@Rachelwolf00) March 14, 2025 Olivia Santarelli, head of marketing for Gemini, told Cryptonews at SXSW that the 1,000 drone show was meant to share the story of Gemini’s “Go Where Dollars Won’t” campaign. Gemini launched the “Go Where Dollars Won’t” campaign in November 2024. It featured a woolly mammoth image in a series of Gemini ad placements illustrated by Matt Griffin, a renowned multimedia artist best known for his work on Dune, Dune 2, and Star Wars. “The drone show was meant to tell the story of the ‘Mars Safari,’ which is one of the featured images in our ‘Go Where Dollars Won’t’ campaign,” Santarelli said. “The campaign portrays a future where the world can use cryptocurrency. The audience at SXSW was able to see that Bitcoin is a global currency.” Record-breaking Bitcoin logo at SXSW 2025 in Austin. / Source: Gemini Santarelli added that Gemini wanted to host the Bitcoin-themed drone show at SXSW due to its broad audience, many of whom may already be familiar with crypto. “We really wanted to do this at SXSW this year because the audience has probably heard a lot about crypto, and the drone show is a way for them to experience Gemini and crypto differently from social media or the news,” she remarked. “I hope this served as another touch point to help people learn more about cryptocurrency.” The world-record-breaking drone show concluded with a giant QR code in the sky for 30 seconds. The QR code led to Gemini’s website, offering $50 in BTC for trades of $100 or more. “This call-to-action allows people to invest in a small amount of crypto while earning crypto back,” Santarelli said. Coinbase Discusses Crypto Security Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase also had a presence at SXSW this year. Philip Martin, chief security officer for Coinbase, spoke about risks of online financial scams on a panel titled, “ Tech-Wide Battle Against Online Fraud .” Philip Martin speaking about security at SXSW 2025. Source: Coinbase Martin told Cryptonews that he was joined by one of Coinbase’s “Tech Against Scams” coalition partners, Match Group, along with a former FBI agent, to walk the audience through how fraudsters operate across online platforms. “We discussed how bad actors carry out long-term, high-reward financial scams that rely on trust and relationship-building – also known as social engineering scams,” Martin said. Martin added that it’s important to identify the warning signs and know how to report these types of crimes. “Everyone who attended our panel at SXSW knows someone who can be vulnerable to online scams,” he said. “Our goal was for the audience to go home and discuss this with their parents, their grandparents, and anyone else who might be at risk.” Martin further remarked that it was important for Coinbase to be a part of the conversation at SXSW in an effort to educate the general public on how to stay safe against scams. “If the byproduct of the panel was that attendees walked away from our session feeling more knowledgeable and confident in using crypto safely, then I would consider that a win,” he stated. Decentralized Social Media Gains Attention In addition to leading crypto exchanges, a number of Web3-focused companies and content creators attended this year’s SXSW. Solo Ceesay, co-founder and CEO of Calaxy, told Cryptonews at SXSW that the event was an opportunity to connect with Web2 creators who may be interested in exploring decentralized platforms . “Many creators continue to push for decentralization, but creators remain beholden to platforms like X or Instagram and TikTok,” Ceesay said. “Calaxy took the stage at SXSW to push an alternative platform, where creators can build their own tribe and monetize in a place built around a crypto wallet that enables easy value transfer.” Ceesay also announced the launch of a new fund at SXSW that is designed to propel 50 content creators into the Web3 social media revolution. “The recipients, known as the Calaxy Class of 2025, will each receive $20,000, along with milestone-based incentives and sustainable monetization opportunities within the Calaxy ecosystem,” Ceesay said. SXSW attracted a number of Web2 content creators this year, and Ceesay mentioned the event was an opportunity to introduce mainstream audiences to the crypto sector. AI and Blockchain Discussed Violetta Zironi, a singer-songwriter who inscribed a song on the Bitcoin blockchain , told Cryptonews at SXSW that while artificial intelligence (AI) dominated discussions, blockchain played an essential role in digital ownership. “The panel I was on was called ‘Building Music Communities with and Around XR Technology,’ where we spoke a lot about AI,” Zironi said. “However, I made it a point to explain how blockchain is the infrastructure needed to verify everything built around AI.” Zironi added that while blockchain was not a hot topic of discussion at SXSW, she believes it’s an essential part of the conversations that took place throughout the event. Beyond Speculation: Crypto’s Shift Toward Utility For years, crypto’s presence at major events leaned on price speculation and technological hype. At SXSW 2025, the focus shifted toward something more practical: security, education, and creative applications. Gemini’s drone show, Coinbase’s panel on scams, and Calaxy’s push for decentralized social media all underscored a growing effort to make crypto useful rather than just exciting. If the industry continues down this path, it may find that mainstream adoption isn’t about chasing trends but about solving real-world problems. Whether audiences at SXSW left as believers or skeptics, they were given something far more tangible to consider. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are the broader implications of crypto firms focusing on education and safety at events like SXSW? These sessions show a shift toward simplifying digital assets while tackling online risks. They build practical skills and user confidence, fostering an inclusive method for managing digital finance securely. How does the focus on decentralized social media at SXSW add value to crypto discussions? Emphasizing decentralized social media introduces alternative digital spaces for content creation. It spurs broader engagement, allowing users to explore asset management through community-led online networks. What future trends in digital finance might we expect following SXSW’s focus on crypto education and creative outreach? Future trends may include more interactive learning events and live digital displays that blend finance with art. These initiatives could drive wider user familiarity and reshape public views on digital asset use.

US intelligence federal agencies like the CIA, NSA, and FBI, which had presented the firm as a key asset to government officials, were also seemingly alarmed by Marquis-Boire’s past indiscretions. Marquis-Boire was first accused of sexual assault in 2017 and had to take a step back from the public Marquis-Boire sexual assault accusations first surfaced in 2017, with multiple women coming forward. The allegations at the time forced him to retreat from the public eye for some time. Moreover, several companies had even distanced themselves from him, including the interdisciplinary laboratory Citizen Lab. Citizen Lab even openly criticised the growing “toxic culture of sexual discrimination, harassment, and violence” in the tech industry. After several companies cut ties with him, Marquis-Boire reportedly helped start and develop Unciphered in secret using the pseudonym “Frank Davidson.” The company’s employees only found out about his involvement in the firm’s development towards the end of 2023. For the last four years, however, Unciphered has built up a good reputation, specializing in cracking encrypted wallets to recover lost crypto funds. Even high-profile cybersecurity figures, including former NSA general counsel Stewart Baker and security expert Chris Wysopal, took an interest in the company. Employees doubted whether Marquis-Boire left the company completely in 2024 However, Marquis-Boire’s revealed connections to the company raised concerns about the firm’s reputation and image. The company’s employees especially raised alarms over Marquis-Boire’s past, not wanting to be tied to the man’s past actions and ruin their professional reputations. Jon Ellch, a former FBI cybersecurity expert, even asked for the company to drop Marquis-Boire. Following multiple other complaints, CEO Eric Michaud resigned, and Marquis-Boire left the company. However, even after he left the company, employees were still concerned about his lingering connections to the firm. In early 2024, a package addressed to him was delivered to Unciphered’s San Francisco office, renewing fears about his continued influence. Nevertheless, the company’s administration quickly reassured its workers that Marquis-Boire’s shares were all bought out in February 2024, and he was no longer involved with the company Meanwhile, in response to the controversy, Unciphered took down all employee names from its website for security reasons.

The broader crypto market remains under stress, with fear dominating sentiment and keeping ETH from regaining momentum. Related Reading: Dogecoin Network Activity Surges 47% In A Month – What’s Next for DOGE? The downturn is largely driven by macroeconomic uncertainty and escalating trade war fears, which have shaken both crypto and the U.S. stock markets. As investors brace for further volatility, some fear that the market is setting up for a deeper correction. However, not all analysts are bearish. Some believe that a recovery could be on the horizon in the coming months, especially if technical indicators begin to show strength. Top analyst Daan shared insights on X, revealing that Ethereum has been consolidating since the major sell-off and has formed a falling wedge pattern—a bullish formation that could indicate a local trend reversal. For now, ETH remains at risk of further declines, but if this pattern plays out, Ethereum could soon break out of its consolidation range and start building momentum for a recovery. The next few weeks will be crucial in determining whether ETH can stabilize or if more downside is ahead. Ethereum Falling Wedge Could Signal a Reversal Ethereum has lost over 57% of its value, creating a challenging environment for bulls as selling pressure continues. ETH is now trading below a multi-year support level, which has flipped into strong resistance. As long as Ethereum remains below the $1,900–$2,000 range, bulls will struggle to regain momentum, keeping bearish sentiment intact. The entire crypto market has mirrored this weakness, experiencing a significant breakdown alongside the U.S. stock market. Global trade war fears and uncertainty surrounding U.S. President Trump’s policies have further fueled the sell-off in risk assets. Since the U.S. elections in November 2024, macroeconomic volatility and rising uncertainty have driven markets lower. With the U.S. stock market hitting its lowest levels since September 2024, investors remain on edge, questioning if Ethereum has further downside ahead. Despite this bleak outlook, there is some optimism. Daan’s insights suggest that Ethereum has been consolidating since the major drop and has formed a falling wedge pattern. This bullish formation could lead to a local trend reversal if ETH breaks out and holds above resistance. For this potential recovery to materialize, ETH must break above the white zone and reclaim $2,000. If this happens, bulls could start testing higher levels and build momentum for a broader market recovery. However, the ETH/BTC ratio remains near multi-year lows, showing only minor resilience in recent days. Sustained strength is needed before a real reversal can take place. Related Reading: Ethereum Net Taker Volume Signals Huge Selling Pressure – Can Bulls Hold Key Levels? With Ethereum still struggling, the next few weeks will be crucial in determining whether this falling wedge breakout can lead to a meaningful rally or if the downtrend will continue. Bulls Struggle Around $1,900 Ethereum is currently trading at $1,900, after days of struggling below the crucial $2,000 mark. Bulls have lost control, and ETH is now at its lowest levels since October 2023, reflecting the broader market uncertainty and ongoing bearish sentiment. With macroeconomic volatility and trade war fears weighing heavily on risk assets, Ethereum continues to face selling pressure, making it difficult for bulls to build momentum for a recovery. The longer ETH stays below $2,000, the stronger the resistance at this level becomes, pushing buyers further out of the market. For Ethereum to avoid deeper losses, bulls must reclaim the $2,000 mark as soon as possible and establish it as a new support level. A break and hold above this threshold could trigger a recovery rally, allowing ETH to test higher resistance zones. However, losing current levels would leave ETH vulnerable to another drop, potentially retesting support near $1,750 or lower. Related Reading: Bitcoin Lost And Retested The 200-Day MA As Resistance – Here’s What Happened Last Time The next few days will be critical, as bulls need to step in and defend current demand to prevent further downside.

While the market marvels at this growth in the Sonic price, most savvy investors are also stacking up FloppyPepe (FPPE) , which is making headlines as the most promising meme coin to buy in anticipation of the much-anticipated crypto bull run. Sonic Price Prepares For A Massive Rebound As Network Metrics Rise After the Fantom blockchain rebranded to Sonic (S), the Sonic price has seen significant gains. It peaked at $0.95 last month, just shy of its $1.03 all-time high (ATH). Experts attribute this sudden price surge to the altcoin season hype, and many are optimistic that the Sonic price will soon reclaim previous highs. Notably, one market analyst, Crypto Kindle, says that Sonic price is on a bullish trend and is outperforming again. The price is currently sitting at a local resistance level, aiming to break to new levels after successfully breaking out of its previous downtrend. Aside from its impressive price performance, the Sonic (S) network boasts over 10,000 transactions per second (TPS) with sub-second finality—a standout feature that has caught the market’s eye. The Sonic (S) network has adopted a new developer model that grants builders 90% of fees. This model spiked its Total Value Locked (TVL) to $745 million, marking a major milestone, as it has increased by 220% since January. FloppyPepe (FPPE): Best Bet For Big Gains In The Expected Bull Run Among the new promising cryptocurrencies in the space, the Sonic price and FloppyPepe (FPPE) are set for a major rise, driven by their respective utility and community backing.

Unlike traditional meme coins that rely solely on hype, FloppyPepe (FPPE) stands out with a 1% burn mechanism , which reduces supply and increases its value over time. Another standout feature of FloppyPepe (FPPE) is its reward distribution model. With every transaction, this meme coin redistributes 3% to token holders, providing an added incentive for long-term participation. Beyond its profit-driven structure, FloppyPepe (FPPE) offers real utilities that set it apart from typical meme coins. One of its standout features is the integration of AI tools designed to help investors stay ahead of market trends. The FloppyAI , for instance, particularly guarantees that investors and community members receive instant, accurate responses about tokenomics, roadmap milestones, and market trends. Interestingly, this FloppyAI agent has been integrated across Telegram, Twitter (X), and the FloppyPepe (FPPE) website, making it accessible to both token holders and new investors looking to explore its capabilities and stay ahead of the crypto bull run. Meanwhile, the Meme-o-Matic machine, which is already live on Telegram, allows users to create quality memes through AI text prompts. These AI tools position FloppyPepe (FPPE) as an intelligent meme coin with long-term growth potential, whether or not a crypto bull run influences it. While most savvy investors believe the Sonic price will surge and give them some returns, most are hedging with FloppyPepe (FPPE), which offers higher ROIs with a low presale price of $0.0000002 . Even top analysts like Crypto Chino and NASS CRYPTO have endorsed it as the most profitable coin ahead of the crypto bull run. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Is A Must-Buy Due to attractive and lucrative opportunities FloppyPepe (FPPE) has to offer, the meme coin has raised over $1.2 million just three weeks into its presale.

The DOJ says former Bank of America employee Rongjian Li was a member of a money laundering and drug trafficking outfit headed by Jin Hua Zhang. According to prosecutors, Li used his position at the bank from 2021 through 2022 to help the criminal organization open several accounts. Zhang’s organization then used the BofA accounts, some of which were registered using forged passports, to launder illicit funds. “As part of his involvement, when the bank’s financial auditing systems flagged or froze accounts for suspicious activity, Li helped Zhang circumvent the bank’s anti-money laundering protocols and move illicit funds elsewhere. In addition, Li was observed sitting next to Zhang at a dinner in New York, where Zhang discussed the different fee percentages he charged various criminal groups for drug trafficking and scams.” Zhang’s organization is believed to have laundered millions of dollars in a span of months, according to the DOJ. “The investigation revealed that, for a fee, Zhang laundered bulk cash for drug dealers and laundered profits from other illegal businesses.

The sports betting industry needs efficient sports odds aggregators as sportsbooks continue to incorporate crypto payment methods. Sportsbook operators can utilize these platforms to retrieve betting odds from various sources in real time, ensuring users receive current and competitive wagering options. The selection of a quality sports odds API is essential because it determines a sportsbook’s performance and also influences user loyalty, financial outcomes, and system stability. The article goes over premium odds aggregation features in crypto-friendly betting platforms and explores the impact of modern technology on future sports wagering. Digital wagering solutions are analyzed in detail at Crypto Intelligence , where readers can access the latest trends in crypto gambling and sports betting technology. The Importance of Sports Odds Aggregators for Crypto Sportsbooks The competitive crypto gambling market requires platforms to provide immediate access to odds from various sporting events for their betting customers. Traditional sportsbooks have long used odds aggregation to improve their betting options, but crypto-friendly sportsbooks face three main challenges: decentralized transactions, market volatility, and regulatory uncertainties. A reliable sports odds aggregation system allows sportsbooks to instantly compare odds from multiple platforms by integrating both fiat and cryptocurrency data, thereby building user trust. As the sports betting industry transitions to digital assets, operators must choose aggregators that support crypto transactions and incorporate blockchain security, features that are now essential. The integration of a trustworthy odds API becomes essential because operators who do not implement it will lose ground to competitors who provide better betting experiences based on secure data-driven platforms. Key Factors to Consider When Choosing a Sports Odds Aggregator The selection of an appropriate sports odds aggregator depends on multiple important factors for assessment. Crypto sports betting demands precise real-time data because odds change quickly during betting sessions. Top aggregators rely on fast data streams and AI-driven analysis to continuously update odds in real time. For optimal security and seamless, delay-free crypto payment transactions, API integration with payment gateways must be flawless. Security and compliance stand as essential factors in the industry, so top aggregators use blockchain encryption together with 2FA and anti-fraud protection systems. Following regulations provides legal stability to operations. Sportsbooks gain better user satisfaction through customization because they can adjust odds and betting limits and market options to specific preferences. A design that embraces user-friendliness enables better customer commitment both during initial engagement and for continued use. Maximizing profits in sports betting increasingly depends on AI analytics, which provide predictive sports predictions, personalized betting guidance, and effective risk optimization. The Impact of Sports Odds Aggregators on Crypto-Friendly Sportsbooks Crypto sportsbooks differ from traditional bookmakers in that they incorporate decentralized finance (DeFi) principles throughout their operations. Every component of betting operations must function at high speed with robust security and transparency. A dependable sports odds aggregator enables crypto-friendly betting platforms to update their odds instantly, an essential feature given the constant price volatility of digital assets. The efficient operation of an odds API eliminates betting rate differences to stop users from placing wagers with old prices. The acceptance of multiple currencies through wagering support becomes possible because leading odds aggregators enable sportsbooks to work with various cryptocurrencies and stablecoins which expands their betting audience worldwide. Blockchain-based odds aggregation provides transparent betting records that prevent data tampering while reducing concerns about data manipulation. The system establishes confidence levels that benefit both gamblers and oversight organizations. Selecting the Best Sports Odds API Provider Sportsbook operators need to perform thorough assessments of multiple odds aggregation services that exist in the market. Sports betting technology includes reputable companies such as Odds88 that provides both sportsbook-compatible real-time odds aggregation and API solutions. Their platform delivers sportsbook operators an advanced API that provides smooth integration and real-time betting updates, and extensive market coverage. The Future of Sports Betting and Odds Aggregation in 2025 Multiple developments in the sports betting sector will transform odds aggregation during the upcoming years. AI technology together with machine learning, will assume a more influential position to refine odds while delivering predictive information to betting customers. The growing decentralized betting market is creating increased adoption of blockchain technology which will produce transparent and fair odds generation. The expanding esports industry alongside virtual betting will escalate the need for adaptable odds aggregation solutions, and regulatory changes in crypto gambling will impact API security procedures. Conclusion Sportsbook operators within the crypto betting industry must select the perfect sports odds aggregator because it represents their most vital operational choice. A perfect sports odds API must deliver real-time precise betting information with crypto transaction support and blockchain encryption for security purposes. The competitive crypto betting market demands advanced odds aggregation technology to stay ahead since user demand for crypto-friendly platforms continues its upward trend. Sportsbook operators who integrate Odds88 solutions into their operations can provide their users with the best betting experience through competitive odds.

After severe downtrend, the SOL price found support at $114 level and has since witnessed a brief uptick. The price of Solana has declined by nearly 50% since its January high, when Donald Trump’s meme coin was introduced, due to the network’s transaction volumes and fees being affected by the meme coin winter. Since reaching its high in December of last year, the market cap of meme coins has decreased by 65.2%, and the price of most assets in this category has dropped to levels seen before the election or even lower. Because of the large number of transactions they facilitate, meme coins play a crucial role in the Solana ecosystem. Having said that, the majority of these assets have seen substantial declines since the beginning of the year. Bulls Striving Hard At the time of writing, SOL is trading at $134.41, up 8.91% in the last 24 hours as per data from CMC. Moreover, the trading volume is up 9.75%. The price surge follows general uptick in the overall crypto market with Bitcoin regaining the $84k mark. Despite the recent uptick, the SOL price is still down 4.15% in the last 7 days. After severe downtrend, the SOL price found support at $114 level and has since witnessed a brief uptick. The pace of SOL is increasing on the hourly chart after a breach of the $130 local barrier. It is still too soon to tell whether the recent price respite for Solana represents a sustained bounce or just a pump. The uptrend should likely extend to the $140 region, if the bulls can maintain their newly-won advantage. Breaking above $140 level should likely propel the SOL price towards $153 resistance level. However, if the price falls below the $124 mark, then it will likely retest $114 support level.",Editors News|Investing News|Altcoin|Solana,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BTC,"{'name': 'The News Crypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thenewscrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thenewscrypto,2025-03-15 00:23:29

Key Metrics Predict A Strong Bounce,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/dogecoin-recovery-in-sight-key-metrics-predict-a-strong-bounce/,"After months of struggle in gathering momentum, Dogecoin (DOGE) might be about to undergo a dramatic price reversal. Monitoring the movements of the meme coin, analysts believe it has hit a turning point and might thus launch a quick comeback. The question at hand is whether Dogecoin can seize this opportunity and emerge from its decline, as key indicators are currently displaying bullish signals. Related Reading: Bitcoin And S&P Decline Together, But Data Predicts A Turnaround Analysts Spot Signs Of A Bottom Some analysts contend that Dogecoin has already reached its lowest price point, which could potentially lead to a rebound. A prominent crypto analyst, Trader Tardigrade, has observed that DOGE has been adhering to a long-term price channel. The overall pattern indicates that a bottom has likely formed, despite the fact that it has momentarily moved outside the channel’s boundary. #Dogecoin has been following this Macro Channel since its inception 🔥 Deviations have occurred at the channel’s edges historically. If $Doge remains within the channel without deviation this time, it has already reached the bottom 🚀 pic.twitter.com/fzDDW4HDqe — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) March 13, 2025 Other analysts noted that the TD Sequential indicator, which is used to predict trend reversals, has sent out a buy signal on Dogecoin’s daily chart. This indication has historically been linked to price gains, suggesting that DOGE might be about to enter an upward trend. Crucial Levels To Keep An Eye On Support and resistance levels will be critical in determining Dogecoin’s next moves. At the moment, the $0.16 level is showing signs that a support will emerge. Market observers believe that if the meme coin can keep a solid footing on this level, it could muster enough steam to rally toward much higher price targets. Under ideal conditions, some predictions suggest that Dogecoin may reach $2.74. Compared to its current state, this would represent a significant price hike. However, DOGE needs to surpass a number of resistance zones, including the $0.30 and $0.50 marks, before this can happen. Uptick In Market Activity Encourages Optimism Another element that is giving Dogecoin a good ounce of lift is the elevated market activity of the meme crypto. For instance, in a 24-hour span, the number of active wallets on the network jumped 270% and totaled 264,000 overall. Usually, an increase in this department indicates rising enthusiasm among consumers and investors. Meanwhile, significant investors, referred to as “whales,” have been acquiring DOGE at an accelerated rate. Whales accumulated 1.7 billion DOGE in their accounts over the past 72 hours. This level of accumulation suggests that significant stakeholders value Dogecoin at its present price. Related Reading: TRUMP Token Takedown—Did Insiders Plan The Crash?

The Minnesota Bitcoin Act is somewhat deceptively titled, however, as the bill refers to “Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies” throughout. The bill, while made public on March 14, is dated March 17. It makes no mention of any kind of reserve. The Minnesota bill is simple but comprehensive The proposals are fairly simple. The bill adds crypto to the list of investment options available to the State Board of Investment. It adds crypto to the list of forms of payment the state will accept. In addition, the bill allows cryptocurrency received to be subtracted from federal adjusted gross income and it excludes cryptocurrency gains from certain tax calculations. It will be introduced into the state senate by Republican Jeremy Miller. After that, the bill will be referred to that body’s State and Local Government Committee. Changes made under the act would become effective on either Dec. 31 or Jan. 1, 2026. Minnesota revised its legislation to incorporate updates to the Uniform Commercial Code, but has little oversight over cryptocurrency beyond that. The Department of Commerce requires cryptocurrency exchanges to be registered as money transmitters, which is a common practice among states. Minnesota also has a law protecting consumers who use cryptocurrency kiosks (ATMs), which was enacted in 2024. Minnesota lawmakers are divided on crypto on the federal level Although the state is hardly a crypto hub, Minnesota is the home of cryptocurrency proponent Tom Emmer, who has served in the U.S. House of Representatives since 2014. Emmer is the vice chair of the House Financial Services Committee Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Artificial Intelligence. Emmer reintroduced the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, aimed at preventing the United States from issuing a central bank digital currency, on March 6. He has been pushing the bill since 2022. A different version of it passed the House in 2024. U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order prohibiting federal agencies from establishing, issuing, or promoting CBDCs on Jan. 23. Emmer’s seven colleagues in the House are divided 4-3 in favor of crypto across party lines, according to Stand with Crypto. Its senators are firmly against it.

This marks the firm’s first attempt at an AVAX-focused ETF, adding to its recent efforts in niche investment products. The registration statement filed on Friday noted: “The Trust’s investment objective is to reflect the performance of the price of ‘AVAX,’ the native token of the Avalanche network, less the expenses of the Trust’s operations.” VanEck registered for the ETF in Delaware this past week for what’s believed to be the first AVAX ETF. “Notably — the trust registration was shared widely on this earlier this week,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart on Friday in a post on X. “But this is the first actual filing with the SEC.” VanEck joins the crypto ETF race with first-ever avalanche (AVAX) filing Following Bitcoin’s remarkable rally, investment firms are increasingly rolling out new products aimed at investors who are looking for the next breakout token. Applications for exchange-traded funds have shot up since Gary Gensler stepped down as SEC Chair. A number of companies have applied to the SEC for approval for different crypto ETFs, such as SOL, XRP, DOGE, and LTC. The previous administration saw the SEC approve the listing of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 and spot Ethereum ETFs in July. However, AVAX and the expanded ETF market are presently weighted down by bearish sentiment. The SEC’s approval, however, may not result in inflows until market conditions improve. Today brought the first-ever Avalanche ETF, as VanEck filed for the product. In recent months, VanEck has played around with various experimental ETF constructions. In January, the firm submitted an ETF based on crypto exchanges, mining firms, and payment gateways. If approved, this particular fund would invest in a collection of various crypto companies. VanEck might explore a couple of ETF types, but its Avalanche product could still be a long shot. T he filing sparked a more than 4% uptick in AVAX’s price, suggesting potential bullish momentum. Crypto ETFs face headwinds as market struggles The current market cycle for the crypto ETF industry has been brutal. Bitcoin ETFs have now been subject to five straight weeks of net outflows, and Ethereum funds have similarly been subjected to institutional skepticism. At the same time, the SEC has delayed decisions on several submissions, including Solana and XRP ETFs. With no clear relief in sight, concerns around a potential U.S. recession continue to fuel bearish sentiment across the crypto space. Even if VanEck’s AVAX ETF secures SEC approval, its immediate market appeal may be limited, though it could prove valuable in the long run. The regulatory watchdog has signalled a more friendly approach to the industry. In a matter of just a few weeks, the agency has rescinded controversial crypto accounting guidance, dropped enforcement actions against major crypto industry players, created a crypto task force and issued a meme coin statement.

Crypto sell-off in an effort to prevent conflict of interest The memorandum said “significant steps” were taken to reduce potential conflicts of interest before Sacks began his tenure as the White House AI and crypto czar — in which a major part of his role is to help create a legal framework for the crypto industry. Sacks offloaded all the “liquid cryptocurrency” in his portfolio, as well as Craft Ventures' portfolio — the investment firm he co-founded in 2017 — including holdings in Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ether ( ETH ), and Solana ( SOL ) before US President Donald Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20. The memorandum outlined which cryptocurrencies and crypto-related stocks David Sacks sold prior to Trump’s inauguration. Source: The White House Since Trump’s inauguration, the crypto market has seen a major decline amid a broader market downturn, with many blaming Trump’s proposed tariffs and uncertainty over US interest rates. While Bitcoin tapped a new all-time high of $109,000 just hours before Trump was sworn in as the 47th US president, it recently dipped below $80,000 on Feb. 27 , erasing all post-election gains. At the time of publication, Bitcoin is trading at $84,155, as per CoinMarketCap data. Sacks also divested from publicly traded crypto-related firms, including Coinbase (COIN), Robinhood (HOOD), and stakes in private digital asset companies. Additionally, he sold his limited partner interest in Solana-focused Multichain Capital and crypto-focused venture capital firm Blockchain Capital. At the same time, Craft Ventures offloaded its holdings in Multichain Capital and Bitwise Asset Management. Sen. Warren urged Sacks to prove he no longer holds crypto The memorandum is dated one day before Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren urged Sacks in a March 6 letter to prove he no longer holds any digital assets, following Sacks’ claim in an X post that he sold off all his crypto. “Despite your public statements via X, it remains unclear exactly when you personally divested from BTC, ETH, and SOL, when Craft Ventures divested from Bitwise, and whether people close to you ‘may have held positions and sold into the recent price surge,” Warren said. Since Sacks started the White House crypto role, he has been a vocal advocate on various issues in the crypto industry, from the importance of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to not over-taxing the crypto industry. Related: Bitcoin panic selling costs new investors $100M in 6 weeks — Research Sacks recently shut down the idea of crypto transaction taxes on an episode of the All In Podcast after host Jason Calacanis proposed charging a 0.01% tax on every cryptocurrency transaction. “That’s always how taxes start. They are described as being very modest,” Sacks said. “You know, when the income tax started, it only applied to like a thousand Americans, and the legislators swore up and down that it would never be applied to middle-class people,” Sacks added.

Key technical indicators on the XRP/USD weekly charts show critical levels XRP price must cross to hit $20 if the ETF filings are approved. Ripple (XRP) surges 5% as SEC Settlement Talks Begin Rippple (XRP) price jumped 5% to reclaim the $2.3 support level following reports that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could classify XRP as a commodity in its ongoing legal battle with Ripple Labs. This development comes as part of a potential settlement framework that could remove regulatory barriers surrounding XRP ETF approval. XRP price action | XRPUSDT On March 14, sources close to the negotiations revealed that SEC officials are discussing whether to treat XRP similarly to Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are already considered commodities under U.S. law. If XRP secures commodity status, it could facilitate the approval of an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF), a move that has driven speculation among investors. Crypto market analysts note that an official SEC statement confirming XRP’s commodity classification could act as a catalyst for a major price rally. The last time similar speculation surfaced, XRP price surged from $0.90 to $3.1 in under two months. If the SEC provides regulatory clarity soon, XRP could test resistance levels at $3.50 and $5 before eyeing a more ambitious target at $20. When Could the US SEC Approve XRP ETF? The timeline for an XRP ETF approval hinges on several key regulatory developments. The SEC is currently reviewing multiple crypto ETF applications, including those for Ethereum and XRP, amid increasing pressure from institutional investors seeking diversified exposure to digital assets. Industry experts predict that an XRP ETF could gain approval in late Q3 or early Q4 of 2025, depending on how Ripple’s legal battle unfolds. If Ripple successfully secures commodity status for XRP and resolves the SEC lawsuit through a settlement, the regulatory pathway for an XRP ETF could become significantly clearer. XRP ETF Fillings in Progress as of March 12, 2025 | Source: Cointelegraph Historically, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 triggered a wave of institutional inflows that pushed BTC price to new all-time highs. A similar scenario could unfold for XRP if the SEC greenlights a dedicated ETF product. Analysts project that an XRP ETF could attract over $5 billion in inflows within the first few months, potentially pushing XRP price towards $10 in the short term and $20 in a prolonged bullish cycle. With growing institutional interest and positive regulatory momentum, XRP remains one of the top contenders for the next big ETF approval. The next major catalysts to watch include upcoming court rulings in the Ripple vs. SEC case and further statements from SEC Chair Gary Gensler on the regulatory framework for crypto-based ETFs. XRP Price Forecast 2025: Is $20 a viable target? XRP price is consolidating around $2.38 after retracing from its recent high of $3.10, with technical indicators signaling a potential move toward the $20 target by 2025. The Bollinger Bands on the monthly chart show an expansion phase, suggesting increased volatility, while the price remains above the midline support, indicating sustained bullish momentum. The MACD histogram continues to trend positively, confirming strong upward momentum, though the signal line crossing above 0.23 warrants caution. XRP Price Forecast 2025 A bullish scenario unfolds if XRP reclaims the $2.57 resistance and maintains a monthly close above this level. This would confirm support at the upper Bollinger Band, allowing for a continuation toward the next psychological resistance at $5, where historical sell pressure previously emerged. If buying pressure sustains through 2024, a breakout above $5 could pave the way for a parabolic rise, with Fibonacci extensions pointing to $10 and beyond, fueled by ETF speculation and increased institutional adoption. Conversely, a bearish divergence in MACD or a failure to hold $2.00 as support could signal a deeper correction. A breakdown below $1.90 would expose XRP to downside risks, potentially testing the $1.00 psychological floor before a renewed uptrend. However, given the current technical setup, the path of least resistance remains upward.

The market expert Patrick Bet-David predicts XRP prices will reach $100 if SWIFT picks up 5% of its transactions and subsequent universal adoption pushes prices to $1,000. The latest phase of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is at $0.02 and anticipates a remarkable 15,354% price surge following its launch. XRP’s path of growth depends on regulatory rights and institutional adoption but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) uses its practical DeFi features to create active market interest leading to better returns than Bitcoin according to seasonal forecasts. XRP’s Ascent Hinges on Market Shifts XRP has gained 6% after experiencing a rough week with a 10% reduction in value to reach its current trading price at $2.20. The success of XRP Ledger depends on SWIFT processing volume rates which need extraordinary institutional support to materialize. The prospective SEC resolution and new stablecoin RLUSD stand as main forces behind market changes although analysts maintain doubts about their immediate impact. Franklin Templeton submitted a filing to launch an XRP exchange-traded fund while increasing XRP network user activity although the token price currently rests at 80% less than its 2018 high. Integrated commentary indicates that reaching $1,000 probably seems impossible right now yet advancing from $100 to $1 could establish meaningful change within international financial operations. Mutuum Finance Gains Momentum Real-world usage of MUTM trumped widespread speculations by designating its lending model to produce buy pressure through organic means. Presale the project reached $3.2 million an is currently priced at $0.02. Overall, investments are from over 5,500 holders as they anticipate Phase 4 to bring a $0.025 price level. The listing price of $0.06 shapes the Tokenomics model which guarantees Phase 3 participants will achieve 200% gains. Experts expect Mutuum Finance’s tokens to reach $3.07 following its launch resulting from its revenue-dependent purchase mechanism and_mtToken model which builds interest through time. Strategic Tokenomics Drive Demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) reduces token price volatility through its usage-based price mechanism. Part of protocol fees used to buy MUTM tokens on open markets provides stakers with redistributed tokens while maintaining market demand. MUTM maintains its position as a liquidity center through this preventative system together with overcollateralized loans and peer-to-peer lending operations. Investors who purchased MUTM tokens as low as $0.02 at the presale phase would reach a maximum gain of 200% in the beginning but could potentially earn a 2900% return through conservative market targets of $0.060. The presale experienced swift purchasing growth that indicates urgency because Phase 3 distribution levels fall before exchange listings start. A Calculated Opportunity Emerges MUTM provides immediate opportunities for investors since its performance remains independent of macroeconomic events which impact XRP. The presale framework employs a different strategy from speculative tokens because its approach provides clear pricing steps powered by real-world applications and accounting for specific increments. The market opportunity for investors to acquire MUTM at $0.02 price becomes more restricted as Phase 4 approaches and institutional investors show increased interest. Investors who value measurable growth above abstract projections should consider MUTM’s dual appeal of DeFi innovation along with mathematical advantages because the combination represents a hard-to-find asymmetric investment opportunity. Mutuum Finance demonstrates the evolution of decentralized finance by merging lending markets while giving financial rewards to those who enter early. The Ripple (XRP) raises its goals whereas MUTM develops its presale process faster. The price of Secure tokens stands at $0.02 during this phase so investors can secure them now before the upcoming market increase while anticipating over 15,000% profit growth in 2025. Presently you can sign up for Phase 3 at Mutuum Finance through their official website.

This consolidation phase often serves as a launching pad for a potential upward move as buyers step in. Traders are now eyeing key resistance levels, which, if broken, could trigger a short-term rally. As the crypto market shows signs of recovery, DOT’s technical setup and fundamentals suggest that a bullish breakout might be on the horizon. Could this be the start of a fresh rally for Polkadot? Market Sentiment Improves As Polkadot Holds Steady DOT is exhibiting resilience as it continues to hold firm above the $3.5 support zone, signaling a potential shift in market sentiment. This stability is a positive sign, suggesting that selling pressure is subsiding, allowing bullish momentum to build gradually. The market’s confidence in Polkadot appears to be improving, as reflected by steady buying interest and a noticeable slowdown in bearish activity. Related Reading: Polkadot Price Crisis: Further Losses Incoming After DOT Falls Under $4.8 Moreover, DOT’s resilience amid broader market shifts highlights its ability to attract demand at current levels. If market sentiment continues to improve, an upward push could be imminent. However, a decisive move above key resistance levels is needed to confirm a sustained recovery and prevent prolonged consolidation or a possible retracement. A key bullish signal emerges from the MACD indicator, which is gradually rising toward the average, hinting at a potential shift in momentum. This upward movement suggests that bearish pressure is fading, allowing buyers to regain control and build confidence in a possible trend reversal. As the MACD line approaches the average, buying interest has risen, which could translate into a stronger push toward higher price levels. If this trend continues, it may serve as an early indication of a breakout attempt. Short-Term Rally Or Fakeout? Key Levels To Monitor Polkadot’s price stability has sparked hopes for a short-term rally, but traders remain cautious about the possibility of a fakeout. Key resistance and support levels will be crucial in determining the next move. Related Reading: Polkadot Rebounds Slowly As Oversold Conditions Ignite Bullish Hopes A breakout above the $4.8 resistance level could serve as a strong confirmation of upside momentum, signaling increased buyer interest. Should this level be successfully breached, DOT may gain the necessary traction to push higher, targeting the resistance zones at $6.2 and $7.7. However, failure to sustain upward movement may indicate a lack of strong buying pressure, leading to a retracement toward $3.5. Monitoring price action around critical levels, volume, and technical indicators will be essential in assessing whether Polkadot is gearing up for a true breakout or merely experiencing a temporary uptick.

Strategic investments today could yield 100x returns by 2026. Trump’s Election Victory Sparks Renewed Altcoin Demand Demand for crypto assets spiked after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election in November 2024. While prices have retraced since his inauguration, institutional demand—one of the key forces behind last year’s rally—has only grown. Since the start of 2025, several altcoins have been targeted by U.S.-based corporate investors. Firms are racing to list altcoin ETFs as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) has relaxed its stance on crypto under the Trump administration. Litecoin ETF Approval Odds, March, 14 2025 | Source: Polymarket More so, the recent departure of Gary Gensler has led to the rollback of multiple regulatory sanctions, with the SEC dropping existing charges against Coinbase, Robinhood, Ripple (XRP), and Uniswap. This policy shift has significantly increased the likelihood of multiple altcoin ETFs receiving approval, further fueling institutional interest. According to Polymarket data , crypto bettors are now pricing in 70% chance of Litecoin ETF approvals, with similar odds inferred for all other altcoin with filings in progress. Here are five altcoins that could deliver astronomical returns as institutional adoption accelerates. 1. Cardano (ADA) Cardano has maintained its reputation as one of the most secure and decentralized proof-of-stake (PoS) networks. With growing enterprise adoption and strategic partnerships in Africa and Latin America, ADA is a prime candidate for institutional investment. If the SEC approves an ADA ETF, price discovery could push Cardano to new all-time highs. Cardano Price Action With ADA price currently trading at $0.7401, a move to $740.10 could turn a $100 investment into $100,000. 2. Solana (SOL) Solana has dominated the Layer-1 race, boasting lightning-fast transactions, low fees, and an expanding ecosystem. Recent partnerships with Visa and Shopify have strengthened its position as a leader in real-world blockchain applications. If institutions begin allocating large capital to SOL-based ETFs, a parabolic price surge is inevitable. Solana (SOL) Price Action With Solana price currently trading at $133.18, a move to $133,180 could turn a $100 investment into $100,000. 3. Litecoin (LTC) Litecoin has long been considered the silver to Bitcoin’s gold. With its strong security, low transaction fees, and recent privacy upgrades, LTC remains a favorite for institutional investors seeking a reliable store of value. The approval of an LTC ETF could trigger substantial price appreciation. Litecoin price action With Litecoin price currently trading at $91, a move to $91,000 could turn a $100 investment into $100,000. 4. Hedera (HBAR) Price Action Hedera Hashgraph is backed by major corporations, including Google, IBM, and Boeing. Its energy-efficient consensus mechanism and high-speed transactions make it an ideal choice for institutional adoption. With governments and enterprises integrating Hedera for tokenization and CBDCs, HBAR has massive upside potential. Hedera (HBAR) Price Action With Hedera price currently trading at $0.19, a move to $195 could turn a $100 investment into $100,000. 5. Aptos (APT) – The Next-Gen Blockchain Infrastructure Aptos, developed by ex-Meta engineers, is gaining traction as a high-performance Layer-1 blockchain designed for mass adoption. Its parallel execution engine enables unmatched scalability, making it attractive for institutions looking beyond Ethereum and Solana. With corporate backing growing, APT is a top pick for explosive growth. Aptos price action With Aptos price currently trading at $5.29, a move to $5,290 could turn a $100 investment into $100,000. Summary: With institutional capital flowing into crypto and regulatory hurdles fading, the next bull cycle is set to be historic. Smart investors positioning themselves in high-upside altcoins today could witness 100x gains by 2026. As the ETF narrative unfolds, Cardano, Solana, Litecoin, Hedera, and Aptos are poised for considerable growth as the year unfolds.

Meanwhile, XYZVerse Defies Market Trends With Massive Buying Momentum!",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/are-chainlink-and-pi-network-prices-about-to-surge-meanwhile-xyzverse-defies-market-trends-with-massive-buying-momentum/,"Signs point to significant shifts in the values of Chainlink and Pi Network tokens, hinting at possible upcoming price hikes. Meanwhile, XYZVerse is catching the eye by moving against the general market trends, showing strong buying interest. This piece explores the reasons behind these developments and what they could mean for those involved in digital currencies. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it’s attracting both sports fans and crypto enthusiasts, creating a unique crossover that’s gaining serious traction. With a strong presale and an engaged community, some investors are already eyeing major potential gains. More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.003333 by Stage 12, with over 70% of the $15 million milestone already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a final presale target price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” Of course, in crypto, nothing is guaranteed, but the excitement is undeniable. Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing that separates XYZVerse from the pack is the platform’s community engagement. Recently the team introduced the Ambassador Program, allowing users to earn free tokens by helping the project. And that’s only the beginning — major sports celebrities are already in discussions to help increase visibility. By unifying traditional sports fans with the fast-moving world of crypto, XYZVerse is creating something unique — something engaging and entertaining, not simply a way to win or lose. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With an ongoing presale, a dedicated community, and an ambitious vision, XYZVerse is generating buzz! Those components suggest serious potential. Although this case highlights the volatility of the crypto market, it is also perceived as an opportunity for many to have an early investment in something that could amount to a fortune in the future. The presale isn’t going to be around forever — so if you’re interested, now may be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Chainlink: Bridging Blockchain and Real-World Data Chainlink Bridge The gap between smart contracts and the real world This enables smart contracts to react to events outside the blockchain. Chainlink is a decentralized network of oracles that deliver reliable data with reputation scores to help ensure accuracy. When smart contracts run, they require real data; these oracles collect, verify and reliably transmit data to inviolable contracts. One of the standout projects in the crypto market today is Chainlink, which connects blockchain technology to the outside world and resolves a major issue that many aggressively marketed cryptocurrency has trouble solving — generating tangible use cases. With the increase in blockchain adoption, there will be an increasing requirement for reliable data, thus making LINK tokens a very good investment. A vital currency for builders, but it also goes beyond that into one of the most important technologies for decentralized applications of the future. Pi Network: Mining Cryptocurrency on Your Phone Made Easy Launched in 2019 by graduates of Stanford, Pi Network makes it easy to mine cryptocurrency on mobile phones. Users can mine Pi coins with little energy consumption, logging in daily from their smartphones to mine coins. Pi Network operates off of an expansive series of small, personal networks based on the notion of trust amongst peers, using the low-energy Stellar Consensus Protocol rather than the PoW systems used in the traditional model. It is now mainnet, although closed, with plans to open it as the users are vetted for identity verification in the future. By now, Pi Network’s aim is to be for the cryptocurrency available for everyone and build a strong community that may distinguish it from any other cryptocurrency in the world of Crypto. Conclusion Although Chainlink (LINK) and Pi Network (PI) provide different solutions to target various pain points and has great potential, XYZVerse (XYZ) shouldn’t be overlooked as it also has the upcoming sports-centric meme ecosystem alongside promising growth.

In the constantly evolving world of digital assets, Qubetics is emerging as a leader in offering tangible solutions that go beyond speculation. Alongside it, coins like Quant (QNT) and Toncoin (TON) have been making significant strides, each presenting unique opportunities for community members. This article dives deep into these three projects and explores their current updates, market performance, and their potential to reshape the future of finance. In the realm of real-world asset tokenization, Qubetics is setting the stage for what many believe will be the future of business and finance. From tokenizing real estate properties to simplifying complex financial transactions, Qubetics provides a seamless way for individuals, businesses, and professionals to access a more transparent and efficient digital economy. Let’s explore the latest updates on these three projects and why Qubetics is the best crypto under a penny for those looking to jump into an asset that promises both utility and future growth. Qubetics: Real-World Asset Tokenization Meets Blockchain Innovation Qubetics is revolutionizing the concept of digital asset ownership. By offering a marketplace for tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs), Qubetics solves a fundamental issue that many blockchain projects have struggled with: providing practical, real-life utility to the average user. For example, imagine tokenizing physical assets like real estate, art, or even rare collectibles. With Qubetics, businesses can now leverage blockchain technology to create fractional ownership of physical assets, making investments more accessible and transparent. The platform’s real world asset tokenization marketplace has the potential to disrupt industries ranging from real estate to finance. This technology will allow participants to easily trade shares of assets, thereby opening up markets that were previously reserved for the elite. As a result, even small businesses and everyday individuals will have access to new forms of capital, all while ensuring complete security and traceability through blockchain. Qubetics is already gaining momentum, with over $15 million raised in its presale and more than 23,000 token holders. The token price currently sits at $0.1074, but projections suggest that it could see a massive 831% return if it hits $1 after the presale ends. For community members who want to get in early, the crypto presale offers one of the best crypto opportunities under a penny. Qubetics is positioning itself as the best crypto under a penny for anyone looking to get into a groundbreaking project with real-world applications. Quant (QNT): Blockchain Interoperability Pioneer Quant (QNT) continues to redefine how blockchains communicate with one another. With the Quant Overledger, this platform allows different blockchain networks to work together seamlessly. Unlike other projects that focus on single-chain solutions, Quant focuses on enabling cross-chain interoperability, which is crucial as the blockchain ecosystem grows and diversifies. The project is seeing steady growth, with its market performance showing a 1.16% increase as of March 14, 2025. As of now, Quant is priced at approximately ₹6,622.22, reflecting the community’s trust in its long-term viability. With growing adoption across industries, Quant could serve as the backbone for enterprises seeking to integrate blockchain technology without the restrictions of siloed networks. While Quant’s ecosystem continues to expand, the technology’s potential to bridge traditional finance with blockchain-based solutions is one of its most exciting attributes. The project’s ongoing updates and developments position it as a strong contender in the crypto space, especially for professionals and businesses aiming for seamless blockchain integrations. Toncoin (TON): DeFi and Beyond Toncoin has faced its fair share of price volatility, with fluctuations ranging between $1.50 and $6.00. Despite these ups and downs, Toncoin remains a noteworthy player, especially with the TON Foundation’s recent launch of a 5 million Toncoin DeFi Incentive Program. This initiative aims to enhance the liquidity and adoption of USDt-TON pairs within Toncoin’s DeFi ecosystem, making it an attractive option for those seeking liquidity solutions within the space. However, Toncoin’s current challenge is a significant portion of its addresses being in loss territory. Despite this, the TON Foundation’s efforts to boost adoption and facilitate growth within the DeFi sector showcase Toncoin’s determination to recover and expand. As the project seeks to enhance its market position, participants may find opportunities to gain exposure to Toncoin at a discounted price, depending on market conditions. Toncoin’s current focus on decentralized finance highlights the shift toward community-driven ecosystems, making it a valuable asset for those looking to diversify their portfolios. Conclusion: Seizing the Future with Qubetics When it comes to the best crypto under a penny , Qubetics stands out due to its focus on real-world solutions and its potential to reshape digital finance. While Quant and Toncoin provide innovative blockchain solutions in their own right, Qubetics offers something unique—a bridge between the physical and digital world. Through its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace, Qubetics is providing businesses and individuals with new opportunities that other platforms simply cannot match. For community members looking for long-term value, getting in on Qubetics’ presale at such an early stage offers a chance for significant returns, with the potential for over 9,000% ROI upon mainnet launch.

If approved by the SEC, it would be the first-ever ETF tied to AVAX, marking a significant step for both the fund and the broader crypto space. “The Trust’s investment objective is to reflect the performance of the price of ‘AVAX,’ the native token of the Avalanche network, less the expenses of the Trust’s operations,” the filing noted. The VanEck Avalanche ETF will directly hold AVAX and determine its share value based on the MarketVector Avalanche Benchmark Rate. This rate combines pricing data from the five largest trading platforms, as identified in CCData’s exchange benchmark report. Analysts Place High Odds Of Approval James Seyffart from Bloomberg Intelligence stated on Friday that although the VanEck Avalanche ETF had been widely discussed earlier this week, this is the first official filing with the SEC. Besides, Several firms are seeking the SEC’s approval for different types of cryptocurrency ETFs, such as ones tracking SOL (Solana), XRP (Ripple), DOGE (Dogecoin), and LTC (Litecoin). Bloomberg ETF analysts have given a 90% chance of approval for a Litecoin-based ETF, while XRP and Solana have lower odds. Avalanche’s strong track record, including its role in Franklin Templeton’s tokenized fund, could help boost its chances for approval. Positive Regulatory Shift This push comes after the SEC approved the listing of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 and spot Ethereum ETFs in July 2024 under the previous administration, signaling a shift toward more crypto-related investment products being allowed in the market. In just a few weeks, the agency reversed its controversial crypto accounting rules, dropped enforcement actions against major crypto players, created a crypto task force, and even issued a statement on memecoins. This shift indicates a more open approach to the crypto space.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,REGULATION|AVAX|DOGE|LTC|SOL|XRP|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-15 02:41:18

Arctic Pablo Is Among the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now,https://thecoinrise.com/floki-inus-early-day-hype-faded-arctic-pablo-is-among-the-top-new-meme-coins-to-invest-in-now/,"Once upon a time, Floki Inu was the undisputed king of meme coin hype. A wild ride fueled by Elon Musk tweets and a devoted community saw Floki Inu explode onto the crypto scene, promising investors riches beyond their wildest dreams. Its early investors raked in astronomical gains, turning tiny investments into six and seven-figure fortunes. But as the dust settled and the hype cooled, many latecomers were left holding the bag. The once-thriving frenzy surrounding Floki Inu has waned, leaving crypto enthusiasts searching for the next big thing. If you missed out on Floki Inu’s early days and regret not getting in at those rock-bottom prices, there’s a fresh opportunity knocking at the door. Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) isn’t just another meme coin—it’s an entire experience, a thrilling adventure set in the mystical, ice-covered lands of the Arctic.

Right now, it’s stationed at Frosty Falls, the 14th location in its journey, with a jaw-dropping potential ROI of 10,694.59%. This is the kind of early entry point investors dream about.

Armed with sheer determination and a snowmobile, he carves through icy landscapes, unearthing the legendary Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC). These aren’t just any tokens—they are mystical artifacts infused with the power of forgotten lands, ready to bring wealth to those who dare to claim them. Right now, Arctic Pablo Coin is stationed at Frosty Falls, the 14th location in its journey.

With a total raise of over $1.88 million, this expedition is gaining serious momentum. The presale isn’t just a way to buy tokens—it’s an immersive experience. Unlike Floki, where external endorsements drove the hype, Arctic Pablo is all about the journey. Each week, Pablo advances to a new location, and the price of $APC rises with him. Investors who get in now can potentially see over 10,694.59% returns by the time the presale concludes. But that’s not all.

The 66% APY staking program allows investors to earn substantial passive income while securing their place in the Arctic Pablo ecosystem. With its unique approach, deflationary mechanism, and compelling narrative, Arctic Pablo isn’t just another meme coin—it’s an adventure. The hype is just beginning; those who seize this opportunity could see life-changing gains. It is one of the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now. Floki Inu: The Rise, the Hype, and the Fizzle Floki Inu entered the market as part of the wave of dog-themed meme coins that followed Dogecoin’s success. With a powerful narrative tied to Elon Musk’s dog and a name straight out of Viking mythology, Floki Inu quickly built a dedicated following. Early investors saw exponential gains as the coin surged in value, leveraging aggressive marketing campaigns, celebrity endorsements, and strategic partnerships to fuel its ascent. At its peak, Floki Inu’s market cap soared into the billions, and investors who got in at the ground floor celebrated life-changing gains. However, as the crypto space evolved, the hype that once propelled Floki Inu began to wane. The market’s appetite for new and exciting meme coins led investors to fresh opportunities, leaving Floki struggling to maintain its former glory. Despite various ecosystem developments, including FlokiFi and its metaverse Valhalla, the magic that once made Floki Inu a must-have investment isn’t as potent as it once was. Those who missed the early train are left wondering if there’s a new, high-reward opportunity out there. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, the era of Floki Inu’s explosive gains may be over, but the search for the next top-performing meme coin continues. Arctic Pablo Coin has everything investors look for in an early-stage meme project—scarcity, staking rewards, a unique narrative, and an engaged community. Right now, the window of opportunity is still wide open, but it won’t last long. With the price set to rise every week and unsold tokens permanently burned, waiting too long could mean missing out on a potential 100x opportunity. If you’ve ever regretted not getting into Floki Inu early, don’t make the same mistake twice. Join the Arctic Pablo meme coin presale now and be part of the greatest meme coin adventure of 2025.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are beginning to bounce off an important Fibonacci level, and Solana is still showing a short-term bullish divergence. However, XRP is breaking out above a critical resistance zone. Currently, XRP continues to face bearish pressure, particularly on the 3-day time frame. The chart reveals a significant bearish divergence, suggesting that a sustained bullish momentum is not likely in the near future. According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, this signal on the larger time frames indicates that a major upward movement is not expected. However, short-term bullish movements remain possible. Recent Price Movements and Support Levels XRP has recently bounced off key support levels, particularly between $1.95 and $2.25. For several hours, the price struggled to break past a short-term resistance zone in the $2.25 to $2.30 range. However, a positive shift occurred with a confirmed breakout, as the price closed above $2.30 on an 8-hour candle, signaling a potential short-term bullish trend. Resistance Levels to Watch Looking ahead, the next key resistance levels for XRP are expected to be between $2.65 and $2.80. If the price continues to rise, additional resistance may appear near the $3 mark. In the short term, potential resistance could be seen around $2.50 and $2.38–$2.40, as previous support zones could now act as resistance. Bitcoin’s Influence on XRP Price To predict XRP’s price movements more accurately, monitoring Bitcoin’s price trends is crucial. If Bitcoin experiences short-term bullish relief, XRP and many altcoins are likely to follow suit.

Why the Market Crashed Despite the President’s Crypto Support,https://dailyhodl.com/2025/03/14/trump-to-the-rescue-why-the-market-crashed-despite-the-presidents-crypto-support/,"HodlX Guest Post Submit Your Post At the beginning of 2025, Donald Trump’s return to power led to a sharp revision of the government’s crypto policy and explosive market movements. The Trump administration declared a pro-crypto stance, from establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve to softening the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) positions. However, instead of a prolonged rally, the Web 3.0 industry faced volatility and liquidity outflows. Why did the market drop despite expectations of support The key question is why the crypto market declined when many believed that a pro-Republican administration would drive growth instead. The effect of unmet expectations According to experts, the market had already priced in the ‘best-case scenario.’ When the anticipated multi-billion-dollar government Bitcoin purchases turned out to be mere verbal commitments with no actual buying, traders rushed to take profits. Essentially, the classic rule of ‘buy the rumor, sell the news’ played out. However, the government fund did not start purchasing BTC , removing a strong hypothetical growth driver and instead triggering a sell-off. Institutional investors used the rally to exit Large funds began selling BTC and ETH futures as early as February 2025, locking in profits from December 2024’s peaks. By March, this trend had intensified. The futures curve flipped into backwardation (futures prices falling below spot prices) – a typical signal of declining capital inflows. The broader macroeconomic landscape triggered the market decline Simultaneously, Trump launched a trade confrontation, announcing 25% tariffs on Mexican imports and 50% on Canadian imports starting in March. This sparked economic concerns – t reasury yields dropped, and the S&P 500 index retreated to post-election lows. Cryptocurrencies – as risk assets – also came under pressure, further intensified by news of a Bybit hack. Analysts note that macroeconomic factors were the primary driver of March’s price decline, overshadowing any positive sentiment from Trump’s actions. As a result, while the new president’s policies were officially more crypto-friendly, they did not immediately bring a liquidity influx. Instead, speculative excitement gave way to a correction phase. Which Web 3.0 projects were affected A hit to funds and liquidity The first weeks of March saw significant capital outflows from the crypto market , impacting funds, exchange-traded products and decentralized finance (DeFi). In the last week of February, investors withdrew a record $2.6 billion from US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) – the largest weekly outflow since their inception. This capital flight caused the total cryptocurrency market capitalization to shrink from approximately $3.7 trillion in December to $3.1 trillion by the end of February. The DeFi sector took a blow TVL (total value locked) in DeFi protocols declined by roughly $45 billion over the winter. The growth accumulated after Trump’s election – with TVL reaching $138 billion by December – completely evaporated. By March 10, TVL had fallen to $92.6 billion, returning to early November levels. Crypto hedge funds and arbitrage traders suffered losses Crypto hedge funds and arbitrage traders faced heavy losses as market structure changes disrupted their strategies. First, the popular ‘cash-and-carry’ arbitrage between futures and spot markets disappeared. Previously, funds profited from a positive basis by going long on spot BTC – including through ETFs – while shorting futures, earning returns higher than Treasury yields. However, as the market fell, futures prices dropped below spot prices, collapsing the basis and rendering this arbitrage unprofitable. Funds specializing in altcoins were also hit hard. In early March, an anomaly occurred – Bitcoin initially declined more than most altcoins, causing BTC dominance in total market capitalization to drop by five percentage points within a week. This temporary capital rotation into altcoins – as investors sought higher returns in less liquid assets before a major summit – could have severely impacted funds with poorly calibrated risk models. However, after the summit, altcoins crashed at an even faster rate, pushing BTC’s dominance back to approximately 61%. Investment outflows and capital flow shifts By March, it became clear – c rypto ecosystem capital flows had reversed. Institutional investors and funds were pulling out, falling prices triggered margin liquidations and arbitrage unwinding and retail investors were scared off by high volatility. All of this reduced available funding for Web 3.0 startups. Venture capital investments, already declining in 2024, fell even further in early 2025. Additionally, regulatory uncertainty remains high. While the SEC has eased its crackdown, no concrete new rules have been enacted yet. A stablecoin regulation bill is expected in August, raising concerns about potential strict oversight for DeFi and stablecoin-related projects. This creates a stressful environment for Web 3.0 businesses, requiring founders to take proactive steps to safeguard their projects. What should Web 3.0 founders do right now Given the current landscape, founders should plan for two phases – stabilization and growth. In the stabilization phase, the key priorities are preserving resources, maintaining the team, refining the product and satisfying existing users. Founders must avoid unnecessary risk. Now is not the time for speculative bets or reckless treasury management. Instead, focus on achievable short-term goals – delivering promised features, fixing issues and improving UX. This will help maintain and grow an active user base, attracting investors when they return. During the growth phase, as the market rebounds, scaling ahead of competitors will be crucial. This means having a well-prepared strategy for acquiring users and capital. For example, if you’re running a DeFi protocol, plan a liquidity mining program or partnerships with wallets to capture market share when fresh liquidity arrives. If you’re an infrastructure project, collaborate with corporations that may begin integrating blockchain in 2025 as regulations become clearer. Web 3.0 startups should start thinking like Web 2.0 businesses with a clear business model, strong value proposition and path to profitability. The projects that will thrive are those with real revenue, engaged users and fundamental utility. Founders should honestly evaluate their projects – i f the product doesn’t solve a real problem or lacks product-market fit, it may be time to pivot or merge with other teams before it’s too late. Conversely, if there’s a solid core, doubling down on execution will position the project as a leader when the next cycle begins. Conclusion The current crypto market correction – driven by both Trump’s policies and external factors – differs from past downturns due to the heightened role of institutional players and new structural dynamics such as ETFs and arbitrage. Bitcoin now reacts not just to retail demand but also to moves by major funds and governments, introducing new forms of volatility. However, fundamentally, the Web 3.0 industry is gaining something invaluable – political support at the highest level of the US government – even if driven by questionable motives. This lays the groundwork for long-term growth. Challenging months lie ahead, but the projects that navigate the storm will be at the forefront of the next bull run.

The index jumped 2.13% to close at 5,638.94, which is its biggest one-day gain of the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average spiked 674.62 points to end at 41,488.19, while the Nasdaq Composite surged 2.61%, closing at 17,754.09. After weeks of brutal losses, traders rushed back in, sending stocks flying. Tech stocks led the charge. Nvidia soared over 5%, Tesla jumped by nearly 4%, and Meta gained close to 3%. Amazon and Apple also rallied. The market snapped back after Thursday’s sharp sell-off, which had dragged the S&P 500 into correction territory—down by 10% from its record close just 16 days ago. The Nasdaq had already fallen into correction, and the Russell 2000 was inching toward a bear market, down nearly 20% from its peak. Stocks rally as tariff fears fade for now After three weeks of chaos driven by President Donald Trump’s trade policies, stocks finally caught a break. No new tariff headlines came out of the White House on Friday, giving traders a reason to buy back into beaten-down stocks. The market had been spiraling in uncertainty, with Trump’s back-and-forth on tariffs keeping investors on edge. Even with Friday’s rally, the Dow still ended the week down by 3.1%, its worst performance since March 2023. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both lost more than 2%, logging their fourth straight weekly drop, according to data from CNBC. Adding to the market’s relief, Chuck Schumer said he wouldn’t block a Republican government funding bill, easing concerns about a potential shutdown. But fresh economic data wasn’t as optimistic. The University of Michigan reported that consumer confidence dropped to 57.9, far below the expected 63.2. Tariff uncertainty, inflation concerns, and stock market volatility have left consumers uneasy. Traders are questioning whether Friday’s bounce was just a dead cat bounce or if markets have finally found a bottom. Thomas Martin, a portfolio manager at Globalt Investments, isn’t convinced. “Consumer sentiment came in worse, inflation expectations are rising, the 10-year Treasury yield is rising. You would think that the market would be off. So a lot of folks are watching to see if this rally has any breadth or legs,” he said . Investors focus on the Federal Reserve’s next move The next big test for the market comes next week when the Federal Reserve holds its policy meeting. CME’s FedWatch Tool puts the odds of rates staying unchanged at 97%, but traders will be listening closely to Jerome Powell’s post-meeting comments for any hint of future moves. Martin warned that any rate hikes would shake investor confidence. “What we would like to see is rates not go up, because that would be an indication that the Fed is losing control. If the Fed says they’re cutting and rates go up, that’s a lack of confidence,” he said. Investors are also watching upcoming economic reports, including retail sales, housing starts, and industrial production. The market is on edge after airlines and retailers issued warnings about weakening consumer demand. Airline CEOs from American, Delta, and Southwest have all slashed their first-quarter forecasts, citing slowing travel. Kohl’s and Dick’s Sporting Goods also signaled that 2025 would be a rough year. The S&P 500 remains in a fragile state. Vishal Khanduja, who runs broad markets fixed income at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, doesn’t think stocks have hit bottom yet. “We don’t think that we’ve seen the bottom. Volatility will be high, so there could be a little bit more downside before there is clarity from the policy side,” he said. Nvidia’s GTC event and global markets add to uncertainty While the Federal Reserve and economic data will dominate headlines, tech investors are locked in on Nvidia’s GTC developer conference next week. Jensen Huang will take the stage to talk about AI and the company’s next-gen chips. Nvidia, which has been in a bear market after falling by more than 20% from its highs, could see a major move. According to Wells Fargo, Nvidia has historically outperformed the SOXX index by 6.5 percentage points during GTC week. Meanwhile, Germany is reacting to Trump’s policies. Friedrich Merz, the leader of the Conservative Party, has unveiled plans to change the country’s “debt brake” to boost military spending. The German 10-year bund yield has already climbed by 2.9%, up from 2.3% last month, showing that markets are preparing for fiscal policy changes from Trump.

Pi Network, a cryptocurrency that allows users to mine coins via their smartphones, has experienced significant price swings since its mainnet launch and subsequent exchange listings. After an initial spike to $2.10, the value of Pi Coin dropped to $1, causing a wave of speculation regarding a potential Binance listing. However, Binance has stated that there is no official confirmation of such a listing, leaving the claims unverified. Currently, Pi Coin is trading at $1.47, with the price hovering just below the $1.50 mark. The weekend could potentially see further downward pressure, but Pi has managed to stay above $1, maintaining a strong position amidst market uncertainty. There are expectations of a potential bull run, which could drive the coin’s value even higher in the near future. If Pi manages to close above the $1.50 mark, a continued rally could follow, potentially pushing the price to $2 or higher. With the broader market sentiment turning positive, Pi’s price could reverse in a favorable direction. Pi Network Faces Migration Issues, Coin Price Drops 10% Pi Network users who have completed their KYC (Know Your Customer) process are facing challenges transferring their Pi tokens. The issue, reportedly coming from the PI$PI team, has led to a 10% drop in the coin’s price over the past 24 hours. Despite this, the Pi Network’s economy continues to expand, with more businesses across China accepting Pi for real-world transactions, from restaurants to retail shops.

However, it sparked a heated debate within the Democratic party on how to confront Donald Trump. The vote was 62-38, with 10 Democrats joining almost all Republicans in supporting the bill. Under pressure from his left and House Democrats to block the GOP bill, Schumer kept his plan quiet all week. But on Thursday, he said he would support the bill, allowing other Democrats to do the same and reducing the risk of a big shutdown during tough economic times. Shutdown Would Be Far Worse Schumer noted that while the funding bill isn’t ideal, allowing a government shutdown would give Trump and DOGE too much power, which would be even worse. He believes a shutdown would give them too much control over the country. Notably, nine Democrats joined Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer to support a bill to prevent a government shutdown, giving up some Democratic power over President Trump for now. These Democrats are a mix of moderates, Schumer’s allies, senators from states with many federal workers, and those close to retirement. They agreed with Schumer that Trump and Elon Musk could cause more harm during a shutdown than with the bill, which was mainly created by Republicans. Schumer said that the decision to avoid a shutdown is now up to Trump, Elon Musk, and DOGE, warning that a shutdown could last six to nine months and would be very unpredictable. Some party critics argue Schumer gave up a rare chance to use his leverage too quickly, after House Republicans passed a spending bill with Trump’s support. “I’ll take Some Bullets,” Says Schumer The vote was mostly split between parties, 54-46. Many Democrats were frustrated, feeling the bill didn’t address key issues like healthcare and housing. Schumer said that he was ready to face criticism from both moderate House members and angry progressives, saying, “I’ll take some of the bullets.” The nine senators who supported him may also face political backlash, but none of them are likely to face immediate challenges in their next election. Schumer’s decision to support the GOP funding bill upset House Democrats. They had voted against it earlier. House leaders, like Hakeem Jeffries, wanted a short-term funding bill to give more time to negotiate. They said the GOP bill gave too much power to Trump and cut important services. It also cut spending in Washington, D.C. Senate Republicans, like John Thune, said Democrats didn’t finish last year’s budget, which led to another stopgap bill. However, the president praised Chuck Schumer for making the right decision, calling it a courageous and bold move.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,REGULATION|DOGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-15 04:01:51

Connolly has called on the US Treasury Department to immediately halt efforts to establish a strategic cryptocurrency reserve. Connolly, who serves as the Ranking Member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, raised concerns over what he described as a blatant conflict of interest, arguing that the initiative appears designed to enrich Trump and his financial backers rather than serve the broader American public. His formal request was outlined in a letter sent on March 13 to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Connolly Challenges Trump’s Crypto Reserve The controversy stems from Trump’s executive order which was signed earlier in March. It details the creation of a federal Bitcoin reserve capitalized with approximately 200,000 Bitcoin already in the government’s possession. In addition, the order establishes the US Digital Asset Stockpile, a separate entity tasked with managing forfeited digital assets, including Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. While the administration has stated that the reserve aims to strengthen the country’s leadership in digital financial technology, Connolly contends that the initiative is a misguided policy decision that could undermine economic stability while disproportionately benefiting the president’s personal business ventures. Central to Connolly’s objections is Trump’s financial interest in the World Liberty Financial Initiative (WLFI). He warned that Trump’s personal stake in the company presents an alarming conflict of interest, as any government policy that boosts cryptocurrency values would directly enhance the profitability of Trump’s business interests. Additionally, the lawmaker pointed to Trump’s controversial involvement in the memecoin Official Trump (TRUMP). Critics have described the token as a speculative money-making scheme, while Connolly said that Trump and his allies stand to gain financially from its volatility. Adding to the scrutiny, Connolly took issue with the manner in which the cryptocurrency reserve is being implemented and highlighted that the US President has not sought congressional authorization for the initiative. By sidestepping legislative input, the administration’s approach raises concerns over transparency and accountability in the handling of federal financial policy. Connolly’s letter cited a Federal Reserve official who dismissed the cryptocurrency reserve plan as “the dumbest idea” ever proposed. Connolly has urged the Treasury Department to abandon all efforts to move forward with the strategic cryptocurrency reserve and requested a full briefing on the matter by March 27. As opposition mounts, the debate over Trump’s cryptocurrency policies is expected to intensify. Meanwhile, lawmakers and financial experts continue weighing the implications of a federal government-backed digital asset reserve. Crypto Market in Turmoil Following Trump’s March 6 executive order establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve, crypto markets experienced a sharp downturn. Bitcoin, for one, plummeted from over $93,400 to a low of $77,234 in a span of less than a week. While the price has since staged a partial recovery to $83,176, investor sentiment remains fragile as broader macroeconomic uncertainty continues to weigh on the market. Altcoins also suffered significant losses, with Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano posting double-digit declines in the aftermath of the announcement.

Sacks’ sales of his assets are very different from others in the administration and come after Trump’s first term, where conflicts of interest were often ignored. Sacks Responds To Criticisms Sacks responded to criticism from officials like Senator Elizabeth Warren, who raised concerns about his financial ties to cryptocurrencies. Ahead of the White House Crypto Summit, Senator Warren sent a letter to Sacks, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest and urging him to disclose his holdings in bitcoin, ether, solana, and other assets linked to Trump’s strategic reserve proposal. Sacks and his venture firm sold all their cryptocurrency, including bitcoin, ether, solana, and shares in Coinbase and Robinhood. He also started selling his stake in crypto investment funds like Multicoin Capital and Blockchain Capital. He still has a small amount of digital assets left, less than 0.1% of his total investments, and plans to sell them soon. President Trump holds a major stake in Trump Media & Technology Group, which owns Truth Social, and has launched several crypto projects that could be affected by government policies. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, and other companies, is also one of Trump’s top advisers and could influence regulations to benefit his businesses. Cabinet Members Hold Major Stakes Just days before his inauguration, Trump launched a meme token called TRUMP through his company CIC Digital LLC, which controls 80% of the coin. The Trump family also gets 75% of the profits from a crypto bank called World Liberty Financial, launched last year. Besides, Musk, heading DOGE, relies on government contracts like SpaceX’s $1.8 billion deal for spy satellites. Also, reports also show that several cabinet members, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, have significant investments in cryptocurrencies.

This marks a significant shift in Wall Street’s attitude toward digital assets, especially as many major banks are slowly adapting to the crypto market. In the 2024 letter, Goldman Sachs opened up about the increasing competition brought by new technologies, including cryptocurrencies and AI, which have reshaped financial markets. The bank also noted that its competitors might offer crypto products that Goldman Sachs currently does not provide, further emphasizing the growing demand for such services. The company said, “We also compete on the basis of the types of financial products and client experiences that we and our competitors offer. In some circumstances, our competitors may offer financial products that we do not offer and that our clients may prefer, including cryptocurrencies and other digital assets that we cannot or may choose not to provide.” “The growth of electronic trading and the introduction of new products and technologies, including trading and distributed ledger technologies, such as cryptocurrencies, and AI technologies, has increased competition,” the company added. Goldman’s decision to mention cryptocurrencies contrasts with its previous stance. Up until 2017, terms like “cryptocurrency” and “blockchain” were absent from the firm’s annual shareholder letters. However, the success of Bitcoin and the broader embrace of crypto by various sectors, including the Trump administration, have forced a shift in perspective. Goldman Sachs has already taken steps to enter the crypto space. In 2021, it launched a crypto desk, followed by a digital asset platform in 2022. The bank has also tested blockchain-based systems such as the Canton Network. Experts believe that Goldman Sachs’ acknowledgment of crypto indicates broader industry trends. The bank, along with others, is preparing for the future of tokenized financial products and blockchain integration.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,FIAT|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-15 04:49:42

Colin Langan, an analyst at the bank, lowered his 12-month price target from $135 to $130 on Friday and maintained an underweight rating. His new forecast means the company could drop 46% from where it is now. The Wall Street average price target for Tesla is $372, but Langan’s outlook tells a different story. “We’ve been bearish on Tesla’s sales and margins since last year, and the concerns were largely correct,” Langan said . He pointed to a 40% drop in European sales this year, which triggered the latest stock decline. That’s not the only problem. Protests and vandalism have hit the company’s facilities, and with no sales growth in sight, Langan believes the stock’s downward momentum will continue. Tesla’s European sales collapse adds to the crisis Tesla is on track for its eighth straight weekly loss, the longest losing streak since it went public in 2010. In Europe, the company’s January sales fell 45%. The problem is bigger than just weak demand. The company is dealing with political backlash after Elon Musk backed Germany’s far-right AfD party in recent elections. The response has been brutal. Customers are abandoning the brand, and the company’s facilities in Europe have been vandalized. Langan says many investors saw weaker profits coming, but they didn’t want to bet against the stock. Now, they don’t have a choice. “Despite the 40% drop this year, we still see another 40% downside,” he said. “If fundamentals matter, the momentum likely turns negative as consensus estimates fall.” It isn’t the only company losing support. UBS and Redburn Atlantic have also reiterated sell ratings, adding to the pressure. Tesla and SpaceX fight U.S. trade policies Tesla isn’t just battling falling demand. The company is also getting hit by tariffs. On Friday, Tesla and SpaceX sent letters to U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, raising concerns about Trump’s tariff policies. Tesla’s letter, submitted by Miriam Eqab, associate general counsel, said U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods are driving up the cost of Tesla’s U.S.-made vehicles. “U.S. exporters are disproportionately impacted when other countries retaliate against U.S. trade actions,” the letter said . The company warned that these tariffs are making its vehicles less competitive, both at home and overseas. SpaceX had a different problem. The company’s Starlink satellite service is facing foreign trade barriers that increase its costs. “The import duties in some countries significantly increase Starlink’s operating costs, while the U.S. has no such tariffs on competing products,” said Mat Dunn, senior director of global business and government affairs at SpaceX. The letters were part of a public comment process, with over 700 companies responding to Trump’s trade policies. But the message was clear: tariffs are making its cars more expensive, damaging sales, and cutting into profitability. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Bulls have lost control, with SOL plunging over 37% since the start of March, reflecting the broader market’s risk-off sentiment. Related Reading: Dogecoin Network Activity Surges 47% In A Month – What’s Next for DOGE? The downturn isn’t limited to crypto—trade war fears and macroeconomic uncertainty have pushed the crypto and U.S. stock markets to their lowest levels since late 2024. With investor confidence deteriorating, SOL remains in a vulnerable position, failing to reclaim critical price levels. Despite the recent weakness, some analysts see potential for a turnaround. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared insights on X, highlighting that Solana is forming a textbook cup-and-handle pattern, a bullish technical formation that could lead to a breakout. If this pattern plays out, SOL could reclaim higher price levels, reversing some of its recent losses. For now, Solana must overcome key resistance levels before confirming a bullish trend. If market conditions improve, SOL could see renewed momentum, but failure to hold current support could result in further downside. The next few weeks will be critical in determining Solana’s short-term direction. Solana Bullish Setup Hints at a Potential Breakout Solana is currently trading below the $130 mark, struggling to establish a foundation for a recovery phase. The broader market downturn continues to weigh heavily on SOL, with volatility and speculation driving short-term price action. With bears still in control, Solana’s direction remains uncertain, and short-term sentiment remains bearish. Despite the recent decline, many investors remain hopeful that SOL is poised for a significant recovery once the broader market starts trending upward. Optimism comes from historical patterns, where Solana has shown strong comebacks following extended periods of selling pressure. Related Reading: Ethereum Net Taker Volume Signals Huge Selling Pressure – Can Bulls Hold Key Levels? Martinez’s long-term technical analysis on X highlights that Solana is forming a textbook cup-and-handle pattern, a bullish formation that often precedes major breakouts. SOL could potentially surge to $3,800 if price action confirms this pattern, marking an astonishing 2,900% gain from current levels. The next few days will be crucial as Solana and the broader crypto market attempt to establish local lows and build momentum for a potential rebound. If market sentiment shifts and key resistance levels are reclaimed, SOL could be one of the top performers in the next primary bullish phase. Price Struggles Around $125 Solana is currently trading around $125, facing resistance at the $130 level after multiple failed attempts to reclaim it. With bears still in control, SOL remains under selling pressure, and bulls must act quickly to avoid further declines. For a recovery to take shape, SOL needs to break above the $130 mark and push toward $150. If bulls manage to reclaim this key level, it will signal renewed buying strength, potentially setting the stage for a larger recovery rally. A move past $150 could shift market sentiment and open the door for higher price targets. However, if SOL fails to hold the current demand, a further downside is likely. A drop below $125 could send the price toward lower support levels between $100 and $105, a zone where buyers may step in to stabilize the price.

Optimism grows among those beyond crypto natives Paul said that while traders and analysts have turned bearish on crypto recently, crypto developers — and more broadly, those working for crypto companies less focused on the market cycle itself — remain much more bullish. “All the data points I’m hearing from basically any crypto-related project or company that doesn’t rely on “natives” near-term is positive,” Paul said. Source: Nic Puckrin Based on this, he’s confident that crypto is a “good buy” over the “12 month timeframe” but isn’t sure if it has reached a short-term bottom yet. Crypto analyst Matthew Hyland recently said the only way for Bitcoin to confirm that the bottom is actually in would be to close a week back above $89,000. However, on March 14, the broader crypto market rose slightly, giving traders a bit more short-term confidence. Bitcoin ( BTC ) spiked 3.16% to $84,638 over the 24 hour period, while Ether ( ETH ) rose 1.79% and XRP ( XRP ) jumped 6.01%, according to CoinMarketCap. Over the same 24 hours, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index , which measures overall crypto market sentiment, surged 19 points to 46, which is still in the “Fear” zone but nearing neutral territory. Source: Dan McArdle MN Trading Capital founder Michael van de Poppe said Bitcoin’s price spike over the past 24 hours has strengthened his confidence in the asset resuming its uptrend by June. Crypto market presenting opportunity for “sustainable value” investments “Clearly made a higher low, clearly touching the highs,” van de Poppe said in a March 14 X post. Related: Bitcoin bull market in peril as US recession and tariff worries loom “It’s very likely that we’re starting a new uptrend on the lower timeframes going into a good Q2,” he added. Paul also said it may be the right time to explore traditional venture capital crypto investments with a longer-term outlook. “A good time to be looking for “traditional” style VC crypto investments. By “traditional” I mean longer term, genuinely focusing on sustainable value creation, no quick monetization scheme,” Paul said.

SEC’s Latest Move Explained!,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-set-to-skyrocket-secs-latest-move-explained/,"The post XRP Price Set to Skyrocket? SEC’s Latest Move Explained! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After years of legal challenges under Biden’s administration, Ripple Labs can finally take a breath as Donald Trump’s administration seeks to tap XRP to implement its strategic Bitcoin (BTC) reserve . According to a recent comprehensive proposal by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), XRP is not a security but a strategic financial asset for the country. According to the proposal, XRP can help unlock $27 trillion in global nostro accounts, starting with the $5 trillion share of the United States. From this, the United States will release $1.5 trillion through using XRP, and be directed to purchasing Bitcoin. “Donald Trump’s recent comments regarding a Bitcoin reserve have led to confusion about the U.S. government’s cryptocurrency strategy. While Bitcoin serves as a strategic digital reserve asset, other cryptocurrencies such as XRP, Solana, and Cardano could play critical roles in the national digital economy,” the SEC’s proposal noted . XRP Legal Clarity Pathway According to the proposal, XRP should be classified as a payment network and not a security. Such a move by the U.S. SEC will enable the settlement of the ongoing legal dispute with Ripple. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction For March 15 , Additionally, the proposal highlighted that the Department of Justice must remove restrictions for banks to enable XRP-based transactions. Finally, the proposal noted that the Federal Reserve and the OCC must mandate the use of XRP for bank liquidity solutions through integration with the XRPL network. The U.S. SEC has set out a standard implementation timeline of 24 months or an accelerated schedule of between 6-12 months. Expected Impact The imminent legal clarity for XRP in the coming months will trigger a major bull run potentially akin to 2017. Already, the XRP price has broken out of a six-year consolidation and is in the process of entreating price discovery in the near future. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Upon seeing the perks, terms, and utility it brings, LTC and HBAR holders promptly joined the $FXG public presale, boosting their crypto portfolio with a token that shows massive long-term potential. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Has Litecoin Fallen Behind? Even though Litecoin is a well-known name in the crypto market, it has failed to generate much buzz lately. Namely, as competition becomes fierce, with crypto players adapting new technologies and adding new features, Litecoin seems to have fallen a bit behind. Still, Litecoin remains a force to be reckoned with, having amassed many loyal LTC fans over the years. And with a market cap of over $7.8 billion, Litecoin continues to be one of the bigger crypto players. However, the recent LTC movements are far from Litecoin’s prime. Currently trading at $103.31, LTC has lost over 18% of its value in the past week alone. Experts and many LTC holders attribute the recent poor performance of Litecoin to the lack of innovation and interest from outside investors. Moreover, LTC holders themselves have begun to look for other investments to add to their crypto portfolio in hopes of boosting their earnings, with FXGuys being the most popular choice. This new crypto trading platform offers everything Litecoin does not – innovation, utility, perks, great terms. So, it’s no wonder that many LTC holders have added it to their crypto portfolio. Hedera Surges After Its Partnership With SWIFT After partnering with SWIFT, a global payment network, Hedera has been surging. The HBAR price increased by over 19% in the past week and it currently trades at $0.24. This has caused a major shift in the Hedera community, with the confidence of HBAR holders soaring. Experts believe that if the Hedera community manages to keep this momentum, the HBAR price could increase by a further 10% in the following week. However, as Hedera fails to capture the attention of outside investors, experts predict that the HBAR price will go down to $0.1. As it turns out, many HBAR holders agree with this sentiment, and have decided to invest in FXGuys, a new crypto trading platform that shows massive growth potential. HBAR holders see $FXG as the perfect token to boost their crypto portfolio, rushing to its public presale to stock up before its price surges. FXGuys’ New Crypto Trading Platform: Bringing Utility and Huge Growth Potential to Life Despite being a new crypto trading platform, FXGuys has quickly become the go-to investment for all those looking to create a better crypto portfolio. Those who don’t know about FX Guys and what it brings might find this hard to believe. But those who do know about this new crypto trading platform know exactly why $FXG has become one of the most popular tokens in the market. So let’s explore the reasons. First off, FXGuys offers incredible perks and benefits, some of them being same-day payouts and unlimited withdrawals. This combo enables traders to manage and take out their money whenever they want to without worrying about delays. Additionally, FXGuys is a great place to learn and improve, offering features like charts, AI trading tools, and copy trading. Moreover, investors can now test out FXGuys for themselves as FX Guys recently launched a free trial for its BETA trading platform. This is something that does not often happen with DeFi presales, as most of them do not release anything until the presale has ended. This move by FXGuys has boosted investor confidence even more, especially since positive feedback continues to roll in each day. This new crypto trading platform is also a great place for traders who need funding. Namely, FXGuys provides excellent terms for funded traders, including an 80/20 profit split and access to $500,000 in funds. This way, funded traders will be able to make thousands in profits with just one FX Guys account. Traders will also benefit from incredible rewards on this new crypto trading platform. One of them is the FXGuys Trade2Earn program, which allows traders to earn $FXG tokens by simply making trades. Another is the FX Guys staking rewards platform, which traders can use to earn a share of the FXGuys trading volume and fees by staking their $FXG tokens. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE $FXG: The Perfect Addition to Your Crypto Portfolio The perks, utility, and massive growth potential have made $FXG the must-have token in every crypto portfolio. Currently in Stage 3 of its public presale, $FXG is available for $0.05, making this the perfect time to stock up on this incredible token before its price rises. Once $FXG reaches $0.10 and launches, its first rally will start. Experts say this rally will bring 100x gains to $FXG holders by Q2 of 2025! But the growth will not stop there as experts predict $FXG will rise even more before 2025 ends.

The company argues that its competitors from foreign countries have no such import restrictions in the United States. According to a Reuters report , SpaceX sent a letter to the US Trade Representative Office on Tuesday. The letter described the requirements imposed on the company as a “protectionist non-tariff trade barrier.” SpaceX must pay additional costs to foreign governments for Starlink to access their spectrum. These costs include imports of Starlink equipment and other regulatory charges. Such payments lead to “artificially” increased international operating expenses. Starlink operates in over 120 countries. However, to run its service, it must coordinate spectrum sharing with local satellite operators in some countries. Matt Dunn, SpaceX’s senior director for global government affairs, stated in the letter that “foreign operators have used these anti-competitive policies to block or slow SpaceX from providing a better quality and lower cost service to customers in those countries.” SpaceX has raised these concerns during the rising tensions regarding trade limitations for US companies. Tesla also sent a letter urging the US to consider the downstream impacts of trade restrictions SpaceX’s letter is among the 700 sent to the trade representative office in response to his invitation to take a public stance about “unfair trade practices by other countries.” These responses are available on a public portal . In another letter sent to Jamieson Greer, Musk’s Tesla requested that USTR “consider the downstream impacts of certain proposed actions taken to address unfair trade practices.” Miriam Eqab, Tesla’s associate general counsel, sent this letter. An excerpt from Tesla’s letter to USTR. Source: comments.ustr.gov The two letters by Elon Musk’s companies arrive as he continues overseeing his Department of Government Efficiency, which is currently focused on reducing the federal government’s spending and staff count.

Pi’s emergence among the top altcoins has been met with a lot of optimism following the coin’s six-year run until its current launch process this year. Holders have been rewarded for their patience and persistence over the course of the last six years. However, while the market continues to grapple with the success of Pi joining the top altcoins, there is a new altcoin projected to see a bigger breakout in the coming months. Hence, if the success of Pi has interested you, Remittix might stun you more. What Made the Pi Top Altcoins Breakout Possible There is strong optimism currently growing around the Pi coin in the last few weeks as it approached the end of its onboarding process for new users. The coin breakout has been a major sensation, breaking out amongst the top altcoins with a massive market cap in the upwards of $10B. This has continued to boost the hype around this new altcoin as it brings a fresh atmosphere to the market during these turbulent times in the crypto market. However, unlike other new crypto assets, which usually face a strong dump after an official launch, the Pi coin has launched on a strong foot, keeping a consistent growth spirit. The first few days saw the Pi coin on a continuous growth, opening at $0.6287 and hitting a new high of $2.9817 by the end of the sixth day. But the coin’s innovative approach for providing utility for the coin using local businesses has kept the coin waxing stronger. Although the Pi coin is currently about 49% down from the ATH of $2.9817 set late February, analysts predict the utility of this new token could see it at a new ATH before the end of the second quarter. Could Remittix Break The Pi Coin Growth Record This Year Remittix is another new token that has become a sensation during its presale round in the last few weeks. Experts are quickly catching up on this new token. One standout projection predicts that the Remittix token could join the top altcoins this year with a 100x breakout. This follows a careful analysis of the growing investor list and positive sentiments around the ongoing Remittix presale. One factor that stood the Pi coin out for success in the last few years was the fact that it continues to enjoy a positive outlook even while it was yet to launch. However, with careful evaluation of the Remittix token, analysts believe the Remittix presale has also been following this path, enjoying a strong buzz around its presale. Although the Pi launch process in the last few years didn’t give a hint of the price change, the Remittix presale round, on the other hand, has shown over 7x change since it began. Given the high optimism about the Remittix token and its more user-focused utility, the token is projected to see a breakout that could see it above $5 before the end of the year. Experts believe the demand for the Remittix token will continue to enjoy a surge as the exchange allows users to make crypto to FIAT payments smoothly. The Remittix exchange uses a user-friendly interface while also implementing an approach that makes transactions easy and at a low fee. Investors have continued pushing the Remittix price higher, and it has now raised more than $13.8M, making it one of the best crypto ICOs this year. Join the Remittix presale today as it moves towards becoming one of the top altcoins in the market this year, with a projected 100x before the end of 2025.

Top Factors Driving Prices Higher appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The total crypto market cap surged by over 1.2 percent in the past 24 hours to hover about $2.84 trillion on Saturday, March 15, 2025. The mild crypto recovery was heavily welcomed, despite the industry having lost over $1 trillion in net valuation during the last two months. The wider altcoin market followed Bitcoin’s (BTC) price in a bullish recovery during the past 24 hours. As a result, the fear of further crypto capitulation significantly dropped as shown by Bitcoin’s fear and greed index which surged to 46 percent, which represents market neutrality. Major Factors that Influenced Crypto Recovery Today Sustained Gold Price Rally In the past three days, gold price has rallied over 3 percent to hit a new all-time high of around $3k per ounce for the first time in its history as a store of value for humanity. With Bitcoin regarded as digital gold, speculation about a V-shaped BTC price reversal surged across different social media channels. The wider crypto market, which has over the years moved in tandem with Bitcoin, benefited from the mild BTC price rebound. Stock Market Gains The wider crypto market followed major stock indexes in a bullish outlook in the last 24 hours. After a notable decline earlier this week, the S&P 500, NASDAQ Index, and the Dow gained around 2 percent in the last 24 hours. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Holds Around Key $85K Level: Will BTC Price Meet Buyers’ Demand? , Since the second inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump is an American former president politician, businessman, and media personality, who served as the 45th president of the U.S. between 2017 to 2021. Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President the wider crypto market has signaled a positive correlation with major stock indexes. Crypto Regulatory Clarity The cryptocurrency market recorded a mild recovery in the past 24 hours as the United States Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposed the implementation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve through the use of XRP. According to the U.S. SEC, XRP should be considered a payment asset and not a security investment. As a result, the agency believes that XRP can be used to free up funds locked up in the U.S. Nostro account, which can be used to purchase more Bitcoins. The regulatory clarity from the U.S. SEC has played a crucial role in instilling confidence in the wider crypto market. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The bill’s passing, however, unearthed the deep rifts in the Democratic Party, showing that the members are divided on how to deal with President Donald Trump. Failing to pass the government’s spending bill would have given the Democratic party room to stop Trump and Elon Musk’s mass dismissals and the dismantling of federal agencies. However, with a number of Democrats, like Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, joining in to pass the bill, they’ve cleared a major procedural impediment for Trump’s administration. Chuck Schumer says he’d rather drop a procedural blockade on the bill than risk having a government shutdown The Democrats who helped pass the bill are now being heavily criticized by the public, seeing how Trump’s opponents will only have to rely on courts to halt his plans. Within the party, Democratic leaders also clashed over a difference in opinion. Those who backed the spending bill argued that a government shutdown would harm Americans more than Trump’s cost-cutting agenda. For instance, Senator Schumer claimed that his party had no good alternatives: they could either force a prolonged government shutdown to counter Trump or accept a Republican bill that would slash funding for veterans’ health care, firefighters, and police in Washington, DC. He added that he’d rather block the spending bill later than risk a government shutdown. He commented: “I believe it is the best way to minimize the harm that the Trump administration will do to the American people. Clearly, this is a Hobson’s choice. The CR is a bad bill, but as bad as the CR is, I believe allowing Donald Trump to take even much more power via a government shutdown is a far worse option.” – Chuck Schumer Schumer’s bill support, however, is a political victory for Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, who persistently pushed for the bill to advance the government’s cost-cutting plans. Trump even commended Schumer, saying he did the right thing by supporting the bill. Democrat leaders are second-guessing minority leader Chuck Schumer Before the bill’s passing, Democrats like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had called for the public to push against it. As a result, Americans called multiple senators’ offices, asking them to vote against the bill. However, as matters stand, many Democrats believe Schumer let them down. On Friday, when reporters asked House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries whether he still had confidence in Schumer, he did not give a direct answer and only asked reporters for the next question. The 52nd speaker of the United States House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, also argued that senators made the wrong choice by accepting the bill rather than fighting against it, taking a hit at senators like Schumer without naming them directly. Biden’s domestic chief policy adviser Susan Rice even asked Democrat leaders to “grow a spine”, asking them why they would want to “roll over and play dead.” Schumer has, however, stated that he’s proud of the decision he made, believing it was the right thing to do to protect his party. He even said he expected that some would disagree with his choice, claiming that’s always the case in such situations. Additionally, Senator Martin Henrich asked Democrats to come together, telling them that it’s not the right time to doubt their leader, Schumer, if they are going to stand against Trump. Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, also claimed he had confidence in Schumer, although he voted no on the Republican spending bill. He added that he respects all other democrats who supported the bill, claiming they were all torn between two awful choices. So far, the party’s more progressive voters are still insistent on opposing Musk’s plan to eliminate federal agencies. Many moderates, however, are leaning towards fighting to protect Medicaid and against the impact of Trump’s destructive trade tariffs. Nevertheless, the Senate approved a separate measure to allow Washington, DC, to have some authority over spending, but the measure still needs the House’s approval .

Dogecoin Is Retesting The Lower Bound Of An Ascending Channel In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has shared a long-term Ascending Channel that the 1-week price of Dogecoin has been trading inside over the years. The “Ascending Channel” here refers to a pattern from technical analysis (TA) that forms when an asset’s price observes consolidation towards a net upside between two parallel trendlines. The upper line of the channel is drawn by connecting successive higher highs. Similarly, the lower one joins higher lows. When the price is moving between these two lines, it’s likely to face resistance at the former level and support at the latter one. Related Reading: Bitcoin & Altcoin Volume Fades—Investor Exhaustion Setting In? In the scenario that the resistance or support line breaks, the asset can be likely to see a continuation of the trend in the direction of the break. This means that escapes above the channel can be bullish, while drops under it can be bearish. Like the Ascending Channel, there is also the Descending Channel, which occurs when the asset’s consolidation happens toward a net downside instead. But other than this fact, the latter works similarly to the former. There is also a third type of parallel channel, where the consolidation is exactly sideways. In this case, the trendlines are not only parallel to each other, but also to the time-axis. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the Ascending Channel that the weekly price of Dogecoin has seemingly been stuck inside for the past decade: As is visible in the above graph, the 1-week price of Dogecoin has recently observed a sharp decline toward the bottom line of the Ascending Channel. Last year, the memecoin also made a retest of the line, which proved successful and helped its price find a rebound to the upside. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Shift To Strong Distribution As Demand Fades, Glassnode Reveals It’s possible that the line may once again end up holding for DOGE, but it’s still too early to say anything, considering that the last retest saw the coin move along the line for a while before bullish momentum returned. The latest retest of the line has come following a crash that has shaken assets across the cryptocurrency space and instilled fear in the minds of the investors. As long as DOGE stays inside the Ascending Channel, though, not all hope may be lost for the memecoin’s holders. As the analyst says, “Dogecoin $DOGE still has a chance to go parabolic if the $0.16 support level holds!” DOGE Price Dogecoin has been one of the worst-hit top coins in the sector during the past week, as its price has plummeted almost 17%, coming down to the $0.17 level.

Recently, the rounds of the SEC ending the lawsuit against Ripple made huge noise. Ripple also acquired a license in Dubai to become the first blockchain-based payment provider. Meanwhile, the latest reports suggest the SEC is also considering the possibility of recognizing XRP as a commodity, not a security, and also published a document mentioning replacing the SWIFT system with XRP, making it a strategic financial asset for the US. Is this the Right Time to Buy XRP? The XRP price is accumulating around the pivotal resistance zone after a rebound from the crucial support at $2. In the times when the technicals have turned bullish and positive updates are surrounding the token, here is why the value remains less impacted. Firstly, the exchange reserve has seen a sudden increase, which suggests the XRP tokens have flown back onto the exchanges since the start of the month. The rise in the exchange reserve also suggests that volatility is expected to increase heavily in the coming days, which will either positively or negatively impact the price. On the other hand, the number of active addresses has been dropping since December 2024. The XRP price and active address count surged magnificently after the token broke out from the consolidation around $0.5 in November 2024 to mark local highs close to $3. However, the XRP price remained within a range-bound consolidation between $2.02 and $3, and the active address count continued to plunge, forming constant lower highs and lows. This suggests a massive drop in trading activity with a decrease in the participation of retail traders. This raises the speculation of the price remaining within the same consolidated zone for an extended time frame. Will the XRP Price Ever Rise Above $5 in 2025? The XRP price surged above an important resistance level, hinting towards a rise from the bearish influence. The chart pattern suggests the token is heading towards the upper resistance close to $3, but the decreasing volume raises some concerns. Meanwhile, the technicals have turned bullish, which keeps the bullish hopes alive. The MACD has just turned bullish, while the +Di and -Di of the DMI underwent a bullish crossover, which suggests a substantial change in the market trend. Meanwhile, the MACD continues to remain within the negative range, and the ADX is heading towards the lower threshold. Therefore, it may not be easy for the price to rise above $3, which could lead towards a new ATH as the bulls do not possess the required strength, and as a result, bears may exert pressure at frequent intervals, hindering the progress of the rally. If Bitcoin demonstrate strength and rises above $90,000 and reaches $95,000, the market sentiments may turn bullish, elevating the XRP price towards a new ATH.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|BTC|ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-15 06:10:51

The world of Ethereum ETFs is experiencing a notable shift. After a period of optimism and inflows, U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs have now recorded their eighth consecutive day of net outflows. On March 14th alone, these ETFs saw a substantial $46.9 million exit the door, according to data from Farside Investors. This development raises eyebrows and begs the question: Is this a temporary blip, or the start of a more concerning trend? Let’s dive deep into the numbers and explore what this could mean for the future of crypto investments. What’s Behind the Recent Ethereum ETF Outflows? The immediate headline is clear: ETF outflows are happening. But to truly understand the situation, we need to break down where these outflows are originating and what might be driving them. On March 14th, BlackRock’s ETHA ETF took the brunt of the exodus, leading the pack with a net outflow of $36.4 million. Fidelity’s FETH followed with a $11.6 million outflow. Interestingly, other Crypto ETFs in the market didn’t register significant inflows or outflows on the same day, suggesting the trend is specifically impacting these two major players in the Spot Ethereum ETF space. Here’s a quick look at the numbers: ETF Net Outflow (March 14) BlackRock ETHA $36.4 Million Fidelity FETH $11.6 Million Other ETFs No Significant Net Flow Total Net Outflow $46.9 Million So, what could be causing these Spot Ethereum ETF outflows? Several factors could be at play: Profit Taking: After a period of price appreciation in Ethereum and the broader crypto market, some investors might be taking profits. ETFs, being easily tradable, are a convenient vehicle for this. Market Correction Fears: The crypto market is known for its volatility. Concerns about a potential market correction could be prompting investors to reduce their exposure to riskier assets like Ethereum, leading to ETF redemptions. Shifting Institutional Sentiment: While institutional investment in crypto is growing, sentiment can be fickle. Large institutional investors might be re-evaluating their positions in Ethereum ETFs based on macroeconomic factors or internal portfolio adjustments. Alternative Investment Opportunities: Other investment avenues might be appearing more attractive at the moment. Investors could be rotating capital into different asset classes, including other cryptocurrencies or traditional markets. Is This a Setback for Ethereum ETFs and Institutional Investment? While eight consecutive days of outflows and a nearly $47 million single-day exodus sound alarming, it’s crucial to maintain perspective. The Crypto ETF market is still relatively young, especially in the U.S. market for spot products. Volatility in flows is expected, and short-term outflows don’t necessarily indicate a long-term trend reversal. However, sustained outflows do warrant attention. If this trend continues, it could signal: Diminished Institutional Appetite: Prolonged outflows might suggest that institutional investment interest in Ethereum ETFs is waning, at least temporarily. This could impact the overall market sentiment and potentially exert downward pressure on Ethereum prices. Impact on ETF Performance: Significant and consistent outflows can affect the performance of ETFs themselves. Fund managers might need to sell underlying Ethereum holdings to meet redemption requests, which could further amplify price volatility. Re-evaluation of Crypto ETF Strategy: Asset managers offering Spot Ethereum ETFs will be closely monitoring these flows. Sustained outflows might prompt them to re-evaluate their marketing strategies, fee structures, or even the underlying product itself. Navigating ETF Outflows: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors For crypto investors, especially those holding or considering Ethereum ETF investments, what are the key takeaways and actionable steps? Don’t Panic Sell: Short-term market fluctuations are normal. Avoid making impulsive decisions based solely on a few days of ETF outflows. Focus on your long-term investment strategy and risk tolerance. Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on ETF flow data and broader market trends. Resources like Farside Investors and other financial news outlets can provide valuable insights. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification across different asset classes and crypto investments can help mitigate risk. Understand ETF Mechanics: Familiarize yourself with how ETFs work, including creation and redemption mechanisms. This knowledge can help you better interpret flow data and market signals. Consider Long-Term Potential of Ethereum: Remember that Ethereum and its underlying technology still hold immense long-term potential. Short-term ETF outflows don’t negate the fundamental value proposition of Ethereum and its ecosystem. Conclusion: Weathering the Waves in the Crypto ETF Ocean The recent Ethereum ETF outflows are undoubtedly a noteworthy development in the evolving crypto investment landscape. While the $46.9 million net outflow on March 14th and the eight-day outflow streak raise concerns, it’s essential to analyze these trends within the broader context of market dynamics, institutional investment flows, and the inherent volatility of the crypto market. Whether this is a temporary dip or the beginning of a more prolonged outflow trend remains to be seen. For investors, the key is to stay informed, maintain a long-term perspective, and navigate these market fluctuations with a balanced and strategic approach. The crypto ETF journey is still in its early chapters, and like any nascent market, it will experience periods of both exhilarating growth and concerning corrections.

The world of spot Bitcoin ETFs has just witnessed another day of net outflows, signaling potential shifts in investor sentiment. On March 14th, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced a combined net outflow of $59.2 million, marking the second consecutive day of such movement. Let’s delve into the specifics of these Bitcoin ETF outflows and understand what might be driving this trend. Decoding the Shocking Bitcoin ETF Outflows: What Happened on March 14th? According to data from Farside Investors, March 14th wasn’t a rosy day for all spot Bitcoin ETFs . While some funds saw inflows, the overall picture was painted in red due to significant outflows from certain key players. Let’s break down the numbers to get a clearer picture: Net Outflow Total: $59.2 million Consecutive Outflow Days: 2 This marks a notable shift after periods of net inflows, prompting questions about the underlying reasons. Are investors losing interest, or is this a temporary market correction? Let’s investigate further. BlackRock’s IBIT Leads Bitcoin ETF Outflows In a surprising turn of events, BlackRock’s IBIT, which has been a dominant force in attracting inflows, spearheaded the Bitcoin ETF outflows on March 14th. The ETF recorded a substantial outflow of $96.2 million. This is noteworthy because IBIT has consistently been a top performer in terms of attracting capital into the spot Bitcoin ETF market. Could this be a sign of profit-taking, or is there a deeper concern driving investors away from IBIT? Analyzing the performance and market sentiment around BlackRock and IBIT might offer some clues. Bright Spots: Which Spot Bitcoin ETFs Saw Inflows? Despite the overall net outflow, it wasn’t all gloom and doom for spot Bitcoin ETFs . Several funds managed to attract inflows, demonstrating continued investor interest in specific products. Here’s a look at the ETFs that bucked the trend: Bitwise (BITB): $23 million net inflow Fidelity (FBTC): $9.2 million net inflow VanEck (HODL): $4.8 million net inflow These inflows suggest that while some investors might be reducing their exposure through certain ETFs, others are still actively allocating capital to spot Bitcoin ETFs, albeit selectively. Why are BITB, FBTC, and HODL attracting investors even amidst overall outflows? Analyzing Investment Trends: Are Bitcoin ETFs Losing Steam? The recent Bitcoin ETF outflows raise a crucial question: Are Bitcoin ETFs losing their appeal? While two consecutive days of outflows might seem concerning, it’s essential to consider the broader context of investment trends and market dynamics. Here are some factors to consider when analyzing these outflows: Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. Bitcoin’s price fluctuations can significantly impact investor sentiment and ETF flows. Profit Taking: After periods of price appreciation, some investors might choose to take profits, leading to outflows from ETFs. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic conditions, interest rate changes, and inflation concerns can influence investment decisions across all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies and related ETFs. ETF Competition: The spot Bitcoin ETF market is becoming increasingly competitive. Investors may be shifting funds between different ETFs based on fees, performance, or perceived risk. Long-Term Perspective: It’s crucial to remember that ETFs are long-term investment vehicles. Short-term outflows don’t necessarily indicate a fundamental shift in the long-term investment thesis for Bitcoin. Spot Bitcoin ETFs: Benefits and Challenges Spot Bitcoin ETFs have revolutionized access to Bitcoin for many investors. Let’s quickly recap the key benefits and challenges associated with these investment products: Benefits of Spot Bitcoin ETFs: Accessibility: ETFs make Bitcoin investment accessible through traditional brokerage accounts, simplifying the process for retail and institutional investors. Regulation: ETFs operate within a regulated framework, providing a level of investor protection and transparency. Liquidity: ETFs offer high liquidity, allowing investors to easily buy and sell shares during market hours. Diversification: Bitcoin ETFs can be used to diversify investment portfolios. Challenges of Spot Bitcoin ETFs: Volatility: Bitcoin’s inherent price volatility is reflected in ETF performance, which can be a concern for risk-averse investors. Fees: ETFs charge management fees, which can eat into returns over time. Tracking Error: While spot Bitcoin ETFs aim to track the price of Bitcoin, there can be slight deviations or tracking errors. Market Sentiment: ETF flows are susceptible to shifts in market sentiment, as seen with the recent outflows. Actionable Insights: Navigating Bitcoin ETF Investment Trends So, what are the actionable insights we can glean from these investment trends in crypto ETFs ? For investors, it’s crucial to: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on ETF flow data and market analysis to understand prevailing trends. Diversify Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your crypto investments and broader portfolio. Long-Term View: Focus on the long-term potential of Bitcoin and avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term market fluctuations. Due Diligence: Research different spot Bitcoin ETFs, compare fees and track records before investing. Risk Management: Understand your risk tolerance and invest accordingly. Bitcoin and crypto ETFs are inherently volatile investments. Conclusion: Understanding the Dynamic Bitcoin ETF Landscape The recent $59.2 million net outflow from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs serves as a reminder of the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of the cryptocurrency market. While BlackRock’s IBIT experienced significant outflows, other ETFs like BITB, FBTC, and HODL continued to attract investors. Understanding these Bitcoin ETF outflows , investment trends , and the broader context of crypto ETFs is essential for navigating this exciting yet volatile asset class. As the market matures, we can expect to see continued fluctuations in ETF flows, reflecting the ongoing interplay between investor sentiment, market dynamics, and the inherent characteristics of Bitcoin itself.

He outlined a scenario where banks are legally permitted to hold XRP, allowing investors to leverage their holdings for mortgage-backed property purchases. Van Code’s proposed method involves transferring XRP to a bank and taking out a mortgage against it to acquire real estate. He suggested renting out the properties to generate income while covering shortfalls in the first two years by selling a portion of the XRP holdings. The strategy hinges on the assumption that XRP’s price will increase over time, enabling further borrowing to expand the property portfolio. He projected that investors could establish significant real estate holdings within five years while maintaining most of their original XRP. He concluded his post by clarifying that his idea was “not financial advice.” An idea of how I might use my XRP in the future: 1. Assume banks can custody XRP 2. Transfer your XRP to bank 3. Take a mortgage on XRP to buy as much property as you can 4. Rent out property 5. Make up short fall of rent/repayment for first 2 years by selling some XRP 6. Get to… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) March 13, 2025 Community Response and Alternative Perspectives The post drew attention from the cryptocurrency community, with users offering different viewpoints. One response came from an account named John Denver (parody), who expressed skepticism about the reliance on banks. He suggested an alternative approach involving private lenders instead of traditional financial institutions. His perspective emphasized using XRP as collateral or proof of reserves rather than transferring it to a bank. He proposed purchasing a multi-family property, such as a fourplex, and using rental income to repay the loan while allowing the XRP to appreciate. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Feasibility of Using XRP in Real Estate Van Code’s concept reflects ongoing discussions about cryptocurrency’s potential role in traditional finance. The idea of leveraging digital assets for real estate purchases is not new, but regulatory and institutional adoption remain key factors. Some financial entities have explored crypto-backed loans, and private lending options for digital assets are already in use. However, whether banks will widely adopt XRP custody and provide mortgages is uncertain. The discussion highlights the evolving nature of digital asset utility beyond trading. If banks or private lenders increasingly accept cryptocurrency as collateral, investors may explore such strategies in the future. The debate also underscores differing risk tolerances, with some preferring to integrate XRP into conventional financial systems while others advocate for decentralized solutions. While Van Code’s strategy remains hypothetical, it contributes to broader conversations about the intersection of cryptocurrency and real estate investment. As institutional attitudes toward digital assets develop, the feasibility of such approaches may become clearer.

41686055,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=140326,1742020214,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Explosive News: VanEck Files for Groundbreaking Avalanche AVAX ETF,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/vaneck-files-avalanche-avax-etf/,"Get ready for a potential game-changer in the crypto investment world! Leading asset manager VanEck has just thrown its hat in the ring for a spot Avalanche (AVAX) Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). According to a recent update from Unfolded on X, VanEck has officially filed an S-1 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This news is sending ripples of excitement through the crypto community, and for good reason. But what exactly does this mean for Avalanche, for crypto ETFs, and for you as an investor? Let’s dive into the details. What is a Spot Avalanche ETF and Why is it a Big Deal? Before we get too far, let’s break down what a spot ETF actually is. In simple terms, a spot ETF is an exchange-traded fund that directly holds the underlying asset – in this case, Avalanche (AVAX). This is different from futures-based ETFs, which track futures contracts rather than holding the actual asset. Why is this distinction important? Because a spot Avalanche ETF is widely considered to be a much more direct and potentially efficient way for investors to gain exposure to the price movements of AVAX. Think of it like this: Direct Exposure: A spot AVAX ETF mirrors the actual price of Avalanche more closely than a futures ETF. Accessibility: ETFs are traded on traditional stock exchanges, making them easily accessible to a broader range of investors, including those who may be hesitant to navigate the complexities of crypto exchanges and wallets. Regulation and Security: ETFs operate within a regulated framework, offering a layer of security and investor protection that some may find reassuring compared to holding crypto directly. The approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF earlier this year paved the way and set a precedent, demonstrating the SEC’s evolving stance on crypto investment products. Now, with VanEck’s filing for a spot Avalanche ETF , the crypto industry is watching closely to see if this trend of wider acceptance will continue. VanEck’s Bold Move: Why a VanEck Avalanche ETF Matters VanEck is no stranger to the ETF world. They are a well-established global investment manager with a long history of offering innovative and specialized ETFs. Their decision to file for a spot VanEck Avalanche ETF is a significant vote of confidence in both Avalanche and the broader crypto market. Here’s why VanEck’s involvement is noteworthy: Reputable Issuer: VanEck’s established reputation and expertise in the ETF space lend credibility to the idea of a crypto ETF. Their involvement can instill greater confidence in potential investors. Market Demand Signal: VanEck likely sees strong market demand for a spot Crypto ETF Avalanche . Their filing suggests they believe there’s a substantial appetite among investors to access AVAX through a regulated and familiar ETF structure. Pushing Crypto Adoption Forward: Each filing for a spot crypto ETF, especially from a major player like VanEck, contributes to the ongoing narrative of mainstream crypto adoption. It signals that institutional players are taking crypto seriously and see its potential as an asset class. VanEck has been actively involved in the crypto space for some time, previously launching Bitcoin futures ETFs and expressing strong interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs before their eventual approval. This consistent engagement suggests a long-term commitment to the crypto market and a belief in its growth trajectory. Unpacking the S-1 Filing: What Does it Mean for a Spot AVAX ETF? The S-1 form is a registration statement that companies file with the SEC prior to publicly offering new securities, like an ETF. Filing an S-1 is a crucial step in the ETF approval process. While it doesn’t guarantee approval, it signifies a serious intent to launch a spot AVAX ETF and starts the formal review process with the SEC. Key aspects of the S-1 filing process include: Stage Description Filing the S-1 The company submits the registration statement to the SEC, detailing the ETF’s structure, investment strategy, risks, and other essential information. SEC Review The SEC reviews the S-1 to ensure it meets all regulatory requirements and adequately protects investors. This process can involve multiple rounds of feedback and amendments. Approval or Rejection After the review process, the SEC will either approve the S-1, allowing the ETF to launch, or reject it. The SEC’s review process for crypto ETFs has been historically rigorous. However, with the precedent set by spot Bitcoin ETF approvals, there’s growing optimism that the path for other crypto ETFs, including a spot Avalanche ETF , may be becoming clearer. It’s important to remember that SEC approval is not guaranteed, and the timeline for review can be unpredictable. Benefits of an Avalanche ETF: Why Investors Might Be Excited The potential launch of a spot Avalanche ETF brings a host of potential benefits for investors, making AVAX more accessible and potentially driving further adoption. Let’s explore some key advantages: Simplified Investment: Investing in an ETF is significantly simpler than buying and storing AVAX directly. Investors can purchase shares of the ETF through their existing brokerage accounts, just like any other stock or ETF. Reduced Custodial Risk: With an ETF, investors don’t need to worry about the complexities and security risks associated with managing private keys and crypto wallets. The ETF provider handles custody of the underlying AVAX. Tax Efficiency (Potentially): Depending on the investor’s jurisdiction and tax situation, ETFs can sometimes offer tax advantages compared to direct crypto ownership. It’s always advisable to consult with a tax professional for personalized advice. Institutional Investment Flow: A spot Avalanche ETF could open the door for greater institutional investment in AVAX. Many institutional investors are restricted from directly holding crypto but can invest in ETFs. Increased Liquidity: ETFs traded on major exchanges generally offer high liquidity, making it easier for investors to buy and sell shares. For investors who are interested in the potential of Avalanche and its ecosystem but are hesitant to dive into the technical aspects of crypto ownership, a spot AVAX ETF could be an attractive and user-friendly entry point. Challenges and Considerations: Navigating the Crypto ETF Landscape While the prospect of a spot Avalanche ETF is exciting, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges and considerations that still exist in the crypto ETF landscape: Regulatory Uncertainty: The SEC’s stance on crypto ETFs is still evolving. While spot Bitcoin ETFs have been approved, there’s no guarantee that other crypto ETFs will follow suit, or that the approval process will be swift. Market Volatility: The crypto market is known for its volatility. An Avalanche ETF , while offering diversification within the crypto space, will still be subject to the inherent price fluctuations of AVAX and the broader crypto market. Fees and Expenses: ETFs come with management fees and expense ratios. Investors should carefully consider these costs and compare them to the potential benefits of ETF investment versus direct AVAX ownership. Tracking Error: While spot ETFs aim to closely track the price of the underlying asset, there can be instances of tracking error, where the ETF’s performance deviates slightly from AVAX’s price movements. Investors should conduct thorough research, understand the risks involved, and consider their own investment goals and risk tolerance before investing in any crypto ETF, including a potential spot Avalanche ETF . The Future of AVAX and Crypto ETFs: What to Expect? VanEck’s Crypto ETF Avalanche filing is a significant step forward for both Avalanche and the broader crypto ETF market. If approved, it could pave the way for more spot crypto ETFs focused on other leading cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. This increased product diversity would offer investors a wider range of options to gain exposure to the crypto asset class through regulated and accessible investment vehicles. The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs will likely play a crucial role in the SEC’s decision-making process for subsequent crypto ETF applications. Positive performance and investor adoption of Bitcoin ETFs could strengthen the case for approving other spot crypto ETFs, including the VanEck Avalanche ETF . For Avalanche, ETF approval could mean: Increased Demand: ETF inflows could drive up demand for AVAX, potentially impacting its price positively. Enhanced Legitimacy: ETF listing on traditional exchanges can further legitimize Avalanche as a recognized and investable asset. Ecosystem Growth: Increased investor interest and capital flow could fuel further development and growth within the Avalanche ecosystem. A Pivotal Moment for Avalanche and Crypto Investment VanEck filing for a spot Avalanche ETF is more than just another news headline; it’s a powerful indicator of the maturing crypto market and the growing acceptance of digital assets by traditional finance. As the SEC reviews VanEck’s application, the crypto community and investors alike will be watching closely. The potential approval of a spot AVAX ETF could mark a pivotal moment, further bridging the gap between traditional and decentralized finance and opening up new avenues for crypto investment. This exciting development underscores the continued evolution of the crypto landscape and its increasing integration into mainstream investment portfolios. The journey of Crypto ETF Avalanche is just beginning, and its outcome could reshape the future of crypto investment.

TRUMP’s 98% Collapse? $BLEM’s Presale Is the Real Crypto Headline,https://timestabloid.com/doges-318-price-surge-trumps-98-collapse-blems-presale/,"By Trend Tracker on March 15, 2025 | Market Insights On-chain data tells an interesting story. Dogecoin’s network activity is up 47%, TRUMP memecoin’s trading volume has collapsed by 98%, and BitLemons ($BLEM) ? It’s seeing an explosive presale that’s nearly completely sold out before even hitting public exchanges. In a market filled with speculation, Bitlemons is standing out as a Web3 gaming token with real utility. And with a massive $1 million USDT giveaway , investors can enter by simply investing $50 in BLEM tokens for the chance to become one of 20 winners pocketing 50,000 USDT each. With such a compelling incentive, it’s no wonder crypto investors are quickly pivoting towards BLEM as their next big play. What’s Fueling $BLEM’s Rapid Rise? Bitlemons is more than just a token—it’s a fully operational Web3 gaming platform with a revenue-generating model that sets it apart from speculative cryptos. Unlike many projects that rely on hype alone, Bitlemons has already launched three original games: $BLEM Keno by Bitlemons, Crash by Bitlemons, and Wheel of Bitlemons. These proprietary games generate higher margins because they don’t require gross gaming revenue (GGR) payments to third-party providers, maximizing profits for the platform and token holders. The roadmap is packed with new games, incentives, and strategic partnerships, ensuring continuous engagement and long-term value growth. But that’s not all—Bitlemons has strategic partnerships in the works with influencers and sports celebrities, a move that could propel it into mainstream adoption. Can DOGE Really Surge Another 318%? Dogecoin has once again captured the market’s attention. Analysts predict DOGE could surge 318%, reaching an estimated price of $0.6533 based on historical breakouts. This growing optimism is further fueled by on-chain data, which shows a 47% increase in network activity over the past month—an indication that whales and long-term holders may be accumulating. Beyond price speculation, one of the biggest potential catalysts for DOGE is the prospect of a Bitwise Dogecoin ETF. If approved in 2025, this fund would allow institutional investors to easily access Dogecoin, driving demand and potentially pushing its value to new heights. Why Did TRUMP Token Suddenly Collapse? Unlike Dogecoin, the TRUMP memecoin is facing a different reality. After briefly peaking at $75, its price has now plummeted to around $10, representing a staggering decline. This downward trend is largely due to fading interest, as trading volume has dropped by 98%, signaling that investors are pulling out. Adding to its woes, market skepticism is growing. Many traders believe the TRUMP token’s rise and fall resemble a classic pump-and-dump scheme, where early adopters capitalize on hype while late investors bear the losses. With no clear utility or roadmap for future development, the TRUMP memecoin faces an uncertain future. How Far Could $BLEM Really Go? While Dogecoin is rallying and TRUMP is fading, Bitlemons continues to build real value. The project isn’t just a token—it’s a live and operational gaming platform that is already generating revenue. Investors benefit directly from the platform’s success, as 30% of all Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) is allocated to token holders through staking rewards for long-term investors and buybacks and burns to reduce supply and drive value growth Additionally, Bitlemons is fostering an active and engaged community of gamers and investors. With continuous game releases and incentives, the ecosystem is designed to increase token utility and long-term demand. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of BitLemons ($BLEM) Presale Today!

Whether it’s blockchain innovations, new tokens, or the latest trends, the digital finance world never stays still. Now, in 2025, three altcoins are making waves, and if you’re hunting for the best altcoins to buy and hold for short term, you should definitely keep your eyes on Qubetics , Maker, and Aptos. So what sets these three apart from the pack? Let’s break it down. From revolutionary blockchain interoperability with Qubetics to Maker’s decentralized finance (DeFi) dominance and Aptos’s blazing-fast blockchain, these coins are turning heads. By the end of this article, you’ll be clued in on why these altcoins are worth considering for anyone looking to make a move in the near future. But here’s the thing: While Qubetics promises unique blockchain interoperability and real-world problem-solving, it’s crucial to look at each project separately, understanding their strengths and potential. Let’s dive in and see what makes each one tick and why they might be the best altcoins to buy and hold for short term. Qubetics: Revolutionizing Blockchain Interoperability and Solutions Qubetics isn’t just another cryptocurrency—it’s a complete game-changer. Right now, as part of its crypto presale , over 23,000 holders have already snatched up more than 499 million $TICS tokens, raising more than $15 million. Currently, at $0.1074 per token, the Qubetics presale is in its 25th stage. And if the predictions hold true, this could be one of the best altcoins to buy and hold for short term. But why is Qubetics generating so much buzz? It’s all about interoperability. What sets Qubetics apart from its predecessors is its focus on making blockchain easier for businesses, professionals, and individuals by enabling smoother, more efficient cross-chain interactions. Unlike other blockchain projects that focus primarily on scalability or security, Qubetics has zeroed in on solving the real-world problems that hinder the seamless flow of digital assets across different chains. Its innovative interoperability protocols allow different blockchain systems to connect and share information, essentially making it much easier for businesses to operate and thrive in a blockchain-powered world. From decentralized finance (DeFi) applications to cross-border transactions, Qubetics is paving the way for a more efficient, interconnected crypto ecosystem. Qubetics Presale Milestone The presale has been highly successful. Analysts predict a 132% ROI by the end of the presale. $TICS may climb to $0.25 by the end of the presale. After the mainnet launch, some analysts expect $TICS to reach $1 or higher. Potential for an 830% ROI after the mainnet launch. Why it’s worth considering: With such strong backing and predictions, Qubetics looks like a solid short-term play. It’s not just about price potential but also about how its unique interoperability features could help tackle long-standing issues in the blockchain space. MakerDAO MKR Token Soars 23% Amid Proposal and Blockchain Expansion MakerDAO’s MKR token has experienced a significant surge, with its price increasing by 23% over the past 24 hours. This rise is attributed to heightened demand and the approval of an emergency proposal aimed at boosting lending limits for MKR holders. The proposal has generated discussions within the community, with some members expressing concerns over the expedited process and potential implications for governance. In addition to the recent price movement, MakerDAO is actively exploring the deployment of its native tokens on the Solana blockchain. Co-founder Rune Christensen has indicated that the team will present three voting options to the community on October 28, 2024, to decide on this strategic expansion. Aptos (APT) Surges 13% Amid Market Rebound and Strategic Blockchain Partnership Aptos (APT) demonstrated notable market activity, surging over 13% to reclaim the $6 level after an initial 15% decline earlier in the week. Currently trading at approximately $5.16, Aptos exhibits significant volatility, presenting both risks and opportunities for short-term traders. In a landmark development, Aptos has partnered with Bluprynt to integrate U.S. securities law documents onto the blockchain. This collaboration marks the first time a Form Reg D filing, along with its metadata, has been tokenized, paving the way for compliance and real-world asset integration into decentralized finance ecosystems. The Importance of Interoperability: Why It’s the Future When it comes to the best altcoins to buy and hold for short term, interoperability is becoming a key factor. Simply put, interoperability allows different blockchain networks to work together seamlessly, eliminating the need for manual processes and cutting down on inefficiencies. Qubetics, as mentioned earlier, is tackling this issue head-on by enabling cross-chain transactions and making it easier for users and businesses to move assets and data across different blockchain platforms. This capability is huge because, without it, blockchains are essentially islands of data that can’t communicate with one another. The more projects embrace interoperability, the more fluid and connected the entire crypto ecosystem becomes. In the context of short-term altcoin strategies, interoperability can be a game-changer. The greater the flexibility and connectivity between networks, the more valuable a project can become. It’s not just about the price—it’s about solving real-world problems, like making blockchain technology more accessible and usable on a daily basis. Conclusion: Making the Right Move in 2025 So, if you’re on the lookout for the best altcoins to buy and hold for short term , Qubetics, Maker, and Aptos should absolutely be on your radar. Each of these projects has a unique angle, from Qubetics’s interoperability to Maker’s DeFi dominance and Aptos’s speed and scalability. These altcoins offer real-world solutions that could revolutionize how blockchain technology is used. Whether you’re drawn to Qubetics’s presale opportunities, Maker’s steady DeFi position, or Aptos’s cutting-edge blockchain innovations, it’s clear that 2025 holds exciting possibilities for anyone ready to dive into the world of cryptocurrency. Make a move now before these projects truly explode in the coming years.

41685539,https://coinpedia.org/?p=432002,1742020313,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Dogecoin (DOGE) vs. BinoFi (BINO) – Why Major Investors are Choosing Utility Over Viral Trends,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/doge-vs-binofi-bino-why-major-investors-are-choosing-utility-over-viral-trends/,"The post Dogecoin (DOGE) vs. BinoFi (BINO) – Why Major Investors are Choosing Utility Over Viral Trends appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Dogecoin (DOGE) may have started as a joke, but it leveraged humor and celebrity endorsements to become a well-known cryptocurrency. Yet, for serious investors seeking lasting value, its reliance on virality feels outdated. Meanwhile, BinoFi (BINO) stands out by addressing real market needs with innovative technology, offering substantial growth opportunities for those ready to look beyond the surface. DOGE’s Challenges in the Modern Market Dogecoin achieved fame through community-driven hype and social media buzz. But fame alone doesn’t ensure longevity. Lacking significant technical advancement or utility, it remains a speculative asset dependent on public sentiment. This uncertainty has left many investors seeking more meaningful opportunities. Simultaneously, BinoFi is attracting attention with its practical solutions for trading and portfolio management. It’s not about fleeting trends but delivering tools that enhance the investment experience, setting it apart in a sea of speculative projects. BinoFi’s Utility Drives Investor Confidence Hybrid Exchange Model for Real Functionality BinoFi redefines trading with its hybrid exchange model , combining the liquidity and speed of centralized exchanges (CEXs) with the transparency and security offered by decentralized exchanges (DEXs). For traders frustrated by traditional platforms’ inefficiencies, this innovative integration is the future of crypto. Dogecoin doesn’t offer any comparable framework; its appeal is driven solely by market sentiment, leaving it without the advanced capabilities many investors now expect. Cross-Chain Trading for Better Access The crypto ecosystem remains fractured, making it hard for traders to move assets between blockchains. BinoFi overcomes this barrier with cross-chain functionality, improving access across networks like Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. This flexibility is nonexistent in Dogecoin’s single-chain operation, further limiting its appeal to investors who manage diverse portfolios. BinoFi simplifies trading in a way Dogecoin cannot. Gasless Transactions to Optimize Profits Network fees can quietly erode gains, but BinoFi tackles this problem with gasless transactions. By eliminating these charges, it ensures users retain more of their investment returns, a rare and valuable feature. While Dogecoin is known for its low fees, it still relies on conventional systems tied to its blockchain’s limitations. Investors in BinoFi are spared from unpredictable costs, gaining a clear financial edge. Advanced Security for Peace of Mind BinoFi prioritizes user safety with Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology. This cutting-edge security measure protects wallet keys and funds, adding a layer of trust that’s essential for investors navigating a volatile market. Although Dogecoin has proven itself as a reliable blockchain, it lacks such advanced security enhancements, putting BinoFi ahead in addressing modern investor concerns. MVP Launch Builds Credibility Unlike projects that overpromise and underdeliver, BinoFi is proving its reliability with the upcoming launch of its Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Features like gasless transactions and cross-chain trading will soon be live, giving investors real-world value from the start. Dogecoin has no comparable initiatives to show for its longevity. For investors, BinoFi’s clear roadmap and execution set it apart as a trustworthy option. The Better Choice for Serious Investors While Dogecoin’s meme appeal was groundbreaking, it lacks the depth to sustain serious investor interest. BinoFi’s focus on utility, efficiency, and security positions it as a smarter long-term choice. From its hybrid exchange model to gasless transactions and cross-chain functionality, BinoFi offers tools designed for growth in the evolving crypto landscape. Conclusion With its presale pricing at just $0.02 and the potential for a 150x return, BinoFi presents a rare opportunity for early investors. Dogecoin’s time in the limelight proved the power of community, but BinoFi adds substance to the buzz, making it the clear choice for those ready to move beyond memes. Exploring BinoFi could be your step toward uncovering the next big opportunity in the world of crypto.

After weeks of navigating choppy waters, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is flashing signs of a shift in market mood. For those keeping a close eye on the volatile world of digital assets, this could be a significant indicator. Let’s dive into the latest movement of this crucial sentiment gauge and what it means for your crypto portfolio. Decoding the Crypto Fear and Greed Index: A Beacon for Market Sentiment The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a widely tracked metric provided by Alternative, has registered a noteworthy climb. As of March 15th, the index stands at 46, a substantial leap of 19 points from the previous day’s reading. This jump reflects a palpable improvement in overall crypto sentiment . However, it’s crucial to note that despite this positive momentum, the index remains anchored in the “Fear” zone. This nuanced position suggests a market that’s becoming less fearful, but not yet embracing outright greed. For those new to this indicator, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index operates on a scale of 0 to 100. Here’s a quick breakdown: 0-24: Extreme Fear – Signifies a market gripped by intense fear, often presenting potential buying opportunities as assets may be undervalued. 25-49: Fear – Indicates prevalent fear, suggesting investors are still cautious and potentially risk-averse. 50-74: Greed – Points to growing greed in the market, where investors become more bullish and potentially prone to impulsive buying. 75-100: Extreme Greed – Signals excessive greed, often a warning sign of a potential market bubble or overvaluation. Currently positioned at 46, the index suggests we’re moving away from pronounced fear, but the market isn’t yet exhibiting greedy behavior. This transitional phase is often characterized by uncertainty and could present both risks and opportunities for investors. What Fuels the Fear & Greed Index? Unpacking the Metrics of Market Analysis The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t just a random number; it’s a composite score derived from a meticulous market analysis of six key factors. Each factor contributes to the overall sentiment reading, providing a holistic view of the crypto landscape. Let’s break down these components: Factor Weight Description Volatility 25% Measures the current and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing it with the average values over the last 30 and 90 days. Unusually high volatility can indicate fear. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Compares the current market momentum and volume (Bitcoin) against the last 30 and 90-day averages. High buying volumes can signal greed. Social Media 15% Analyzes sentiment trends on social media platforms, primarily Twitter, for crypto-related hashtags. Positive sentiment leans towards greed, negative towards fear. Surveys 15% Weekly crypto polls are conducted to gauge investor sentiment. While paused currently, this factor historically provided direct insight into market feelings. Bitcoin Dominance 10% An increasing Bitcoin dominance suggests fear as investors may be moving away from altcoins towards the perceived safety of Bitcoin. Conversely, decreasing dominance could indicate growing risk appetite. Google Trends 10% Analyzes Google Trends data for Bitcoin-related search queries. Spikes in searches often correlate with market uncertainty or excitement, influencing the fear and greed perception. By weighting these factors, the index aims to provide a balanced and data-driven assessment of fear and greed index within the cryptocurrency market. Understanding these components can empower investors to make more informed decisions, moving beyond purely emotional reactions to market fluctuations. Why Does Crypto Market Sentiment Matter? Navigating Investment Decisions Understanding market sentiment is more than just reading the temperature of the crypto room; it’s a strategic tool for navigating the inherent volatility of digital assets. The Fear & Greed Index acts as a compass, helping investors gauge whether the market is driven by excessive fear or irrational exuberance. Why is this so important? Identifying Potential Buying Opportunities: Periods of extreme fear often drive asset prices down to potentially undervalued levels. Savvy investors may see this as a chance to buy low, anticipating a market rebound. Recognizing Potential Selling Signals: Conversely, extreme greed can inflate asset prices beyond sustainable levels, creating potential bubbles. Recognizing this over-optimism can prompt investors to take profits before a potential correction. Managing Risk: Understanding market sentiment can aid in risk management. During fearful periods, investors might consider reducing exposure to riskier assets, while in greedy phases, a more cautious approach might be warranted. Gauging Market Cycles: The Fear & Greed Index can offer insights into broader market cycles. Shifts from fear to greed (or vice versa) can indicate potential shifts in market trends, helping investors anticipate changes. It’s crucial to remember that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is just one tool in a comprehensive investor toolkit. It should be used in conjunction with other forms of technical and fundamental analysis, and never as a standalone predictor of market movements. However, its ability to distill complex market emotions into a single, digestible number makes it an invaluable resource for both seasoned traders and newcomers to the crypto space. Taking Actionable Insights from the Fear & Greed Shift The recent 19-point surge in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is undoubtedly a positive signal. It suggests a lessening of the intense fear that may have dominated the market recently. But what are the actionable insights investors can glean from this shift? Cautious Optimism: While the move out of extreme fear is encouraging, the index is still in the “Fear” zone. This calls for cautious optimism rather than unbridled enthusiasm. It might be a good time to reassess portfolio allocations and consider strategic entries, but with careful due diligence. Monitor Key Levels: Keep a close watch on the index as it approaches the “Neutral” zone (around 50). Crossing into neutral could signal a more sustained shift in sentiment. Conversely, a reversal and a move back towards extreme fear would warrant a more defensive stance. Diversification Remains Key: Regardless of sentiment shifts, diversification remains a cornerstone of sound crypto investing. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, and spread investments across different types of crypto assets to mitigate risk. Stay Informed: Market sentiment can change rapidly in the crypto world. Stay updated on the Fear & Greed Index, as well as other market indicators, to adapt your strategies as needed. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a dynamic tool that reflects the ever-evolving emotions of the crypto market. By understanding its nuances and incorporating it into a broader investment strategy, you can navigate the exciting, yet often unpredictable, world of cryptocurrencies with greater confidence. Conclusion: Riding the Waves of Crypto Sentiment The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s latest upward movement is a breath of fresh air for the crypto market, signaling a move towards less fear and potentially laying the groundwork for renewed growth. While the index remains in the “Fear” zone, the 19-point jump is an undeniable sign of improving crypto sentiment . For investors, this is a crucial moment to observe, analyze, and strategically position themselves. By understanding the dynamics of market sentiment , utilizing tools like the Fear & Greed Index, and staying informed, you can navigate the crypto landscape with greater clarity and potentially capitalize on emerging opportunities. The journey through the crypto markets is often a rollercoaster of emotions, and tools like this index help us keep our bearings.

In March 2024, Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $73,679 before entering a consolidation phase, swinging within a range of around $20,000 up until Donald Trump was elected as US president in November. Bitcoin’s current chart signals “market indecision” Thielen said he had this thought even two months ago, around the time Bitcoin hit its current all-time high of $109,000 on the day of Trump’s inauguration . He explained in his most recent market report on March 15 that Bitcoin’s current chart resembles a “High and Tight Flag,” which, despite typically being a bullish continuation pattern, shows signs of weakness. Bitcoin’s price chart is forming a High, Tight Flag Pattern. Source: 10x Research “Two flags instead of a single, precise formation weakens this setup,” Thielen said. “As a result, the pattern currently suggests market indecision rather than a straightforward bullish consolidation,” he added. Meanwhile, he also pointed out that the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) market shows no signs of a “buy-the-dip” mentality. “Little incentive” to take advantage of Bitcoin’s recent price dip “This aligns with our view that most ETF flows came from arbitrage-driven hedge funds. Given the persistently low funding rates, there’s little incentive or willingness to deploy additional capital despite the recent price correction,” Thielen said. Since the beginning of March, when Bitcoin fell below $90,000, spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have recorded total outflows of around $1.66 billion, according to Farside data. Bitcoin is trading at $84,290 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap. This represents a 23% decline from its $109,000 January all-time high. Bitcoin is down 12.86% over the past month. Source: CoinMarketCap Thielen is unsure if Bitcoin’s uptrend will resume in the short term. ”Therefore, it may be prudent to close short positions at this stage, although there remains little evidence to support a strong price recovery,” Thielen said.

On March 10, BitMEX co-founder and Maelstrom chief investment officer Arthur Hayes said “it looks like Bitcoin will retest $78,000.” “If it fails, $75,000 is next in the crosshairs,” he added. Meanwhile, Iliya Kalchev, dispatch analyst at digital asset investment platform Nexo, told Cointelegraph on March 11 that the low $70,000 range could “provide a foundation for a more sustainable recovery.” Magazine: Crypto fans are obsessed with longevity and biohacking: Here’s why",,EN,0,0,BTC|ZRX|TRADING|RESEARCH|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-15 06:35:20

Strongly criticising top media outlets, specifically WSJ and Bloomberg, for publishing unsubstantiated articles, the WLFI team aggressively denounced all the allegations as politically motivated.

In a post on X, he highlighted several key factors that have had little to no impact on the asset’s market value. He noted that XRP was mentioned first in a “strategic stockpile,” suggesting its importance in future financial frameworks. Additionally, he pointed out that over fifteen XRP-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have been filed, indicating institutional interest in the asset. “These big asset funds aren’t wrong,” he stated, referring to the level of research and strategic planning that typically precedes such filings. Confidence in XRP is so low that even the juiciest news doesn't move price: 1. XRP in strategic stockpile, mentioned first 2. Over 15 XRP ETFs filed – these big asset funds aren't wrong 3. @EleanorTerrett breaks news that 2 of her close sources advised the case is going to end… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) March 12, 2025 Legal Case Nearing Conclusion Van Code referenced a report from journalist Eleanor Terrett, who cited two close sources claiming the ongoing legal battle involving XRP was nearing its conclusion. “She hasn’t been wrong and never makes up ‘source,’” he stated, reinforcing the credibility of her information. The resolution of this case is expected to significantly impact XRP, yet the market has not reacted accordingly. Stablecoin and Custody Advancements Developments in digital asset custody and stablecoins were also mentioned. Van Code pointed out that RLUSD and Ripple’s custody are positioned to become standard, particularly with new regulations around stablecoins. He also referenced the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which has confirmed that banks are permitted to run validators and custody of digital assets. Despite these advancements, he criticized the market’s focus on speculation and unconventional theories. “But you go right on ahead and decrypt cartoon characters and Simpsons prophecies,” he remarked, implying that attention is being diverted from fundamental developments. Institutional Interest May Be Ahead of Retail Sentiment In response to Van Code’s observations, X user Rogue Trader shared his perspective, suggesting that major institutional investors may already be positioning themselves. “Do you think any of these ETF guys are waiting for approval to buy? These are big businesses, they started before they submitted.” He indicated that firms investing in ETFs likely began accumulating XRP well before filing, signaling long-term confidence in the asset. Rogue Trader also emphasized XRP’s technological strength compared to other digital assets. “BTC has no pedigree or progression,” he commented, arguing that only a few cryptocurrencies have a clear technological advantage. Market Outlook Van Code’s remarks reflect broader concerns about the disconnect between fundamental progress and XRP’s price action. Despite regulatory clarity, institutional adoption, and technological advancements, investor sentiment remains subdued. Whether this represents a delayed market response or continued skepticism toward XRP remains uncertain. However, the points raised suggest that major institutions may already position themselves, even if retail investors remain hesitant.

41686580,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=712485,1742022054,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/41686580.jpeg,"Ethereum, Dogecoin, And The Altcoin Market: Why Up-Only For 217 Days Is Possible",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-dogecoin-altcoin-market/,"A new technical analysis suggests that the crypto market, which includes altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and Dogecoin (DOGE), is about to experience a major altcoin season that could last 217 days. If critical support levels are maintained, the analyst suggests that we may finally see the long-anticipated altcoin season. Ethereum And Dogecoin To See An Altcoin Season Soon Sporia, a TradingView crypto analyst, has shared a detailed technical analysis of the altcoin market. The analysis highlights key indicators within the Total2 chart, which represents the total crypto market cap excluding Bitcoin. The market expert emphasizes the importance of holding a critical support level, noting that the highly anticipated altcoin season could finally begin if this zone is maintained. Related Reading: Crypto Pundit Says Ethereum Price Is ‘Destined’ To Reach $10,000 This Cycle, Here’s Why Notably, top cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Dogecoin could benefit from this market shift into an altcoin season. The analyst also noted that current market conditions coincide with Fibonacci time sequences, which may signal an inflection point for altcoin prices. Sporia shared a price chart, describing it as his secret weapon in determining bottom signals for altcoins. Since 2022, the chart has indicated a significant bottom each time the market encountered resistance at a crucial point. As of this week, the chart has recorded a bottom, marking the fourth hit around the critical resistance zone. The analyst has expressed excitement about this trend, solidifying his confidence in a strong altcoin season. He further underscores that the alignment of events, including key support line formations during the week of the Fibonacci time sequences, indicates the heightened possibility of a major market shift. While tracking Fibonacci-based time cycles, Sporia revealed that the first two hits did not trigger any major events, but the third hit at the 2.618 level led to a significant pivot. Currently, this fourth hit at the 3.618 level coincides with the August 2024 altcoin crash, which mirrored the COVID crash in the last cycle. This suggests a 50% accuracy rate for the current Fibonacci sequence, making it an ideal target to watch for a potential bottom and pivot. Altcoin Market Bull Rally To Last Only 217 Days Diving further into his analysis, Sporia predicts that the altcoin market could rally for 217 days, peaking by October 13, 2025, roughly 20 to 30 days after Bitcoin reaches its projected cycle top. He argues that, historically, Bitcoin has always hit a cycle top before altcoins. Related Reading: Altcoins Season: Recent Crypto Dip Shows Decline May Be Over And Bulls Are Taking Charge In 2021, Bitcoin peaked in April, and the altcoin market topped 28 days later. Similarly, in 2017, Bitcoin reached the top of the market, and altcoins followed 22 days later. For this market cycle, Sporia projects that Bitcoin will hit its highest point by mid-September after a typical 1,050-day cycle from its previous market bottom. Notably, the analyst revealed that the last time the altcoin market hit the 3.618 Fib level, its total market capitalization surged to $5 trillion. Overall, Sporia has indicated a 99% surety that the altcoin market will bottom so long as the key diagonal support holds. If it does, he highlights that the market should expect a V-shaped recovery and an uptrend lasting for 217 days.

In a new video, Cowen tells his 886,000 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin may be repeating a similar pattern from 2017, when it tested the prior year high. However, he warns that if Bitcoin drops below the 2024 low of about $71,000 and enters the $60,000 range, the bull cycle may be over. “In 2017 Bitcoin had a drop in early 2017 where it tested the 2016 high. And it happened, by the way, fairly early on. I would argue that’s very much an outcome to consider for this cycle, testing the 2024 high, which is in the lower $70,000s… If we get closes, and especially if there’s a wick in the low $60,000s, then there’s a good chance the cycle is over. If it stays above the 2024 high, then the party could easily go on.” Source: Benjamin Cowen/YouTube He also says that if Bitcoin maintains the $70,000 range, a bull cycle will probably remain intact, whereas anything lower may result in a bearish price pattern of lower highs later in the year on the weekly chart. “If it holds support above $70,000, $73,000, [the] structure of the market is fine. If it goes into the $60,000s, then I would argue that the more likely outcome would be a macro lower high in Q2, Q3, potentially around like the August timeframe.” Bitcoin is trading for $84,059 at time of writing, up 3.8% in the last 24 hours.

While both tokens remain leaders in the space for the meme coins, the space is evolving with investors seeking out options with tangible use cases. Of the new faces, Remittix (RTX) promises to be the potential game-changer in blockchain finance. While SHIB and PEPE depend on hype and fanfare, RTX is set to transform the way crypto is transferred to fiat. When it comes to making the call in terms of trading, many are asking themselves: Can RTX replace meme coins in 2025? PEPE’s Price Surge Signals Strength Pepe Coin (PEPE) keeps gaining momentum at around $0.057141, with its price rising by 7.53% in the last 24 hours. Market cap is at $3 billion, with trading volume decreasing by 26.08%, which shows some sellers are taking profits. Source: Tradingview PEPE is the dominant force in the meme coin space during volatility, riding on its popularity and demand in the market. With constant momentum, PEPE can reach new heights, but it will have to see steady investor demand to grow for the long term. Since the traditional meme coins have always recorded rapid price swings, PEPE investors are also considering other growth prospects like Remittix (RTX) Shiba Inu (SHIB) Continues Expanding Its Ecosystem Shiba Inu (SHIB) is still one of the largest meme coins, trading at around $0.00001264, having gained 5.70% over the past day. Its market capitalization is $7.44 billion, with trading volume rising by 6.03%, reflecting continued interest in SHIB’s ecosystem. Source: Tradingview The Shibarium layer-2 network is continuing to expand, allowing SHIB to position itself beyond the role of being more than a meme coin. However, even with the growth in the ecosystem, SHIB remains extremely reliant on market speculations, which can make long-term growth unpredictable. Traders are looking beyond SHIB and PEPE, with many opting for Remittix (RTX) as the new utility-focused option. Remittix (RTX): The Crypto Set to Eclipse PEPE and SHIB Remittix (RTX) is also rising to give PEPE and SHIB a run for their money, providing instant crypto to fiat transactions with no fees. Trading at $0.0734 currently, RTX raised more than $13.8 million and sold 518 million tokens, reflecting investor confidence. Unlike PEPE and SHIB, both reliant on social media buzz, RTX provides real-world use cases for companies and freelancers. Consider the small business owner in Asia who receives payment for services rendered by customers in Europe with RTX, they can instantly off-ramp crypto to fiat, without delay and extortionate banking fees. This real-world utility makes RTX more than the subject of speculative token but positions it for widespread adoption beyond the trading of meme coins. Will RTX Outperform PEPE and SHIB in 2025? While SHIB and PEPE remain at the forefront among the meme coins, Remittix (RTX) is gaining popularity due to its real-world use. Since the typical meme coins have always been plagued by price volatility, RTX’s payment orientation brings less volatility and more potential for sustainable growth. For investors looking for the next hot thing, RTX offers the rare combination of high growth coupled with real-world use cases. Whereas the fortunes of PEPE and SHIB are governed by market hype, RTX’s fortunes are governed by financial use cases, which makes it a more viable investment. If RTX keeps increasing at the same level, it can beat meme coins by percentage return by the year 2025. Secure Your Spot in the Next Big Crypto Investment As PEPE and SHIB are doing great, investors are eyeing RTX for potential future growth and stability in finances. With its crypto to fiat payment platform, it is raising new standards for the blockchain ecosystem. In short, while PEPE and SHIB remain the most dominant, RTX’s growing adoption may make it an attractive long-term play. While investors seek utility tokens, RTX is proving to be a force to be reckoned with in the evolving crypto space. Want to invest in a real-world utility-based cryptocurrency? Take a glance at the Remittix presale and find out why RTX might outperform PEPE and SHIB in 2025.

As of 2022, all global assets were estimated at $450 trillion, suggesting a tokenization market of at least $45 trillion by 2030. This gives cryptocurrencies like XRP a major advantage, as the XRP Ledger (XRPL) is well-known for its speed, reliability, and low cost, which lend themselves well to tokenization. The XRPL is already one of the leading blockchains for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, and EGRAG CRYPTO called out investors who can’t see XRP’s potential, and are bearish because of a minor price drop. #Tokenization : By 2030, it's projected that 10% of assets worldwide will be tokenized. Given that the total asset value as of 2022 is around $450 trillion, that means 10% of $450 trillion is $45 trillion set to be tokenized. And you're #Bearish on a 20% move in #XRP ?… pic.twitter.com/ObvURdgwdF — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) March 14, 2025 Understanding Tokenization on the XRP Ledger Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David Schwartz, has elaborated on tokenization , and how it can enhance efficiency in asset management. He noted that traditional processes, such as real estate transactions, involve extensive paperwork and verification. Tokenization simplifies these processes by converting physical assets into digital tokens, allowing for streamlined ownership verification and transfer. This approach reduces the risk of fraud and increases transparency in transactions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Schwartz emphasized that the XRPL facilitates easy token creation without requiring knowledge of smart contracts or programming languages. Once issued, these tokens can be immediately traded on the XRPL’s decentralized exchange (DEX), enabling swift and efficient transactions. Major Advancements for Ripple On March 11, 2025, RWA.xyz announced its integration with the XRPL , achieved through collaboration with Ripple. This integration allows users to access data about tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) and RLUSD, Ripple’s stablecoin, via RWA.xyz’s dashboard. Such developments enhance transparency and accessibility for institutional and retail users, highlighting the XRPL’s growing role in the tokenization of RWAs. XRP’s Future in the Tokenization Market Despite recent price fluctuations, EGRAG CRYPTO suggests that a 20% decline in XRP’s value is minor compared to the potential growth stemming from widespread asset tokenization. The integration of stablecoins like RLUSD and the XRPL’s capabilities in facilitating tokenization position XRP favorably in the evolving digital asset landscape. RWA tokenization holds many benefits for XRP and the global financial market. The projection that $45 trillion in assets could be tokenized by 2030 shows the transformative potential of blockchain technology. The XRPL, with its robust features, is poised to play a significant role in this financial evolution. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This staggering 9,900% surge mirrors the early success of ADA, which once traded for pennies before reaching multi-dollar valuations. Analysts are eyeing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that is attracting crypto users who see the platform as a rising interest area. Mutuum Finance tokens available during their Phase 3 presale. A strong investor backing emerged through the acquisition of more than 5600 buyers who have raised $3.3 million during the presale process. Investors participating in Mutuum Finance Phase 3 token purchase earn 200% profit at $0.06 at exchange launch. Mutuum Finance Presale Accelerates To Phase 3 The third phase of Mutuum Finance presale has started while the platform attracts increasing investor interest. The DeFi solution provided by Mutuum Finance operates as a scalable long-term solution instead of hyper-inflated meme coins. Investor confidence remains high since Phase 3 of the presale has surpassed $3.3 million total shares and attracted more than 5600 token holders before the following price adjustment. The presale token price has reached $0.02 during Phase 3 of the presale while the launch will bring it to $0.06. Investors who bought in Phase 3 obtained 200% growth from their investment once MUTM launches. Furthermore analysts predict MUTM will reach $1.5 upon listing resulting in almost 25x the original amount. The current cost of MUTM attracts investors to buy during Phase 4 since it will undergo another pricing increase to 0.025.

The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system enables smart contracts to regulate lending pools that shift interest rates in harmony with market conditions. Lenders receive dependable income while borrowers get secure financing opportunities through this system. The P2P approach takes out middlemen by enabling direct communication between borrowing parties and lending participants. Any asset with volatility needs this complete decentralized model which provides maximum flexibility to users. Security takes precedence in this ecosystem through combination with open-source smart contracts along with third-party audits to establish complete transparency. The MUTM token holders benefit from both price growth potential and earn passive income while receiving investments through a strategic buyback system that strengthens long-term token value. Mutuum Finance aims to increase accessibility and liquidity by implementing multi-chain expansion which will include EVM and non-EVM blockchain support. $100,000 Giveaway & Community Incentives The $100,000 giveaway conducted by Mutuum Finance aims to give away $10,000 in MUTM tokens to 10 participants as part of its adoption drive.

33767162,[object Object],1742023827,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Ethereum FUD Spikes On Social Media After 13% Price Drop: Bottom Signal?,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-fud-spikes-social-media-13-price-bottom/,"Data shows the sentiment around Ethereum (ETH) has recently soured on social media, something that could actually help the coin reverse its price. Ethereum Positive/Negative Sentiment Has Declined Recently According to data from the analytics firm Santiment , traders on social media have become bearish toward Ethereum following the price drawdown. The indicator of relevance here is the “ Positive/Negative Sentiment ,” which tells us about whether the social media users are bullish or bearish toward a given coin. The metric works by going through the major social media platforms to filter for posts/threads/messages that contain at least one mention of the asset. It then puts these posts through a machine-learning model to determine whether the comments are positive or negative. Finally, the indicator takes the ratio between the two types of posts, in order to represent a ‘net’ situation for traders as a whole. This metric’s value being greater than 1 implies positive posts outpace the negatives ones, while it being under the mark suggests a bearish sentiment is held by the majority. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Ethereum Positive/Negative Sentiment over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum Positive/Negative Sentiment witnessed some very large spikes during the last couple of months of 2024. The peak of the metric during that period corresponded to positive comments outweighing negative ones by more than three times. The overwhelming bullish sentiment was a result of the sharp rally that ETH observed alongside the rest of the cryptocurrency sector. Interestingly, the run ran out of steam not too long after optimism spiked among the social media users. This pattern of the ETH price moving contrary to the expectations of the majority has actually been witnessed time and again, not just for ETH, but digital assets in general. From the chart, it’s visible that with the bearish price action that has followed in the last couple of months, the Positive/Negative Sentiment has seen a notable cooldown. After the latest continuation of the decline, that has taken Ethereum under the $2,000 level, the indicator’s value has dropped below the neutral 1 mark, indicating the traders on the social media platforms now believe in a bearish outcome for the asset. As mentioned before, though, it’s been a historical pattern that the coin’s price tends to go opposite to the crowd’s opinion. Thus, in this view, the dominance of fear on social media could be something that can help ETH attain a bottom. It only remains to be seen, however, whether the current sentiment is negative enough for this effect to take hold, or if the mood will have to worsen still for a rebound to occur. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is floating around $1,900, down more than 13% in the last seven days.",Ethereum|ETH|Ethereum Bottom|Ethereum FUD|ethereum price|Ethereum Social Media Sentiment|Ethereum Social Sentiment|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|RUNE|FDUSD,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-03-15 07:30:27

Within the last 45 minutes, the trader deposited 2.875M USDC into Hyperliquid to open a LINK long position with 10x leverage. Since February 7, this high-risk trader has pocketed $16.4M by flipping leveraged positions on ETH, BTC, HYPE, and YGG. Now, all eyes are on whether this LINK bet will deliver another payday or end in liquidation. However, his past trades have not only brought him massive profits but also raised concerns about the risks of extreme leverage on decentralized trading platforms. This whale is long $LINK on #Hyperliquid and #GMX , with a position size of ~$31M. He also spent 12.1M $USDC to buy 863,174 $LINK at $14. https://t.co/SncLPnog4v https://t.co/3fXA7ctoOh pic.twitter.com/kx7WWCiJ4R — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) March 14, 2025 The Big LINK Bet On March 14, the whale opened long positions on LINK worth approximately $31 million using 10x leverage on Hyperliquid and GMX, two major perpetual trading platforms. On top of that, he accumulated around $12 million in spot LINK. However, on-chain data shows that he has been gradually selling portions of his LINK holdings back into stablecoins, possibly securing profits or adjusting his exposure. The ETH Trade That Shook Hyperliquid This comes just days after his massive $200 million ETH long position on March 12, which led to millions in losses for Hyperliquid’s liquidity providers. The trade resulted in a $4 million deficit for the platform’s liquidity pool but landed the trader $1.8 million in profits. Over the past month, his total earnings from Hyperliquid alone have soared to $17 million, according to Web3 analytics firm Lookonchain. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : World Liberty Financial Denies Bloomberg’s Claims on Binance Stablecoin Talks , The incident highlighted the risks of leveraged trading, where traders can control huge positions with little capital. While some thought the whale exploited a loophole, Hyperliquid confirmed it was all within the rules—just an extreme case they hadn’t accounted for. To prevent future disruptions, the platform tightened its collateral requirements on March 13. Hyperliquid’s Growing Dominance Controversy aside, Hyperliquid continues to dominate decentralized derivatives trading. Since launching in 2024, it has taken 70% of the market, outpacing GMX and dYdX, as noted by VanEck. Adding to its momentum, the platform recently hit a major milestone of $1 trillion in lifetime trading volume, solidifying its spot among the top decentralized exchanges . What’s Next for Chainlink? Chainlink’s price has been all over the place. It shot up by over 150% after Trump won the election but has since dropped from nearly $30 in December to under $14 now. But with big traders like the ETH 50x whale jumping in, many are wondering if LINK is about to make another big move. Right now, it has a market value of $8.7 billion and is still an important player in the DeFi world. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The discussion follows a Bloomberg report claiming that WLFI, referred to as World Liberty Financial, was in talks with Binance over a potential collaboration. The talks reportedly include the possibility of developing a stablecoin backed by the US dollar. However, the extent of these negotiations and whether any formal agreements have been reached remain unclear. WLFI has positioned itself as a decentralized finance (DeFi) startup with a mission to democratize the financial system. “To get the facts straight: WLF is a DeFi project with a monumental mission to build and democratize a new financial system for the benefit of millions. It’s that simple,” the statement said.

The flagship coin surged 3 percent in the last 24 hours to trade at about $84,233 on Saturday, March 15, 2025. As a result of the mild rebound, more than $71 million was liquidated from the leveraged Bitcoin market, mostly involving short traders. Top Reasons Why Bitcoin Price Gained Today Encouraging Inflation Data In the past two days, major U.S. stock indexes led by the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq recorded mild recovery following an encouraging inflation update. Earlier this week, the U.S. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that overall prices rose less for consumers last month than expected despite the ongoing tariff wars triggered by President Donald Trump. The mild gains in major stock indexes trickled down to the wider crypto assets, led by Bitcoin. Cooled Leveraged Market The cryptocurrency market experienced a rather calmer period in the past two days after a notable forced liquidation earlier this week. The heavy liquidation of long traders, which previously triggered a long squeeze, has created an atmosphere that allows mild crypto recovery, led by Bitcoin. Moreover, the total Bitcoin futures Open Interest (OI) surged by over 5 percent in the last 24 hours to hover about $49 billion. Gold Price Surge For the first time in the history of humanity, gold price surged close to $3k per ounce earlier this week. With Bitcoin price perceived as digital gold by nation-states led by the United States, a mild recovery was imminent, and likely to continue in the coming days. What Next? After a nearly 30 percent correction since the second inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump is an American former president politician, businessman, and media personality, who served as the 45th president of the U.S. between 2017 to 2021. Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President Bitcoin price is possibly approaching the bottom of the multi-week correction phase. The highly anticipated implementation of the U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve has rejuvenated bullish sentiment for a parabolic rally beyond $108k in the near future. However, Bitcoin demand from whale investors remains low compared to last year. The U.S. spot BTC ETFs have now recorded five consecutive weeks of cash outflows. The overall supply of Bitcoin on centralized exchanges has not been dropping in the past few weeks, signaling low demand from whale investors.

As we enter March 2025, many investors are seeking the next big opportunities that could offer significant returns. Among the top contenders for attention are Cardano (ADA), Pi Network (PI), and Coldware (COLD) , all of which have seen increased interest and strong growth potential. An analyst forecast suggests that these three cryptocurrencies could experience a remarkable 28% uplift in March, making them the go-to options for investors looking to capitalize on the ongoing market momentum. Coldware (COLD): The ‘Solana 2.0’ with Web3 Mobile Mining Among the new entrants in the cryptocurrency space, Coldware (COLD) stands out as a promising alternative to traditional tokens like Cardano (ADA) and Pi Network (PI). Market analysts have dubbed Coldware (COLD) as the potential “Solana 2.0” due to its innovative Web3 mobile mining features and decentralized applications. The project focuses on providing scalable solutions in mobile mining, blockchain applications, and decentralized finance. Coldware (COLD) has been gaining traction as an emerging Web3 powerhouse, offering mobile mining capabilities to users in a way that rivals both Pi Network (PI) and Cardano (ADA). As the project continues its presale, more investors are flocking to Coldware (COLD) for its disruptive potential in the Web3 space. With the upcoming launch of its main website and Web3 mobile mining platform, Coldware (COLD) is poised for significant growth. Analysts predict that it could become a key player in the Web3 ecosystem, offering a new level of scalability and accessibility that traditional cryptocurrencies like Cardano (ADA) have yet to achieve. Cardano (ADA): A Resilient Force in the Crypto Market Cardano (ADA), the eighth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, continues to hold a strong position despite recent market volatility. Over the past few weeks, Cardano (ADA) has faced a price drop of 25.67%, but its fundamentals remain solid. With continued development of its smart contract platform and the growing DeFi ecosystem on Cardano (ADA), investors are increasingly bullish on its long-term potential. Technical analysis shows a potential for recovery, and many investors are betting on Cardano (ADA) bouncing back in March. As the market stabilizes and the project continues its technological advancements, Cardano (ADA) remains a safe bet for those seeking both short-term and long-term gains. Pi Network (PI): Mobile Mining with Massive Potential Pi Network (PI), which has gained considerable traction due to its unique approach to mobile mining, has seen a significant 15% price surge overnight, as it continues to garner interest from investors. Pi Network (PI) is rapidly gaining a large user base, with millions mining tokens directly from their smartphones. This has given Pi Network (PI)a massive advantage in terms of accessibility and inclusivity, making it a strong contender in the cryptocurrency space. The recent surge in trading volumes and the ongoing excitement surrounding Pi Network (PI), especially with its growing community, are signs of significant momentum. As Pi Network (PI) looks set to list on major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, it could see even more substantial growth in March, potentially pushing the token price closer to its all-time high of $2.99. Why These Three Cryptocurrencies Are Gaining Attention The continued focus on Cardano (ADA), Pi Network (PI), and Coldware (COLD) is not without reason. Cardano (ADA) is a well-established blockchain with a strong community and a solid track record, making it a safe investment for long-term growth. Pi Network (PI), on the other hand, continues to capture attention with its innovative mobile mining model and rapidly growing user base. Finally, Coldware (COLD), often referred to as the “Solana 2.0”, offers a new level of scalability and accessibility that could revolutionize the Web3 space. These three cryptocurrencies have strong fundamentals and unique features that set them apart from their competitors. Investors looking for solid returns in March 2025 should keep an eye on Cardano (ADA), Pi Network (PI), and Coldware (COLD) as they all have significant upside potential. As the crypto market continues to evolve, these three projects could offer significant returns for investors who act now. Whether you are looking for stability with Cardano (ADA), the revolutionary potential of Pi Network (PI), or the future of Web3 with Coldware (COLD), these cryptocurrencies are expected to show impressive gains in March 2025.

Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez outlined a slightly ridiculous price tag of $15, which would require a mindblowing surge. Being one of the largest cryptocurrencies for roughly a decade, XRP has attracted a substantial community that remains bullish no matter the current developments. Although the asset struggled for years after the 2017/2018 cycle, they kept making bold predictions and some of their faith was rewarded after the US presidential elections when XRP jumped from under $0.6 to match its 2018 ATH of $3.4. However, it couldn’t keep the momentum going, and the subsequent market-wide crash pushed it south hard. As of now, Ripple’s token, which could soon be categorized as a commodity in the US, trades at around $2.38. The positive predictions continue, and the latest to highlight a notable target for XRP was Ali Martinez, who said : “Since January 2018, XRP appears to be forming a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating a potential bullish continuation where every lower high XRP made created a descending trendline at the top and every higher low created a rising trendline at the bottom. Now that XRP has broken out of the triangle, there’s a chance XRP can continue rising to reach a target of $15.” The aforementioned current price tag means that the asset needs to surge by approximately 530% to reach that line, which sounds somewhat outrageous given the market conditions as of late. Moreover, it would put its market cap at close to $900 billion, which would be a lot higher than ETH and close to BTC. Although the $15 target does seem difficult to achieve, let’s not forget that XRP skyrocketed by 470% in mere months after the elections. Moreover, a potentially favorable resolution in the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit and an approved XRP ETF could boost the asset north once again.

Meanwhile, in the United States, a new bill seeks to formalize former President Donald Trump’s executive order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. However, Democrat Representative Gerald is pushing for the US Treasury to halt any efforts toward creating a crypto reserve. Sacks and his VC firm sold over $200M in crypto and stocks before WH role David Sacks and his venture capital firm sold over $200 million in crypto and crypto-related stocks before he commenced his role as the White House AI and crypto czar, a White House memorandum disclosed. “You and Craft Ventures have divested over $200 million of positions related to the digital asset industry, of which $85 million is directly attributable to you,” said the memorandum dated March 5. The memorandum said “significant steps” were taken to reduce potential conflicts of interest before Sacks began his tenure as the White House AI and crypto czar — in which a major part of his role is to help create a legal framework for the crypto industry. Sacks offloaded all the “liquid cryptocurrency” in his portfolio, as well as Craft Ventures' portfolio — the investment firm he co-founded in 2017 — including holdings in Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), and Solana ( SOL ), before US President Donald Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20. Argentina finalizes rules for virtual asset providers Argentina’s securities regulator has finalized rules for virtual asset service providers (VASPs), which cover general codes of conduct and custody requirements for cryptocurrency exchanges and other platforms facilitating digital asset transactions. The regulations were published on March 13 by the National Securities Commission, also known as CNV, under General Resolution No. 1058. According to a translated version of the announcement , the regulations impose “obligations regarding registration, cybersecurity, asset custody, money laundering prevention, and risk disclosure” on VASPs operating in the country. The stated goal of the rules is to guarantee “transparency, stability, and user protection in the crypto ecosystem,” the announcement said. Argentine tax lawyer Diego Fraga said the final guidelines include mandatory separation of company and client funds, annual audits and monthly reporting with the CNV. Source: Diego Fraga Since 2024, VASPs operating in Argentina have been required to register with the registry of virtual asset service providers, also known as PSAV. According to the new rules, registrations may be revoked for noncompliance, and any company operating without registration may be blocked by court order. US Rep. Byron Donalds to introduce bill codifying Trump’s Bitcoin reserve A new bill set to be introduced in Congress aims to formalize President Donald Trump’s executive order establishing a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, a move that could further integrate Bitcoin into the nation’s financial strategy. Trump signed an executive order on March 7 to use Bitcoin (BTC) seized in government criminal cases to establish a national reserve . The legislation, introduced by US Representative Byron Donalds, seeks to ensure the Bitcoin reserve becomes a permanent fixture, preventing future administrations from dismantling it through executive action. Source: Margo Martin “For years, the Democrats waged war on crypto,” Donalds, a Florida Republican, said in a statement to Bloomberg . “Now is the time for Congressional Republicans to decisively end this war.” If the bill is passed, it would ensure that the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the US Digital Asset Stockpile could not be eliminated via executive actions by a future administration. The bill will require at least 60 votes in the Senate and a House majority to pass. With Republicans holding a Senate majority — and amid a generally more crypto-friendly environment — the bill has a chance of passing.",Trump memecoin|Solana memecoin|TRUMP token|Solana|SOL|Nova Labs|SEC|Securities and Exchange Commission|crypto regulation|TRUMP rally|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|ICO|BCH|ETH|USDT|XRP|MATIC|ZK|ADA|TON|BNB|WLD|SOL|APT|ARB|AVAX|LINK|ASIA|MINING|USDC|FIAT|ARKM|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-15 07:45:00

At the heart of the discussion is whether XRP should be considered a commodity, similar to Ethereum (ETH), or if it falls under securities regulations. The SEC’s past decision not to take action against Ethereum despite its initial coin offering (ICO) has raised questions about inconsistent enforcement. Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David Schwartz, responded to these comparisons by emphasizing a key difference: ETH was privately sold before its blockchain existed, whereas XRP had no such pre-sale. Schwartz’s remarks were made in response to Fox Business Senior Correspondent Charles Gasparino, who discussed the ongoing settlement negotiations between Ripple and the SEC. Gasparino pointed out that the SEC is considering whether XRP’s utility and trading characteristics now align more closely with those of a commodity. He also emphasized the significance of Ethereum’s (ETH) regulatory treatment, stating that ETH was initially issued through an initial coin offering (ICO) but later recognized as a commodity. Gasparino questioned why XRP was singled out for legal action while ETH was not. David Schwartz’s clarification ties into ongoing SEC-Ripple settlement talks, where XRP’s classification as a commodity or security is debated, pic.twitter.com/pkBSa7F7rl — 𝗕𝗮𝗻𝗸XRP (@BankXRP) March 13, 2025 David Schwartz Refutes ETH-XRP Comparison In response, David Schwartz directly challenged the comparison between ETH and XRP. He stated, “ETH was privately sold by an issuer prior to any ledger or blockchain existing. XRP was not.” His argument reinforces the view that ETH had a pre-sale before its blockchain was operational, whereas XRP did not undergo a similar process. This distinction is critical because the SEC’s case against Ripple has largely relied on the claim that XRP’s issuance was akin to an unregistered securities offering. However, Schwartz’s statement highlights a fundamental difference in how the two assets were initially distributed. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Members of the XRP community have called out the SEC since the beginning of the lawsuit, as the regulator did not take legal action against Ethereum despite its pre-sale, whereas Ripple has faced years of litigation. What’s Next for XRP? The SEC’s inconsistent treatment of XRP and ETH highlights regulatory bias and selective enforcement. However, with former SEC Chair Gary Gensler out of the picture and his war on crypto winding down, many in the XRP army are willing to put the past behind them and work toward a future with sensible crypto regulation. Recent reports suggest that Ripple is negotiating for the removal of the permanent injunction preventing institutional sales. The end of the lawsuit would remove all questions about XRP’s status as a commodity and level the playing field.

The sudden spike comes amid growing speculations that the leading asset manager BlackRock could soon file for an ETF for Ripple’s native asset and Solana. Besides, renowned experts predicted a potential rally for the asset, potentially sending it to a new ATH. BlackRock’s ETF Filing Speculations Gain Traction The XRP community is abuzz with speculation following a recent statement from ETF Store President Nate Geraci. In a recent X post, Geraci suggested that BlackRock may file for both Solana and XRP ETFs in the near future. He emphasized that the giant asset manager, which currently leads in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF assets, is unlikely to let competitors take the lead on two of the top five non-stablecoin crypto assets. Geraci stated : “BlackRock will file for both Solana and XRP ETFs. Solana could be any day. Think xrp once the SEC lawsuit concluded. I simply don’t see them allowing competitors to come in & launch ETFs on 2 of the top 5 non-stablecoin crypto assets w/out any sort of fight.” Meanwhile, his comments have reignited investor confidence in XRP’s potential, especially as BlackRock’s involvement could drive major institutional interest. XRP Price Targets $5 Amid Bullish Projections Following Geraci’s statement, market analysts have turned bullish on XRP. Notably, a recent report hints at a potential rally for Ripple’s native asset to $15 in the coming days. Besides, another expert has shared a bullish forecast, hinting towards a new ATH ahead. Well-known crypto expert, Rose Premium Channels, shared an optimistic price prediction, suggesting that XRP could soon hit $5. According to the analysis, XRP’s key support levels lie at $2.1 and $2.2, while its next targets stand at $3, $4.2, and ultimately $5. With the potential ETF filing and the broader market recovery, traders anticipate a strong uptrend for XRP. Some analysts even project a double-digit long-term target, should the ETF materialize and market conditions remain favorable. XRP Price & Performance XRP price has jumped nearly 6% today and exchanged hands at $2.46 while touching a 24-hour high of $2.47. However, its one-day trading volume fell 20% to $4.6 billion. Besides, CoinGlass data showed that XRP Futures Open Interest soared more than 6% to $3.38 billion, reflecting the bullish market sentiment. Besides, a recent report also showed why Ripple’s coin is poised to continue its rally ahead. However, with soaring anticipation over the potential XRP ETF launch in the US, the market sentiment remains high with many expecting the crypto to touch a new high ahead.

Interestingly, he made headlines just before joining for selling $200M worth of crypto holdings, including Bitcoin. While he believes it is a strategic exit considering his role, others question whether he will regret it later, as Bitcoin looms into the full cycle, where experts anticipate a price rally (cycle top) to $440k. Bitcoin Price Rally: Crypto Analyst Predicts $440K Cycle Top Crypto analysts have been quite optimistic about the Bitcoin price trajectory for years. However, the recent downturn amid the market’s bearish sentiments and the crypto market crash caused investors to worry about this digital asset’s future. However, things align to change, as BTC’s price overcame the $84k barrier and is moving upward. Adding to the enthusiasm. Crypto analyst Josh Mandel has predicted BTC’s next milestone after his previous one came true. In a few-month-old post, he forecasted this digital asset to hit $84k on March 14, 2025, and that’s what happened. Not only that, the other mentioned dates also had the proper mention of big moves or turning points, shocking everyone with the accuracy of the forecast. Now, the eyes are on the next hint, built on the ‘Fourth Turning’ concept- a historical cycle theory suggesting drastic societal and economic shifts. In a poem, Josh Man says: When 84 becomes the base, Bitcoin CALLS will melt their face. This is how you get ahead of Buy IBIT calls in size. Instead of ten to one, you’ll write it up. The analyst Peter Duan, who decoded it, claims that the poem suggests $444k is the ultimate Bitcoin cycle top. This shot a new enthusiasm among investors, especially as a lot is happening around this asset, including the Bitcoin Reserve Executive Order signing. The global adoption is also at its peak; as Godman Sachs mentioned BTC & crypto for the first time in its annual shareholder letter, and a Minnesota senator introduced a bill to accept BTC payments. Did David Sacks Sell Too Early? Josh’s Bitcoin price prediction is just an anticipation, and the market’s unpredictability may change the direction. However, simultaneously, the accuracy of his predictions made people question whether David Sacks made the right decision. Sacks probably made this decision due to a conflict of interest. Many critics, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, have objected to Sack’s Crypto Czar role with high crypto holdings, but that’s no longer a discussion. Although this selling step aligns with his role, Donald Trump still holds his cryptos , resulting in investors questioning any additional motive. In the All-In podcast, Savid revealed that he did it “because I didn’t want to even have the appearance of a conflict,” said CNBC. Interestingly, there have been incidents where people sold their holdings at a low amid circumstances but regretted it. Now, it is time to see how things will take a turn, as analysts anticipate the BTC price will reach $440k. Final Thoughts: David Sacks & Bitcoin Price Trajectory in Doubt Predicting Bitcoin’s exact price trajectory accurately is challenging, but analyzing historical trends, institutional demand, and speculative enthusiasm could determine a perfect result. Josh Man succeeded in his predictions, and now the eyes are on his $440k BTC target. David Sacks’s $200M sale would become a missed opportunity if this happened. However, a different result would make his crypto exits worth it.

ADA price could now be on the verge of a massive upswing, with analysts predicting a 15% rally. However, there are also concerns that the listing may mark a local price top. Will this Coinbase listing drive sustained growth for Cardano price or trigger a sell-the-news event? Let’s explore. Cardano Price in Focus as Coinbase Files for ADA Futures Coinbase Derivatives is expanding its crypto offerings with ADA futures. The exchange has filed with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for this product. If it launches, it will boost liquidity and institutional interest in Cardano and potentially fuel gains. The Cardano futures will enable traders to gain exposure to ADA without holding the underlying asset. This offering will allow investors to use leveraged trading strategies. If the product is approved, it will launch on March 31. Coinbase Cardano Futures Futures listings have often spiked price volatility, and traders are now speculating about the impact that the launch will have on ADA price, which has been recording choppy price moves. At press time, Cardano trades at $0.74 with a 4.8% gain in 24 hours as the crypto market today rebounds. Will the Coinbase Listing Mark a Local Top for ADA? The upcoming launch of ADA futures could break Cardano from consolidation if it leads to a spike in social volumes. Historically, exchange listings drive speculative discussions that in turn result in high trading activity. Data from Santiment shows that Cardano social volumes peaked earlier this month after President Trump endorsed ADA as one of the US altcoins that will be part of the US digital asset stockpile. This saw the price hit a local top of around $1.12 before a sharp reversal. Cardano Social Volumes The recent Coinbase listing has yet to cause a surge in social volumes. This indicates that Cardano price still has room for growth before reaching another local top. However, this listing could end up being a sell-the-news event that will lead to a bearish reversal. Cardano Price Gears for a 15% Rally Analysts have shared a bullish Cardano price prediction after it bounced by nearly 5% to an intra-day high of $0.75 following the news of the Coinbase listing. Popular analyst Ali Charts forecasts that the altcoin could be on the verge of a 15% upswing after forming a symmetrical triangle pattern. ADA/USDT 1-hour Chart If ADA price breaks out of the upper resistance trendline, it could pave the way for the altcoin to reclaim $1 as traders buy into the rally that will be realized with the Coinbase listing later this month. Data from Coinglass also shows an uptick in activity in the derivatives market. The Cardano open interest has increased slightly in the last 4 days to $770M. If this rise in OI continues, it could add more fuel to the ADA price rally.

Analysts believe that it could continue climbing and reach $90,000 as long as it remains above the $84,000 support level, which is being tested now. Whales Buying, BTC Rising Large BTC wallets, typically referred to as whales or sharks, are crucial to the asset’s price movements due to their ability to purchase or offload massive portions in a rather short timeframe that could impact the entire market. After months of accumulating before and during the run toward $110,000, they changed their stance in early February following Trump’s tariffs against several countries. Inevitably, BTC’s price tumbled, and its most recent bottom came earlier this week with a drop below $77,000 – a four-month low. During this correction, though, whales and sharks reversed their strategy once again and began accumulating more of the asset. The last few days of the business week saw another buying spree, with more than 20,000 BTC going into their wallets, according to Ali Martinez, who cited data from Santiment. In terms of USD value, this stash is worth close to $1.7 billion. Whales have bought over 20,000 #Bitcoin $BTC in the last 48 hours! pic.twitter.com/5e6eLvYEiN — Ali (@ali_charts) March 14, 2025 The popular analyst told his 130,000 followers on X that bitcoin could surge to $90,000 as long as the $84,000 support, which is being tested as of press time, holds. Leveraged Run? Although whales purchasing substantial portions of BTC within a few days could indeed impact bitcoin’s price, as well as the entire market, which has jumped since Thursday, CryptoQuant’s Maartunn outlined another possible reason behind the relief rally. He noted that the Bitcoin Open Interest had increased by about 13% from the recent lows and is close to $28 billion now. Consequently, he warned that this surge could be driven by a large number of leveraged positions, which is a double-edged sword. In case of a rapid BTC price crash, those leveraged longs could result in a massive liquidation cascade , as we have witnessed on a few occasions since the February correction. Leverage Driven Pump!

However, XRP lawyer John Deaton set the record straight, stating that the regulator hasn’t shared any such information. Did US SEC Release Details on Crypto Roles? John Deaton Weighs In According to recent reports, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has released details on the potential roles of altcoins such as XRP, SOL, and ADA within the government. Reportedly, XRP is recognized as suitable for state-level financial transactions. Its primary goal is to optimize government payments and enhance interbank liquidity. Meanwhile, ADA is deemed ideal for academic credentialing, smart contracts for government services, and secure infrastructure management. At the same time, SOL may be used for high-speed blockchain applications. These includes real-time government databases, secure voting mechanisms, and digital identity management. However, XRP lawyer John Deaton dismissed these rumors asserting that the SEC still remains silent on the potential roles of these assets under the Trump government. He stated, “The SEC did not release any such thing.” US SEC Acknowledges XRP as a Strategic Financial Asset Reportedly, the US SEC acknowledged XRP as a strategic financial asset. The official website of the US SEC published a document entitled “Comprehensive Proposal: XRP as a Strategic Financial Asset for the US,” which explained how XRP is poised to play a pivotal role in the US financial landscape. The regulator also proposed the potential roles of other cryptocurrencies too. The document read, Solana and Cardano should be integrated into U.S. digital infrastructure but not included in the reserve strategy. Instead, they enhance efficiency and security for state applications, while XRP remains the key asset for financial transactions. While some claim this as the SEC’s clarification on the potential roles of these assets in the US government, John Deaton denies it. He has disputed the claim, stating that the regulator has not released any such clarification. This denial has sparked confusion and debate among crypto enthusiasts, highlighting the need for official confirmation from the US SEC. This comes following John Deaton’s recent endorsement of Bitcoin amid the BTC vs XRP war. He highlighted Bitcoin’s potential, pointing out the significance of holding BTC in one’s portfolio. Community Seeks Clarity on SEC Proposal, Appreciates John Deaton Notably, John Deaton’s post gained widespread attention as it provides clarity to the prevailing rumors about the SEC’s clarifications on XRP, SOL, and ADA. This development comes on the heels of Trump’s decision to include these altcoins, along with Bitcoin, into the US reserve. Many remain concerned about the circulating misinformation. Meanwhile, XRP lawyer Bill Morgan reinforced Deaton’s claim stating, “Where does it come from. Endless false information.” Following John Deaton’s clarification, the community acknowledged that the document on the SEC’s website is merely a proposal submitted by someone. They believe that it might not be authored by the SEC itself. This development highlights the importance of verifying information through reputable sources to avoid spreading misinformation.

There’s a mix of excitement and anxiety, as some believe the case is close to ending, while others think there’s still a long wait ahead. Jeremy Hogan Thinks a Private Settlement Could End It All Recently crypto legal expert Jeremy Hogan dropped a major prediction, saying the SEC and Ripple could settle the lawsuit privately. If that happens, there would be no court battles, no appeals, and no delays—just clarity for Ripple and XRP. This would be a game-changer, allowing banks and institutions to start using XRP without fear of legal trouble.

Meanwhile,… pic.twitter.com/pdKWuilhcZ — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) March 14, 2025 Crypto analyst X Finance Bull backed Hogan’s view, saying that once clear rules are in place, XRP’s true value will finally be unlocked. He pointed out that XRP is already outperforming Bitcoin and Ethereum, and if clarity comes soon, XRP could see a massive rally. According to him, patience will pay off for those holding onto their tokens. Some Analysts Say It’s Not That Simple Not everyone is convinced. X user Steven Hausser says a private settlement isn’t happening anytime soon. He believes nothing will move until former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins joins in May or June. After that, regulatory clarity needs to come before XRP can truly take off. Hausser does see a bright future, though—he expects XRP’s price to rise in spring and summer, continue growing in the fall, and possibly hit $6 or $8 by 2026. X Finance Bull agreed, saying that once regulations are in place, XRP holders who stayed patient will be the real winners. Is XRP a Commodity? The SEC Might Decide Soon In another twist, the SEC is reportedly considering classifying XRP as a commodity. Crypto journalist Eleanor Terrett, citing anonymous sources, says the lawsuit is nearing its conclusion. This case started back in 2020, and in 2023, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple’s open-market sales of XRP weren’t securities, going against the SEC’s claims. However, she did agree with the SEC that Ripple’s direct sales to big investors were securities. Ripple’s legal team is still fighting to reduce a $125 million fine, which is causing more delays. Meanwhile, Fox Business reporter Charles Gasparino confirmed that the SEC is actively discussing XRP’s status. SCOOP: Off of @EleanorTerrett 's scoop from yesterday on the @Ripple – @SECGov settlement negotiations, one issue that is being weighed by the commission is whether $XRP continues to trade and have a utility that makes it more a commodity and not a security. I am told the… — Charles Gasparino (@CGasparino) March 13, 2025 What Happens Next? If XRP is officially labeled a commodity, it could clear the way for bigger adoption and finally end the legal drama. With the SEC dropping other crypto cases and the Trump administration pushing for friendlier regulations, the timing couldn’t be more interesting.

According to Ali Martinez, Solana has the potential to surge by a staggering 2,900%, pointing to the formation of a cup and handle pattern as a strong indicator of a bullish trend, he said in an X post on March 14. Solana price analysis chart. Source: Ali Martinez Martinez noted that since November 2021, Solana has experienced a U-shaped decline, followed by a level-off phase, which is now evolving into the pattern’s “handle.” This technical formation is often seen as a precursor to a major upward movement in price. The cup and handle pattern is bullish, where the price forms a rounded bottom (the cup) followed by a consolidation phase (the handle). A breakout above the resistance level signals a potential rally. Martinez suggested that Solana could break the $200 resistance, paving the way for a surge toward $4,000. He emphasized that if Solana can decisively break above the $200 mark, the odds of a continued bullish rally increase significantly. In this case, a $4,000 valuation would likely elevate Solana to the highest-ranked digital asset with a market cap exceeding $2 trillion, provided Bitcoin ( BTC ) stagnates during this period. Meanwhile, another analysis by Ted Pillows in an X post on March 14 also stressed the significance of Solana holding the $110 level, as dropping below this mark could usher in a sustained correction for SOL. Solana price analysis chart. Source: Ted Pillows The expert stated that Solana stands at a key juncture, considering its retest of a multi-year support zone and a long-term uptrend line. Historically, these levels have provided strong buying opportunities. He highlighted the importance of the $110 to $120 zone, noting that failure to hold support could open the door for a deeper correction of 30% to 40%. However, a successful bounce could signal a reversal, with a potential upside if bullish momentum returns. Solana price fundamentals Although technical indicators are crucial to Solana’s next price trajectory, other fundamentals are also coming into play, with the spot exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) ranking as a key factor. Several entities have applied for the product with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). On March 11, the SEC postponed its decision on multiple altcoin ETFs, including those for XRP , Solana, Litecoin ( LTC ), and Dogecoin ( DOGE ). The agency extended its review period, pushing decisions on Grayscale’s XRP ETF and Cboe BZX’s Solana ETF to May. SEC ETF verdict.

Fellow analyst Eric Balchunas added that other ETF proposals, including one for Ethereum ( ETH ) staking, were also delayed. Eth staking and in-kind also delayed. Everything delayed. It's like the NYC-bound Amtrak on monday morning: ""Mechanical issues in DC"" — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) March 11, 2025 The SEC has previously extended crypto ETF decisions amid leadership changes following Gary Gensler’s exit from the regulator. Although part of Solana’s momentum last year was driven by meme coin activity on its network, an ETF approval could help broaden SOL’s appeal and attract long-term investors. On the other hand, a proposal to slash Solana’s inflation rate by 80% (SIMD-228) has failed to pass after falling short of the required 66.67% approval. Despite securing 61.39% “Yes” votes, opposition from smaller validators tipped the balance, keeping SOL issuance unchanged. The decision could lead to short-term selling pressure, as lower inflation would have reduced token supply, potentially driving up SOL’s price. However, higher rewards may sustain validator participation and network security, a long-term positive. SOL price analysis As of press time, Solana was trading at $133.10, well below its 50-day ($183.93) and 200-day ($186.79) moving averages ( MA ), signaling a strong downtrend. The asset’s market sentiment remains bearish, with the Fear & Greed Index at 27 (Fear). However, the 14-day relative strength index ( RSI ) stands at 35.38. SOL must reclaim $150 and break above key resistance levels to reverse the bearish trend. Until then, downside risks remain in play.

The U.S. Treasury Department’s daily reports show that despite Elon’s massive layoffs and budget cuts, the federal government is spending money even faster than before. Since January 21, 2025, when Donald Trump took office for his second term and put Elon in charge of federal budget cuts, the government has spent more than it did during the same periods in 2023 and 2024. Adjusting for inflation barely changes the picture—spending is still higher than last year. D.O.G.E was supposed to slash government waste, shut down costly agencies, and end reckless spending. But after weeks of cuts, contract cancellations, and chaos, the government’s financial reports show no actual savings. Elon promised that his strategy would cut spending deeper than Margaret Thatcher’s policies in the 1980s, but reality is telling a different story. Nothing has changed—except for the people who lost their jobs. D.O.G.E cuts aren’t lowering government spending The biggest problem for D.O.G.E is simple: it’s cutting in the wrong places. The Treasury’s financial breakdowns show that the parts of the budget Elon can actually touch don’t add up to much. In 2022, the total payroll for civilian government employees was just 4% of federal spending. Adding in active-duty military salaries only raised it to 7%. Even if D.O.G.E fired every single government worker, the government would still be spending over 90% of its budget. Government contracts aren’t the issue either. In 2023, nondefense agency contracts made up 5% of federal spending, and with the Defense Department included, it was 12%. Elon’s team has cut plenty of contracts, but those reductions barely make a dent in overall spending. Source: D.O.G.E website The real money? Entitlement programs and debt interest. Spending on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid accounts for most of the budget, and interest on the national debt grows every year. But D.O.G.E doesn’t control any of that. Elon can fire as many employees as he wants and shut down as many agencies as possible—the money will still be spent. The numbers also show that discretionary spending, which once accounted for three-quarters of the federal budget in the 1960s, has now shrunk to just over a quarter. The part that D.O.G.E actually controls—nondefense discretionary spending—was only 14.9% of total spending in 2023. Even if Elon eliminated every single thing D.O.G.E was targeting, the federal budget would still be massive. Elon is running into the same problem David Stockman faced in the Reagan administration. Stockman cut real non-defense discretionary spending by 18% in three years, but it still didn’t stop the government from spending more overall. That’s because defense spending grew, and entitlement programs remained untouched—just like today. D.O.G.E is causing chaos, not efficiency Since its launch, D.O.G.E has moved quickly, but not effectively. Elon’s department has laid off thousands, shut down agencies, and slashed contracts faster than anyone expected. But instead of improving efficiency, the strategy has backfired. The first round of layoffs hit probationary employees first, removing the newest hires and recently promoted staff—the people who were supposed to help modernize government operations. D.O.G.E had to walk this decision back. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) was dismantled, but then partially restored when banks realized they needed it to roll back regulations. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) saw major cutbacks, which contrasted with the Reagan administration’s strategy of increasing IRS funding to boost tax enforcement. The result was less money being collected and an even bigger deficit for America. Even D.O.G.E’s financial reports are unreliable. The department claims to be saving billions, but independent financial experts keep finding major discrepancies. Instead of making the numbers clear, D.O.G.E has made it harder to check federal spending data at all. While Elon’s leadership team includes tech industry names like Joe Gebbia, co-founder of Airbnb, and Steve Davis, one of Elon’s longtime business partners, none of them have government experience. Running a business is not the same as running a government. The U.S. budget isn’t a startup that can be optimized through layoffs and automation. The biggest problem might be Elon himself. The man who built Tesla and SpaceX is the same one who spends hours posting on X (formerly Twitter). There’s a difference between Elon Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur, and @elonElon, the account posting non-stop rants about politics and crypto. The federal government has handed real power to the second one. Santi Ruiz, a policy researcher at the Institute for Progress, summed up the situation: “Everyone evaluating D.O.G.E right now is like a blind man feeling different parts of an elephant.” No one can see the whole picture yet. But the parts we can see don’t look good.",OP-ED|CFPB|D.O.G.E|IRS|USD,EN,0,0,DOGE|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-15 08:15:06

Crypto analyst David (@david_dogecoin) suggests that, if confirmed, Dogecoin could be targeting an ambitious price target of $4. Dogecoin Cup And Handle Pattern The first stage of this pattern, the cup, began taking shape when Dogecoin initially declined from its May 2021 all time high at $0.74. This downward movement led to an extended consolidation period, where the asset gradually formed a rounded bottom in the $0.05–$0.06 range. The curvature of the price action suggests a slow but steady shift in market sentiment, where selling pressure was gradually absorbed by buyers accumulating DOGE at lower levels. As time progressed, Dogecoin started to recover from this bottom, pushing back towards its December 2024 high at $0.48. The gradual and steady rise back to this high signals that bullish momentum has been building, with increasing interest from market participants. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breakout Alert! This Pattern Could Trigger A ‘Parabolic’ Surge After reaching the $0.48 resistance level, Dogecoin faced a rejection, leading to a moderate pullback. This decline formed the handle, a smaller downward retracement that typically precedes the final breakout. The handle in this setup is forming around the $0.14–$0.17 price zone, where the market is currently consolidating. The handle serves as the last phase where weaker hands exit, and stronger buying interest gathers momentum before a decisive move higher. If Dogecoin successfully breaks out of the cup and handle pattern, the projected price target can be estimated using the measured move technique. This involves calculating the depth of the cup and adding that value to the breakout point. Based on this method, the expected target is around $4, according to the chart shared by analyst Kevin. Critique: Why This Is Not A Classic Cup And Handle A textbook cup and handle requires specific structural characteristics, including a rounded bottom and a shallow handle, forming near a prior all-time high or key resistance zone before a breakout. However, there are critical deviations in this analysis that cast doubt on its validity. Related Reading: Dogecoin’s Darkest Hour? Sentiment Tanks, Whales Accumulate The decline from $0.74 (May 2021 ATH) to $0.05–$0.06 is too deep and prolonged to be considered a proper cup formation. Classic cup patterns typically form over weeks to months, not multiple years of extended downtrend. The recovery from $0.05–$0.06 to $0.48 is not symmetrical with the initial drop, making the “rounded bottom” aspect of the cup questionable. Instead, the price action resembles a multi-year accumulation phase rather than a continuous rounding structure. Moreover, the handle is forming too deep in the structure. A valid handle should develop near the rim (i.e., close to $0.48), but in this case, Dogecoin has retraced all the way down to $0.14–$0.17—which is a massive drop of over 65% from the supposed cup rim. A healthy handle should not drop below 50% of the cup’s depth, but here, it retraces nearly to the lower third of the structure, invalidating the classical pattern. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.17.

Is the SOL hype train a myth? Will price recover and kickstart an uptrend here? Let’s find out. Why 40M Unique Crypto Tokens Were Created On Solana Even as the Price Crashed 62%? The unique value proposition of PumpFun that allows investors even a layman to simply create a token with a click of a button is why the total unique crypto tokens on Solana Blockchain continue to explode. Even as SOL value shed 62% in the last 52 days, this metric continues to rise, showcasing that retail investors’ risk-taking appetite is yet to climax. Unique Crypto Tokens Created on Solana Blockchain Does this mean a reversal in Solana price is what’s next? Unlikely. The price action of Solana is dependent on the larger crypto market ecosystem and the macroeconomic policies that impact Bitcoin (BTC). So, what’s next for SOL? Will Solana Price Soar as Altcoin Dominance Hints Reversal? The altcoin dominance, which is the combined market capitalization of cryptocurrency ecosystem excluding Bitcoin. The recent recovery of altcoin market cap above $218 billion notes that a resurgence of bullish momentum. A decisive breakout above the $229 billion to $230 billion level will suggest a shift in market structure favoring bulls. Such a development will indicate that there could be a mini bull run, which pushes the market cap to the $300 billion to $310 billion range. Altcoin Market Capitalization Hence, investors can expect Solana, which is at the forefront of top altcoins to hold, to trigger a bullish reversal. How High Can Solana Go? Based on the recent price action, Solana has recovered above the February 28 swing low of $125, signaling a resurgence of bullish momentum. To add credence to the buying pressure, SOL has also produced a higher high on the daily chart. The next key support zone is $128 to $120, a bounce here could see the altcoin propel to the range high of $179. But ideal take profit levels based on bullish Solana price predictions extend from $180 to $186.

The announcement sparked significant whale activity, with popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighting the trend early Monday. “Whales bought an additional 140 million DOGE in the last 24 hours,” Martinez tweeted. This followed a significant accumulation spree over the weekend, with whales amassing 910 million DOGE in just 48 hours. On Friday, Martinez reported that whales were “buying the dip,” acquiring more than 530 million DOGE over 72 hours. The renewed interest comes after a prolonged quiet period, particularly since January 25, when DOGE’s price began to decline, leading to a loss of investor enthusiasm and waning whale activity. However, the latest surge has reignited momentum, primarily driven by Elon Musk’s involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The agency’s acronym aligning with Dogecoin’s name has sparked renewed excitement, mirroring its November 2024 rally when Trump announced the department, appointing Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to key roles. This event triggered a 15% price spike. Speaking on The Joe Rogan Experience last week, Musk acknowledged the unexpected link between Dogecoin and the newly formed government agency. “Doge started as a meme coin, right? A joke cryptocurrency with memes and dogs. But somehow, the letters just lined up perfectly, ” Musk explained . “ Originally, I was going to call it the Government Efficiency Commission, which is a very boring name. Then people online were like, ‘No, it needs to be the Department of Government Efficiency,’ and I was like, you know what? You’re right.” Notably, the growing attention around DOGE and its unusual but high-profile connection to a government agency has fueled speculation that Dogecoin could also soon be considered for the crypto reserve becoming the first meme coin. If that happens, Dogecoin’s price and legitimacy could spike, solidifying its place not just as a joke, but as a serious asset in the evolving digital economy. With renewed interest and increasing whale accumulation, analysts predict further gains for DOGE. On Monday, analyst Kaleo shared a chart highlighting DOGE’s breakout from a multi-month resistance trendline. “DOGE is currently sitting at resistance from the downtrend it has been stuck under for the past two months. I wouldn’t be surprised if it takes a brief pause before breaking higher, but when it does, I expect the move up to be violent and much quicker than the move down.” Kaleo noted . At press time, the meme coin was retesting this critical level. Meanwhile, analyst ByllifyX pointed to a bullish flag formation, offering an even more aggressive outlook. “DOGE isn’t just mooning, it’s teleporting to another galaxy. $3+ soon. Stay bullish,” he stated. At press time, DOGE was trading at $0.17 reflecting a 1.19% surge in the past 24 hours.",Cryptocurrency|News|Doge|Dogecoin,EN,0,0,DOGE|TRADING|FIAT|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-15 08:32:49

The initiative, unveiled on Sunday, included XRP, SOL, and ADA before BTC and ETH were added. The news, arriving just days ahead of the highly anticipated first-ever crypto summit later this week, sent Bitcoin soaring past $94,000. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization reclaimed the $3 trillion mark as traders scrambled to capitalize on the potential impact of the development. However, while many in the crypto community have lauded the announcement as a step toward legitimizing crypto assets nationally, others have raised concerns, questioning the timing and potential conflicts of interest surrounding the decision. One of the most immediate concerns surfaced after an anonymous crypto whale executed a highly leveraged trade just hours before Trump’s announcement. On Sunday morning, the trader went 50x long on Bitcoin and Ethereum, turning a $4 million position into $200 million. By the time the news broke, the whale had already exited most of their trades, securing a profit of just over $6.5 million in less than 24 hours, triggering widespread speculation about potential insider trading. Another point of controversy revolves around David Sacks, Trump’s newly appointed Crypto Czar. Derek Martin, founder of Pathfinder Research, pointed out that Sacks has long-standing financial ties to Bitwise Asset Management, which holds Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana , XRP , and Cardano , the very assets included in the proposed Crypto Reserve. Martin argued that Sacks’ role as a major investor in Bitwise via Craft Ventures since 2017 suggests a potential conflict of interest, as the announcement directly benefited Bitwise and its investors. “These coins are all pumping like crazy on this strategic reserve announcement, which means Bitwise and it’s investors – like David Sacks – are making a ton of money right now .” Said Martin . “Congress must investigate and determine if David Sacks or Donald Trump’s personal investment holdings are driving US crypto policy.” However, in a separate post, Sacks quickly denied the allegations, stating, “I sold all my cryptocurrency (including BTC, ETH, and SOL) before the start of the administration.” He further clarified that he previously held a $74,000 position in the Bitwise ETF, which he sold on January 22. Dismissing claims of “large indirect holdings,” he assured that he would provide an update once the ethics review process is complete. Beyond concerns over insider trading and conflicts of interest, industry leaders have voiced differing opinions on the structure of the U.S. Crypto Reserve. In a tweet, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong suggested that Bitcoin alone might be the best choice, arguing that it provides the clearest narrative as a digital successor to gold. He proposed a market cap-weighted index of top cryptocurrencies to maintain neutrality. Meanwhile, Ki Young Ju, founder of CryptoQuant, offered a more geopolitical perspective, warning that the U.S. could be weaponizing cryptocurrency markets. He asserted that Trump’s policies have shifted moral standards in the industry, favoring assets that align with U.S. national interests. According to Ju, this strategy could marginalize Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have long sought neutrality as global digital assets.",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano|Donald Trump|Ripple|USA|XRP News,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-15 08:45:20

According to an announcement by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), the crypto influencer TJ Stone committed wire fraud, scamming investors out of more than $1.3 million. In the announcement, the DOJ mentioned that Sfraga, who had already pleaded guilty in May 2024, was sentenced in the Eastern District of New York. According to the authorities, TJ Stone lied to investors, posing as the owner of multiple businesses, including Vandelay Contracting Corp, a name he got from the sitcom Seinfeld. Authorities also said he presented himself as an emcee at several crypto events around New York. Sfraga convinced investors to invest in a fake cryptocurrency called virtual wallet, promising them returns as high as 60% over the next three months after their initial deposit. Instead of using the funds for the reasons he was paid, Sfraga was said to have used some of it for personal businesses and to pay off earlier investors, making it a Ponzi-like investment scheme. United States authorities arrest crypto influencer for fraud Aside from the prison sentence, Sfraga has been ordered to pay about $1.3 million in forfeiture, with his restitution amount to be determined at a later date. United States Attorney John Durham mentioned that he stole from several investors including his next-door neighbors and other people he was able to convince to invest in the cryptocurrency. “There was nothing funny about his use of a Seinfeldian company, Vandelay Industries, to carry out this fraud, which caused severe financial and emotional harm to the hard-working men and women who trusted him,” he added. According to the court filing, Sfraga carried out his criminal activities from 2016 to 2022, lying to investors about being the owner of multiple businesses which included Building Strong Homes LLC. Authorities connected his use of Vandelay Contracting Corp to a fictional Vandelay Industries to the TV show called Seinfeld. Authorities added that he defrauded about 17 victims, including investors from Brooklyn, Long Island, and Staten Island. Aside from his illegal crypto business, he also convinced other investors to loan him money or invest in multiple sham businesses, which he said involved purchasing, renovating, and sometimes flipping homes. The court filing noted that he convinced one of his victims to lend him $100,000 in cash to cover start-up costs on a construction project that was non-existence. New York intensifies crypto fraud crackdown United States authorities mentioned that they started looking into Sfraga after several investors filed complaints about him not fulfilling the end of their agreements. The lawsuit led to him fleeing to Arizona to live under a false identity. He was eventually apprehended in Las Vegas after he was arrested for running out on his bill at the Wynn Casino. This latest conviction is part of a broader crackdown on crypto fraud in New York after United States President Donald Trump appointed John Durham as the interim United States Attorney. Other notable cases involve that of SafeMoon CEO Braden John Karony, who has requested a delay in the case because of the shift in the approach to enforcement by the current administration. In addition, there have been some high-profile crypto personalities docked for several crimes that have explored the option of a presidential pardon. According to reports, former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has explored the option while still serving his 25-year jail term. Another personality is former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, who completed a four-month jail term in 2024, but Zhao has denied any interest in a pardon. The recent crypto personality vying for a presidential pardon is Roger Ver nicknamed Bitcoin Jesus, who is currently facing a life sentence for tax evasion and mail fraud. Several influential crypto personalities have spoken up for Ver, urging President Trump to grant him a pardon, with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin campaigning for him. The crypto community is still divided over the issue, with some seeing the case as the same with previously pardoned Ross Ulbricht, while others say he has to face the consequences of his actions.

The latest burn metrics by the coin’s community indicated a staggering 535 million tokens destroyed in the past 7 days. As an upshot, traders and investors eye looming price gains, whilst a renowned market analyst further highlights the potential for a 22% rally soon. Shiba Inu Price Bullish As 535M Tokens Burnt Weekly SHIB coin’s price today gained over 2% intraday and closed in at $0.00001276. The meme coin bottomed and peaked at $0.00001244 and $0.0000129, respectively. For context, the rising price trajectory aligns with the massive blow to the supply brought by a phenomenal weekly burn chronicle. According to the data from Shibburn on X , 535.85 million SHIB tokens were burnt over the past seven days, resulting in a 415% upswing in the weekly burn rate. With this massive burn weighing in, a staggering 410.49 trillion coins have been burnt to date in total. For context, the burn mechanism deals a massive blow to the meme coin’s market supply by sending tokens to a null address. Therefore, crypto market traders and investors anticipate a bolstered effect on Shiba Inu price amid reduced supply, mirroring the law of supply and demand. Intraday Burn Meanwhile, the intraday burn data indicated that 5.11 million coins were destroyed in the past 24 hours. The constant burns further fuel market optimism surrounding the crypto’s long-term price prospects. Notably, a total of 999.99 trillion SHIB tokens were created, of which roughly 410 trillion have been destroyed to date. Yet, market watchers eagerly await phenomenal returns as the current bull cycle halted amid macro heat. Can SHIB Price Gain 22%? Nevertheless, with the broader crypto market showing a recovery trend this weekend, investors remain optimistic about future movements. As mentioned above, Shiba Inu’s price entered the green zone leveraging its burn rate surge today. In the midst of this optimism, a crypto market analyst took to X, revealing crucial price statistics. As per analyst ‘Rose Premium Signals,’ SHIB recently challenged the upper resistance of a falling wedge pattern on the 4H chart, marking a crucial move.

Crypto and Stock Holdings Offloaded Before Trump’s Inauguration Before Donald Trump was sworn in as the 47th U.S. president on January 20, Sacks liquidated all his personal cryptocurrency holdings, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). Craft Ventures also sold off its crypto investments, ensuring that neither Sacks nor his firm held digital assets upon his appointment. Sacks also divested from publicly traded crypto firms such as Coinbase (COIN) and Robinhood (HOOD), along with stakes in private digital asset companies. Furthermore, he exited his limited partner interests in Solana-focused Multichain Capital and Blockchain Capital, while Craft Ventures offloaded its holdings in Multichain Capital and Bitwise Asset Management. Since Trump’s inauguration, the crypto market has experienced a downturn, with many attributing the decline to uncertainty surrounding U.S. interest rates and proposed tariffs. Bitcoin had reached an all-time high of $109,000 just hours before Trump took office, but by February 27, it had fallen below $80,000, wiping out all post-election gains. As of publication, Bitcoin is trading around $84,155, according to CoinMarketCap. The memorandum surfaced one day before Senator Elizabeth Warren sent a March 6 letter demanding that Sacks prove he no longer holds any cryptocurrency. The request followed Sacks’ public statement on X confirming that he had sold all his crypto holdings. Correct. I sold all my cryptocurrency (including BTC, ETH, and SOL) prior to the start of the administration. https://t.co/dN6nuGQUtu — David Sacks (@DavidSacks) March 3, 2025 Warren questioned the timing of Sacks’ divestment, asking for transparency regarding when he and Craft Ventures offloaded their positions and whether individuals close to him benefited from the recent price surge before selling. Sacks’ Views on Crypto Regulation Since assuming his role at the White House, Sacks has been a vocal advocate for the crypto industry. He has pushed for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and warned against excessive taxation on digital assets. Most recently, on the All In Podcast, he rejected the idea of a crypto transaction tax , after host Jason Calacanis proposed a 0.01% tax on all cryptocurrency transactions. “That’s always how taxes start. They are described as being very modest,” Sacks warned, referencing how income tax was initially applied to only a few Americans before expanding to the broader population. President Donald Trump has previously proposed eliminating the federal income tax and replacing it with tariffs on imported goods. He has argued that tariffs once fully funded the U.S. government in the 19th century, a period he described as an era of significant prosperity.

Top Trader Says It Will Happen If This History Repeats,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-to-reach-100-top-trader-says-it-will-happen-if-this-history-repeats/,"Crypto influencer Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) recently sparked a debate on X by comparing today’s skepticism about a $100 XRP price to the doubts surrounding $1 XRP in the early years. His post drew a flood of responses from the community, with some asserting that history is repeating itself and that a three-digit valuation is inevitable. Back the early days of XRP (2013-2016) $1.00 per coin was thought to be impossible I’m seeing similar rhetoric today about a $100 XRP — Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) March 13, 2025 XRP’s Price Trajectory Through the Years XRP was created in 2012 to facilitate fast and efficient cross-border transactions. From 2013 to 2016, its price remained below $0.01, and many investors doubted it would ever reach $1. However, things quickly began to change for the digital asset. In 2017, it experienced an unprecedented rally, rising from fractions of a cent to an all-time high of approximately $3.84 in January 2018. This surge was fueled by speculative interest, a booming cryptocurrency market, and growing institutional adoption of Ripple’s payment solutions. However, the price crashed in 2018 amid a broader market downturn. The SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple in 2020 further suppressed the cryptocurrency’s price , keeping it below $1 for extended periods. While it surpassed this level to hit a multi-year high of $1.96 in 2021, it quickly fell and remained below $1 until late 2024 shortly before former SEC Chair Gary Gensler announced his resignation . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The $100 XRP Target While the asset struggled for years, many criticized the community for their faith in the asset, laughing at the prospect of hitting $1. However, the digital asset hit a multi-year high of $3.39 in January 2025 and has stayed well above $1 since it surpassed that level in November. Although the lawsuit is still ongoing, XRP remains a top cryptocurrency. The debate over its future price trajectory continues, with some predicting that XRP will eventually reach $100. Despite the skepticism from the crypto space, many investors share Cobb’s optimism. One commenter stated , “History repeats itself. $100 XRP is not only possible but inevitable given XRP’s utility and institutional adoption.” Another pointed out that once the asset hits $100, people will say $589 is impossible. Others remained cautious, with one remarking , “Let’s get to 10 first,” while another pointed out , “So many things need to happen for it to even get to $10.” Many experts are convinced that XRP is going to $100 soon , and while multiple factors will determine its trajectory, its short, and long-term outlooks are bullish.

Recent data from Arkham Intelligence shows BlackRock added 268 BTC ($22 million) on March 14, despite ongoing market fluctuations. Beyond Bitcoin, BlackRock also owns 1.2 million ETH ($2.3 billion) alongside other altcoins, showcasing its diversified crypto strategy. More notably, in February 2025, BlackRock integrated its Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) into its model portfolio, a move that could attract institutional investors seeking indirect BTC exposure.

While short-term Bitcoin ETF outflows have spurred market uncertainty, BlackRock’s strategic accumulation suggests long-term confidence, potentially supporting price stability and renewed bullish momentum. U.S. Lawmaker Moves to Secure Bitcoin as National Reserve In a pivotal legislative push, U.S. Representative Byron Donalds is drafting a bill to legalize former President Donald Trump’s executive order establishing the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Trump’s directive, signed on March 7, mandates the government to utilize seized BTC as a national reserve asset. Donalds’ proposal aims to prevent future administrations from dismantling the Bitcoin reserve, ensuring long-term government involvement in digital assets. The bill requires Senate and House approval, and with Republican leadership, the chances of passage appear strong.

Daily Technical Outlook: Bitcoin (BTC/USD) – March 15, 2025 The Bitcoin price today is $83,657, with a 24-hour trading volume of $28.33 billion. Bitcoin has gained 1.46% in the last 24 hours, holding the #1 market ranking with a $1.66 trillion market cap. The circulating supply stands at 19,837,137 BTC, with a fixed maximum of 21 million BTC. Technical Analysis Bitcoin recently broke above a descending trendline, signaling bullish momentum above $82,640—where the 50-period EMA has acted as a key support level. The breakout pushed BTC toward $85,312, its immediate resistance, but momentum has slowed, raising the possibility of a short-term consolidation or a pullback. A break above $85,312 would clear the path toward $88,046 and $91,117, potentially triggering a new leg up in the bull cycle. However, failure to maintain momentum could result in a pullback to $82,640 or lower support levels. Conclusion Bitcoin remains in a critical breakout phase, with $85,312 acting as the make-or-break level. A sustained push higher could send BTC toward $88K-$91K, while a failure to hold momentum may trigger a retracement to $82,640 or lower.

This downturn mirrors the broader economic volatility as investors react to shifting macroeconomic trends and regulatory developments. Despite this short-term decline, the medium-term outlook for the crypto sector remains optimistic. At the start of 2024, the total market cap was just $1.7 trillion, meaning that even after recent corrections, the market has surged by 64% over the past 15 months. This long-term growth trajectory has led investors to seek out bargain opportunities, hoping to acquire undervalued assets before the next major market upswing. Among the promising opportunities available at a low price, three standout options are BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) , Ripple (XRP), and Dogecoin (DOGE). Each of these assets presents a unique value proposition with the potential to deliver substantial returns as the market recovers. BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) is the only presale asset on this list, making it a unique opportunity for investors looking to secure tokens at a fixed price before it enters mainstream exchanges. Priced at $0.002405 per token, BTCBULL has already raised an impressive $3.5 million since the start of its presale, signaling strong investor confidence in its potential. BTC Bull Token: Bitcoin’s Best Crypto Presale The project is closely tied to Bitcoin’s price movements, positioning itself as a direct beneficiary of BTC’s growth. One of its most innovative features is its Bitcoin airdrop mechanism. BTCBULL holders will receive free real Bitcoin airdrops at predetermined price milestones, ensuring added value as Bitcoin’s price appreciates. A major airdrop will take place when BTC hits $250,000, resulting in BTC Bull Token allocating 10% of its entire 21 billion token supply to early presale investors. Additionally, the token burn milestones built into BTCBULL’s framework reduce supply over time, increasing scarcity and, potentially, value. BTC Bull Token’s staking rewards further enhance its attractiveness. With an APY (annual percentage yield) of 121% and 871 million tokens already staked, the project offers significant passive income opportunities for long-term holders. As BTCBULL approaches its exchange listing, anticipation is building for potential price appreciation, mirroring past successes of Bitcoin-linked assets. Visit BTC Bull Token Ripple (XRP) Ripple (XRP) is one of the most widely adopted digital assets in the financial sector, designed by Ripple Labs to facilitate cross-border payments for banks and financial institutions. Despite being the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap at $129 billion, XRP remains one of the most affordable high-cap tokens, currently trading at just $2.23 per coin. For several years, XRP’s growth was hindered by an ongoing lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which created uncertainty and prevented major price breakouts. However, regulatory sentiment has begun shifting, with the SEC retracting several lawsuits against crypto firms since Donald Trump’s return to office. Following Trump’s election victory in November 2024, XRP surged from $0.50 to a peak of $3.30 by January 2025 – an astonishing 560% rally in just a few months. Although the price has since corrected, XRP’s inclusion in Trump’s Crypto Strategic Reserve plan signals potential for further institutional adoption. With its renewed regulatory optimism and previous breakout performance, XRP remains a top bargain buy for investors looking for a major altcoin with strong growth potential. Dogecoin (DOGE) Originally created as a joke in 2013, Dogecoin (DOGE) has since evolved into the largest and most influential meme coin in the market. Despite its lighthearted origins, DOGE has cultivated a dedicated community and gained the backing of high-profile figures like Elon Musk, making it a formidable force in the crypto space. Currently priced at $0.1679, Dogecoin offers an accessible entry point for investors looking to capitalize on its high volatility and history of dramatic price surges. Over the past 30 days, DOGE has seen a sharp 35.7% decline, mirroring broader market trends. However, its history suggests that it could stage a strong comeback in the next bull run. Dogecoin has already experienced a staggering 193,000% increase since its inception and remains 77% below its all-time high of $0.73. Analysts from Crypto News Flash have projected that DOGE could surge to $5 in the future, though its meme-based nature makes it inherently volatile. As a result, Dogecoin may be best suited for investors willing to tolerate high risk in pursuit of outsized rewards.",Press Release,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|DOGE|MARKET|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-15 09:05:57

After briefly stabilizing above $91,000, renewed selling pressure dragged BTC to fresh yearly lows. By mid-Tuesday, the price had plummeted to $87,081, with daily liquidations surpassing $870 million, according to Coinglass data. The broader crypto market also suffered, with total market capitalization dropping 8.9% to $3.01 trillion over the same period. Despite the downturn, Bitcoin whales seized the opportunity to accumulate more BTC. Analysts from IntoTheBlock revealed that large holders acquired approximately $2.35 billion worth of Bitcoin within hours of the drop. “Whales are buying. 26,430 BTC just flowed into whale accumulation addresses, often linked to OTC deals and long-term custody,” the analysts tweeted. Bitcoin’s latest dip coincides with multiple factors contributing to selling pressure. Crypto analyst Nic highlighted that ETF outflows have been significant, with cumulative withdrawals reaching $649 million so far this week. He suggested a slowdown in institutional “cash and carry” trades may also add to the pressure. Macroeconomic uncertainties are further weighing on the market. Nic pointed to postponed tariffs against Mexico and Canada as a possible trigger for recent sell-offs. Additionally, Bitcoin’s break below its 100-day moving average, an important historical support level, raises concerns. Based on on-chain data, he suggested that BTC could find support for around $71,600, aligning with the lower standard deviation of the short-term holder (STH) cost basis. Former Bitmex CEO Arthur Hayes also shared his outlook, attributing the drop to ETF sales, hinting at further downsides for Bitcoin. “Bitcoin goblin town incoming: Lots of $IBIT holders are hedge funds that went long ETF short CME futures to earn a yield greater than where they fund, short-term US treasuries,” Hayes tweeted . “If that basis drops as $BTC falls, these funds will sell $IBIT and buy back CME futures. These funds are in profit, and given basis is close to UST yields, they will unwind during US hours and realize their profit. $70,000 I see you” . However, other analysts remain cautiously optimistic. On Monday, Darkfost from CryptoQuant noted that the 30-day retail demand indicator has returned to the neutral zone at 0%, a shift that preceded price rebounds. “This marks a significant shift from the previous highly negative value of approximately -21%, a level not seen since 2021. Notably, past instances of recovering retail demand have often coincided with upward price movements in the short-term (several weeks or months).” He wrote. Elsewhere, analyst Rekt Capital stressed the importance of Bitcoin reclaiming the $96,700 level by the end of February. According to him, a monthly close above this level would confirm a breakout from the bullish flag formation, potentially setting the stage for a renewed uptrend. At press time, BTC was trading at $83,940 reflecting a 1.44% upsurge in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|LUNA,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-15 09:08:27

According to a White House fact sheet, the president’s action eliminates non-statutory functions and reduces others that are considered “unnecessary” for these entities. Trump’s order seeks to downsize “unnecessary” U.S. government entities Mass firings across multiple federal agencies have defined the first months of President Trump’s second term as the administration attempts to strip the executive branch of many powerful assets unilaterally. Elon Musk’s “D.O.G.E,” along with agencies like the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), are choking off services to the public by incapacitating the agencies that are legally bound to deliver them. Trump’s administration is still preparing to further reduce agency capacity through reductions in force, or RIFs. This time, they will target employees who do not work during a government shutdown. Furthermore, on February 11, President Trump issued Executive Order 14210, directing agencies to use “efficiency improvements and attrition” to shrink the federal workforce. According to the order, agency heads were told to “promptly undertake preparations to initiate large-scale reductions in force (RIFs).” On Friday, Trump ordered cuts to eight federal agencies, including the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which oversees Voice of America and other news outlets. The move also impacts the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, the Woodrow Wilson Center, the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the Interagency Council on Homelessness, the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, the Minority Business Development Agency, and the Arctic Research Commission, potentially affecting many workers. According to the White House fact sheet, cutting these governmental entities will save taxpayers dollars, reduce unnecessary government spending, and streamline government priorities. The White House even shared an X post quoting Elon Musk’s words: “It’s not optional for us to reduce the federal expenses. IT’S ESSENTIAL.” However, opponents are turning to courts to impose restrictions on their cost-cutting plans. U.S. judges order the Trump administration to reinstate thousands of fired workers Following the rising concerns of the firing of federal workers, federal judges in California and Maryland on Thursday ordered the U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration to reinstate thousands of probationary federal workers who lost their jobs as part of mass firings carried out at 19 agencies. The court’s decision was the biggest setback for Trump and his top adviser, Elon Musk, in their attempt to significantly reduce the size of the federal bureaucracy. James Bredar, U.S. District Judge in Baltimore, concurred and opened a new tab with 20 Democratic-led states, finding that 18 of the agencies that had mass-fired probationary employees in recent weeks had broken rules about federal employee layoffs. Bredar’s restraining order covered agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the U.S. Agency for International Development. The Trump administration has targeted these three organizations for cost-cutting and deregulatory measures. Other agencies covered by the judge’s order include the U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Labor, Transportation, Treasury, and Veterans Affairs. Moreover, the judge said the administration’s argument that it dismissed each employee for performance or other individualized reasons was untrue. Therefore, the job cuts would be considered a mass layoff, requiring the states, which are obligated to support their newly unemployed citizens, to give advance notice. Bredar wrote, “The sheer number of employees that were terminated in a matter of days belies any argument that these terminations were due to the employees’ individual unsatisfactory performance or conduct.” During a hearing in San Francisco, the U.S. District Judge William Alsup had also ordered the reinstatement of probationary employees terminated at six agencies, including the U.S. Department of Defense.

Solaxy aims to introduce a Layer-2 (L2) scaling solution for Solana, designed to address the blockchain’s ongoing congestion and network issues. Despite launching in a period of broader market downturn – where the overall crypto space is down 3.23% in the last 24 hours and Solana meme coins have dropped by 8.4% – Solaxy’s presale has continued to surge.

This model is expected to improve processing speeds while reducing congestion significantly. Beyond its scalability upgrades, Solaxy plans to introduce a highly flexible framework tailored for developers, allowing them to build optimized decentralized applications (dApps). Additionally, Solaxy is working toward cross-chain interoperability, which would enable seamless asset transfers between Solana and Ethereum. This integration aims to combine Solana’s speed and affordability with Ethereum’s liquidity and established ecosystem, potentially increasing SOLX adoption and overall market value. Why Are Analysts Keeping an Eye on Solaxy? Solaxy’s record-breaking presale has drawn the attention of leading crypto analysts and influencers. One of them is ClayBro, a popular YouTuber with over 136,000 subscribers, who has described Solaxy as one of the most promising presales of the year. Over $26,000,000 So Far! Crypto Is Rebounding And Solaxy Token Could Lead The Way! In a recent video, ClayBro highlighted that while crypto markets have been struggling in the short term, meme coin and crypto search volume are reaching all-time highs. As Solana’s trading volume and investor activity grow, its network congestion is expected to increase, creating demand for a Layer 2 scaling solution like Solaxy. Given its strong presale performance, ClayBro suggests that Solaxy has significant long-term growth potential. ClayBro also cautioned that, like any new crypto investment, there are inherent risks. He emphasized that investors should always do their own research and invest only what they can afford to lose. Earn Rewards With Solaxy’s Staking Program Beyond its Layer-2 developments, Solaxy offers an attractive staking model that allows token holders to earn a passive income. With an annual percentage yield (APY) of 156%, the staking rewards are among the highest in the industry. From a total supply of 138.046 billion tokens, more than 7.3 billion SOLX tokens have already been staked. This reflects strong investor confidence in the project’s long-term vision and potential. Get Involved in the Solaxy Presale Solaxy’s promised Layer-2 solution, along with its surging presale success, has positioned it as one of the most anticipated crypto projects of 2025. While the project is still in its presale phase, its continued success and investor demand could set the stage for significant growth post-launch. Investors looking to participate in the presale can purchase SOLX tokens directly from the official Solaxy presale website . The platform supports multiple payment options, including ETH, USDT, BNB, and Credit Card options. SOLX tokens are also available for purchase through the Best Wallet app , which is available for download on both Google Play and the Apple App Store.

A Santiment report highlights that on March 12, the on-chain activity of Tether (USDT) reached a six-month high, with over 143,000 wallets transferring USDT in a single day. Notably, since January 1, the aggregate stablecoin supply has also increased by $20.17 billion (+10.9%), now surpassing $205 billion, according to Glassnode data. Stablecoins—digital assets pegged to traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar—serve as a reliable store of value for investors during periods of high market volatility. As their scope expands with increasing use cases in cross-border payments, and as they gain institutional and financial acceptance, CoinGape speaks exclusively with Mark Boiron, CEO of Polygon Labs in this #PoweTalk.Sta With Polygon PoS emerging as the third-largest blockchain for on-chain stablecoin transactions, Boiron discusses the growing role of stablecoins, evolving regulatory landscape, and future prospects. He also explores whether stablecoins could replace traditional payment rails and whether they can coexist with Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) in the future. Polygon Labs CEO Marc Boiron begins, “Stablecoins are making it faster and cheaper to move money across borders—whether you’re an individual or a business. And as yield-bearing stablecoins gain traction, especially in 2025, they’ll likely become a bigger draw for traditional financial players, opening up even more opportunities in the space. This shift is massive, and it’s just getting started.” First appearing on the Web3 landscape in 2014, stablecoins are combining the technological benefits of Blockchain such as transparency, efficiency and programmability, with the financial stability needed for quick adoption in the real-world. This include Fiat-pegged stablecoins such as USD-pegged Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC); commodity-pegged such as PAX Gold (PAXG), Tether Gold (XAUT), and Crypto-backed Stablecoins such as Dai (DAI). Stablecoins moving beyond Applications of Trading and Speculation Evolving from their mere applications of speculation and trading with BitUSD (on BitShares) and NuBits among the first stablecoins, Stablecoins are emerging as a reliable asset for cross-border payments, peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions. They are enabling cheap and fast cross-border money transfers, bypassing traditional banking fees and delays. They are also acting as the on-ramp to DeFi by facilitating lending, borrowing yield farming for many DeFi protocols. For instance, Aave & Compound offer stablecoin-based loans, enabling users to lend stablecoins to earn interest or use them as collateral for crypto loans. Stablecoins have moved far beyond just crypto trading—they’re now playing a big role in things like cross-border payments, remittances, and corporate treasuries. Over the next few years, I see stablecoins becoming a key part of the global financial system. We’re already seeing a market cap of over $200 billion, but that’s just the beginning. To put it in perspective, the U.S. M2 money supply is over $21 trillion, so we’re still under 1% penetration. Hitting $3 trillion by 2030 is totally within reach, and that would only be about 15% of the current M2 supply,” explains CEO Marc. In another new instance of stabelcoins usecases, Binance, the leading global Crypto exchange, recently secured a $2 billion investment from tech investor MGX, marking it the largest crypto-related deal conducted using stablecoins. Highlighting the growing utility of stablecoins in VC Fundings and Investments as well, Binance deal was followed by another stablecoin supported funding of $82M received by Mesh , as reported by CoinGape. Source: https://x.com/glassnode/status/1900146408407114107 Will Stablecoins Replace Traditional Payment Rails No doubt, stablecoins offer faster, cheaper and borderless transactions, in comparison to their traditional counterparts of banking payment rail such as SWIFT and Visa. While traditional cross-border transactions via SWIFT can take 1–5 business days to settle due to multiple intermediaries, stablecoins since they operate on blockchains networks, can settle such transactions in seconds to minutes, regardless of geography. Further, transactions by them cost fractions of a cent in comparision to traditional payment rails, implying significant cost savings for the users. But on the queston of whether stablecoins would end up replacing traditional payment systems, CEO Marc says, “Traditional payment systems are due for an upgrade, and stablecoins are stepping in to offer a much-needed solution. While they won’t replace existing systems overnight, they already provide clear benefits like faster global transactions, lower costs, and greater accessibility, making them an increasingly appealing choice.” Further, with the growing adoption and development of stablecoins, traditional payment systems can also taking cues from it – in order to stay relevant in the rapidly growing scenario of borderless payments. Visa and PayPal are already integrating USDC & PYUSD for payments while JPMorgan’s Onyx blockchain is using tokenized dollars for real-time settlements. Prominent Players Entering as Stablecoin Issuers Amid the growing acceptance of stablecoins among regulators around the world, some of the World’s largest banks and Fintech are also rushing to launch their own stablecoins. Notable entrants include Bank of America with the bank signalling last month that it is exploring the issuance of its own stablecoin to enhance cross-border payment efficiency and reduce transaction costs. CEO Marc points out, “Even companies that aren’t traditionally in crypto are jumping on board. Launching a stablecoin isn’t just about making money—it’s also a way to attract new users and create stronger communities. For consumers, this means cheaper, faster, and more efficient payment options, especially for things like remittances, where traditional systems often hit you with high fees. Take Tether’s massive $2.5 billion profit last year as an example—it’s no surprise so many companies are eager to get involved. Plus, the regulatory landscape is shifting in favor of crypto, with Europe’s MiCA regulation offering more clarity and the U.S. likely to follow suit. This combination of profit potential and clearer rules is pushing stablecoins into the spotlight, and consumers are poised to benefit from the improvements to payment systems.” In 2023, PayPal introduced PayPal USD (PYUSD), a USD-pegged stablecoin integrated into its existing payment platform while Stripe recently acquired Bridge, a stablecoin orchestration platform, for $1.1 billion, to enhance cross-border payment processing capabilities. Revolut, the fintech company is also venturing into the stablecoin sector. Notably, in December 2024, Ripple, XRP’s largest issuer. also launched its stablecoin, RLUSD, pegged to the U.S. Dollar, after receiving an approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). Challenges and the Evolving Regulatory Environment Governments and financial regulators worldwide are still debating how to classify and regulate stablecoins (as securities, commodities, or digital payments). Jurisdictions like the U.S. and the EU have different approaches, making global compliance difficult. However, in a recent move that augurs well for the regulatory scenario of stablecoins, the US Senate is set to vote on the “GENIUS Act,” a bill co-sponsored by Senators Bill Hagerty and Kirsten Gillibrand, which seeks to grant federal legitimacy to stablecoins and promote their mainstream adoption. When it comes to stablecoin regulations, Europe is definitely leading the way with MiCA. The U.S. is likely to follow suit with an approach that achieves the same goal, and Asia will probably have its own regulations tailored to the region. Looking ahead five years, I think we’ll have a well-regulated global stablecoin ecosystem with clear rules and standards. This will open the door for stablecoins to be used in everyday retail transactions, just like cash or credit cards. On the Competition with CBDCs Some governments are pushing for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), but I think private stablecoins and CBDCs will end up coexisting rather than one dominating the other. They serve different but complementary roles, each with its own strengths. Notably, the European Central Bank (ECB) is actively working on a Digital Euro, expected to enter its preparation phase by 2025. However, China is leading the CBDC race with the Digital Yuan (e-CNY), developed by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC). It has been piloted in major cities like Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen and the Winter Olympics of 2022 in Beijing was the first large-scale international use case of the Digital Yuan. Stablecoins to become Everyday Tool by 2030, says Marc Stablecoins offer efficiency, stability, and accessibility in digital finance, but they also face significant challenges across regulatory, economic, and technological fronts. For instance, as with all digital assets, stablecoins can present money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risks. If I had to make a bold prediction about stablecoins in 2030, I’d say they will be the go-to form of digital payment worldwide, with a market cap that could easily surpass $5 trillion. We’ll see them integrated into nearly every major financial app and service, making transactions smoother and more efficient for everyone. The technology is already there, capable of supporting widespread use. The main hurdles are regulatory and educational. Once those are addressed, they could become a common, everyday payment method, making things faster, cheaper, and more efficient for consumers. By 2030, the line between traditional finance and crypto will be pretty much gone, with stablecoins playing a key role in bringing everyday users into the Web3 space. Central banks will have embraced private stablecoins as part of their broader monetary policies, recognizing the benefits they bring to the table. The real game-changer, though, is how they will make financial services available to billions of people who are currently underserved by traditional banks. They’ll be the tool that helps democratize access to the global economy, making it easier for people around the world to take part in the digital financial world. For users, this means faster, cheaper, and more inclusive financial services that open up opportunities for growth and financial freedom.

Though he refrained from making direct accusations, his comments have started a new speculation about the events that shook the crypto market. Did FTX Play a Role in the LUNA Collapse? CZ responded to a post by an FTX creditor, @Mbottjer, who revealed that 3AC had recently outbusted proofs indicating that FTX had liquidated $1.53 billion worth of its assets just two weeks before 3AC collapsed. The claim, which has been approved by a judge, adds another layer to the complex web of crypto failures that rocked the industry. https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1900445304371241161 CZ called this an “interesting turn of events” and admitted it was news to him. He then questioned whether there was a link between FTX and the collapse of Terraform Labs’ LUNA token and UST stablecoin in May 2022. That crash sent shockwaves through the market, dragging down Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Was it Planned? In response to CZ’s remarks, Crypto analyst MartyParty stated that he had already revealed on-chain evidence showing Celsius and FTX withdrawing massive amounts of UST from the liquidity pool at the exact moment the market was vulnerable. According to him, both firms executed $200 million UST withdrawals, triggering the stablecoin’s depeg and ultimately causing the LUNA meltdown. His statement adds weight to theories that powerful players in the crypto space may have intentionally orchestrated the collapse. If true, it would mean the 2022 market crash wasn’t just a result of bad risk management but a coordinated attack. CZ’s Book Will Address These Controversies—But With Caution A user on X suggested that the entire FTX scoop deserved a documentary series, to which CZ responded that he had thought about this connection while writing his book. However, he made it clear that he found no concrete evidence, saying, “I didn’t want to speculate; there were rumors, but I never saw hard evidence.” CZ has already completed a 114,000-word draft of his book and has printed a physical copy. However, he believes it will take three times the effort to refine it before it’s ready for publication. Given the controversies surrounding FTX, 3AC, and Binance itself, the book could provide an insider’s perspective on the crypto industry’s most chaotic years. What’s Next for CZ’s Book? With the crypto world still recovering from the aftermath of the 2022 crashes, CZ’s book is expected to shed light on key industry events from his point of view. Whether it will contain major revelations or remain a personal reflection, the anticipation is growing. For now, CZ remains careful with his words, ensuring that his account sticks to facts rather than speculation.",News,EN,0,0,LUNA|MARKET|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-15 09:13:51

In a new strategy session, the analyst pseudonymously known as DonAlt tells 66,000 subscribers of the TechnicalRoundup YouTube channel that he believes XRP has more upside potential and could outperform other crypto assets including Ethereum ( ETH ). “I’m a big XRP believer in the sense that I think the XRP price is going to go up, just generally. I think it’s the best. And I’ve been saying this since [it was priced at] $0.60. I think it’s the best coin to capture altcoin strength this entire market cycle.” XRP is trading at $2.30 at time of writing, up by around 342% from the November 1st, 2024 price of around $0.52. The pseudonymous analyst, however, says that while XRP possesses more upside potential than Ethereum, the latter would be a better crypto asset to hold during a downturn. “If the market goes down, you’re going to be more happy having ETH than XRP. But if the market goes up, you’re going to massively outperform with XRP.” Ethereum is trading at $1,900 at time of writing, down by around 31% from the November 1st, 2024 price of about $2,500. Next up is Bitcoin ( BTC ). According to the pseudonymous analyst, Bitcoin’s recovery after falling to around $76,600 earlier this week is “good” but further downside corrections could indicate a bearish tilt. “We bounced quite a bit before support [at slightly below $72,000], which I find good. I really don’t want to see us trade below $80,000 for too long. I generally think if we retest $70,000, that’s a massive sign of weakness. And it’s going to be much harder to come back from that.” Bitcoin is trading at $84,319 at time of writing.

The initial crypto FUD in the past few weeks was largely overshadowed by positive sentiment from the United States in the last two days. Furthermore, Bitcoin price led the wider altcoin industry in mirroring gold bullish outlook as major stock indexes recorded mild rebounds. Factors Influencing Cardano and XRP Rally Today Clear Regulatory Outlook from the U.S. SEC As Coinpedia reported, the U.S. SEC acknowledged the role of XRP and Cardano in the country’s digital economy. Whereby the agency noted that XRP will play a crucial role in state-level financial transactions, optimizing government payments, and enabling interbank liquidity. On the other hand, the agency noted in the proposal that Cardano is best suited for academic credentialing, smart contracts for government services, and secure infrastructure management. Rising Adoption from Institutional Investors Following the notable interest of Cardano by the United States, institutional investors have made strategic moves to adopt ADA before the anticipated altseason. On Friday, Coinbase Global announced that it has filed with the U.S. CFTC to offer Cardano futures, with the product expected to go live on March 31, 2025.

41691685,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=140257,1742030264,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crucial Revelation: Ripple CTO Confirms RLUSD Can Be Frozen for Regulatory Compliance,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/rlusd-stablecoin-crypto-regulation/,"The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with discussions around regulation and compliance, and a recent revelation from Ripple’s CTO, David Schwartz, has added fuel to the fire. It appears Ripple’s upcoming dollar-pegged stablecoin, RLUSD, is designed with a crucial feature: it can be frozen or seized if legal and regulatory obligations demand it. This news, initially reported by BeInCrypto, has sparked conversations about the balance between decentralization and regulatory adherence in the burgeoning stablecoin market. Let’s delve into what this means for RLUSD and the broader landscape of stablecoin regulation . What is RLUSD and Why a Ripple Stablecoin? Before diving into the regulatory aspects, it’s important to understand what RLUSD is and why Ripple, a major player in the crypto space, is venturing into the stablecoin arena. RLUSD is Ripple’s newly announced dollar-pegged stablecoin, intended to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the world of digital assets. But why is Ripple, known for its XRP cryptocurrency and enterprise solutions, launching a Ripple stablecoin ? Expanding Ripple’s Ecosystem: A stablecoin allows Ripple to broaden its offerings beyond XRP and cater to a wider range of financial applications, including payments, DeFi, and trading. Facilitating Enterprise Adoption: A compliant and reliable stablecoin like RLUSD can encourage greater adoption of blockchain technology by institutions and businesses seeking stable digital currencies for transactions and settlements. Capitalizing on Stablecoin Demand: The stablecoin market has witnessed explosive growth, indicating a strong demand for digital assets that offer price stability. RLUSD positions Ripple to tap into this lucrative market. Essentially, RLUSD is a strategic move by Ripple to solidify its position in the crypto industry by providing a regulated and enterprise-grade RLUSD stablecoin solution. The Revelation: RLUSD Can Be Frozen for Regulatory Compliance Now, let’s address the core of the news: David Schwartz’s confirmation that RLUSD can be frozen or seized. This isn’t a bug; it’s a feature, designed to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory frameworks. According to Schwartz, this functionality is not only permissible but necessary for issuers to operate within the bounds of the law. What does this mean in practical terms? Legal and Regulatory Obligations: Issuers of stablecoins, like traditional financial institutions, are subject to various laws and regulations. This includes obligations to comply with court orders, sanctions, and other legal mandates. Off-Ledger Actions: Schwartz clarified that actions taken outside the blockchain, such as court orders, can necessitate modifications to the on-chain obligations related to RLUSD. This could involve freezing or seizing funds to comply with legal directives. Reserve Maintenance: To maintain the 1:1 peg with the US dollar, RLUSD issuers are obligated to hold reserves equal to the total supply of the stablecoin. This reserve backing is crucial for maintaining stability and investor confidence. In essence, the ability to freeze or seize RLUSD is presented as a necessary mechanism for Ripple to operate within the existing legal and crypto regulation landscape. This feature is not unique to RLUSD; many centralized stablecoins incorporate similar controls to ensure compliance. Understanding Stablecoin Regulation and Digital Asset Compliance The discussion around RLUSD’s features highlights the broader context of stablecoin regulation and digital asset compliance . Regulators worldwide are increasingly focusing on stablecoins due to their potential systemic importance and their growing integration with the traditional financial system. Here’s why compliance is becoming a central theme: Aspect Importance for Stablecoin Regulation Financial Stability Regulators are concerned with maintaining financial stability and preventing risks associated with stablecoin runs or failures. Reserve requirements and regulatory oversight are key. Consumer Protection Protecting consumers from fraud, manipulation, and loss is paramount. Regulations aim to ensure transparency, accountability, and adequate safeguards for stablecoin holders. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) Stablecoins, like any financial instrument, can be used for illicit activities. AML and CTF regulations require issuers to implement measures to prevent and detect illegal use. Systemic Risk Mitigation As stablecoins become more interconnected with the financial system, regulators are focused on mitigating systemic risks that could arise from their widespread adoption. Therefore, features like the ability to freeze or seize assets are often seen as necessary tools for stablecoin issuers to meet these regulatory expectations and ensure digital asset compliance . Implications and Considerations: Centralization vs. Decentralization While regulatory compliance is crucial, the ability to freeze or seize RLUSD also brings to the forefront the ongoing debate about centralization versus decentralization in the crypto space. For proponents of decentralization, this feature might raise concerns. Points to Consider: Centralized Control: The ability to freeze or seize funds inherently implies a degree of centralized control over RLUSD. This contrasts with the ethos of some cryptocurrencies that prioritize decentralization and censorship resistance. Transparency and Due Process: It becomes crucial to understand the processes and conditions under which RLUSD can be frozen or seized. Transparency around these procedures and ensuring due process are essential to maintain user trust. User Concerns: Users holding RLUSD might have concerns about the potential for their funds to be frozen, even if for legitimate regulatory reasons. Balancing security and compliance with user autonomy is a key challenge. Broader Crypto Ecosystem: The approach taken with RLUSD could set a precedent for other stablecoins and digital assets, influencing the future trajectory of crypto regulation and the balance between centralized and decentralized systems. Ultimately, the design of RLUSD reflects the pragmatic reality of operating within existing legal frameworks. While it might not align perfectly with the ideals of complete decentralization, it underscores the increasing need for compliance as the crypto industry matures and seeks broader mainstream adoption. The key will be finding the right balance that fosters innovation while ensuring the safety and stability of the financial system. Conclusion: Navigating the Regulatory Maze David Schwartz’s confirmation that RLUSD can be frozen or seized is not necessarily a surprising revelation in the context of evolving stablecoin regulation . It highlights the ongoing efforts to bring digital assets within established legal and regulatory frameworks. For Ripple, this feature is likely a strategic imperative to ensure RLUSD can operate compliantly and gain acceptance from both regulators and institutional users. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, the interplay between decentralization, regulation, and compliance will remain a central theme, shaping the future of digital currencies and their role in the global financial system.

Carney Closes Gap on Polymarket with BTC-Friendly Poilievre,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/03/15/new-canadian-p-m-carney-closes-gap-on-polymarket-with-btc-friendly-poilievre,"Newly elected Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who recently won a leadership contest of the Liberal Party to replace Justin Trudeau , has dramatically increased his odds of winning the next federal election in the eyes of Polymarket bettors. Carney now has a 49% chance of winning the next Canadian election, compared to 26% a month ago. Conservative opposition leader Pierre Poilievre's chances are at 51%, down from 72% in February. The next Canadian federal election is scheduled to occur on October 20, 2025. However, under Canada's Westminster system, if the opposition Conservatives and NDP jointly vote against the minority Liberal government on a confidence motion after Parliament resumes from prorogation on March 24, requested by Trudeau on Jan. 6 , as he announced his resignation plans pending a new Liberal leader, the government would fall, triggering an election. Carney closing the gap against Poilievre on Polymarket – despite a lag between prediction markets and the polls – echoes what the polls are showing. The Conservatives are just one percentage point ahead of the Liberals, according to Canadian pollster Nanos Research , down from nearly a 16-point lead a month ago according to a polling average. Observers credit this dramatic shift to trade threats from the U.S., with pollsters indicating Canadians prefer Carney's business sense and central bank experience over his opponent. This is all a bit of a contrast to last year's U.S. election, where prediction markets consistently showed that then-Republican candidate Donald Trump had a lead over his Democratic opponents. The election result, as CoinDesk wrote in an editorial at the time , was only a surprise to those who get their information from CNN. Crypto on the Canadian campaign trail? Crypto doesn't seem to be a major plank of a hypothetical Canadian election. While Poilievre holds a Canadian-issued BTC ETF , according to disclosures, and has previously made pro-blockchain and crypto comments , most of the campaign rhetoric appears to be about the trade war. Likewise, Carney, who has made mixed if not skeptical comments on crypto in his role as Bank of England governor hasn't yet spoken about the topic in his new role as Liberal leader.",Markets,EN,0,0,MARKET|FIAT|BTC|BUSINESS|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-15 09:18:11

The recent movements in the US Dollar Strength and the Euro Dollar Exchange Rate are prime examples. As crypto traders navigate volatility, understanding macroeconomic factors driving fiat currencies like the dollar and euro becomes increasingly crucial. Today, the dollar is exhibiting resilience, inching upwards as traders brace for the release of the closely watched Michigan consumer sentiment data. Meanwhile, the euro is experiencing a slip, creating ripples across the forex landscape. What does this mean for the broader financial ecosystem, and how can it inform your crypto strategies? Decoding the Dollar’s Ascent: What’s Fueling US Dollar Strength? The US Dollar Strength is often seen as a barometer of global economic confidence. When the dollar strengthens, it typically reflects investor sentiment leaning towards the perceived safety and stability of the US economy. Several factors are currently contributing to the dollar’s upward trajectory: Anticipation of Economic Data: The market is keenly awaiting the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index. Positive data is expected to reinforce the narrative of a robust US economy, further bolstering the dollar. Safe-Haven Demand: In times of global economic uncertainty or geopolitical tensions, the US dollar often benefits from safe-haven flows. While not currently in a crisis mode, underlying economic anxieties can still drive investors towards the dollar. Interest Rate Differentials: The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy and interest rate stance play a significant role in dollar strength. Expectations regarding future rate hikes or the maintenance of current high rates can make the dollar more attractive to yield-seeking investors. But is this surge sustainable? Let’s consider some potential headwinds: Data Dependency: The dollar’s current strength is heavily reliant on positive economic data. A disappointing Michigan sentiment reading could quickly reverse its gains. Global Economic Slowdown: While the US economy shows resilience, concerns about a global economic slowdown persist. A significant downturn could eventually weigh on the dollar as well. Overvaluation Risks: Continued dollar appreciation could lead to concerns about overvaluation, potentially triggering a correction down the line. Euro Under Pressure: Analyzing the Euro Dollar Exchange Rate Dip Conversely, the euro is currently facing headwinds, leading to a slip in the Euro Dollar Exchange Rate . Several factors are contributing to the euro’s weakness: Economic Growth Concerns: The Eurozone economy faces more pronounced growth challenges compared to the US. High energy prices, inflation, and the ongoing impact of geopolitical events are weighing on the region’s economic outlook. ECB Monetary Policy: While the European Central Bank (ECB) has also been raising interest rates to combat inflation, the pace and magnitude of these hikes, and the overall economic outlook for the Eurozone, may be perceived as less supportive for the euro compared to the dollar. Risk Sentiment: Periods of heightened risk aversion can sometimes disproportionately impact the euro, as investors may favor the dollar as a safer alternative. However, it’s crucial to remember that currency markets are dynamic. The euro also has potential catalysts for recovery: Improved Economic Data: Positive surprises in Eurozone economic data could shift sentiment and provide support for the euro. ECB Hawkishness: If the ECB signals a more aggressive stance on inflation and further rate hikes, it could boost the euro. Resolution of Geopolitical Risks: Any easing of geopolitical tensions affecting the Eurozone could improve investor confidence and support the euro. Michigan Consumer Sentiment Data: The Key Catalyst All eyes are now on the upcoming release of the Michigan Michigan Consumer Sentiment data. This report is a crucial gauge of consumer confidence in the US, reflecting how optimistic or pessimistic households are about the economy. Why is this data so important for the forex market? Economic Health Indicator: Consumer sentiment is a leading indicator of economic activity. Strong sentiment typically translates to increased spending, driving economic growth. Fed Policy Implications: The Federal Reserve closely monitors consumer sentiment as it influences spending and inflation. Strong data could reinforce the Fed’s hawkish stance, supporting further dollar strength. Market Volatility Trigger: Unexpectedly strong or weak sentiment data can trigger significant volatility in the forex market, particularly in the Euro Dollar Exchange Rate . Scenario Analysis: Michigan Sentiment Data Outcomes Scenario Michigan Sentiment Data Potential Dollar Impact Potential Euro/Dollar Impact Positive Surprise Data exceeds expectations Further Dollar Strengthening Euro likely to weaken against Dollar In Line with Expectations Data meets forecasts Dollar strength may be maintained, but less pronounced Euro/Dollar may see limited movement Negative Surprise Data falls short of expectations Potential Dollar Weakening Euro could potentially strengthen against Dollar Navigating Forex Market Trends: Actionable Insights for Crypto Traders Understanding Forex Market Trends , especially the dynamics between the dollar and euro, can provide valuable context for crypto traders. Here’s how you can leverage this information: Risk Assessment: Dollar strength often correlates with risk-off sentiment in broader markets. Monitoring dollar movements can help gauge overall market risk appetite, influencing your crypto trading decisions. Stablecoin Strategies: Stablecoins pegged to the US dollar can be affected by dollar fluctuations. A strengthening dollar might increase the relative purchasing power of dollar-pegged stablecoins against other assets, including cryptocurrencies. Macroeconomic Awareness: Being aware of macroeconomic factors driving forex markets enhances your overall understanding of global financial flows, which can indirectly impact crypto markets. Diversification Considerations: Forex market analysis can inform diversification strategies. Understanding currency trends might lead you to consider diversifying into assets that are less correlated with the dollar or euro. Looking Ahead: Currency Market Outlook and Potential Shifts The Currency Market Outlook remains dynamic and subject to various evolving factors. While the dollar currently holds a stronger position, several potential shifts could alter the landscape: Global Growth Trajectory: The relative growth performance of the US versus the Eurozone and other major economies will be a key driver of currency valuations. Central Bank Policies: Future monetary policy decisions by the Federal Reserve, ECB, and other central banks will significantly impact currency movements. Geopolitical Developments: Unforeseen geopolitical events can trigger sudden shifts in currency valuations as investors react to changing risk perceptions. Inflation Dynamics: The trajectory of inflation and how central banks respond will continue to be a major factor influencing currency markets. In conclusion, the dollar’s current edge reflects a confluence of factors, primarily driven by anticipation of positive US economic data and ongoing concerns about the Eurozone economy. The Michigan consumer sentiment data release is a pivotal event that could either solidify the dollar’s gains or trigger a reversal. For crypto traders, keeping an eye on these forex market dynamics provides valuable insights into broader market sentiment and macroeconomic trends, aiding in more informed decision-making in the volatile world of digital assets.

According to Mandell, if the Bitcoin price were to be between $80,000 and $84,000 at the exact close of the day yesterday London time (UTC0), this would mean that the rally would continue and possibly reach $100,000 by the end of this month. If the BTC price were to close above $84,000, it would also signal a drop and mean that the recent recovery rally would fail. However, according to the analyst, if the Bitcoin price were to close at exactly $84,000, this would indicate “historical movements.” Last night, in an event that was met with great surprise by the cryptocurrency community, at exactly 00:00 London time, the BTC price closed at $83,980, according to Coinbase data. Mandell said that since it is not exactly $84,000, this means the current modest rally will continue. Chart showing BTC price above $84,000 at closing time.

41692219,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=140254,1742031016,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Visionary Move: SoftBank’s $676M Investment Fuels Japan’s AI Revolution with OpenAI,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/softbank-openai-japan-ai-data-center/,"In a groundbreaking move that underscores the escalating global race in artificial intelligence, SoftBank has announced a massive $676 million investment to acquire a former Sharp LCD plant in Osaka, Japan. This strategic acquisition is not just about real estate; it’s a bold declaration of SoftBank’s commitment to spearheading Japan’s AI Data Center infrastructure and deepening its collaboration with AI powerhouse OpenAI. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors keenly observing technological shifts, this development signifies the growing importance of robust computational power – the very backbone that supports blockchain networks and the burgeoning field of decentralized AI. Let’s dive into why this deal is a game-changer and what it means for the future of AI and Japan’s tech landscape. Why is SoftBank Investing Heavily in an AI Data Center in Japan? SoftBank’s hefty investment into converting a Sharp plant into a cutting-edge AI Data Center is driven by several key factors: Strategic Autonomy in AI: SoftBank aims to establish a strong, independent AI operation in its home market. This move reduces reliance on external AI infrastructure and strengthens Japan’s position in the global AI arena. Fueling Generative AI Growth: The explosion of generative AI models like those from OpenAI demands massive computational resources. Data centers are the engine rooms that power the training and deployment of these advanced models. SoftBank recognizes this critical need and is proactively building capacity. OpenAI Collaboration: The data center is explicitly linked to SoftBank’s partnership with OpenAI. This facility will likely serve as a crucial hub for deploying and potentially developing OpenAI’s advanced AI models specifically for the Japanese market through their joint venture, SB OpenAI Japan. Market Opportunity: Japan, like many nations, is eager to harness the transformative power of AI across various sectors. SoftBank is positioning itself to capitalize on this growing demand by providing the necessary infrastructure and services. Essentially, SoftBank is not just buying a plant; it’s investing in the future of AI and Japan’s technological competitiveness on a global scale. This is reminiscent of the early days of the internet boom, where infrastructure investments laid the foundation for today’s digital giants. For the crypto world, this highlights the parallel need for scalable and decentralized infrastructure to support the next wave of blockchain innovation. OpenAI and SoftBank: A Powerful Partnership for Japan AI Advancement The collaboration between OpenAI and SoftBank is central to this data center initiative. Here’s a breakdown of what this partnership entails: Joint Venture – SB OpenAI Japan: This JV is specifically designed to bring OpenAI ’s foundational AI models to the Japanese market. It’s not just about importing technology; it’s about tailoring and innovating for local needs. Customized AI Agents: SB OpenAI Japan plans to train AI models using client data from various sectors like marketing. This allows for the creation of highly customized AI agents, offering businesses in Japan bespoke AI solutions. Data Sovereignty and Localization: By building a data center in Japan, SoftBank and OpenAI address growing concerns around data sovereignty and localization. Japanese businesses will have the option to process and store data within the country, which is crucial for regulatory compliance and data privacy. Expanding Global Footprint: For OpenAI , this partnership with SoftBank is a strategic move to expand its global presence and tap into the lucrative Japanese market. It mirrors OpenAI ‘s broader strategy of collaborating with key players to build AI infrastructure worldwide. This partnership signifies a powerful synergy. OpenAI brings its cutting-edge AI models, and SoftBank provides the local market expertise, infrastructure, and investment muscle. This combination is poised to accelerate the adoption of advanced AI across Japan, impacting everything from enterprise solutions to consumer applications. Breaking Down the $676 Million Deal: What is SoftBank Acquiring? The $676 million price tag is for more than just bricks and mortar. Here’s what SoftBank is getting for its investment: The Sharp Sakai Plant: This is a substantial facility, previously used for LCD panel production. It includes both the land and the existing buildings, offering ample space for a large-scale data center. Existing Infrastructure: A key advantage of repurposing an existing plant is the pre-existing infrastructure, particularly power capacity. SoftBank anticipates the plant will initially support 150 megawatts, scaling up to 240 megawatts – crucial for powering energy-intensive AI workloads. Speed to Market: Acquiring an existing facility significantly shortens the timeline for establishing a data center. SoftBank aims to commence operations in 2026, a relatively quick turnaround for such a massive project. Strategic Location: Osaka is a major economic hub in Japan. Locating the data center there provides proximity to businesses and talent, enhancing its accessibility and impact. By acquiring an existing plant, SoftBank is not only saving time and potentially costs compared to building from scratch, but also leveraging existing infrastructure to expedite its Japan AI ambitions. This pragmatic approach is characteristic of SoftBank’s strategic investments. The Broader Implications for Japan AI and the Tech Landscape SoftBank’s Generative AI data center investment is more than just a company-specific initiative; it has broader implications for Japan and the global tech landscape: Boosting Japan’s AI Ecosystem: This investment is a significant boost to Japan’s ambition to become a leader in AI. It creates jobs, attracts talent, and fosters innovation within the country. Economic Growth: The development and operation of a large data center will stimulate economic activity in Osaka and surrounding regions. It will attract related businesses and investments in the AI sector. Competition and Innovation: SoftBank’s move is likely to spur further investment in AI infrastructure by other players in Japan and Asia, fostering healthy competition and driving innovation in the data center and AI industries. Global AI Race: This investment is part of the larger global race to dominate the AI landscape. Nations are vying for AI leadership, and investments like SoftBank’s are crucial for staying competitive. For the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, these developments are highly relevant. AI and blockchain are increasingly converging, with AI enhancing blockchain analytics, security, and scalability, while blockchain can provide transparency and trust to AI systems. Robust AI Data Center infrastructure like SoftBank’s is foundational for this convergence to flourish. What’s Next for SoftBank and its Generative AI Vision? SoftBank’s acquisition of the Sharp plant is just the beginning. Here’s what we can expect in the near future: Data Center Construction and Build-out: The immediate next steps involve retrofitting and equipping the Sharp plant to become a state-of-the-art AI Data Center . This will involve significant engineering and technological deployments. SB OpenAI Japan Operations: As the data center comes online, SB OpenAI Japan will likely ramp up its operations, focusing on training customized AI models and deploying AI solutions for Japanese enterprises. Further Investments: SoftBank’s commitment to AI is likely to extend beyond this data center. We can anticipate further investments in AI startups, research, and talent development in Japan and globally. Monitoring the $25 Billion OpenAI Investment: The rumored $25 billion investment in OpenAI is still pending official confirmation. Its closure would further solidify the partnership and provide OpenAI with substantial capital for its continued growth and innovation. SoftBank’s visionary investment in this AI Data Center is a clear signal that it is placing a massive bet on the future of AI, particularly Generative AI , and its transformative impact on industries and societies worldwide. This is a development that tech enthusiasts, investors, and particularly those in the cryptocurrency space should watch closely, as AI and blockchain technologies continue to intertwine and shape the future.

Multiple releases today include a new .pi Domains Auction that facilitates an important… pic.twitter.com/Xfyaw1CFvl — Pi Network (@PiCoreTeam) March 15, 2025 According to the network’s blog page, users will be required to use Pi coins in buying domain names in the auction, set to run from March 14 to June 28, 2025, and periods could be extended if new bids are placed within the final 24 hours before closure. How the .pi domain auction works The .pi Domain Auction is open to all members of the Pi community, including individuals who acquire Pi through centralized exchanges. Users can participate by visiting the Pi Browser, where they can bid on domain names with a minimum bid of 10 Pi. The highest bidder will secure domain names to use exclusively. Registration and maintenance fees will be similar to traditional domain services like the ones provided on Web2. The Pi team also talked about the auction’s reversible bid system feature, where participants are allowed to withdraw their Pi until the auction closes. Still, individuals that have bought Pi on exchanges will have to follow a different process. Rather than using claimable balances, they will receive a custom Pi blockchain address for each domain they bid on, where they can send their Pi as payment. Refunds for these standard payments will only be processed after the auction ends. Once an exchange-based bidder wins a domain, they will need to establish a standard Pi blockchain account to receive it. First Open network PiFest commences Pi Network has also launched a shopping event that involves users and merchants on the network, dubbed PiFest, which will run from March 14 to March 21, 2025 worldwide. PiCoreTeam claims the merchant registration period began two days before the event, and over 100,000 businesses have already signed up, with 49,000 active sellers listed on the Map of Pi, a platform where users can find the participating businesses. The Web3 project has updated its ecosystem Interface, removing the pre-approval requirement for developers. Previously, developers had to meet specific eligibility criteria before applying to list their apps in the Pi Browser ecosystem. With this update, any developer meeting Mainnet requirements can now apply immediately, eliminating delays in the application process. Pi Coin continues downtrend after mainnet migration mishap Pi Coin’s price has fallen from an intraday high of $1.72 to levels below $1.5, against the backdrop of network issues that saw users struggle to migrate their tokens on deadline day. The token has shed over 22% of its value since Thursday. According to CoinGecko, the token reached its all time high value of $2.99 six days after it started trading, but is now about 51% down from the February 26 highs. It has also seen a 35.3% downtick in a fortnight, and a 19% drop intraweek. As of this publication, Pi Coin is consolidating between $1.44 and $1.46, as market watchers wait for more fluctuations over the weekend. The crypto has managed to stay above the $1.40 psychological support level, but is trading way below its 10-day and 20-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) at 1.59 and 1.66, and will need to climb past those levels for a positive price correction.

Tom Lee’s Bold Prediction,https://coinpedia.org/news/can-bitcoin-outperform-gold-in-2025-tom-lees-bold-prediction/,"The post Can Bitcoin Outperform Gold in 2025? Tom Lee’s Bold Prediction appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin is one of the cryptos that have benefited hugely from the shift in political attitude towards the cryptocurrency industry. Just weeks after the victory of Donald Trump against Kamala Harris in the U.S. presidential election, the Bitcoin market achieved the impressive milestone of $100K. Like the majority of the top ten cryptos, the upward momentum in the BTC market has started to slow down since the beginning of 2025. The YTD change of BTC stands at -10.2%. In the last seven days alone, the Bitcoin price has declined by over 2.71%. However, Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee predicted that Bitcoin would become the best-performing asset class of the year. He even asserted that BTC would outperform gold in 2025. Unbelievable, isn’t it? Let’s dive deep! Bitcoin Will Outperform Gold in 2025 In the previous year, the gold price reported a rise of 27.44%. Meanwhile, during the same period, the Bitcoin price registered a surge of at least +121.1%. Though BTC strongly outperformed XAU in 2024, the crypto, popularly known as digital gold, struggled to maintain its growth pace in the first quarter of 2025. The YTD change of gold is nearly 13.7%, but the YTD of Bitcoin is -10.2%. Bitcoin’s poor performance in the first quarter has raised questions about its potential to challenge the dominance of Gold in the market as the most trusted store of value. However, Lee predicted that the Bitcoin market would outperform the gold market this year. Bitcoin’s Performance in 2025 So Far At the start of 2025, the price of BTC was at $93,536.41. In January, the BTC market experienced a moderate growth of 9.54%. However, in February, the market saw a significant drop of -17.55%. The MTD of BTC stands at -0.48%. At the beginning of this month, the price of Bitcoin was at $84,381.04. In the first two days of the month, the market witnessed a rise of 11.68%. At one point on March 2, the market reached as high as $95,048.73. This month, the market has recorded two major corrections: an 8.5% drop on March 3 and a 13.25% decline between March 6 and 10. The market has not yet fully recovered from these corrections. Currently, the BTC price remains at $83,873 – at least 13.32% below the peak of the month. Lee’s Bold Prediction for 2025 According to Lee, the price of Bitcoin would reach as high as $150,000 in the year 2025. It appears that this analyst is extremely optimistic about the future prospects of the BTC market. An analysis of the previous Bitcoin price predictions of Lee indicates that he has a mixed record in BTC predictions. However, Lee is a very respected figure in the financial sector.

41692556,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=140165,1742031643,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Turbulence in Asian Forex: Trade War Escalation Dips Markets, Yuan Shows Resilience",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/asian-fx-trade-war-yuan/,"Navigating the cryptocurrency world requires a keen eye on global financial currents. Recent developments in traditional markets, particularly in Forex, can offer valuable insights and even foreshadow movements in the crypto sphere. The escalating trade tensions spearheaded by former US President Trump are sending ripples across Asian currency markets, creating a climate of uncertainty. Let’s dive into how this Trade War is impacting Asian FX and what’s keeping the Yuan afloat. Why are Asian Currencies Feeling the Heat from the Trade War? The resurgence of trade war rhetoric has injected a fresh dose of anxiety into global markets. When trade disputes escalate, they directly impact economies reliant on international trade, and Asia is at the heart of global supply chains. Here’s a breakdown of why Asian FX is particularly vulnerable: Export Dependence: Many Asian economies, such as South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore, are heavily reliant on exports. A trade war, characterized by tariffs and trade barriers, directly threatens their export competitiveness, weakening their currencies. Supply Chain Disruptions: Trade wars disrupt established supply chains, leading to uncertainty for businesses. This uncertainty can deter investment and negatively impact economic growth prospects, further pressuring Asian FX . Risk-Off Sentiment: Escalating trade tensions typically trigger a “risk-off” sentiment in global markets. Investors tend to flock to safe-haven assets like the US dollar and Japanese yen, pulling capital away from perceived riskier assets, including emerging market currencies in Asia. Currency Devaluation as a Weapon: In a trade war, countries might be tempted to devalue their currencies to make their exports cheaper and more competitive. This can lead to a ‘race to the bottom’ and further volatility in the Forex Market . Yuan Resilience: Is China’s Stimulus a Game Changer? Amidst the broader downturn in Asian FX , the Chinese Yuan has shown a degree of resilience. This relative strength can be attributed, in part, to proactive measures taken by the Chinese government to stimulate its economy. But how effective is this stimulus, and can it truly shield the Yuan from the storm? China’s policymakers have been deploying a range of stimulus measures to bolster economic activity. These include: Monetary Policy Easing: The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has been cautiously easing monetary policy, including measures like reducing reserve requirement ratios for banks. This injects liquidity into the financial system, encouraging lending and investment. Fiscal Stimulus: Increased government spending on infrastructure projects and targeted tax cuts for businesses are designed to boost domestic demand and offset the negative impacts of external trade pressures. Support for Key Sectors: Specific sectors facing headwinds, such as technology and manufacturing, may receive targeted support to maintain growth and employment. However, the effectiveness of China Stimulus in fully offsetting the negative impact of a protracted trade war remains a subject of debate. While stimulus measures can provide a buffer and support domestic demand, they may not be sufficient to completely insulate the Yuan from external pressures if trade tensions continue to escalate. Decoding the Dips: Which Asian Currencies are Most Affected? While the overall trend in Asian FX is downward pressure, the degree of impact varies across different currencies. Some currencies are proving more vulnerable than others. Let’s examine a few key examples: Currency Factors Contributing to Weakness Outlook South Korean Won (KRW) High reliance on exports (especially electronics), sensitivity to global trade cycles, geopolitical risks related to North Korea. Likely to remain under pressure if trade tensions persist. Vulnerable to fluctuations in global demand for electronics. Taiwan Dollar (TWD) Strong technology export sector exposed to global trade disruptions, close trade links with China. Similar to KRW, susceptible to trade war impacts and global tech sector performance. Singapore Dollar (SGD) Open economy highly dependent on trade, regional financial hub sensitive to global economic sentiment. May experience volatility due to its open economy nature, but generally considered more resilient due to Singapore’s strong fundamentals. Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) & Indian Rupee (INR) Emerging market currencies sensitive to risk-off sentiment, potential capital outflows, and commodity price fluctuations (for IDR). Face challenges from both trade war uncertainties and broader emerging market risks. Central bank intervention may be necessary to manage volatility. Forex Market Volatility: What Does This Mean for Crypto? The turbulence in the Forex Market , driven by trade war escalations and currency fluctuations, can indirectly impact the cryptocurrency market. Here’s how: Risk Sentiment Spillover: The risk-off sentiment prevailing in traditional financial markets can spill over into the crypto market. When investors become risk-averse, they may reduce exposure to both traditional risky assets and cryptocurrencies. Dollar Strength and Crypto: A strengthening US dollar, often a consequence of risk-off flows during trade wars, can sometimes exert downward pressure on cryptocurrency prices, particularly Bitcoin, which is often priced against the dollar. Alternative Asset Appeal: Conversely, in times of economic uncertainty and currency volatility, some investors may view cryptocurrencies as alternative assets or hedges against traditional market risks. This could potentially lead to increased interest in crypto, though this is not always a guaranteed outcome. Geopolitical Uncertainty and Decentralization: Trade wars and geopolitical tensions highlight the interconnectedness and potential vulnerabilities of the traditional financial system. This can, in turn, strengthen the appeal of decentralized and borderless cryptocurrencies for some investors seeking alternatives. Actionable Insights: Navigating Forex and Crypto in Uncertain Times For those involved in cryptocurrency trading and investment, understanding the dynamics of the Forex Market and the impact of events like trade wars is crucial. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of developments in global trade relations, macroeconomic indicators, and central bank policies, especially in Asia. These factors can significantly influence both Forex and crypto markets. Diversification: Diversify your investment portfolio across different asset classes, including both traditional and cryptocurrencies, to mitigate risk during periods of market volatility. Risk Management: Implement robust risk management strategies. Use stop-loss orders and manage your position sizes carefully, especially when markets are experiencing heightened volatility. Monitor Currency Movements: Pay close attention to the movements of key Asian FX currencies and the Yuan . Significant fluctuations can provide clues about market sentiment and potential ripple effects in the crypto space. Consider Stablecoins: In times of extreme volatility, consider temporarily moving some of your crypto holdings into stablecoins to preserve capital and reduce exposure to market swings. Conclusion: Riding the Waves of Global Financial Shifts The current climate of escalating trade tensions and its impact on Asian FX underscores the interconnectedness of global financial markets. While the immediate focus might be on currency fluctuations, these events have broader implications that extend to the cryptocurrency world. By staying informed, understanding the underlying dynamics, and implementing sound risk management practices, investors can navigate these turbulent times and potentially identify opportunities amidst the uncertainty. The resilience of the Yuan , despite the headwinds, highlights the complex interplay of global economics and policy responses in shaping market outcomes. As the trade war saga unfolds, continued vigilance and adaptability will be key for participants in both the Forex Market and the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies.

ETH’s most recent performance has been even more painful, as the asset dumped to its lowest level since November 2023 at under $1,800. The question raised now by analysts is whether ETH will continue losing ground and dump to $1,250. ETH at $1,250? Remember 2021? Back then, ETH was charting massive gains and its price soared toward $5,000. In fact, speculations emerged about a potential event called the ‘flippening,’ in which Ethereum could surpass Bitcoin and become the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Fast-forward some three and a half years later and that seems as distant from reality as fiat money becoming disinflationary. ETH bottomed below $1,000 during the 2022 bear market but went on the offensive again two years later. It failed to decisively overcome the $4,000 target despite its numerous attempts to conquer it in 2024. The latest rejection came in mid-December. Since then, ETH’s price has nosedived hard, which culminated (for now) earlier this week with a drop below $1,800. As such, Ethereum not only erased all the gains registered after Trump’s presidential election victory but even plunged to its lowest levels since November 2023. According to Ali Martinez, a crypto analyst with over 130,000 followers on X, the asset’s price drop meant that it had broken out of a years-long parallel channel, which could spell further trouble. In fact, he forecasted a slump to $1,250 – a level not seen in over two years. #Ethereum $ETH targets $1,250 after breaking out from this parallel channel! pic.twitter.com/XS3N9p8Unr — Ali (@ali_charts) March 14, 2025 But ETH Whales Keep Buying CryptoPotato has repeatedly reported in recent weeks Ethereum whales’ predominantly bullish behavior. Recall that within a 48-hour period alone, they accumulated 1.1 million ETH, which is nearly 1% of the total supply. At the prices back then, it was worth over $2 billion in USD . Martinez brought another chart showing that these large entities acquired more than 420,000 ETH in the following five days, valued at $800 million at today’s prices. Such massive accumulations should benefit the underlying asset as they decrease the immediate selling pressure. However, ETH’s price is yet to stage a notable recovery as it still sits below $2,000.

Speaking at a conference on Monday, SEC Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda reaffirmed his commitment to reshaping the agency, delivering a sharp critique of Gary Gensler’s handling of the crypto sector and broader financial markets. “What occurred under the Biden Administration was a stark aberration from longstanding norms regarding the Commission’s legal authority, policy priorities, and enforcement approach,” Uyeda stated , echoing concerns long held by the crypto community about regulatory overreach. A key takeaway from Uyeda’s speech was the rescission of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121, which had restricted banks and broker-dealers from handling crypto assets. In addition, Uyeda unveiled a broader initiative aimed at revitalizing U.S. capital markets, the “Make IPOs Great Again” plan, designed to streamline the IPO process and encourage more companies to go public. Notably, central to this initiative was the rollback of restrictive policies that have hindered businesses, particularly crypto firms, from raising capital efficiently. “In the past the number of IPOs has drastically declined.” He added. “As entrepreneurs grow businesses past the startup stage, they will likely require capital from institutional investors, such as venture capital funds. Without attractive opportunities for the company to sell itself or become publicly traded, what incentive does a venture fund have to make an investment? …there are things that the Commission can do to help make IPOs attractive again.” Uyeda also emphasized that Commissioner Hester Peirce would lead a newly established crypto task force to develop a comprehensive and practical regulatory framework for digital assets , “providing realistic paths to registration and crafting sensible disclosure standards.” Following these developments, the XRP community has grown increasingly optimistic, viewing the SEC’s pivot as a potential opening for Ripple to reconsider its long-delayed IPO. With SEC Chair Gary Gensler stepping down and a shift in regulatory policy, speculation around Ripple’s potential IPO has intensified, with some anticipating a launch as early as 2025 or 2026. Notable figures in the XRP community, including attorney John Deaton , have weighed in on potential valuations, linking Ripple’s stock price to its XRP holdings. Recently, popular XRP analyst Nietzbux suggested that Ripple could trade at three times the value of its XRP holdings, drawing parallels to MicroStrategy’s valuation model. According to this approach, if XRP reaches $8.72, Ripple’s valuation could surpass $1 trillion, a scenario market veteran Peter Brandt has previously considered possible. Moreover, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has previously expressed interest in taking the company public. However, Ripple’s long-standing legal battle with the SEC, which began in 2020, has been a significant obstacle , prompting Ripple to shelve those ambitions once clearer regulations were in place. That said, while IPO discussions remain speculative, the SEC’s evolving stance could be a turning point for Ripple and the broader crypto industry, potentially paving the way for more crypto companies to pursue public offerings.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|MARKET|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-15 09:49:24

According to a recent Reuters report, sources familiar with the matter have revealed that Russia is increasingly turning to digital assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether to facilitate oil transactions, particularly with economic giants China and India. Is this a game-changer in international finance, or a desperate measure in the face of mounting pressure? Let’s dive deep into this fascinating development and explore the implications for the global economy and the future of cryptocurrency. Russia Crypto Sanctions: A Calculated Move? The backdrop to this intriguing development is the stringent sanctions imposed by Western nations in response to geopolitical events. These sanctions have significantly hampered Russia’s ability to conduct international trade using traditional financial systems. Faced with these obstacles, Russia appears to have adopted a proactive approach, exploring alternative financial avenues. The use of cryptocurrency emerges as a potentially viable solution, offering a decentralized and, to some extent, less regulated pathway for international payments. Last year, Russia made a significant move by passing legislation that officially permits cross-border payments using cryptocurrencies. This legal framework laid the groundwork for the current scenario, enabling Russian entities to explore and implement crypto-based solutions for their international trade activities. But why is crypto proving to be such an attractive alternative? The Allure of Crypto Oil Trade: Benefits and Mechanisms Cryptocurrencies offer several advantages that make them appealing for nations seeking to circumvent traditional financial sanctions: Decentralization: Cryptocurrencies operate outside the purview of traditional banking systems, making them harder for sanctioning bodies to control or block transactions directly. Reduced Intermediation: Crypto transactions can occur directly between parties, reducing reliance on intermediaries like banks that are subject to international regulations and sanctions. Speed and Efficiency: Cross-border crypto transactions can be faster and potentially cheaper than traditional international wire transfers, especially for large sums. Anonymity (Pseudonymity): While not entirely anonymous, cryptocurrency transactions can offer a degree of pseudonymity, making it harder to trace the origin and destination of funds compared to traditional banking systems. Reuters’ report highlights that Russian oil firms are specifically using cryptocurrencies to convert Chinese yuan and Indian rupees – currencies received from oil sales – into Russian rubles. This conversion process is crucial as it allows Russia to repatriate revenue from oil exports despite limitations on access to international financial infrastructure. The cryptocurrencies mentioned – Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Tether (USDT) – are all well-established and liquid digital assets, facilitating relatively easy conversion and transfer. Sanctions Evasion: Is Crypto the Ultimate Loophole? The use of cryptocurrency to facilitate oil trade raises significant questions about the effectiveness of international sanctions. While sanctions aim to restrict a nation’s access to global financial systems and resources, the emergence of crypto as an alternative payment mechanism presents a potential challenge. Is sanctions evasion becoming easier in the age of digital currencies? It’s important to note that while crypto offers a route to bypass traditional financial channels, it is not without its challenges and limitations: Challenge Description Volatility Cryptocurrency prices are notoriously volatile. This volatility can introduce risks and complexities in large-scale trade transactions, requiring sophisticated risk management strategies. Scalability and Liquidity While Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether are liquid, the overall crypto market’s capacity to handle extremely large volumes of oil trade transactions on a sustained basis is still being tested. Regulatory Scrutiny Governments and regulatory bodies worldwide are increasingly focused on regulating cryptocurrencies. Increased scrutiny and potential future regulations could impact the long-term viability of crypto-based sanctions evasion strategies. Transparency Concerns While offering pseudonymity, blockchain transactions are not entirely untraceable. Sophisticated blockchain analysis tools are becoming more advanced, potentially allowing authorities to monitor and analyze crypto transactions. Cross-Border Payments Reimagined: The Future of International Trade? Russia’s move to utilize crypto for oil trade underscores a broader trend: the increasing role of digital currencies in cross-border payments . As traditional financial systems grapple with geopolitical tensions and evolving technological landscapes, cryptocurrencies are emerging as a potentially transformative force in international trade and finance. This development prompts us to consider: Will other sanctioned nations follow suit? If Russia’s crypto strategy proves effective, other countries facing sanctions may be incentivized to explore similar approaches. How will regulators respond? Western governments and international regulatory bodies are likely to intensify their efforts to monitor and regulate crypto transactions to prevent sanctions evasion and illicit activities. What are the long-term implications for the global financial system? The increasing use of crypto in international trade could potentially lead to a more fragmented global financial landscape, with traditional and decentralized systems coexisting and competing. Cryptocurrency: A Double-Edged Sword? The situation highlights the double-edged nature of cryptocurrency technology. While it offers innovative solutions and opportunities for financial inclusion and efficiency, it also presents challenges in terms of regulation, illicit finance, and, as seen in this case, potential sanctions evasion. The global community faces the complex task of harnessing the benefits of crypto while mitigating its risks and unintended consequences. The unfolding situation with Russia’s crypto-based oil trade is a significant development to watch. It serves as a real-world example of how digital currencies are being used in the context of international geopolitics and sanctions. It raises critical questions about the future of sanctions effectiveness, the evolution of international trade, and the ongoing debate about the role and regulation of cryptocurrencies in the global economy.

The recovery follows a challenging February, driven by renewed investor confidence and improved market sentiment. XRP’s resurgence aligns with broader market stability, as institutional and positive legal speculation fuel optimism. However, this cryptocurrency is currently above its 100-hour Simple Moving Average (SMA), reflecting a short-term upward trend, yet it remains below the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), highlighting ongoing long-term resistance. XRP Price Action We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 February 2025 Recap Last month, XRP experienced a 30% decline after reaching a seven-year high in January. Several factors contributed to this downturn, including: Widespread market corrections affecting major cryptocurrencies, Regulatory uncertainty, particularly concerning Ripple’s ongoing legal dispute with the SEC, and Profit-taking by investors following XRP’s strong rally earlier in the year. Despite the sharp drop, XRP found support near $2.00, setting the stage for its March recovery. March 2025 Performance March has seen XRP regain momentum, with a 13.7% recovery, driven by: Renewed investor confidence as market conditions stabilize, Positive sentiment surrounding Ripple’s SEC case, with speculation about a favorable resolution, Increasing institutional interest, as financial institutions explore XRP’s potential for cross-border transactions, and Altcoin market strength is supported by Bitcoin’s strong performance.

You Won’t Believe What Analysts Are Saying,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/is-mutuum-finance-mutm-the-next-big-thing-in-crypto/,"The post Is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) the Next Big Thing In Crypto? You Won’t Believe What Analysts Are Saying appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has ignited a frenzy in the crypto market as its presale races toward Phase 4, amassing $3.4 million from over 5,700 investors. Currently priced at $0.02 in Phase 3, the token’s value is set to leap 25% to $0.025 once the next stage begins—a shift analysts describe as a precursor to explosive growth. With an exchange listing planned at $0.06, early buyers could secure instant 200% returns upon launch. But forecasts stretch further: projections hint at a climb beyond $3.50 by late 2025, positioning Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a potential titan in decentralized finance (DeFi). Presale Momentum Builds Rapidly Investors are scrambling to acquire Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens before Phase 3 sells out, driven by its structured presale model and real-world utility. Unlike speculative assets, the project anchors itself in decentralized lending, allowing users to borrow, lend, and earn through mtTokens—a system converting deposits like ETH or DAI into interest-bearing assets. This practicality has translated into staggering demand, with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Phase 3 allocations dwindling faster than previous stages. Those entering now stand to gain not only from the imminent price jump to $0.025 but also from the anticipated listing surge. Should Mutuum Finance (MUTM) hit its post-launch target of $3.50, a $500 investment today could balloon to $87,500—a 17,400% windfall. Innovative Mechanics Drive Sustained Demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) distinguishes itself through a self-reinforcing ecosystem. A buy-and-distribute mechanism funnels platform revenue into repurchasing tokens, which are then allocated to mtToken stakers. This creates perpetual buy pressure, countering volatility while rewarding long-term holders. In order to further stabilise the network and provide liquidity, borrowers lock up collateral that exceeds loan values. Peer-to-peer financing for assets such as Dogecoin (DOGE) or Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been introduced, expanding its appeal and reaching niche sectors that are neglected by conventional platforms. Market Analysts Spotlight Unmatched Potential While meme coins and speculative tokens dominate headlines, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly reshaping DeFi’s foundations. Its overcollateralized model and dynamic interest rates offer lenders competitive yields, drawing risk-averse participants seeking stability. Security audits by reputable firms and a $100,000 giveaway for presale contributors further bolster credibility. Analysts emphasize that MUTM’s presale structure—where each phase incrementally hikes the price—creates urgency among investors. With Phase 4 approaching, the window for securing tokens at $0.02 is narrowing rapidly. Additionally, Mutuum Finance’s smart contracts are undergoing a CertiK audit to guarantee optimal security. Following completion, the results will be posted on various social media channels, emphasising the team’s proactive efforts to create a reliable and robust environment for its expanding user and investment base. A Groundfloor Opportunity in DeFi’s Evolution Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t merely chasing trends; it’s engineering them. The platform’s roadmap includes launching a decentralized stablecoin backed by user collateral, enhancing transparency in a sector often criticized for opacity. Early adopters today aren’t just buying tokens—they’re securing stakes in a system designed to thrive beyond hype cycles. As adoption accelerates and exchange listings loom, the math becomes irresistible: a 25% gain between phases, a 200% surge at launch, and potential quadruple-digit growth thereafter. The crypto market rarely offers second chances, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is no exception. With Phase 3 filling rapidly and analysts forecasting historic returns, hesitation could mean missing the decade’s most promising DeFi entry. Visit Mutuum Finance’s official site to participate in the presale before the next price hike—and position yourself at the forefront of a financial revolution.

What The Charts Are Saying",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-to-70000-or-300000/,"Bitcoin’s price trajectory has become a significant point of interest in light of the recent downtrend, which has disappointed many bullish traders. According to on-chain analytics platform IntoTheBlock, the recent price crash up to the current price has seen over 6.5 million BTC addresses falling into losses. Still, technical analysis suggests Bitcoin could experience further drops. The question is whether Bitcoin will test the $70,000 mark before regaining strength or can rebound from here toward a $300,000 price target. Insights from price structure and historical patterns help provide a clearer picture of what’s next. Bitcoin Price Decline: A Normal Cycle Within Uptrends Despite concerns over Bitcoin’s recent price swings, crypto analyst Philip (BasicTradingTV) maintains that the market is behaving normally within a long-term bullish structure. He highlights that on the higher monthly timeframe, Bitcoin continues to create higher highs and higher lows and maintains a solid uptrend that dates back to 2017. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Suffers Bearish Deviation After Filling CME Gap, Is This Good Or Bad? This technical outlook, which was noted on the TradingView platform, comes as a response to concerns about whether BTC is still bullish after the ongoing 25% correction from its recent all-time high. Traders have been unsettled following the recent drop, but historical trends suggest this kind of movement is part of the market’s natural cycle. According to the analyst, Bitcoin is still forming a bullish market structure, and while short-term fluctuations may continue, the broader uptrend channel from 2017 is still in place. Furthermore, the analyst noted previous instances of 25% and 40% corrections during Bitcoin’s rallies from the lower trendline of this uptrend channel. What’s Next For BTC? Possible Retest Of Resistance Before Rally To $300,000 With the notion of a long-term uptrend still intact, the analyst noted, however, that Bitcoin could continue its downtrend until it reaches $70,000. This level holds significant importance, as it previously marked Bitcoin’s all-time high before turning into resistance around mid-2024. After multiple attempts, Bitcoin eventually broke through this resistance toward the end of the year, leading to its new all-time high of $108,786 in January 2025. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Action Says Bottom Is In, Analyst Reveals What’s Coming As such, this $70,000 level is now a major psychological support zone, making it a key area to watch amidst the ongoing Bitcoin price correction. From here, the analyst predicted a rebound that would send BTC to reach as high as $300,000. “Levels to watch: 70.000, $300.000,” the analyst said. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $82,555, having spent the majority of the past 24 hours trading between $79,947 and $83,436. This leaves Bitcoin still about 14% away from testing the $70,000 support level. However, there is also the possibility that BTC may not drop as low as $70,000 before bullish sentiment takes over once again. If Bitcoin continues to follow the trajectory of past cycles, Fibonacci extensions point to price targets between $150,000 and $300,000.

41693388,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=140263,1742032832,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Groundbreaking Bill: Byron Donalds Champions National Bitcoin Reserve for Secure Digital Future,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/byron-donalds-bill-bitcoin-reserve/,"Get ready for a potential seismic shift in U.S. digital asset policy! U.S. Representative Byron Donalds is set to introduce a bill on March 14th that could fundamentally reshape how America handles Bitcoin. This isn’t just another piece of legislation; it’s a bold move to establish a national Bitcoin reserve, potentially locking in a digital asset strategy for years to come. Are you ready to dive into the details of this groundbreaking initiative? Why a National Bitcoin Reserve? Understanding the Vision The core of this bill, as reported by Wu Blockchain on X and cited by Bloomberg, revolves around solidifying a policy initially outlined in a recent executive order by former President Trump. This order directed the U.S. government to treat seized Bitcoin – a substantial amount, estimated around 200,000 BTC – as a reserve asset. Furthermore, it authorized the Treasury and Commerce Departments to strategically acquire even more Bitcoin without burdening taxpayers. But why is Congressman Donalds taking legislative action now? Preventing Policy Whims: Executive orders can be reversed by subsequent administrations. To ensure the national Bitcoin reserve policy isn’t just a fleeting idea, this bill aims to codify it into law. This means future presidents would need to go through Congress to overturn it, providing long-term stability and commitment to the digital asset strategy. Securing Seized Assets: Currently, the U.S. government holds a significant amount of Bitcoin seized from illicit activities. Instead of simply auctioning it off, this bill proposes strategically holding these assets as part of a national reserve, potentially benefiting the nation in the long run as Bitcoin adoption grows. Strategic Digital Asset Stockpile: Beyond seized assets, the bill empowers the Treasury and Commerce Departments to proactively build a digital asset stockpile. This proactive approach signals a forward-thinking strategy, positioning the U.S. to be a major player in the evolving digital economy. Byron Donalds Bill: A Deeper Dive into the Details While the full text of the Byron Donalds bill is yet to be released, we can infer key aspects based on the available information. It appears to be laser-focused on establishing a legal framework for the national Bitcoin reserve and the broader digital asset stockpile. Let’s break down what we know and what we can anticipate: Aspect Details Core Objective To codify the executive order establishing a national Bitcoin reserve and digital asset stockpile into law. Key Proponents U.S. Representative Byron Donalds (leading the bill), potentially supported by other pro-crypto lawmakers. Assets in Focus Primarily Bitcoin (BTC), but the bill also mentions a broader “digital asset stockpile,” suggesting potential inclusion of other cryptocurrencies in the future. Acquisition Methods Holding seized BTC and authorizing Treasury/Commerce Departments to acquire more without increasing taxpayer burden (details of acquisition methods are still to be clarified). Timeline Bill introduction expected on March 14th. Legislative process and potential enactment timeline are yet to unfold. Trump Bitcoin Policy: The Foundation for the Bill It’s crucial to understand the context of the Trump Bitcoin policy that serves as the bedrock for this legislative effort. Earlier this month, the executive order signed by President Trump laid the groundwork. This order wasn’t just about holding Bitcoin; it was a statement about recognizing the strategic importance of digital assets. Here’s what the Trump administration’s directive aimed to achieve: Legitimizing Bitcoin as a Reserve Asset: By directing the government to hold seized Bitcoin as reserves, the order signaled a shift in perception, acknowledging Bitcoin’s potential role in national finance. Proactive Acquisition Strategy: Authorizing the Treasury and Commerce Departments to acquire more Bitcoin indicates a proactive approach to building a digital asset portfolio, rather than just passively managing seized assets. Economic Opportunity: The move can be seen as a way to tap into the growing digital economy and potentially benefit from the appreciation of Bitcoin over time, without directly impacting taxpayers. Benefits of a National Bitcoin Reserve: What’s in it for the U.S.? Establishing a national Bitcoin reserve could bring several potential advantages to the United States. Let’s explore some key benefits: Financial Innovation Leadership: By embracing Bitcoin as a reserve asset, the U.S. could solidify its position as a leader in financial innovation, attracting talent and investment in the digital asset space. Economic Diversification: Holding Bitcoin as part of national reserves could diversify the U.S.’s asset portfolio, potentially mitigating risks associated with traditional assets and currencies. Future-Proofing National Finances: As the world increasingly moves towards digital currencies, having a Bitcoin reserve could position the U.S. for a smoother transition and greater financial resilience in the digital age. Potential Revenue Generation: If Bitcoin’s value continues to appreciate, the national reserve could become a significant source of revenue for the government in the future. Challenges and Considerations: Navigating the Road Ahead While the concept of a national Bitcoin reserve is exciting, there are also challenges and considerations to address: Volatility Concerns: Bitcoin’s price volatility is a well-known factor. Managing a large Bitcoin reserve requires robust risk management strategies to mitigate potential value fluctuations. Regulatory Clarity: Clear regulatory frameworks are essential for managing and utilizing a national Bitcoin reserve effectively. This includes addressing issues related to custody, security, and accounting. Public Perception and Education: Public understanding and acceptance of Bitcoin and digital assets are crucial for the success of this initiative. Education and transparent communication will be key. Security and Custody: Securing a large amount of Bitcoin requires robust cybersecurity measures and secure custody solutions to prevent theft or loss. The Digital Asset Stockpile: Beyond Bitcoin The bill’s mention of a broader “digital asset stockpile” is intriguing. This suggests the U.S. government might be considering expanding its holdings beyond just Bitcoin to include other cryptocurrencies or digital assets. This could be a strategic move to: Diversify Digital Asset Holdings: Including a variety of digital assets could reduce risk and capture opportunities across different segments of the crypto market. Support Innovation Across the Digital Asset Ecosystem: Holding a broader range of digital assets could signal support for innovation and growth across the entire digital asset ecosystem. Strategic Advantage in Emerging Technologies: As blockchain technology and digital assets evolve, a diversified stockpile could provide the U.S. with a strategic advantage in emerging technologies and financial systems. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? This potential legislation has implications for everyone interested in the cryptocurrency space. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on the progress of the Byron Donalds bill. Follow news outlets and cryptocurrency publications for updates. Engage in the Conversation: Share your thoughts and opinions on social media and with your representatives. Public discourse can influence policy decisions. Educate Yourself About Bitcoin: If you’re new to Bitcoin, now is a great time to learn more about its fundamentals, technology, and potential. Consider the Long-Term Implications: Think about how a national Bitcoin reserve could impact the cryptocurrency market, the U.S. economy, and the future of finance. Conclusion: A Bold Step into the Future of Finance U.S. Representative Byron Donalds’ bill to establish a national Bitcoin reserve is a significant development in the cryptocurrency landscape. It represents a bold step towards embracing digital assets at a national level and could have far-reaching implications for the U.S. economy and its role in the global financial system. Whether this bill will become law remains to be seen, but it undoubtedly signals a growing recognition of Bitcoin’s importance and the transformative potential of digital assets. The journey towards a digital future is unfolding, and this bill could be a pivotal moment in that evolution.

Yet contrary to pessimistic outlooks, several underlying narratives suggest this correction may actually signal the early stages of an extended growth phase – and not the conclusion of favorable market conditions. Wall Street Giants Are Reshaping Crypto Market Dynamics The entrance of established financial behemoths into the cryptocurrency ecosystem is creating previously unseen market patterns. Organizations managing trillions of dollars in assets are starting to dampen the typically extreme price swings of digital currencies. Industry observers are noting a maturation process where digital assets increasingly mirror conventional equity behavior. As highlighted by online commentator Alyo , the integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream investment portfolios through ETFs and treasury positions is likely transforming traditional boom-bust sequences into more gradual appreciation phases. “This cycle is different!” Yes, because this time, financial giants are buying through their #Bitcoin ETFs. When Gold ETFs launched, gold rallied for 10 years straight. It was cyclical too, until the ETF changed everything. What makes you think $BTC won’t do the same? pic.twitter.com/ObMiEoEqOP — Crypto Anbu (@CryptoAnbu_) March 12, 2025 These changes will involve less dramatic fluctuations, but potentially more enduring upward movement. Economic Indicators Point to Monetary Policy Shifts The latest consumer price metrics reveal inflationary pressures subsiding more rapidly than economists projected. This development carries substantial implications for cryptocurrency valuations, as it enhances the probability of upcoming monetary easing measures. Great PPI & CPI data this week. Those are signs that inflation isn't picking up momentum and could ease a lot for the FED to potentially do a rate cut. Waiting for M2 Supply to pick up momentum and then #Bitcoin should restart its uptrend. — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) March 13, 2025 Historical patterns demonstrate that central bank rate reductions typically create favorable conditions for digital asset appreciation. For instance, the monetary policy adjustment last September ignited a robust upward momentum that only diminished following conservative Federal Reserve commentary in December, and unchanged rates in January. Current futures trading activity suggests markets anticipate three potential rate adjustments in 2025, creating a potentially supportive environment for renewed cryptocurrency appreciation. Crypto Presale Enthusiasm Reveals Underlying Market Strength Despite widespread price corrections across established digital assets, participation in early-stage crypto presales continues at unprecedented volumes. This phenomenon indicates that individual investors remain both financially capable and optimistic about the Web3 sector’s prospects. For example, consider the presale success of Solaxy ($SOLX) , which has attracted $26 million for its Solana-based Layer 2 scaling solution. Expected to launch later this year, Solaxy is designed to enhance the scalability potential of the Solana blockchain, and eliminate the possibility of failed transactions on the network. Leading analysts predict 50x gains for the SOLX crypto, which will also be compatible with Ethereum, Solana, and Solaxy itself. Equally noteworthy is the $11 million raised by the ICO for Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , which will provide users of the Best Wallet crypto management platform with benefits including lower transaction fees, premium staking rewards, early crypto presale access, and much more. As Best Wallet has over 500,000 users, some of the biggest investors in the market have embraced BEST as a key investment opportunity for 2025 – one that could potentially 100x in value . The enthusiastic response to these fundraising initiatives reveals a resilient optimism among cryptocurrency participants, which contradicts surface-level bearish market sentiment. Trump’s Trade Strategy May Be Designed to Force Rate Cuts The recent US government transition brought market volatility as Donald Trump adopted an aggressive negotiating stance toward key international trading partners, threatening a series of trade wars. While this move has been publicly framed as domestic economic prioritization, market analysts suspect alternative motivations. Financial commentators including Ran Neuner propose these economic pressure tactics may deliberately create short-term market uncertainty, which is designed to influence central banking decisions toward accommodative policies – and potentially foster extended economic expansion. Trump is working to a plan. The endgame is to force the FED’s hand. The plan means cooling the markets and confidence off in the short term. The lack of confidence will slow the economy and this will cool GDP and inflation. Companies will be less bullish and therefore will… — Ran Neuner (@cryptomanran) March 9, 2025 This approach aligns with a potential transition toward more sustained growth cycles, and would ultimately benefit digital asset markets once monetary policy adjustments materialize. Government Crypto Reserves Authorized, When Will Acquisitions Begin? US federal authorities recently established the framework for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve – but have not yet initiated active purchasing to expand their existing holdings. Nonetheless, the creation of the aforementioned reserve still represents an unprecedented legitimization of the crypto industry that has yet to be priced in through market activity. Just a few minutes ago, President Trump signed an Executive Order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The Reserve will be capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings. This means it… — David Sacks (@davidsacks47) March 7, 2025 The financial institution Standard Chartered has also suggested that funding for such acquisitions might come through gold reserve reallocation , rather than public expenditure. The mere possibility of sovereign cryptocurrency acquisition by the world’s largest economy represents a transformative milestone for the digital asset sector, and could trigger renewed market momentum when implementation begins.",Press Release,EN,0,0,MARKET|FIAT|TRADING|BTC|ZRX,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-15 10:01:49

Bitcoin ( BTC ) price fell over 3% during the past week, to trade above $83,748 as of 9:33 a.m. in UTC, Cointelegraph Markets Pro data shows. Bitcoin price continues to risk significant downside volatility due to growing macroeconomic uncertainty around global trade tariffs, according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research. BTC/USD, 1-year chart. Source: Cointelegraph Closing the week above $81,000 will be key to avoid more Bitcoin downside, the analyst told Cointelegraph, adding: “The key level to watch for the weekly close is $81,000 range, holding above that would signal resilience, but if we see a drop below $76,000, it could invite more short-term selling pressure.” The analyst's comments come days ahead of the next FOMC meeting scheduled for March 19. Markets are currently pricing in a 98% chance that the Fed will keep interest rates steady, according to the latest estimates of the CME Group’s FedWatch tool . Source: CME Group’s FedWatch tool The outcome of the meeting may significantly impact Bitcoin investor sentiment, said Lee, adding: “The market largely expects the Fed to hold rates steady, but any unexpected hawkish signals could put pressure on Bitcoin and other risk assets.” “Even a dovish surprise, like a rate cut, might not be the immediate boost some are hoping for, as investors are still weighing macro uncertainties,” added the analyst.

Byron Donalds to introduce bill codifying Trump’s Bitcoin reserve Bitcoin close above $85k may reignite investor optimism for more upside: analyst Other analysts are seeing a silver lining in Bitcoin’s stagnant price action. A weekly close above $85,000 may inspire more investor confidence and lead to the next breakout, according to Enmanuel Cardozo, market analyst at Brickken real-world asset tokenization platform. The market analyst told Cointelegraph: “Traders and investors alike are keeping a close eye on the $80,000 support and the $85,000–$90,000 resistance, with a break above the latter potentially sparking a strong upward movement.” While Bitcoin’s short-term momentum may be limited by the upcoming economic releases, the regulatory developments around Trump’s Bitcoin reserve plan may gradually bring more market optimism and mass adoption, added the analyst. Related: Bitcoin’s next catalyst: End of $36T US debt ceiling suspension Trump’s Bitcoin reserve came one step closer to fruition on March 14, after US Representative Byron Donalds introduced a bill that seeks to ensure the Bitcoin reserve becomes a permanent fixture, preventing future administrations from dismantling it through executive action. If the bill is passed, it would ensure that the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the US Digital Asset Stockpile could not be eliminated via executive actions by a future administration. The bill will require at least 60 votes in the Senate and a House majority to pass. With Republicans holding a Senate majority — and amid a generally more crypto-friendly environment — the bill has a chance of passing.

A well-known crypto millionaire who turned early bets on Dogecoin (DOGE) and Floki Inu (FLOKI) into a 17,000% portfolio gain is now setting his sights on five undervalued altcoins for 2025. With the market still recovering from volatility, these low-cost assets could present massive growth potential for investors seeking high returns. Among them, a new project has already gained traction in early investment circles, showing signs of strong momentum. Priced at just $0.006 and having already raised $17 million, Lightchain AI is emerging as one of the most talked-about opportunities. As 2025 approaches, these five cryptos could follow the path of past meme coin success stories and deliver exponential gains for early adopters. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at each of these undervalued coins and why they could be set to pump in 2025. Why Crypto Millionaire Is Focusing on These Undervalued Coins A crypto millionaire who turned small investments in Dogecoin (DOGE) and Floki Inu (FLOKI) into a 17,000% portfolio gain is now shifting focus to undervalued altcoins. While many investors chase established assets, he believes that hidden gems often yield the highest returns. His latest picks for 2025 include projects with strong fundamentals, growing communities, and the potential to replicate past meme coin rallies. These altcoins are currently flying under the radar but could explode as market sentiment improves. With increasing institutional interest and retail adoption, undervalued cryptos are becoming a prime target for early movers. Among them, one project stands out due to its strong early traction and investor confidence. As the market gears up for the next bull cycle, these selections could deliver exponential gains for those who act early. 5 Undervalued Coins Set to Pump In 2025 Identifying undervalued cryptocurrencies before they explode is key to maximizing returns. As the market evolves, several altcoins are positioning themselves for significant growth in 2025. One such crypto is Lightchain AI (LCAI ), which has gained traction due to its innovative approach and strong presale momentum . Another promising pick is Injective Protocol (INJ), known for its decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. SingularityNET (AGIX) is another contender, riding the wave of AI-powered blockchain adoption. Meanwhile, IOTA (MIOTA) continues to develop real-world applications for the Internet of Things (IoT), making it a strong candidate for future gains. Lastly, Render Token (RNDR) is gaining attention for its decentralized GPU-based rendering network, which supports AI and metaverse applications. These five cryptos have strong use cases and market potential, making them solid picks for investors in 2025. Can Undervalued Coins Really Deliver Exponential Gains? Investing in undervalued cryptocurrencies has historically been one of the most effective ways to achieve exponential returns. Coins like Dogecoin and Floki Inu once traded at fractions of a cent before skyrocketing in value, rewarding early investors with massive gains. The key to identifying such opportunities lies in recognizing strong fundamentals, growing adoption, and innovative use cases before mainstream hype sets in. While market conditions can be unpredictable, history has shown that undervalued assets with solid technology and real-world utility often outperform expectations. As the crypto market evolves, new contenders are emerging, presenting fresh opportunities for investors willing to take calculated risks. https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN|INJ,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-15 10:10:07

This move is generating significant buzz in the crypto community, and here’s everything you need to know to make the most of this opportunity. What is Bitget Pre-Market and Why PAWS? Before we delve into the specifics of PAWS on Bitget pre-market, let’s understand what a pre-market trading platform is and why Bitget is offering this for the PAWS token. A crypto pre-market essentially allows users to trade tokens before they are officially launched and listed on spot exchanges. It’s a fantastic way to gauge early interest, discover price points, and for early adopters to position themselves advantageously. Bitget’s decision to introduce PAWS on its pre-market platform signals strong confidence in the project and a desire to provide its users with early access to promising new tokens. But why PAWS? While the specifics of the PAWS token project aren’t detailed in the initial announcement, the move suggests that PAWS is a project with considerable potential and community backing. Bitget, known for its strategic token listings and user-centric approach, carefully selects projects for its pre-market, indicating PAWS likely possesses compelling features or addresses a significant need within the crypto ecosystem. How to Engage with PAWS on Bitget Pre-Market and Earn Crypto Points? Bitget has made participating in the PAWS pre-market both engaging and rewarding. The platform isn’t just about passively waiting for the token launch ; it’s designed to encourage active community participation. Here’s a breakdown of how you can get involved and start earning points: Join Telegram Communities: A core component of earning points involves engaging within dedicated Telegram communities. This fosters a sense of community around the PAWS token and allows users to stay updated with the latest announcements and developments. Complete Activities: Beyond just joining Telegram groups, users are encouraged to actively participate by completing various activities. While the specific nature of these activities isn’t detailed in the initial announcement, they are likely to include tasks that promote community growth, awareness, and engagement with the PAWS project. Think along the lines of: Social Media Engagement: Sharing posts, retweeting announcements, and participating in discussions about PAWS on platforms like Twitter. Content Creation: Creating and sharing original content such as articles, videos, or memes about the PAWS token. Community Quizzes and Contests: Participating in quizzes to test your knowledge about the PAWS project or contests that reward creative contributions. Referral Programs: Inviting friends to join the Bitget pre-market PAWS community. Accumulate Points: By participating in Telegram communities and completing these activities, users accumulate points. The more actively you engage, the more points you can potentially earn. Point Conversion to PAWS Tokens: The most exciting part! These accumulated points are expected to be converted into actual PAWS tokens upon the official token launch scheduled for March 18th. This means your engagement isn’t just for fun; it directly translates into potentially owning PAWS tokens. Key Takeaway: Bitget’s pre-market approach for PAWS is innovative. It’s not just about early trading; it’s about building a strong, engaged community from the ground up. By rewarding participation with points convertible to tokens, Bitget is incentivizing users to become active stakeholders in the PAWS ecosystem. Benefits of Participating in the Crypto Pre-Market PAWS Launch on Bitget Why should you consider participating in the Bitget pre-market launch of PAWS? Here are some compelling benefits: Benefit Description Early Access Gain access to PAWS tokens before they are available on major exchanges. This early entry can be advantageous if the token performs well post-launch. Potential for Early Gains Pre-market trading can offer opportunities to acquire tokens at potentially favorable prices before they gain wider market attention and potentially increase in value after the official launch. Earn Crypto Rewards Through Engagement Bitget’s unique approach allows you to actively earn crypto by participating in community activities. This is a lower-risk way to accumulate PAWS tokens compared to purely financial investment in the pre-market. Community Building Be part of the ground-floor community for PAWS. Engage with like-minded individuals, contribute to the project’s growth, and stay informed about the latest developments directly from the source. Platform Familiarization Experience Bitget’s pre-market platform firsthand. This can be valuable for future pre-market opportunities and for understanding the dynamics of early token trading. Navigating the Challenges and Risks of Pre-Market Tokens While the Bitget pre-market PAWS launch presents exciting opportunities, it’s crucial to be aware of the potential challenges and risks associated with pre-market token trading: Volatility and Price Fluctuations: Pre-market token prices can be highly volatile. Prices are often driven by speculation and early sentiment, which can lead to significant price swings. Be prepared for potential fluctuations and understand that pre-market prices may not accurately reflect the token’s value post-launch. Liquidity Concerns: Liquidity in pre-market trading can be lower compared to established exchanges. This might make it harder to buy or sell large quantities of tokens at desired prices. Project Risks: Pre-market tokens are associated with newer projects, which inherently carry higher risks. The project might not achieve its goals, the token launch could be delayed, or the token’s value might not perform as expected after launch. Thorough research into the PAWS project (once more information is available) is crucial. Platform Risks: While Bitget is a reputable exchange, using any pre-market platform involves a degree of trust in the platform’s security and operational integrity. Information Asymmetry: Information about pre-market tokens might be less readily available compared to established cryptocurrencies. Conducting due diligence and staying informed is essential. Actionable Insight: Approach pre-market participation with caution and a clear understanding of the risks involved. Never invest more than you can afford to lose, and always conduct thorough research. The thrill of early access should be balanced with responsible risk management.

Several altcoins have produced impressive gains over the past day, and ATOM stands out as the only one with a double-digit increase. BTC at $84K The primary cryptocurrency had a rocky start to the week as it lost the $86,000 level, which held during the previous weekend, and slumped to $80,000 on Monday. After a brief rebound to $84,000, the bears took complete control of the market and pushed it south hard to under $77,000 for the first time in approximately four months. After losing nearly ten grand in less than 48 hours, BTC finally reacted well and jumped above $80,000 hours later. It kept climbing on Wednesday after the favorable US CPI data but was stopped at $84,000 and driven back down to $80,000. More volatility ensued on Thursday and especially on Friday when it jumped from $82,000 to a multi-day peak of over $85,000 within hours. However, the rally faced another rejection, and BTC now trades quietly at around $84,000. According to some analysts, this is a crucial support zone that could determine whether bitcoin has the legs to challenge $90,000 soon. For now, its market cap remains under $1.670 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts is close to 59%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView SOL, SUI on the Rise As mentioned above, the two top gainers from the larger-cap alts are SOL and SUI. Both have jumped by over 6% and now trade above $230 and $2.35, respectively. ETH remains above $1,900 despite some warnings about a potential drop below $1,300, while XRP has tapped $2.4 after a 4% daily surge. BNB has neared $600, while DOGE, ADA, and LTC are up by around 3% each. The total crypto market cap has added about $60 billion since yesterday’s low and is up to $2.840 trillion on CG.
