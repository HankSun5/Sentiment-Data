With a 10% increase from January, the total supply now stands at almost $205 billion. The spike, according to data from Glassnode, comes after a dip in late 2024, when the supply of stablecoins fell from $187 billion to $185 billion. Related Reading: Bitcoin And S&P Decline Together, But Data Predicts A Turnaround Stablecoins See A Strong Rebound For trading cryptocurrencies, stablecoins—like USDT and USDC—often act as a reserve for investors expecting the right time to buy assets like Bitcoin. The most recent rise shows that investor interest has surged, especially in view of last year’s slow down. Since Jan 1, the aggregate #stablecoin supply has increased by $20.17B (+10.9%), now reaching more than $205B. For comparison, the December peak clocked in at $187B but the supply actually contracted in the last two weeks of 2024 and dropped to $185B by January 2025. pic.twitter.com/gQbdMEDisb — glassnode (@glassnode) March 13, 2025 Given the previous fall, this comeback is especially notable. For most of 2024 the market has been losing stablecoins; but, this trend has lately reversed. Although past patterns suggest that Bitcoin’s price may be impacted, it is unknown whether this increase will lead to a rise in purchases of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin Investors Watching Closely A growing stablecoin supply is often seen as a bullish sign for Bitcoin. Historically, the price of Bitcoin has risen in line with the stablecoin count. The reasoning is simple: more stablecoins mean more potential capital just waiting to be entered into the market. Some analysts believe this fresh injection could push Bitcoin higher. However, not all stablecoins are used for trading. Many are held for remittances, payments, or as a hedge against inflation, especially in countries where local currencies are unstable. As of today, the market cap of cryptocurrencies stood at $2.65 trillion. Chart: TradingView Stablecoin Exchange Holdings Drop 21% While the total supply is rising, only 21% of stablecoins are currently sitting on exchanges. This is a significant drop from 2021, when over 50% of the supply was available for immediate trading, Glassnode disclosed. This shift suggests that while new coins are being issued, they are not all being deployed into crypto markets right away. Related Reading: TRUMP Token Takedown—Did Insiders Plan The Crash? This could point to one of two possibilities: either stablecoins are being used more often outside of exchanges or investors are still waiting for the suitable moment. Should the latter prove right, the impact on Bitcoin could be less notable than expected. What This Means For Bitcoin’s Future The stablecoin market is currently experiencing a resurgence, which is generally a favorable development for the cryptocurrency sector. However, it is uncertain whether this will result in a short-term increase in the price of Bitcoin. Stablecoin utilization has fluctuated, and additional economic variables will contribute to this development. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at 82,264, down 1.1% and 6.9% in the daily and weekly frames.

The one exception is the category of analytics tokens, which is thriving in Q1. Most narrative tokens are down in 2025, driven by the overall stagnation of the altcoin market. Investors have lost their taste for risk, and for assets that may go down to zero, with no fundamental value. Most narratives, which peaked in late 2024, are now back to negative performance. The only exception is the class of analytics tokens, tied to data platforms or AI analytics tools. As the crypto market grows more complex, data and patterns are key to discovering the next viable trade or investment. This allowed analytics tokens to rally as the next possible type of project with real utility. Analytics tokens are the best-performing narrative in 2025. | Source: DeFi Llama According to DeFiLlama, analytics tokens have expanded by over 162% in the year to date, at one point reaching a high of 659% growth. Analytics is a relatively new category, which appeared after the proliferation of millions of new assets and thousands of trading pairs. The rise of a narrative does not mean a rally or liquidity for all tokens. The DeFiLlama narrative average covers a total of 84 analytics tokens, but the bulk of growth comes from the top projects. As with other categories of altcoins, traders remain selective and move into the most liquid assets with the potential of preserving their earnings. SQD was the leading analytics token with rapid growth, trending after its recent launch. SQD is trading at $0.08, still in early price discovery, rising by over 39% in the past 24 hours. DataBot is up over 21% on the day, trading at $0.0008. DATA is a relatively older token, trending now in one of its regular rallies. The third best performer is SoSoValue (SOSO), which recently bounced from its lows at $0.058. Analytics tokens can also outperform the market briefly, if some of the smaller niche assets have outsized rallies. Analytics sector expands with new token launches Analytics tokens combine data platform assets with projects that combine AI agents and on-chain data. Currently, the whole category is valued at over $2.3B, growing by 5.4% in the past 24 hours. Not all analytics tokens were noticed in the past few months. The sector became visible after some of the leading social media analytics accounts also launched tokens. The current leaders for the sector are KAITO and the native token of Bubblemaps, BMT. Both assets are still in their early stages following a recent airdrop. KAITO remains pressured by selling, but BMT was among the day’s top gainers. BMT expanded by over 30% in the past 24 hours to trade at $0.11. The analytics sector is also notable for setting expectations for additional airdrops. Some of the leading tools for on-chain analytics are closely watched for launching their own token. After Arkham, Kaito and Bubblemaps performed their airdrops, others are expected to follow. Analytics platforms offer a real user base and utility in navigating the thousands of tokens with both centralized and decentralized trading. The analytics space also includes The Graph (GRT), a token with years of history in previous bull markets. CookieDAO and ChainGPT are among the trending assets. Most of the analytics tools are pointed toward on-chain data, DEX activity and automated analysis. The analytics narrative thus combines tokens from other categories, carrying rebranded AI agents as well. Analytics tools are becoming more sophisticated, including on-chain data on whale wallets and trading activity. Other tools seek alpha in chats and social media content, sifting through trends too complex to discover and analyze for a human trader. As with other hot sectors, the success of several analytics tokens can lead to the creation of multiple copycat projects. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

A snippet of the S-1 filing was shared on social media on March 14 by Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, who has been closely monitoring developments in the crypto ETF industry. Source: James Seyffart The proposed VanEck Avalanche ETF intends to “reflect the performance of the price of “AVAX,” the native token of the Avalanche network, less the expenses of the Trust’s operations,” the prospectus read. The proposed fund will hold AVAX and will “value its Shares daily based on the reported MarketVector Avalanche Benchmark Rate,” the prospectus said. As Seyffart noted in a follow-up post, the Trust’s registration “was shared widely earlier this week, But this is the first actual filing with the SEC.” Avalanche is the 16th largest crypto asset, with a total market capitalization of $7.7 billion. The blockchain is notable for its high throughput and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility. Related: US Bitcoin ETFs break outflow streak with $13.3M inflow ETF race heats up The overwhelming success of the US spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) exchange-traded funds and the election of a pro-crypto administration in Washington have triggered an influx of crypto fund applications at the SEC. As Cointelegraph recently reported , nine issuers have filed for an XRP ( XRP ) ETF, with Franklin Templeton joining the race on March 11. Issuers are also vying to list ETFs linked to Solana ( SOL ), Litecoin ( LTC ) and Dogecoin ( DOGE ). Although the SEC has punted its decision on these offerings, opting to designate a longer period for review, Seyffart and fellow Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchinas say there are “relatively high odds of approval” later this year. A January report by JPMorgan said the approval of altcoin ETFs will likely trigger billions of dollars in inflows, underscoring the pent-up demand for cryptocurrencies. In particular, SOL and XRP products could attract the most institutional interest. Assuming modest adoption rates, SOL and XRP ETFs could attract billions in their first 12 months. Source: JPMorgan “When applying these so-called “adoption rates” to SOL and XRP, we see SOL attracting roughly $3 billion-$6 billion of net assets and XRP gathering $4 billion-$8 billion in net new assets,” the report said.

On March 14, the anonymous whale, referred to on X as “ETH 50x Big Guy,” took out long positions in LINK worth approximately $31 million with 10 times leverage, according to Lookonchain, a Web3 analytics service. He placed the bets on Hyplerliquid and GMX, two popular perpetuals exchanges, Lookonchain said in a March 14 X post. Additionally, the whale accumulated roughly $12 million in spot LINK. In the ensuing hours, the whale gradually reduced his LINK holdings through small swaps back into stablecoins, as per onchain data . Source: Lookonchain Related: Hyperliquid ups margin requirements after $4 million liquidation loss Massive trading gains On March 12, the unidentified trader intentionally liquidated a roughly $200 million ETH long position, causing Hyperliquid’s liquidity pool, HLP, to lose $4 million . The trader’s profits topped roughly $1.8 million. According to Lookonchain, the trader has earned nearly $17 million in the past month on Hyperliquid. The incident highlighted the challenges facing perpetual trading platforms such as Hyperliquid, which enable traders to take long or short positions many times larger than their deposited capital. Hyperliquid said the trader’s actions did not qualify as an exploit and were instead a predictable consequence of the mechanics of its trading platform under extreme conditions. In response to the losses, Hyperliquid announced on March 13 revised collateral rules for traders with open positions to guard against similar edge cases in the future. Launched in 2024, Hyperliquid’s flagship perpetuals exchange has captured 70% of the market share, surpassing rivals such as GMX and dYdX, according to a January report by asset manager VanEck. Chainlink, the most popular decentralized oracle service, saw the price of its native LINK token increase by more than 150% in the weeks after President Donald Trump prevailed in the US election. It has since given up much of those gains, declining from highs of nearly $30 per token in December to less than $14 as of March 14, according to data from CoinGecko. Chainlink’s market capitalization is currently around $8.7 billion.

Meanwhile, in the United States, a new bill seeks to formalize former President Donald Trump’s executive order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. However, Democrat Representative Gerald is pushing for the US Treasury to halt any efforts toward creating a crypto reserve. Argentina finalizes rules for virtual asset providers Argentina’s securities regulator has finalized rules for virtual asset service providers (VASPs), which cover general codes of conduct and custody requirements for cryptocurrency exchanges and other platforms facilitating digital asset transactions. The regulations were published on March 13 by the National Securities Commission, also known as CNV, under General Resolution No. 1058. According to a translated version of the announcement , the regulations impose “obligations regarding registration, cybersecurity, asset custody, money laundering prevention, and risk disclosure” on VASPs operating in the country. The stated goal of the rules is to guarantee “transparency, stability, and user protection in the crypto ecosystem,” the announcement said. Argentine tax lawyer Diego Fraga said the final guidelines include mandatory separation of company and client funds, annual audits and monthly reporting with the CNV. Source: Diego Fraga Since 2024, VASPs operating in Argentina have been required to register with the registry of virtual asset service providers, also known as PSAV. According to the new rules, registrations may be revoked for noncompliance, and any company operating without registration may be blocked by court order. US Rep. Byron Donalds to introduce bill codifying Trump’s Bitcoin reserve A new bill set to be introduced in Congress aims to formalize President Donald Trump’s executive order establishing a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, a move that could further integrate Bitcoin into the nation’s financial strategy. Trump signed an executive order on March 7 to use Bitcoin ( BTC ) seized in government criminal cases to establish a national reserve . The legislation, introduced by US Representative Byron Donalds, seeks to ensure the Bitcoin reserve becomes a permanent fixture, preventing future administrations from dismantling it through executive action. Source: Margo Martin “For years, the Democrats waged war on crypto,” Donalds, a Florida Republican, said in a statement to Bloomberg . “Now is the time for Congressional Republicans to decisively end this war.” If the bill is passed, it would ensure that the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the US Digital Asset Stockpile could not be eliminated via executive actions by a future administration. The bill will require at least 60 votes in the Senate and a House majority to pass. With Republicans holding a Senate majority — and amid a generally more crypto-friendly environment — the bill has a chance of passing. Democrat lawmaker urges Treasury to cease Trump’s Bitcoin reserve plans A Democrat lawmaker has called on the US Treasur y to “cease all attempts” to create a strategic crypto reserve in the United States. House Representative Gerald E. Connolly of Michigan criticized the “cryptocurrency reserve” in a March 13 letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, stating that it provides “no discernible benefit to the American people” and would instead significantly enrich the president and his donors. Rep: Gerald Connolly’s letter to US Treasury’s Scott Bessent. Source: Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Democrats Connolly said Trump’s plans would constitute “unsound fiscal policy” because it chooses certain cryptocurrencies over others via social media and would also waste taxpayer dollars.

Solayer ( LAYER ) is a blockchain network designed for high throughput and near-zero latency. The network bills itself as “infinitely scalable” and is designed to handle 1 million transactions per second (TPS). Explains the project, “Solayer is a protocol for developers who want to enhance their decentralize application’s performance on Solana. It aims to increase the reliability of network access while reducing associated costs by up to 50x.” Solayer’s new native token, LAYER, is trading at $1.21 at time of writing, up from $0.857 one week ago. The 216th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is also up more than 18% in the past 24 hours alone. LAYER launched in February. That same month, the Singapore-based crypto exchange Bitget and the Seychelles-based exchange MEXC both rolled out trading services for the asset. Earlier this month, the San Francisco-based exchange Kraken listed LAYER, and this week the Hong Kong-based HashKey Global also made the token available for traders.

Will the Uptrend Continue?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/why-has-bitcoin-rebounded-will-the-uptrend-continue/,"Bitcoin has surged over 4% in the past 24 hours, reaching above $84,000, according to cryptocurrency data provider CoinGecko. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap briefly touched $85,000 earlier in the day before pulling back. The rally coincided with a broader recovery in risk assets as markets responded positively to signs of macroeconomic stability and the apparent success of the U.S. government in averting a shutdown. Bitcoin’s rise reflects renewed confidence in financial markets, according to Strahinja Savic, head of data analysis at crypto consultancy FRNT Financial. “Some renewed macro stability suggests that Bitcoin and crypto are recovering alongside other risk assets,” Savic said in a Telegram message. “Lower-than-expected inflation figures and the perception that geopolitical risks are easing are contributing to easing macro concerns and providing a tailwind for Bitcoin.” He also noted that some Bitcoin investors are fueling the recovery by taking the opportunity to “buy the dip.” Related News: Is the Recovery in Solana (SOL) Permanent or Could Further Declines Be Coming? Analytics Firm Reveals Critical Points Bitcoin’s gains came after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer expressed support for a Republican measure to fund the government. A government shutdown could add further uncertainty to markets already grappling with concerns about stagflation, an economic scenario in which growth slows while inflation remains high. Risk assets have been under pressure for weeks due to trade war fears sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on major trading partners. Additional macroeconomic concerns, including the government's controversial cost-cutting measures, have also weighed on investor sentiment. The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index fell to its lowest level since 2022, signaling declining confidence in the U.S. economy. The survey also found that inflation expectations rose to their highest level in more than two years. Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto asset manager BitBull Capital, said the data is driving investors to Bitcoin as a hedge against economic uncertainty. He also noted that institutional confidence remains strong, with BlackRock resuming its Bitcoin purchases and making a $25 million investment. Despite the current bullish momentum, DiPasquale warned that volatility remains a concern and warned of potential significant corrections ahead. *This is not an investment recommendation.

The cryptocurrency market presents two enticing opportunities through ADA and XRP and MUTM stands out due to its high demand during the presale phase. Analysts have set out projections for ADA to reach $2 and XRP to achieve $10 and MUTM to surpass $5 while indicating that these tokens represent core investments for people desiring high return potential. Cardano (ADA) Nears Critical Development Milestones Organizational capital has started to gravitate toward Cardano due to the systematic development of its blockchain infrastructure which focuses on scalability improvements along with energy efficiency measures. ADA surpasses its former role as a speculative instrument because decentralized applications are spreading rapidly into finance and digital identity markets. Market experts predict ADA token value will extend to $2 in late 2025 provided the market shows expansion paths which parallel its growth trajectory. The long-term stability of Cardano receives increased validation from institutional stakeholders because of its compliance-oriented framework. Despite price swings ADA continues to demonstrate its capability as a solid asset in the pursuit of elevated market valuations because of its research-based value additions. Ripple (XRP) Navigates Resistance Amid Bullish Forecast The current resistance level of $2.10 hinders XRP price growth yet experts have positive expectations that it may rise to $10. Crypto strategist ElmoX has identified an important point where XRP could move to $1.20 before a potential parabolic rise requires breaking through $2.90. The market shows signs that regulatory explanations and enhanced inter-banking payment usage will together serve as motivational factors. The token shows fundamental strength through its successful rebound from important support points despite recent price drops. Bullish market activity that picks up speed following a correction may create conditions for XRP to replicate its previous upward patterns in moving past $10 while institutions and retail investors build their similar interests. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Momentum Sparks Frenzy Mutuum Finance (MUTM) establishes itself as a prominent decentralized finance project because its Phase 3 presale heads toward a complete sell-out. 5,500 investors purchased MUTM tokens which resulted in $3.2 million worth of investment while expanding the tokenholder base to 5,500. The price rise in Phase 4 to $0.025 will provide immediate profits of 25% to existing participants. The Tokenomics system presents a mathematical expansion blueprint where Phase 3 investors can expect 200% growth through a $0.06 listing price but the added $5 prediction represents an enormous 24,900% potential return. The lending model of Mutuum Finance that uses mtTokens for interest accrual together with its buy-and-distribute mechanism establishes ongoing demand for MUTM. The presale opportunities enable the first users to lock in positions that become more valuable when mainstream exchange listings bring greater market exposure. The fast growth of Phase 3 investments accelerates the time before the MUTM token at its current price of $0.02 will become unavailable.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, the top US-based crypto exchange platform by volume says that it has added the meme asset doginme ( DOGINME ) to its listing roadmap. Coinbase’s listing roadmap is used to increase transparency and to prevent the front-running of new tokens. Being added to the list means the crypto exchange is considering adding support for the asset soon. News of the addition sent DOGINME flying as the memecoin went from a low of $0.000366 on March 13th to a peak of $0.00106 just a day later. It has since retraced and is trading for $0.00091 at time of writing, a staggering gain of 106% during the last 24 hours. Doginme – which launched in February 2025 – was created by Dan Romero, the founder of the decentralized social media network Farcaster, when he was asked if he owned a dog, according to the crypto asset’s official website. “Doginme came to life in February 2024 when Farcaster founder Dan Romero (DWR) was asked if he owned a dog. DWR replied affirmatively: ‘No, but I got that dog in me.’ Extending far beyond our roots on Farcaster, doginme is now representative of the community’s collective efforts to embrace and embolden that dog in them.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Stone Sentenced to 45 Months for Fraud,https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-influencer-t-j-stone-sentenced-to-45-months-for-fraud/,"Key Takeaways: Crypto influencer faces a prison sentence for deceiving property and digital asset backers. The scheme unfolded over years using false business fronts and exploited personal ties. The case shows the risk of investing without independent verification. Thomas John Sfraga, known as T.J. Stone, was sentenced to 45 months in federal prison for wire fraud after defrauding real estate and cryptocurrency investors out of over $2 million, according to the U.S. Department of Justice on Friday. Brooklyn Podcaster and Cryptocurrency Personality Known as “T.J. Stone” Sentenced to 45 Months’ Imprisonment https://t.co/lbWYVDHqtz (Announced with @NewYorkFBI ) — US Attorney EDNY (@EDNYnews) March 14, 2025 According to a press release from the U.S. Department of Justice, Sfraga defrauded real estate and cryptocurrency investors out of more than $2 million. He was also ordered to forfeit $1,337,700, with restitution to be determined later. His sentencing took place in Brooklyn, presided over by U.S. District Judge Frederic Block. The case, led by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York and the FBI’s New York Field Office, exposed a years-long fraudulent scheme in which Sfraga exploited personal relationships and investor trust to fund a series of sham businesses. T.J. Stone’s Fraud Targeted Close Contacts U.S. Attorney John J. Durham condemned Sfraga’s actions, stating in a press release that he “stole from friends, neighbors, and even parents of children who played on sports teams with his own kids.” Sfraga ran fraudulent businesses, including Build Strong Homes LLC and Vandelay Contracting Corp.—a name referencing the fictional “Vandelay Industries” from Seinfeld. Under the alias “T.J. Stone,” he portrayed himself as a real estate developer, media personality, and cryptocurrency expert, even acting as an emcee at major crypto events in New York. Stone’s Fraudulent Activities Spanned Years Between 2016 and 2022, Sfraga convinced at least 17 victims in Brooklyn, Staten Island, and Long Island to invest in fraudulent ventures, including real estate flipping projects and cryptocurrency investments , promising returns of up to 60% in just three months. One of his schemes involved persuading a victim to lend him $100,000 for a construction project that did not exist. In another, he promoted a fictitious crypto “virtual wallet,” enticing victims with the prospect of high returns. Rather than investing the funds, Sfraga spent the money on personal expenses and used some to repay earlier victims in a Ponzi-style scheme. As authorities began investigating, Sfraga fled to Arizona and assumed a false identity. Law enforcement arrested him in Las Vegas after he failed to pay a bill at the Wynn Casino. The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney John Vagelatos, with support from Paralegal Specialist Madison Bates, culminating in Sfraga’s sentencing. The post Crypto Influencer T.J.

But the move has sparked fierce divisions within the Democratic Party over how to counter President Donald Trump's efforts to expand executive power. The Senate approved the funding package by a 62-38 vote, putting congressional Democrats in a position to give up what they see as their strongest leverage to curb Trump and billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk’s aggressive cost-cutting measures, which include drastically reducing the federal workforce and abolishing entire government agencies. With legislative options dwindling, opponents are expected to shift their efforts to legal challenges in the courts. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer played a critical role in the decision-making process. With less than 30 hours left before the shutdown, the veteran lawmaker announced he would drop his party’s hold on the spending bill, prioritizing the continuation of government services over political wrangling. Related News: Why Has Bitcoin Rebounded? Will the Uptrend Continue? Schumer’s reversal marks a significant victory for Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, paving the way for the spending measure’s final approval. The bill ensures Musk’s newly created Office of Government Efficiency retains the authority to make sweeping budget cuts while securing government funding through the fiscal year-end on Sept. 30. The political impasse coincides with turmoil in financial markets as Trump’s tariff policies have stoked widespread investor uncertainty. By Thursday, the S&P 500 had entered a correction, losing more than 10% in three weeks. But news that the Senate was making progress on the spending bill sparked a 2% recovery on Friday. Nine Democrats and one independent joined forces with nearly all Senate Republicans to pass the bill with a simple majority later in the day, passing the 60-vote threshold. *This is not investment advice.

This was after the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) published a report suggesting such talks had taken place. Details From The Statement Following the report’s release, Zhao addressed the claims in a March 13 post on X, stating, “I have had no discussions of a Binance US deal with … well, anyone.” The former Binance CEO explained that more than 20 people had told him they had been contacted by WSJ and another media outlet, who were attempting to verify whether he had struck a deal for clemency. The article alleged that Zhao was seeking a presidential pardon from Trump, which could allow him to take on an operational or management role at Binance. According to the WSJ, Binance approached Trump’s allies last year with a business proposal as part of its plan to strengthen its U.S. operations. Zhao denied these claims, suggesting that the report was politically motivated and intended as “an attack on the President and crypto.” He also asserted that “residual forces of the ‘war on crypto’ from the last administration are still at work.” CZ, who served time after pleading guilty to violating U.S. anti-money laundering laws, noted that he is the only individual in U.S. history to receive a prison sentence for a single Bank Secrecy Act violation. “No felon would mind a pardon,” he said, adding that he remains dedicated to advancing cryptocurrency both in the U.S. and globally. Implication of CZ’s Possible Return In November 2023, Binance settled with U.S. authorities, agreeing to pay $4.3 billion in fines. As part of the agreement, Zhao pleaded guilty to failing to implement an effective anti-money laundering program at the exchange. The company also committed to fully exiting the United States market. CZ later resigned as CEO, with reports indicating that he was permanently barred from operating or managing Binance under the terms of the settlement. A presidential pardon would possibly change the platform’s ability to conduct business in the country. Since Trump took office, his administration has taken a more supportive stance on digital assets, reversing the strict regulatory approach of the previous government. Under acting Chair Mark Uyeda, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has softened its enforcement efforts against crypto firms. Several high-profile cases, including those involving Binance and Coinbase , have been paused or dropped.

LIBRA Memecoin Scandal The request, made by prosecutor Gregorio Dalbón, reviewed by Fortune, accuses Davis of being a key figure behind the LIBRA memecoin. The token gained significant attention after President Milei endorsed it on Valentine’s Day. Following Milei’s endorsement, LIBRA’s market capitalization soared to over $4.5 billion. However, its value quickly collapsed, plummeting by more than 99% to approximately $18 million. Blockchain analysts later revealed that certain insiders sold large amounts of the token shortly after Milei publicly supported it. Related Reading: Solana Price Crash To $90? Why A 26% Decline Could Rock This Crypto In his request for the Red Notice, Dalbón expressed concerns that Davis might evade justice, citing his financial resources that could facilitate his flight or concealment. “The possibility that Davis will abandon his country of residence or hide to avoid answering for his alleged acts appears to be aggravated by the economic resources he possesses,” Dalbón stated, emphasizing the urgency of the situation. Interpol, the International Criminal Police Organization, facilitates international cooperation among law enforcement agencies in its 196 member countries, including the US and Argentina. A Red Notice serves as a request for member countries to locate and provisionally arrest individuals pending extradition. Federal Investigation Launched Into Javier Milei’s Endorsement Davis has not publicly responded to the allegations, nor have his family members, including his brother Gideon and father Charles, who are involved in their family crypto venture, Kelsier Ventures, Fortune reported. Yet, the controversy surrounding LIBRA is further complicated by its connection to former President Donald Trump, who recently launched his own memecoin named TRUMP. Trump’s endorsement of cryptocurrency has been characterized as part of his broader strategy to position himself as a pro-crypto advocate. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bottom Confirmed? Data Shows 87.5% Chance The Worst Is Over Following Milei’s endorsement, Davis openly acknowledged his role as an advisor to the Argentine president, stating, “I am indeed Javier Milei’s advisor.” He also claimed responsibility for the launch of a separate memecoin associated with Melania Trump. The fallout from the LIBRA launch has prompted legal inquiries, including a federal investigation into Milei’s actions. Both Milei and Davis have denied any wrongdoing, but the political implications of this incident are significant, as it raises questions about the accountability and regulation of cryptocurrencies in Argentina. At the time of writing, the memecoin is trading at $0.060, down over 90% from its all-time high reached on Valentine’s Day.

This decision has approved the collapsed hedge fund liquidators’ increase in the claim against FTX from $120 million to a massive $1.53 billion. This new development could affect how FTX’s remaining assets are shared and impact creditors who are still waiting for their payouts. 3AC’s Uncovers $1.53 Billion Loss in FTX Collapse Three Arrows Capital was once a big name in the crypto industry, managing over $3 billion before collapsing in 2022. Its downfall shook the crypto market, exposing major financial problems. At the time, it had strong financial ties to FTX, which also went bankrupt later that year after fraud accusations against its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried. In July 2023, 3AC’s liquidators filed a claim for $120 million, thinking that was what FTX owed them. Fast-forward to November 2024, and they found new evidence showing that FTX had actually liquidated $1.53 billion of 3AC’s assets just two weeks before 3AC collapsed. This discovery changed everything. FTX’s Defense Falls Apart in Court FTX argued that liquidating 3AC’s assets was justified because the company owed it $1.3 billion as loan collateral. However, the court ruled that FTX did not have enough proof to support this claim, allowing 3AC to increase its claim to a huge amount. Meanwhile, FTX emphasized that it had already started paying creditors and argued that 3AC’s claim came too late. However, the court said the delay was understandable since 3AC’s liquidators had trouble accessing financial records. The judge said the lack of help from 3AC’s founders, Zhu Su and Kyle Davies, made it even harder to uncover the full claim earlier. When 3AC collapsed, its founders also ran into legal trouble. Zhu Su was jailed four months in Singapore for refusing to cooperate with liquidators, while Kyle Davies avoided legal consequences. In 2023, they tried to return to the crypto scene by launching OPNX, a platform for trading bankruptcy claims, but it shut down in early 2025. What’s Next for FTX Creditors? With the court’s recent decision, 3AC’s liquidators have a much bigger position in FTX’s bankruptcy case. This raises questions about how the larger claim will affect payments to other FTX creditors, as another repayment round should start by May 30. Many also wonder whether 3AC will actually recover the full $1.53 billion. This raises concerns about hidden financial dealings between 3AC and FTX, making the case even more complicated. Meanwhile, Sam Bankman-Fried is trying to appeal his 25-year prison sentence, adding more uncertainty to one of the biggest bankruptcy cases in crypto history.

The asset management firm, led by Cathie Wood, made the purchases on March 13, 2025, through Coinbase. The total value of the acquisition is estimated at approximately $80 million. Ark Invest Executes Two Bitcoin Transactions Based on data by Arkham Intelligence, Ark Invest bought 498 BTC in its first transaction, followed by another 499 BTC. The purchases were made at a time when the top crypto’s price was experiencing slight fluctuations. As of March 14, 2025, Bitcoin was trading at $82,234, down 1.40%. Analysts note that while Bitcoin’s price has seen recent volatility, Ark Invest’s decision to buy suggests confidence in a potential price rebound. The firm has previously capitalized on price dips, making substantial purchases when the market was under pressure. Some experts believe this latest move is a sign that ARK expects BTC to appreciate in the coming months.

This marks the firm’s largest Coinbase investment since August last year. Reports indicate that Coinbase now accounts for more than 7% of the Ark fund, making it the fund’s third-largest holding. Coinbase has been a key part of Ark’s investment strategy for years. The firm has consistently added shares of the exchange, reinforcing its belief that the platform will continue to benefit from increased cryptocurrency adoption. Coinbase’s stock has faced some pressure amid regulatory concerns, but Ark’s purchase suggests it sees long-term potential. Cathie Wood Remains Bullish On Crypto Analysts claim that Ark Invest has continuously shown faith in Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. Despite market instability, the company has been making active investments in digital assets. According to reports, Wood still believes that Bitcoin is a significant financial asset with room to expand in the future. Wood has said in the past that Bitcoin may finally reach new all-time highs because there aren’t many of them and they’re becoming more and more popular. It’s clear that the company is willing to take a chance on long-term benefits by pouring massive amounts of money in the asset, even when the market goes down. What It Means For The Market People who follow the market are paying close attention to what Ark Invest has been doing lately. Institutional purchases in Bitcoin often change how the market feels as a whole. Some people believe that Bitcoin is still valuable even though its price has been going up and down lately.

Creative displays and digital experiments offered fresh views on asset use. The event connected tech experts with everyday users. The crypto sector had a small presence at South By Southwest (SXSW) this year. However, a few standout panels and marketing campaigns managed to make an impact. SXSW has been a tech, music, and film festival held in Austin, Texas, since 1987. While brands and creators have focused on non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in recent years, crypto companies arrived at SXSW 2025 with a focus on mainstream adoption. Bitcoin-Themed Drone Show Lights Up Austin Sky A highlight of SXSW 2025 was Gemini’s record-breaking drone show . The US-based exchange set a Guinness World Record on March 13 by deploying 1,000 drones to create the largest-ever aerial display of a currency symbol, forming the Bitcoin (BTC) logo over Austin. The drone show also featured images of spaceships, an astronaut placing flags on Mars, and a woolly mammoth. In case y’all missed it… I just watched the BEST drone show of my life here at SXSW, with a world breaking record for the largest currency symbol in the sky, Bitcoin!! Thank you @Gemini for this absolutely incredible experience that I watched from my balcony!!! Go where… pic.twitter.com/yP4tPWGe1N — Rachel Wolfson (@Rachelwolf00) March 14, 2025 Olivia Santarelli, head of marketing for Gemini, told Cryptonews at SXSW that the 1,000 drone show was meant to share the story of Gemini’s “Go Where Dollars Won’t” campaign. Gemini launched the “Go Where Dollars Won’t” campaign in November 2024. It featured a woolly mammoth image in a series of Gemini ad placements illustrated by Matt Griffin, a renowned multimedia artist best known for his work on Dune, Dune 2, and Star Wars. “The drone show was meant to tell the story of the ‘Mars Safari,’ which is one of the featured images in our ‘Go Where Dollars Won’t’ campaign,” Santarelli said. “The campaign portrays a future where the world can use cryptocurrency. The audience at SXSW was able to see that Bitcoin is a global currency.” Record-breaking Bitcoin logo at SXSW 2025 in Austin. / Source: Gemini Santarelli added that Gemini wanted to host the Bitcoin-themed drone show at SXSW due to its broad audience, many of whom may already be familiar with crypto. “We really wanted to do this at SXSW this year because the audience has probably heard a lot about crypto, and the drone show is a way for them to experience Gemini and crypto differently from social media or the news,” she remarked. “I hope this served as another touch point to help people learn more about cryptocurrency.” The world-record-breaking drone show concluded with a giant QR code in the sky for 30 seconds. The QR code led to Gemini’s website, offering $50 in BTC for trades of $100 or more. “This call-to-action allows people to invest in a small amount of crypto while earning crypto back,” Santarelli said. Coinbase Discusses Crypto Security Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase also had a presence at SXSW this year. Philip Martin, chief security officer for Coinbase, spoke about risks of online financial scams on a panel titled, “ Tech-Wide Battle Against Online Fraud .” Philip Martin speaking about security at SXSW 2025. Source: Coinbase Martin told Cryptonews that he was joined by one of Coinbase’s “Tech Against Scams” coalition partners, Match Group, along with a former FBI agent, to walk the audience through how fraudsters operate across online platforms. “We discussed how bad actors carry out long-term, high-reward financial scams that rely on trust and relationship-building – also known as social engineering scams,” Martin said. Martin added that it’s important to identify the warning signs and know how to report these types of crimes. “Everyone who attended our panel at SXSW knows someone who can be vulnerable to online scams,” he said. “Our goal was for the audience to go home and discuss this with their parents, their grandparents, and anyone else who might be at risk.” Martin further remarked that it was important for Coinbase to be a part of the conversation at SXSW in an effort to educate the general public on how to stay safe against scams. “If the byproduct of the panel was that attendees walked away from our session feeling more knowledgeable and confident in using crypto safely, then I would consider that a win,” he stated. Decentralized Social Media Gains Attention In addition to leading crypto exchanges, a number of Web3-focused companies and content creators attended this year’s SXSW. Solo Ceesay, co-founder and CEO of Calaxy, told Cryptonews at SXSW that the event was an opportunity to connect with Web2 creators who may be interested in exploring decentralized platforms . “Many creators continue to push for decentralization, but creators remain beholden to platforms like X or Instagram and TikTok,” Ceesay said. “Calaxy took the stage at SXSW to push an alternative platform, where creators can build their own tribe and monetize in a place built around a crypto wallet that enables easy value transfer.” Ceesay also announced the launch of a new fund at SXSW that is designed to propel 50 content creators into the Web3 social media revolution. “The recipients, known as the Calaxy Class of 2025, will each receive $20,000, along with milestone-based incentives and sustainable monetization opportunities within the Calaxy ecosystem,” Ceesay said. SXSW attracted a number of Web2 content creators this year, and Ceesay mentioned the event was an opportunity to introduce mainstream audiences to the crypto sector. AI and Blockchain Discussed Violetta Zironi, a singer-songwriter who inscribed a song on the Bitcoin blockchain , told Cryptonews at SXSW that while artificial intelligence (AI) dominated discussions, blockchain played an essential role in digital ownership. “The panel I was on was called ‘Building Music Communities with and Around XR Technology,’ where we spoke a lot about AI,” Zironi said. “However, I made it a point to explain how blockchain is the infrastructure needed to verify everything built around AI.” Zironi added that while blockchain was not a hot topic of discussion at SXSW, she believes it’s an essential part of the conversations that took place throughout the event. Beyond Speculation: Crypto’s Shift Toward Utility For years, crypto’s presence at major events leaned on price speculation and technological hype. At SXSW 2025, the focus shifted toward something more practical: security, education, and creative applications. Gemini’s drone show, Coinbase’s panel on scams, and Calaxy’s push for decentralized social media all underscored a growing effort to make crypto useful rather than just exciting. If the industry continues down this path, it may find that mainstream adoption isn’t about chasing trends but about solving real-world problems. Whether audiences at SXSW left as believers or skeptics, they were given something far more tangible to consider. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are the broader implications of crypto firms focusing on education and safety at events like SXSW? These sessions show a shift toward simplifying digital assets while tackling online risks. They build practical skills and user confidence, fostering an inclusive method for managing digital finance securely. How does the focus on decentralized social media at SXSW add value to crypto discussions? Emphasizing decentralized social media introduces alternative digital spaces for content creation. It spurs broader engagement, allowing users to explore asset management through community-led online networks. What future trends in digital finance might we expect following SXSW’s focus on crypto education and creative outreach? Future trends may include more interactive learning events and live digital displays that blend finance with art. These initiatives could drive wider user familiarity and reshape public views on digital asset use.

US intelligence federal agencies like the CIA, NSA, and FBI, which had presented the firm as a key asset to government officials, were also seemingly alarmed by Marquis-Boire’s past indiscretions. Marquis-Boire was first accused of sexual assault in 2017 and had to take a step back from the public Marquis-Boire sexual assault accusations first surfaced in 2017, with multiple women coming forward. The allegations at the time forced him to retreat from the public eye for some time. Moreover, several companies had even distanced themselves from him, including the interdisciplinary laboratory Citizen Lab. Citizen Lab even openly criticised the growing “toxic culture of sexual discrimination, harassment, and violence” in the tech industry. After several companies cut ties with him, Marquis-Boire reportedly helped start and develop Unciphered in secret using the pseudonym “Frank Davidson.” The company’s employees only found out about his involvement in the firm’s development towards the end of 2023. For the last four years, however, Unciphered has built up a good reputation, specializing in cracking encrypted wallets to recover lost crypto funds. Even high-profile cybersecurity figures, including former NSA general counsel Stewart Baker and security expert Chris Wysopal, took an interest in the company. Employees doubted whether Marquis-Boire left the company completely in 2024 However, Marquis-Boire’s revealed connections to the company raised concerns about the firm’s reputation and image. The company’s employees especially raised alarms over Marquis-Boire’s past, not wanting to be tied to the man’s past actions and ruin their professional reputations. Jon Ellch, a former FBI cybersecurity expert, even asked for the company to drop Marquis-Boire. Following multiple other complaints, CEO Eric Michaud resigned, and Marquis-Boire left the company. However, even after he left the company, employees were still concerned about his lingering connections to the firm. In early 2024, a package addressed to him was delivered to Unciphered’s San Francisco office, renewing fears about his continued influence. Nevertheless, the company’s administration quickly reassured its workers that Marquis-Boire’s shares were all bought out in February 2024, and he was no longer involved with the company Meanwhile, in response to the controversy, Unciphered took down all employee names from its website for security reasons.

The broader crypto market remains under stress, with fear dominating sentiment and keeping ETH from regaining momentum. Related Reading: Dogecoin Network Activity Surges 47% In A Month – What’s Next for DOGE? The downturn is largely driven by macroeconomic uncertainty and escalating trade war fears, which have shaken both crypto and the U.S. stock markets. As investors brace for further volatility, some fear that the market is setting up for a deeper correction. However, not all analysts are bearish. Some believe that a recovery could be on the horizon in the coming months, especially if technical indicators begin to show strength. Top analyst Daan shared insights on X, revealing that Ethereum has been consolidating since the major sell-off and has formed a falling wedge pattern—a bullish formation that could indicate a local trend reversal. For now, ETH remains at risk of further declines, but if this pattern plays out, Ethereum could soon break out of its consolidation range and start building momentum for a recovery. The next few weeks will be crucial in determining whether ETH can stabilize or if more downside is ahead. Ethereum Falling Wedge Could Signal a Reversal Ethereum has lost over 57% of its value, creating a challenging environment for bulls as selling pressure continues. ETH is now trading below a multi-year support level, which has flipped into strong resistance. As long as Ethereum remains below the $1,900–$2,000 range, bulls will struggle to regain momentum, keeping bearish sentiment intact. The entire crypto market has mirrored this weakness, experiencing a significant breakdown alongside the U.S. stock market. Global trade war fears and uncertainty surrounding U.S. President Trump’s policies have further fueled the sell-off in risk assets. Since the U.S. elections in November 2024, macroeconomic volatility and rising uncertainty have driven markets lower. With the U.S. stock market hitting its lowest levels since September 2024, investors remain on edge, questioning if Ethereum has further downside ahead. Despite this bleak outlook, there is some optimism. Daan’s insights suggest that Ethereum has been consolidating since the major drop and has formed a falling wedge pattern. This bullish formation could lead to a local trend reversal if ETH breaks out and holds above resistance. For this potential recovery to materialize, ETH must break above the white zone and reclaim $2,000. If this happens, bulls could start testing higher levels and build momentum for a broader market recovery. However, the ETH/BTC ratio remains near multi-year lows, showing only minor resilience in recent days. Sustained strength is needed before a real reversal can take place. Related Reading: Ethereum Net Taker Volume Signals Huge Selling Pressure – Can Bulls Hold Key Levels? With Ethereum still struggling, the next few weeks will be crucial in determining whether this falling wedge breakout can lead to a meaningful rally or if the downtrend will continue. Bulls Struggle Around $1,900 Ethereum is currently trading at $1,900, after days of struggling below the crucial $2,000 mark. Bulls have lost control, and ETH is now at its lowest levels since October 2023, reflecting the broader market uncertainty and ongoing bearish sentiment. With macroeconomic volatility and trade war fears weighing heavily on risk assets, Ethereum continues to face selling pressure, making it difficult for bulls to build momentum for a recovery. The longer ETH stays below $2,000, the stronger the resistance at this level becomes, pushing buyers further out of the market. For Ethereum to avoid deeper losses, bulls must reclaim the $2,000 mark as soon as possible and establish it as a new support level. A break and hold above this threshold could trigger a recovery rally, allowing ETH to test higher resistance zones. However, losing current levels would leave ETH vulnerable to another drop, potentially retesting support near $1,750 or lower. Related Reading: Bitcoin Lost And Retested The 200-Day MA As Resistance – Here’s What Happened Last Time The next few days will be critical, as bulls need to step in and defend current demand to prevent further downside.

While the market marvels at this growth in the Sonic price, most savvy investors are also stacking up FloppyPepe (FPPE) , which is making headlines as the most promising meme coin to buy in anticipation of the much-anticipated crypto bull run. Sonic Price Prepares For A Massive Rebound As Network Metrics Rise After the Fantom blockchain rebranded to Sonic (S), the Sonic price has seen significant gains. It peaked at $0.95 last month, just shy of its $1.03 all-time high (ATH). Experts attribute this sudden price surge to the altcoin season hype, and many are optimistic that the Sonic price will soon reclaim previous highs. Notably, one market analyst, Crypto Kindle, says that Sonic price is on a bullish trend and is outperforming again. The price is currently sitting at a local resistance level, aiming to break to new levels after successfully breaking out of its previous downtrend. Aside from its impressive price performance, the Sonic (S) network boasts over 10,000 transactions per second (TPS) with sub-second finality—a standout feature that has caught the market’s eye. The Sonic (S) network has adopted a new developer model that grants builders 90% of fees. This model spiked its Total Value Locked (TVL) to $745 million, marking a major milestone, as it has increased by 220% since January.

Another standout feature of FloppyPepe (FPPE) is its reward distribution model. With every transaction, this meme coin redistributes 3% to token holders, providing an added incentive for long-term participation. Beyond its profit-driven structure, FloppyPepe (FPPE) offers real utilities that set it apart from typical meme coins. One of its standout features is the integration of AI tools designed to help investors stay ahead of market trends. The FloppyAI , for instance, particularly guarantees that investors and community members receive instant, accurate responses about tokenomics, roadmap milestones, and market trends. Interestingly, this FloppyAI agent has been integrated across Telegram, Twitter (X), and the FloppyPepe (FPPE) website, making it accessible to both token holders and new investors looking to explore its capabilities and stay ahead of the crypto bull run. Meanwhile, the Meme-o-Matic machine, which is already live on Telegram, allows users to create quality memes through AI text prompts. These AI tools position FloppyPepe (FPPE) as an intelligent meme coin with long-term growth potential, whether or not a crypto bull run influences it. While most savvy investors believe the Sonic price will surge and give them some returns, most are hedging with FloppyPepe (FPPE), which offers higher ROIs with a low presale price of $0.0000002 .

The DOJ says former Bank of America employee Rongjian Li was a member of a money laundering and drug trafficking outfit headed by Jin Hua Zhang. According to prosecutors, Li used his position at the bank from 2021 through 2022 to help the criminal organization open several accounts. Zhang’s organization then used the BofA accounts, some of which were registered using forged passports, to launder illicit funds. “As part of his involvement, when the bank’s financial auditing systems flagged or froze accounts for suspicious activity, Li helped Zhang circumvent the bank’s anti-money laundering protocols and move illicit funds elsewhere. In addition, Li was observed sitting next to Zhang at a dinner in New York, where Zhang discussed the different fee percentages he charged various criminal groups for drug trafficking and scams.” Zhang’s organization is believed to have laundered millions of dollars in a span of months, according to the DOJ. “The investigation revealed that, for a fee, Zhang laundered bulk cash for drug dealers and laundered profits from other illegal businesses. In less than a year, Zhang and his organization laundered at least $25 million worth of drug proceeds and funds from other illegal businesses through undercover agents.” Li has pleaded guilty to the charge of conspiracy to commit money laundering. He faces a monetary fine and a prison sentence. “The charge of money laundering conspiracy provides for a sentence of up to 20 years in prison, up to three years of supervised release and a fine of up to $500,000, or twice the amount involved, whichever is greater.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The sports betting industry needs efficient sports odds aggregators as sportsbooks continue to incorporate crypto payment methods. Sportsbook operators can utilize these platforms to retrieve betting odds from various sources in real time, ensuring users receive current and competitive wagering options. The selection of a quality sports odds API is essential because it determines a sportsbook’s performance and also influences user loyalty, financial outcomes, and system stability. The article goes over premium odds aggregation features in crypto-friendly betting platforms and explores the impact of modern technology on future sports wagering. Digital wagering solutions are analyzed in detail at Crypto Intelligence , where readers can access the latest trends in crypto gambling and sports betting technology. The Importance of Sports Odds Aggregators for Crypto Sportsbooks The competitive crypto gambling market requires platforms to provide immediate access to odds from various sporting events for their betting customers. Traditional sportsbooks have long used odds aggregation to improve their betting options, but crypto-friendly sportsbooks face three main challenges: decentralized transactions, market volatility, and regulatory uncertainties. A reliable sports odds aggregation system allows sportsbooks to instantly compare odds from multiple platforms by integrating both fiat and cryptocurrency data, thereby building user trust. As the sports betting industry transitions to digital assets, operators must choose aggregators that support crypto transactions and incorporate blockchain security, features that are now essential. The integration of a trustworthy odds API becomes essential because operators who do not implement it will lose ground to competitors who provide better betting experiences based on secure data-driven platforms. Key Factors to Consider When Choosing a Sports Odds Aggregator The selection of an appropriate sports odds aggregator depends on multiple important factors for assessment. Crypto sports betting demands precise real-time data because odds change quickly during betting sessions. Top aggregators rely on fast data streams and AI-driven analysis to continuously update odds in real time. For optimal security and seamless, delay-free crypto payment transactions, API integration with payment gateways must be flawless. Security and compliance stand as essential factors in the industry, so top aggregators use blockchain encryption together with 2FA and anti-fraud protection systems. Following regulations provides legal stability to operations. Sportsbooks gain better user satisfaction through customization because they can adjust odds and betting limits and market options to specific preferences. A design that embraces user-friendliness enables better customer commitment both during initial engagement and for continued use. Maximizing profits in sports betting increasingly depends on AI analytics, which provide predictive sports predictions, personalized betting guidance, and effective risk optimization. The Impact of Sports Odds Aggregators on Crypto-Friendly Sportsbooks Crypto sportsbooks differ from traditional bookmakers in that they incorporate decentralized finance (DeFi) principles throughout their operations. Every component of betting operations must function at high speed with robust security and transparency. A dependable sports odds aggregator enables crypto-friendly betting platforms to update their odds instantly, an essential feature given the constant price volatility of digital assets. The efficient operation of an odds API eliminates betting rate differences to stop users from placing wagers with old prices. The acceptance of multiple currencies through wagering support becomes possible because leading odds aggregators enable sportsbooks to work with various cryptocurrencies and stablecoins which expands their betting audience worldwide. Blockchain-based odds aggregation provides transparent betting records that prevent data tampering while reducing concerns about data manipulation. The system establishes confidence levels that benefit both gamblers and oversight organizations. Selecting the Best Sports Odds API Provider Sportsbook operators need to perform thorough assessments of multiple odds aggregation services that exist in the market. Sports betting technology includes reputable companies such as Odds88 that provides both sportsbook-compatible real-time odds aggregation and API solutions. Their platform delivers sportsbook operators an advanced API that provides smooth integration and real-time betting updates, and extensive market coverage. The Future of Sports Betting and Odds Aggregation in 2025 Multiple developments in the sports betting sector will transform odds aggregation during the upcoming years. AI technology together with machine learning, will assume a more influential position to refine odds while delivering predictive information to betting customers. The growing decentralized betting market is creating increased adoption of blockchain technology which will produce transparent and fair odds generation. The expanding esports industry alongside virtual betting will escalate the need for adaptable odds aggregation solutions, and regulatory changes in crypto gambling will impact API security procedures. Conclusion Sportsbook operators within the crypto betting industry must select the perfect sports odds aggregator because it represents their most vital operational choice. A perfect sports odds API must deliver real-time precise betting information with crypto transaction support and blockchain encryption for security purposes. The competitive crypto betting market demands advanced odds aggregation technology to stay ahead since user demand for crypto-friendly platforms continues its upward trend. Sportsbook operators who integrate Odds88 solutions into their operations can provide their users with the best betting experience through competitive odds.

Key Metrics Predict A Strong Bounce,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/dogecoin-recovery-in-sight-key-metrics-predict-a-strong-bounce/,"After months of struggle in gathering momentum, Dogecoin (DOGE) might be about to undergo a dramatic price reversal. Monitoring the movements of the meme coin, analysts believe it has hit a turning point and might thus launch a quick comeback. The question at hand is whether Dogecoin can seize this opportunity and emerge from its decline, as key indicators are currently displaying bullish signals. Related Reading: Bitcoin And S&P Decline Together, But Data Predicts A Turnaround Analysts Spot Signs Of A Bottom Some analysts contend that Dogecoin has already reached its lowest price point, which could potentially lead to a rebound. A prominent crypto analyst, Trader Tardigrade, has observed that DOGE has been adhering to a long-term price channel. The overall pattern indicates that a bottom has likely formed, despite the fact that it has momentarily moved outside the channel’s boundary. #Dogecoin has been following this Macro Channel since its inception 🔥 Deviations have occurred at the channel’s edges historically. If $Doge remains within the channel without deviation this time, it has already reached the bottom 🚀 pic.twitter.com/fzDDW4HDqe — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) March 13, 2025 Other analysts noted that the TD Sequential indicator, which is used to predict trend reversals, has sent out a buy signal on Dogecoin’s daily chart. This indication has historically been linked to price gains, suggesting that DOGE might be about to enter an upward trend. Crucial Levels To Keep An Eye On Support and resistance levels will be critical in determining Dogecoin’s next moves. At the moment, the $0.16 level is showing signs that a support will emerge. Market observers believe that if the meme coin can keep a solid footing on this level, it could muster enough steam to rally toward much higher price targets. Under ideal conditions, some predictions suggest that Dogecoin may reach $2.74. Compared to its current state, this would represent a significant price hike. However, DOGE needs to surpass a number of resistance zones, including the $0.30 and $0.50 marks, before this can happen. Uptick In Market Activity Encourages Optimism Another element that is giving Dogecoin a good ounce of lift is the elevated market activity of the meme crypto. For instance, in a 24-hour span, the number of active wallets on the network jumped 270% and totaled 264,000 overall. Usually, an increase in this department indicates rising enthusiasm among consumers and investors. Meanwhile, significant investors, referred to as “whales,” have been acquiring DOGE at an accelerated rate. Whales accumulated 1.7 billion DOGE in their accounts over the past 72 hours. This level of accumulation suggests that significant stakeholders value Dogecoin at its present price. Related Reading: TRUMP Token Takedown—Did Insiders Plan The Crash?

The Minnesota Bitcoin Act is somewhat deceptively titled, however, as the bill refers to “Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies” throughout. The bill, while made public on March 14, is dated March 17. It makes no mention of any kind of reserve. The Minnesota bill is simple but comprehensive The proposals are fairly simple. The bill adds crypto to the list of investment options available to the State Board of Investment. It adds crypto to the list of forms of payment the state will accept. In addition, the bill allows cryptocurrency received to be subtracted from federal adjusted gross income and it excludes cryptocurrency gains from certain tax calculations. It will be introduced into the state senate by Republican Jeremy Miller. After that, the bill will be referred to that body’s State and Local Government Committee. Changes made under the act would become effective on either Dec. 31 or Jan. 1, 2026. Minnesota revised its legislation to incorporate updates to the Uniform Commercial Code, but has little oversight over cryptocurrency beyond that. The Department of Commerce requires cryptocurrency exchanges to be registered as money transmitters, which is a common practice among states. Minnesota also has a law protecting consumers who use cryptocurrency kiosks (ATMs), which was enacted in 2024. Minnesota lawmakers are divided on crypto on the federal level Although the state is hardly a crypto hub, Minnesota is the home of cryptocurrency proponent Tom Emmer, who has served in the U.S. House of Representatives since 2014. Emmer is the vice chair of the House Financial Services Committee Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Artificial Intelligence. Emmer reintroduced the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, aimed at preventing the United States from issuing a central bank digital currency, on March 6. He has been pushing the bill since 2022. A different version of it passed the House in 2024. U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order prohibiting federal agencies from establishing, issuing, or promoting CBDCs on Jan. 23. Emmer’s seven colleagues in the House are divided 4-3 in favor of crypto across party lines, according to Stand with Crypto. Its senators are firmly against it.
