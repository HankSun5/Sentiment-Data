With a 10% increase from January, the total supply now stands at almost $205 billion. The spike, according to data from Glassnode, comes after a dip in late 2024, when the supply of stablecoins fell from $187 billion to $185 billion. Related Reading: Bitcoin And S&P Decline Together, But Data Predicts A Turnaround Stablecoins See A Strong Rebound For trading cryptocurrencies, stablecoins—like USDT and USDC—often act as a reserve for investors expecting the right time to buy assets like Bitcoin. The most recent rise shows that investor interest has surged, especially in view of last year’s slow down. Since Jan 1, the aggregate #stablecoin supply has increased by $20.17B (+10.9%), now reaching more than $205B. For comparison, the December peak clocked in at $187B but the supply actually contracted in the last two weeks of 2024 and dropped to $185B by January 2025. pic.twitter.com/gQbdMEDisb — glassnode (@glassnode) March 13, 2025 Given the previous fall, this comeback is especially notable. For most of 2024 the market has been losing stablecoins; but, this trend has lately reversed. Although past patterns suggest that Bitcoin’s price may be impacted, it is unknown whether this increase will lead to a rise in purchases of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin Investors Watching Closely A growing stablecoin supply is often seen as a bullish sign for Bitcoin. Historically, the price of Bitcoin has risen in line with the stablecoin count. The reasoning is simple: more stablecoins mean more potential capital just waiting to be entered into the market. Some analysts believe this fresh injection could push Bitcoin higher. However, not all stablecoins are used for trading. Many are held for remittances, payments, or as a hedge against inflation, especially in countries where local currencies are unstable. As of today, the market cap of cryptocurrencies stood at $2.65 trillion. Chart: TradingView Stablecoin Exchange Holdings Drop 21% While the total supply is rising, only 21% of stablecoins are currently sitting on exchanges. This is a significant drop from 2021, when over 50% of the supply was available for immediate trading, Glassnode disclosed. This shift suggests that while new coins are being issued, they are not all being deployed into crypto markets right away. Related Reading: TRUMP Token Takedown—Did Insiders Plan The Crash? This could point to one of two possibilities: either stablecoins are being used more often outside of exchanges or investors are still waiting for the suitable moment. Should the latter prove right, the impact on Bitcoin could be less notable than expected. What This Means For Bitcoin’s Future The stablecoin market is currently experiencing a resurgence, which is generally a favorable development for the cryptocurrency sector. However, it is uncertain whether this will result in a short-term increase in the price of Bitcoin. Stablecoin utilization has fluctuated, and additional economic variables will contribute to this development. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at 82,264, down 1.1% and 6.9% in the daily and weekly frames.

The one exception is the category of analytics tokens, which is thriving in Q1. Most narrative tokens are down in 2025, driven by the overall stagnation of the altcoin market. Investors have lost their taste for risk, and for assets that may go down to zero, with no fundamental value. Most narratives, which peaked in late 2024, are now back to negative performance. The only exception is the class of analytics tokens, tied to data platforms or AI analytics tools. As the crypto market grows more complex, data and patterns are key to discovering the next viable trade or investment. This allowed analytics tokens to rally as the next possible type of project with real utility. Analytics tokens are the best-performing narrative in 2025. | Source: DeFi Llama According to DeFiLlama, analytics tokens have expanded by over 162% in the year to date, at one point reaching a high of 659% growth. Analytics is a relatively new category, which appeared after the proliferation of millions of new assets and thousands of trading pairs. The rise of a narrative does not mean a rally or liquidity for all tokens. The DeFiLlama narrative average covers a total of 84 analytics tokens, but the bulk of growth comes from the top projects. As with other categories of altcoins, traders remain selective and move into the most liquid assets with the potential of preserving their earnings. SQD was the leading analytics token with rapid growth, trending after its recent launch. SQD is trading at $0.08, still in early price discovery, rising by over 39% in the past 24 hours. DataBot is up over 21% on the day, trading at $0.0008. DATA is a relatively older token, trending now in one of its regular rallies. The third best performer is SoSoValue (SOSO), which recently bounced from its lows at $0.058. Analytics tokens can also outperform the market briefly, if some of the smaller niche assets have outsized rallies. Analytics sector expands with new token launches Analytics tokens combine data platform assets with projects that combine AI agents and on-chain data. Currently, the whole category is valued at over $2.3B, growing by 5.4% in the past 24 hours. Not all analytics tokens were noticed in the past few months. The sector became visible after some of the leading social media analytics accounts also launched tokens. The current leaders for the sector are KAITO and the native token of Bubblemaps, BMT. Both assets are still in their early stages following a recent airdrop. KAITO remains pressured by selling, but BMT was among the day’s top gainers. BMT expanded by over 30% in the past 24 hours to trade at $0.11. The analytics sector is also notable for setting expectations for additional airdrops. Some of the leading tools for on-chain analytics are closely watched for launching their own token. After Arkham, Kaito and Bubblemaps performed their airdrops, others are expected to follow. Analytics platforms offer a real user base and utility in navigating the thousands of tokens with both centralized and decentralized trading. The analytics space also includes The Graph (GRT), a token with years of history in previous bull markets. CookieDAO and ChainGPT are among the trending assets. Most of the analytics tools are pointed toward on-chain data, DEX activity and automated analysis. The analytics narrative thus combines tokens from other categories, carrying rebranded AI agents as well. Analytics tools are becoming more sophisticated, including on-chain data on whale wallets and trading activity. Other tools seek alpha in chats and social media content, sifting through trends too complex to discover and analyze for a human trader. As with other hot sectors, the success of several analytics tokens can lead to the creation of multiple copycat projects. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

A snippet of the S-1 filing was shared on social media on March 14 by Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, who has been closely monitoring developments in the crypto ETF industry. Source: James Seyffart The proposed VanEck Avalanche ETF intends to “reflect the performance of the price of “AVAX,” the native token of the Avalanche network, less the expenses of the Trust’s operations,” the prospectus read. The proposed fund will hold AVAX and will “value its Shares daily based on the reported MarketVector Avalanche Benchmark Rate,” the prospectus said. As Seyffart noted in a follow-up post, the Trust’s registration “was shared widely earlier this week, But this is the first actual filing with the SEC.” Avalanche is the 16th largest crypto asset, with a total market capitalization of $7.7 billion. The blockchain is notable for its high throughput and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility. Related: US Bitcoin ETFs break outflow streak with $13.3M inflow ETF race heats up The overwhelming success of the US spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) exchange-traded funds and the election of a pro-crypto administration in Washington have triggered an influx of crypto fund applications at the SEC. As Cointelegraph recently reported , nine issuers have filed for an XRP ( XRP ) ETF, with Franklin Templeton joining the race on March 11. Issuers are also vying to list ETFs linked to Solana ( SOL ), Litecoin ( LTC ) and Dogecoin ( DOGE ). Although the SEC has punted its decision on these offerings, opting to designate a longer period for review, Seyffart and fellow Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchinas say there are “relatively high odds of approval” later this year. A January report by JPMorgan said the approval of altcoin ETFs will likely trigger billions of dollars in inflows, underscoring the pent-up demand for cryptocurrencies. In particular, SOL and XRP products could attract the most institutional interest. Assuming modest adoption rates, SOL and XRP ETFs could attract billions in their first 12 months. Source: JPMorgan “When applying these so-called “adoption rates” to SOL and XRP, we see SOL attracting roughly $3 billion-$6 billion of net assets and XRP gathering $4 billion-$8 billion in net new assets,” the report said.

On March 14, the anonymous whale, referred to on X as “ETH 50x Big Guy,” took out long positions in LINK worth approximately $31 million with 10 times leverage, according to Lookonchain, a Web3 analytics service. He placed the bets on Hyplerliquid and GMX, two popular perpetuals exchanges, Lookonchain said in a March 14 X post. Additionally, the whale accumulated roughly $12 million in spot LINK. In the ensuing hours, the whale gradually reduced his LINK holdings through small swaps back into stablecoins, as per onchain data . Source: Lookonchain Related: Hyperliquid ups margin requirements after $4 million liquidation loss Massive trading gains On March 12, the unidentified trader intentionally liquidated a roughly $200 million ETH long position, causing Hyperliquid’s liquidity pool, HLP, to lose $4 million . The trader’s profits topped roughly $1.8 million. According to Lookonchain, the trader has earned nearly $17 million in the past month on Hyperliquid. The incident highlighted the challenges facing perpetual trading platforms such as Hyperliquid, which enable traders to take long or short positions many times larger than their deposited capital. Hyperliquid said the trader’s actions did not qualify as an exploit and were instead a predictable consequence of the mechanics of its trading platform under extreme conditions. In response to the losses, Hyperliquid announced on March 13 revised collateral rules for traders with open positions to guard against similar edge cases in the future. Launched in 2024, Hyperliquid’s flagship perpetuals exchange has captured 70% of the market share, surpassing rivals such as GMX and dYdX, according to a January report by asset manager VanEck. Chainlink, the most popular decentralized oracle service, saw the price of its native LINK token increase by more than 150% in the weeks after President Donald Trump prevailed in the US election. It has since given up much of those gains, declining from highs of nearly $30 per token in December to less than $14 as of March 14, according to data from CoinGecko. Chainlink’s market capitalization is currently around $8.7 billion.

Solayer ( LAYER ) is a blockchain network designed for high throughput and near-zero latency. The network bills itself as “infinitely scalable” and is designed to handle 1 million transactions per second (TPS). Explains the project, “Solayer is a protocol for developers who want to enhance their decentralize application’s performance on Solana. It aims to increase the reliability of network access while reducing associated costs by up to 50x.” Solayer’s new native token, LAYER, is trading at $1.21 at time of writing, up from $0.857 one week ago. The 216th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is also up more than 18% in the past 24 hours alone. LAYER launched in February. That same month, the Singapore-based crypto exchange Bitget and the Seychelles-based exchange MEXC both rolled out trading services for the asset. Earlier this month, the San Francisco-based exchange Kraken listed LAYER, and this week the Hong Kong-based HashKey Global also made the token available for traders. Despite LAYER’s gains this week, the asset remains more than 14% down from its all-time high of $1.41, which it set shortly after launching last month, according to data from CoinGecko .

Will the Uptrend Continue?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/why-has-bitcoin-rebounded-will-the-uptrend-continue/,"Bitcoin has surged over 4% in the past 24 hours, reaching above $84,000, according to cryptocurrency data provider CoinGecko. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap briefly touched $85,000 earlier in the day before pulling back. The rally coincided with a broader recovery in risk assets as markets responded positively to signs of macroeconomic stability and the apparent success of the U.S. government in averting a shutdown. Bitcoin’s rise reflects renewed confidence in financial markets, according to Strahinja Savic, head of data analysis at crypto consultancy FRNT Financial. “Some renewed macro stability suggests that Bitcoin and crypto are recovering alongside other risk assets,” Savic said in a Telegram message. “Lower-than-expected inflation figures and the perception that geopolitical risks are easing are contributing to easing macro concerns and providing a tailwind for Bitcoin.” He also noted that some Bitcoin investors are fueling the recovery by taking the opportunity to “buy the dip.” Related News: Is the Recovery in Solana (SOL) Permanent or Could Further Declines Be Coming? Analytics Firm Reveals Critical Points Bitcoin’s gains came after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer expressed support for a Republican measure to fund the government. A government shutdown could add further uncertainty to markets already grappling with concerns about stagflation, an economic scenario in which growth slows while inflation remains high. Risk assets have been under pressure for weeks due to trade war fears sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on major trading partners. Additional macroeconomic concerns, including the government's controversial cost-cutting measures, have also weighed on investor sentiment. The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index fell to its lowest level since 2022, signaling declining confidence in the U.S. economy. The survey also found that inflation expectations rose to their highest level in more than two years. Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto asset manager BitBull Capital, said the data is driving investors to Bitcoin as a hedge against economic uncertainty. He also noted that institutional confidence remains strong, with BlackRock resuming its Bitcoin purchases and making a $25 million investment. Despite the current bullish momentum, DiPasquale warned that volatility remains a concern and warned of potential significant corrections ahead. *This is not an investment recommendation.

The cryptocurrency market presents two enticing opportunities through ADA and XRP and MUTM stands out due to its high demand during the presale phase. Analysts have set out projections for ADA to reach $2 and XRP to achieve $10 and MUTM to surpass $5 while indicating that these tokens represent core investments for people desiring high return potential. Cardano (ADA) Nears Critical Development Milestones Organizational capital has started to gravitate toward Cardano due to the systematic development of its blockchain infrastructure which focuses on scalability improvements along with energy efficiency measures. ADA surpasses its former role as a speculative instrument because decentralized applications are spreading rapidly into finance and digital identity markets. Market experts predict ADA token value will extend to $2 in late 2025 provided the market shows expansion paths which parallel its growth trajectory. The long-term stability of Cardano receives increased validation from institutional stakeholders because of its compliance-oriented framework. Despite price swings ADA continues to demonstrate its capability as a solid asset in the pursuit of elevated market valuations because of its research-based value additions. Ripple (XRP) Navigates Resistance Amid Bullish Forecast The current resistance level of $2.10 hinders XRP price growth yet experts have positive expectations that it may rise to $10. Crypto strategist ElmoX has identified an important point where XRP could move to $1.20 before a potential parabolic rise requires breaking through $2.90. The market shows signs that regulatory explanations and enhanced inter-banking payment usage will together serve as motivational factors. The token shows fundamental strength through its successful rebound from important support points despite recent price drops. Bullish market activity that picks up speed following a correction may create conditions for XRP to replicate its previous upward patterns in moving past $10 while institutions and retail investors build their similar interests. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Momentum Sparks Frenzy Mutuum Finance (MUTM) establishes itself as a prominent decentralized finance project because its Phase 3 presale heads toward a complete sell-out. 5,500 investors purchased MUTM tokens which resulted in $3.2 million worth of investment while expanding the tokenholder base to 5,500. The price rise in Phase 4 to $0.025 will provide immediate profits of 25% to existing participants. The Tokenomics system presents a mathematical expansion blueprint where Phase 3 investors can expect 200% growth through a $0.06 listing price but the added $5 prediction represents an enormous 24,900% potential return. The lending model of Mutuum Finance that uses mtTokens for interest accrual together with its buy-and-distribute mechanism establishes ongoing demand for MUTM. The presale opportunities enable the first users to lock in positions that become more valuable when mainstream exchange listings bring greater market exposure. The fast growth of Phase 3 investments accelerates the time before the MUTM token at its current price of $0.02 will become unavailable. The price movements of Cardano alongside Ripple experience market complexities but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides investors with a current advantageous presale situation. The well-planned tokenomics system and practical DeFi uses make MUTM stand apart from many speculative protocols thus enabling it to deliver substantial value fluctuation. The upcoming MUTM presale stages present a scarce occasion for purchasing tokens ahead of market demand intensification during the future. Act Now Before Phase 3 Concludes Time is short for potential investors who want to enter Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at its current price point of $0.02. Delaying the purchase at this time could result in missing the current all-time low price which becomes available during Phase 4 as MUTM approaches its expected $5 value. Purchase your position now because an upcoming market increase is expected. Visit Mutuum Finance’s official website to participate before the next price hike.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, the top US-based crypto exchange platform by volume says that it has added the meme asset doginme ( DOGINME ) to its listing roadmap. Coinbase’s listing roadmap is used to increase transparency and to prevent the front-running of new tokens. Being added to the list means the crypto exchange is considering adding support for the asset soon. News of the addition sent DOGINME flying as the memecoin went from a low of $0.000366 on March 13th to a peak of $0.00106 just a day later. It has since retraced and is trading for $0.00091 at time of writing, a staggering gain of 106% during the last 24 hours. Doginme – which launched in February 2025 – was created by Dan Romero, the founder of the decentralized social media network Farcaster, when he was asked if he owned a dog, according to the crypto asset’s official website. “Doginme came to life in February 2024 when Farcaster founder Dan Romero (DWR) was asked if he owned a dog. DWR replied affirmatively: ‘No, but I got that dog in me.’ Extending far beyond our roots on Farcaster, doginme is now representative of the community’s collective efforts to embrace and embolden that dog in them.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Stone Sentenced to 45 Months for Fraud,https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-influencer-t-j-stone-sentenced-to-45-months-for-fraud/,"Key Takeaways: Crypto influencer faces a prison sentence for deceiving property and digital asset backers. The scheme unfolded over years using false business fronts and exploited personal ties. The case shows the risk of investing without independent verification. Thomas John Sfraga, known as T.J. Stone, was sentenced to 45 months in federal prison for wire fraud after defrauding real estate and cryptocurrency investors out of over $2 million, according to the U.S. Department of Justice on Friday. Brooklyn Podcaster and Cryptocurrency Personality Known as “T.J. Stone” Sentenced to 45 Months’ Imprisonment https://t.co/lbWYVDHqtz (Announced with @NewYorkFBI ) — US Attorney EDNY (@EDNYnews) March 14, 2025 According to a press release from the U.S. Department of Justice, Sfraga defrauded real estate and cryptocurrency investors out of more than $2 million. He was also ordered to forfeit $1,337,700, with restitution to be determined later. His sentencing took place in Brooklyn, presided over by U.S. District Judge Frederic Block. The case, led by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York and the FBI’s New York Field Office, exposed a years-long fraudulent scheme in which Sfraga exploited personal relationships and investor trust to fund a series of sham businesses. T.J. Stone’s Fraud Targeted Close Contacts U.S. Attorney John J. Durham condemned Sfraga’s actions, stating in a press release that he “stole from friends, neighbors, and even parents of children who played on sports teams with his own kids.” Sfraga ran fraudulent businesses, including Build Strong Homes LLC and Vandelay Contracting Corp.—a name referencing the fictional “Vandelay Industries” from Seinfeld. Under the alias “T.J. Stone,” he portrayed himself as a real estate developer, media personality, and cryptocurrency expert, even acting as an emcee at major crypto events in New York. Stone’s Fraudulent Activities Spanned Years Between 2016 and 2022, Sfraga convinced at least 17 victims in Brooklyn, Staten Island, and Long Island to invest in fraudulent ventures, including real estate flipping projects and cryptocurrency investments , promising returns of up to 60% in just three months. One of his schemes involved persuading a victim to lend him $100,000 for a construction project that did not exist. In another, he promoted a fictitious crypto “virtual wallet,” enticing victims with the prospect of high returns. Rather than investing the funds, Sfraga spent the money on personal expenses and used some to repay earlier victims in a Ponzi-style scheme. As authorities began investigating, Sfraga fled to Arizona and assumed a false identity. Law enforcement arrested him in Las Vegas after he failed to pay a bill at the Wynn Casino. The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney John Vagelatos, with support from Paralegal Specialist Madison Bates, culminating in Sfraga’s sentencing. The post Crypto Influencer T.J.

But the move has sparked fierce divisions within the Democratic Party over how to counter President Donald Trump's efforts to expand executive power. The Senate approved the funding package by a 62-38 vote, putting congressional Democrats in a position to give up what they see as their strongest leverage to curb Trump and billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk’s aggressive cost-cutting measures, which include drastically reducing the federal workforce and abolishing entire government agencies. With legislative options dwindling, opponents are expected to shift their efforts to legal challenges in the courts. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer played a critical role in the decision-making process. With less than 30 hours left before the shutdown, the veteran lawmaker announced he would drop his party’s hold on the spending bill, prioritizing the continuation of government services over political wrangling. Related News: Why Has Bitcoin Rebounded? Will the Uptrend Continue? Schumer’s reversal marks a significant victory for Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, paving the way for the spending measure’s final approval. The bill ensures Musk’s newly created Office of Government Efficiency retains the authority to make sweeping budget cuts while securing government funding through the fiscal year-end on Sept. 30. The political impasse coincides with turmoil in financial markets as Trump’s tariff policies have stoked widespread investor uncertainty. By Thursday, the S&P 500 had entered a correction, losing more than 10% in three weeks. But news that the Senate was making progress on the spending bill sparked a 2% recovery on Friday. Nine Democrats and one independent joined forces with nearly all Senate Republicans to pass the bill with a simple majority later in the day, passing the 60-vote threshold. *This is not investment advice.

This was after the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) published a report suggesting such talks had taken place. Details From The Statement Following the report’s release, Zhao addressed the claims in a March 13 post on X, stating, “I have had no discussions of a Binance US deal with … well, anyone.” The former Binance CEO explained that more than 20 people had told him they had been contacted by WSJ and another media outlet, who were attempting to verify whether he had struck a deal for clemency. The article alleged that Zhao was seeking a presidential pardon from Trump, which could allow him to take on an operational or management role at Binance. According to the WSJ, Binance approached Trump’s allies last year with a business proposal as part of its plan to strengthen its U.S. operations. Zhao denied these claims, suggesting that the report was politically motivated and intended as “an attack on the President and crypto.” He also asserted that “residual forces of the ‘war on crypto’ from the last administration are still at work.” CZ, who served time after pleading guilty to violating U.S. anti-money laundering laws, noted that he is the only individual in U.S. history to receive a prison sentence for a single Bank Secrecy Act violation. “No felon would mind a pardon,” he said, adding that he remains dedicated to advancing cryptocurrency both in the U.S. and globally. Implication of CZ’s Possible Return In November 2023, Binance settled with U.S. authorities, agreeing to pay $4.3 billion in fines. As part of the agreement, Zhao pleaded guilty to failing to implement an effective anti-money laundering program at the exchange. The company also committed to fully exiting the United States market. CZ later resigned as CEO, with reports indicating that he was permanently barred from operating or managing Binance under the terms of the settlement. A presidential pardon would possibly change the platform’s ability to conduct business in the country. Since Trump took office, his administration has taken a more supportive stance on digital assets, reversing the strict regulatory approach of the previous government. Under acting Chair Mark Uyeda, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has softened its enforcement efforts against crypto firms. Several high-profile cases, including those involving Binance and Coinbase , have been paused or dropped.

LIBRA Memecoin Scandal The request, made by prosecutor Gregorio Dalbón, reviewed by Fortune, accuses Davis of being a key figure behind the LIBRA memecoin. The token gained significant attention after President Milei endorsed it on Valentine’s Day. Following Milei’s endorsement, LIBRA’s market capitalization soared to over $4.5 billion. However, its value quickly collapsed, plummeting by more than 99% to approximately $18 million. Blockchain analysts later revealed that certain insiders sold large amounts of the token shortly after Milei publicly supported it. Related Reading: Solana Price Crash To $90? Why A 26% Decline Could Rock This Crypto In his request for the Red Notice, Dalbón expressed concerns that Davis might evade justice, citing his financial resources that could facilitate his flight or concealment. “The possibility that Davis will abandon his country of residence or hide to avoid answering for his alleged acts appears to be aggravated by the economic resources he possesses,” Dalbón stated, emphasizing the urgency of the situation. Interpol, the International Criminal Police Organization, facilitates international cooperation among law enforcement agencies in its 196 member countries, including the US and Argentina. A Red Notice serves as a request for member countries to locate and provisionally arrest individuals pending extradition. Federal Investigation Launched Into Javier Milei’s Endorsement Davis has not publicly responded to the allegations, nor have his family members, including his brother Gideon and father Charles, who are involved in their family crypto venture, Kelsier Ventures, Fortune reported. Yet, the controversy surrounding LIBRA is further complicated by its connection to former President Donald Trump, who recently launched his own memecoin named TRUMP. Trump’s endorsement of cryptocurrency has been characterized as part of his broader strategy to position himself as a pro-crypto advocate. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bottom Confirmed? Data Shows 87.5% Chance The Worst Is Over Following Milei’s endorsement, Davis openly acknowledged his role as an advisor to the Argentine president, stating, “I am indeed Javier Milei’s advisor.” He also claimed responsibility for the launch of a separate memecoin associated with Melania Trump. The fallout from the LIBRA launch has prompted legal inquiries, including a federal investigation into Milei’s actions. Both Milei and Davis have denied any wrongdoing, but the political implications of this incident are significant, as it raises questions about the accountability and regulation of cryptocurrencies in Argentina. At the time of writing, the memecoin is trading at $0.060, down over 90% from its all-time high reached on Valentine’s Day.

This decision has approved the collapsed hedge fund liquidators’ increase in the claim against FTX from $120 million to a massive $1.53 billion. This new development could affect how FTX’s remaining assets are shared and impact creditors who are still waiting for their payouts. 3AC’s Uncovers $1.53 Billion Loss in FTX Collapse Three Arrows Capital was once a big name in the crypto industry, managing over $3 billion before collapsing in 2022. Its downfall shook the crypto market, exposing major financial problems. At the time, it had strong financial ties to FTX, which also went bankrupt later that year after fraud accusations against its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried. In July 2023, 3AC’s liquidators filed a claim for $120 million, thinking that was what FTX owed them. Fast-forward to November 2024, and they found new evidence showing that FTX had actually liquidated $1.53 billion of 3AC’s assets just two weeks before 3AC collapsed. This discovery changed everything. FTX’s Defense Falls Apart in Court FTX argued that liquidating 3AC’s assets was justified because the company owed it $1.3 billion as loan collateral. However, the court ruled that FTX did not have enough proof to support this claim, allowing 3AC to increase its claim to a huge amount. Meanwhile, FTX emphasized that it had already started paying creditors and argued that 3AC’s claim came too late. However, the court said the delay was understandable since 3AC’s liquidators had trouble accessing financial records. The judge said the lack of help from 3AC’s founders, Zhu Su and Kyle Davies, made it even harder to uncover the full claim earlier. When 3AC collapsed, its founders also ran into legal trouble. Zhu Su was jailed four months in Singapore for refusing to cooperate with liquidators, while Kyle Davies avoided legal consequences. In 2023, they tried to return to the crypto scene by launching OPNX, a platform for trading bankruptcy claims, but it shut down in early 2025. What’s Next for FTX Creditors? With the court’s recent decision, 3AC’s liquidators have a much bigger position in FTX’s bankruptcy case. This raises questions about how the larger claim will affect payments to other FTX creditors, as another repayment round should start by May 30. Many also wonder whether 3AC will actually recover the full $1.53 billion. This raises concerns about hidden financial dealings between 3AC and FTX, making the case even more complicated. Meanwhile, Sam Bankman-Fried is trying to appeal his 25-year prison sentence, adding more uncertainty to one of the biggest bankruptcy cases in crypto history.

Creative displays and digital experiments offered fresh views on asset use. The event connected tech experts with everyday users. The crypto sector had a small presence at South By Southwest (SXSW) this year. However, a few standout panels and marketing campaigns managed to make an impact. SXSW has been a tech, music, and film festival held in Austin, Texas, since 1987. While brands and creators have focused on non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in recent years, crypto companies arrived at SXSW 2025 with a focus on mainstream adoption. Bitcoin-Themed Drone Show Lights Up Austin Sky A highlight of SXSW 2025 was Gemini’s record-breaking drone show . The US-based exchange set a Guinness World Record on March 13 by deploying 1,000 drones to create the largest-ever aerial display of a currency symbol, forming the Bitcoin (BTC) logo over Austin. The drone show also featured images of spaceships, an astronaut placing flags on Mars, and a woolly mammoth. In case y’all missed it… I just watched the BEST drone show of my life here at SXSW, with a world breaking record for the largest currency symbol in the sky, Bitcoin!! Thank you @Gemini for this absolutely incredible experience that I watched from my balcony!!! Go where… pic.twitter.com/yP4tPWGe1N — Rachel Wolfson (@Rachelwolf00) March 14, 2025 Olivia Santarelli, head of marketing for Gemini, told Cryptonews at SXSW that the 1,000 drone show was meant to share the story of Gemini’s “Go Where Dollars Won’t” campaign. Gemini launched the “Go Where Dollars Won’t” campaign in November 2024. It featured a woolly mammoth image in a series of Gemini ad placements illustrated by Matt Griffin, a renowned multimedia artist best known for his work on Dune, Dune 2, and Star Wars. “The drone show was meant to tell the story of the ‘Mars Safari,’ which is one of the featured images in our ‘Go Where Dollars Won’t’ campaign,” Santarelli said. “The campaign portrays a future where the world can use cryptocurrency. The audience at SXSW was able to see that Bitcoin is a global currency.” Record-breaking Bitcoin logo at SXSW 2025 in Austin. / Source: Gemini Santarelli added that Gemini wanted to host the Bitcoin-themed drone show at SXSW due to its broad audience, many of whom may already be familiar with crypto. “We really wanted to do this at SXSW this year because the audience has probably heard a lot about crypto, and the drone show is a way for them to experience Gemini and crypto differently from social media or the news,” she remarked. “I hope this served as another touch point to help people learn more about cryptocurrency.” The world-record-breaking drone show concluded with a giant QR code in the sky for 30 seconds. The QR code led to Gemini’s website, offering $50 in BTC for trades of $100 or more. “This call-to-action allows people to invest in a small amount of crypto while earning crypto back,” Santarelli said. Coinbase Discusses Crypto Security Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase also had a presence at SXSW this year. Philip Martin, chief security officer for Coinbase, spoke about risks of online financial scams on a panel titled, “ Tech-Wide Battle Against Online Fraud .” Philip Martin speaking about security at SXSW 2025. Source: Coinbase Martin told Cryptonews that he was joined by one of Coinbase’s “Tech Against Scams” coalition partners, Match Group, along with a former FBI agent, to walk the audience through how fraudsters operate across online platforms. “We discussed how bad actors carry out long-term, high-reward financial scams that rely on trust and relationship-building – also known as social engineering scams,” Martin said. Martin added that it’s important to identify the warning signs and know how to report these types of crimes. “Everyone who attended our panel at SXSW knows someone who can be vulnerable to online scams,” he said. “Our goal was for the audience to go home and discuss this with their parents, their grandparents, and anyone else who might be at risk.” Martin further remarked that it was important for Coinbase to be a part of the conversation at SXSW in an effort to educate the general public on how to stay safe against scams. “If the byproduct of the panel was that attendees walked away from our session feeling more knowledgeable and confident in using crypto safely, then I would consider that a win,” he stated. Decentralized Social Media Gains Attention In addition to leading crypto exchanges, a number of Web3-focused companies and content creators attended this year’s SXSW. Solo Ceesay, co-founder and CEO of Calaxy, told Cryptonews at SXSW that the event was an opportunity to connect with Web2 creators who may be interested in exploring decentralized platforms . “Many creators continue to push for decentralization, but creators remain beholden to platforms like X or Instagram and TikTok,” Ceesay said. “Calaxy took the stage at SXSW to push an alternative platform, where creators can build their own tribe and monetize in a place built around a crypto wallet that enables easy value transfer.” Ceesay also announced the launch of a new fund at SXSW that is designed to propel 50 content creators into the Web3 social media revolution. “The recipients, known as the Calaxy Class of 2025, will each receive $20,000, along with milestone-based incentives and sustainable monetization opportunities within the Calaxy ecosystem,” Ceesay said. SXSW attracted a number of Web2 content creators this year, and Ceesay mentioned the event was an opportunity to introduce mainstream audiences to the crypto sector. AI and Blockchain Discussed Violetta Zironi, a singer-songwriter who inscribed a song on the Bitcoin blockchain , told Cryptonews at SXSW that while artificial intelligence (AI) dominated discussions, blockchain played an essential role in digital ownership. “The panel I was on was called ‘Building Music Communities with and Around XR Technology,’ where we spoke a lot about AI,” Zironi said. “However, I made it a point to explain how blockchain is the infrastructure needed to verify everything built around AI.” Zironi added that while blockchain was not a hot topic of discussion at SXSW, she believes it’s an essential part of the conversations that took place throughout the event. Beyond Speculation: Crypto’s Shift Toward Utility For years, crypto’s presence at major events leaned on price speculation and technological hype. At SXSW 2025, the focus shifted toward something more practical: security, education, and creative applications. Gemini’s drone show, Coinbase’s panel on scams, and Calaxy’s push for decentralized social media all underscored a growing effort to make crypto useful rather than just exciting. If the industry continues down this path, it may find that mainstream adoption isn’t about chasing trends but about solving real-world problems. Whether audiences at SXSW left as believers or skeptics, they were given something far more tangible to consider. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are the broader implications of crypto firms focusing on education and safety at events like SXSW? These sessions show a shift toward simplifying digital assets while tackling online risks. They build practical skills and user confidence, fostering an inclusive method for managing digital finance securely. How does the focus on decentralized social media at SXSW add value to crypto discussions? Emphasizing decentralized social media introduces alternative digital spaces for content creation. It spurs broader engagement, allowing users to explore asset management through community-led online networks. What future trends in digital finance might we expect following SXSW’s focus on crypto education and creative outreach? Future trends may include more interactive learning events and live digital displays that blend finance with art. These initiatives could drive wider user familiarity and reshape public views on digital asset use.

US intelligence federal agencies like the CIA, NSA, and FBI, which had presented the firm as a key asset to government officials, were also seemingly alarmed by Marquis-Boire’s past indiscretions. Marquis-Boire was first accused of sexual assault in 2017 and had to take a step back from the public Marquis-Boire sexual assault accusations first surfaced in 2017, with multiple women coming forward. The allegations at the time forced him to retreat from the public eye for some time. Moreover, several companies had even distanced themselves from him, including the interdisciplinary laboratory Citizen Lab. Citizen Lab even openly criticised the growing “toxic culture of sexual discrimination, harassment, and violence” in the tech industry. After several companies cut ties with him, Marquis-Boire reportedly helped start and develop Unciphered in secret using the pseudonym “Frank Davidson.” The company’s employees only found out about his involvement in the firm’s development towards the end of 2023. For the last four years, however, Unciphered has built up a good reputation, specializing in cracking encrypted wallets to recover lost crypto funds. Even high-profile cybersecurity figures, including former NSA general counsel Stewart Baker and security expert Chris Wysopal, took an interest in the company. Employees doubted whether Marquis-Boire left the company completely in 2024 However, Marquis-Boire’s revealed connections to the company raised concerns about the firm’s reputation and image. The company’s employees especially raised alarms over Marquis-Boire’s past, not wanting to be tied to the man’s past actions and ruin their professional reputations. Jon Ellch, a former FBI cybersecurity expert, even asked for the company to drop Marquis-Boire. Following multiple other complaints, CEO Eric Michaud resigned, and Marquis-Boire left the company. However, even after he left the company, employees were still concerned about his lingering connections to the firm. In early 2024, a package addressed to him was delivered to Unciphered’s San Francisco office, renewing fears about his continued influence. Nevertheless, the company’s administration quickly reassured its workers that Marquis-Boire’s shares were all bought out in February 2024, and he was no longer involved with the company Meanwhile, in response to the controversy, Unciphered took down all employee names from its website for security reasons.

The broader crypto market remains under stress, with fear dominating sentiment and keeping ETH from regaining momentum. Related Reading: Dogecoin Network Activity Surges 47% In A Month – What’s Next for DOGE? The downturn is largely driven by macroeconomic uncertainty and escalating trade war fears, which have shaken both crypto and the U.S. stock markets. As investors brace for further volatility, some fear that the market is setting up for a deeper correction. However, not all analysts are bearish. Some believe that a recovery could be on the horizon in the coming months, especially if technical indicators begin to show strength. Top analyst Daan shared insights on X, revealing that Ethereum has been consolidating since the major sell-off and has formed a falling wedge pattern—a bullish formation that could indicate a local trend reversal. For now, ETH remains at risk of further declines, but if this pattern plays out, Ethereum could soon break out of its consolidation range and start building momentum for a recovery. The next few weeks will be crucial in determining whether ETH can stabilize or if more downside is ahead. Ethereum Falling Wedge Could Signal a Reversal Ethereum has lost over 57% of its value, creating a challenging environment for bulls as selling pressure continues. ETH is now trading below a multi-year support level, which has flipped into strong resistance. As long as Ethereum remains below the $1,900–$2,000 range, bulls will struggle to regain momentum, keeping bearish sentiment intact. The entire crypto market has mirrored this weakness, experiencing a significant breakdown alongside the U.S. stock market. Global trade war fears and uncertainty surrounding U.S. President Trump’s policies have further fueled the sell-off in risk assets. Since the U.S. elections in November 2024, macroeconomic volatility and rising uncertainty have driven markets lower. With the U.S. stock market hitting its lowest levels since September 2024, investors remain on edge, questioning if Ethereum has further downside ahead. Despite this bleak outlook, there is some optimism. Daan’s insights suggest that Ethereum has been consolidating since the major drop and has formed a falling wedge pattern. This bullish formation could lead to a local trend reversal if ETH breaks out and holds above resistance. For this potential recovery to materialize, ETH must break above the white zone and reclaim $2,000. If this happens, bulls could start testing higher levels and build momentum for a broader market recovery. However, the ETH/BTC ratio remains near multi-year lows, showing only minor resilience in recent days. Sustained strength is needed before a real reversal can take place. Related Reading: Ethereum Net Taker Volume Signals Huge Selling Pressure – Can Bulls Hold Key Levels? With Ethereum still struggling, the next few weeks will be crucial in determining whether this falling wedge breakout can lead to a meaningful rally or if the downtrend will continue. Bulls Struggle Around $1,900 Ethereum is currently trading at $1,900, after days of struggling below the crucial $2,000 mark. Bulls have lost control, and ETH is now at its lowest levels since October 2023, reflecting the broader market uncertainty and ongoing bearish sentiment. With macroeconomic volatility and trade war fears weighing heavily on risk assets, Ethereum continues to face selling pressure, making it difficult for bulls to build momentum for a recovery. The longer ETH stays below $2,000, the stronger the resistance at this level becomes, pushing buyers further out of the market. For Ethereum to avoid deeper losses, bulls must reclaim the $2,000 mark as soon as possible and establish it as a new support level. A break and hold above this threshold could trigger a recovery rally, allowing ETH to test higher resistance zones. However, losing current levels would leave ETH vulnerable to another drop, potentially retesting support near $1,750 or lower. Related Reading: Bitcoin Lost And Retested The 200-Day MA As Resistance – Here’s What Happened Last Time The next few days will be critical, as bulls need to step in and defend current demand to prevent further downside.

While the market marvels at this growth in the Sonic price, most savvy investors are also stacking up FloppyPepe (FPPE) , which is making headlines as the most promising meme coin to buy in anticipation of the much-anticipated crypto bull run. Sonic Price Prepares For A Massive Rebound As Network Metrics Rise After the Fantom blockchain rebranded to Sonic (S), the Sonic price has seen significant gains. It peaked at $0.95 last month, just shy of its $1.03 all-time high (ATH). Experts attribute this sudden price surge to the altcoin season hype, and many are optimistic that the Sonic price will soon reclaim previous highs. Notably, one market analyst, Crypto Kindle, says that Sonic price is on a bullish trend and is outperforming again. The price is currently sitting at a local resistance level, aiming to break to new levels after successfully breaking out of its previous downtrend. Aside from its impressive price performance, the Sonic (S) network boasts over 10,000 transactions per second (TPS) with sub-second finality—a standout feature that has caught the market’s eye. The Sonic (S) network has adopted a new developer model that grants builders 90% of fees. This model spiked its Total Value Locked (TVL) to $745 million, marking a major milestone, as it has increased by 220% since January. FloppyPepe (FPPE): Best Bet For Big Gains In The Expected Bull Run Among the new promising cryptocurrencies in the space, the Sonic price and FloppyPepe (FPPE) are set for a major rise, driven by their respective utility and community backing.

Unlike traditional meme coins that rely solely on hype, FloppyPepe (FPPE) stands out with a 1% burn mechanism , which reduces supply and increases its value over time. Another standout feature of FloppyPepe (FPPE) is its reward distribution model. With every transaction, this meme coin redistributes 3% to token holders, providing an added incentive for long-term participation. Beyond its profit-driven structure, FloppyPepe (FPPE) offers real utilities that set it apart from typical meme coins. One of its standout features is the integration of AI tools designed to help investors stay ahead of market trends. The FloppyAI , for instance, particularly guarantees that investors and community members receive instant, accurate responses about tokenomics, roadmap milestones, and market trends. Interestingly, this FloppyAI agent has been integrated across Telegram, Twitter (X), and the FloppyPepe (FPPE) website, making it accessible to both token holders and new investors looking to explore its capabilities and stay ahead of the crypto bull run. Meanwhile, the Meme-o-Matic machine, which is already live on Telegram, allows users to create quality memes through AI text prompts. These AI tools position FloppyPepe (FPPE) as an intelligent meme coin with long-term growth potential, whether or not a crypto bull run influences it. While most savvy investors believe the Sonic price will surge and give them some returns, most are hedging with FloppyPepe (FPPE), which offers higher ROIs with a low presale price of $0.0000002 . Even top analysts like Crypto Chino and NASS CRYPTO have endorsed it as the most profitable coin ahead of the crypto bull run. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Is A Must-Buy Due to attractive and lucrative opportunities FloppyPepe (FPPE) has to offer, the meme coin has raised over $1.2 million just three weeks into its presale.

The DOJ says former Bank of America employee Rongjian Li was a member of a money laundering and drug trafficking outfit headed by Jin Hua Zhang. According to prosecutors, Li used his position at the bank from 2021 through 2022 to help the criminal organization open several accounts. Zhang’s organization then used the BofA accounts, some of which were registered using forged passports, to launder illicit funds. “As part of his involvement, when the bank’s financial auditing systems flagged or froze accounts for suspicious activity, Li helped Zhang circumvent the bank’s anti-money laundering protocols and move illicit funds elsewhere. In addition, Li was observed sitting next to Zhang at a dinner in New York, where Zhang discussed the different fee percentages he charged various criminal groups for drug trafficking and scams.” Zhang’s organization is believed to have laundered millions of dollars in a span of months, according to the DOJ. “The investigation revealed that, for a fee, Zhang laundered bulk cash for drug dealers and laundered profits from other illegal businesses.

The sports betting industry needs efficient sports odds aggregators as sportsbooks continue to incorporate crypto payment methods. Sportsbook operators can utilize these platforms to retrieve betting odds from various sources in real time, ensuring users receive current and competitive wagering options. The selection of a quality sports odds API is essential because it determines a sportsbook’s performance and also influences user loyalty, financial outcomes, and system stability. The article goes over premium odds aggregation features in crypto-friendly betting platforms and explores the impact of modern technology on future sports wagering. Digital wagering solutions are analyzed in detail at Crypto Intelligence , where readers can access the latest trends in crypto gambling and sports betting technology. The Importance of Sports Odds Aggregators for Crypto Sportsbooks The competitive crypto gambling market requires platforms to provide immediate access to odds from various sporting events for their betting customers. Traditional sportsbooks have long used odds aggregation to improve their betting options, but crypto-friendly sportsbooks face three main challenges: decentralized transactions, market volatility, and regulatory uncertainties. A reliable sports odds aggregation system allows sportsbooks to instantly compare odds from multiple platforms by integrating both fiat and cryptocurrency data, thereby building user trust. As the sports betting industry transitions to digital assets, operators must choose aggregators that support crypto transactions and incorporate blockchain security, features that are now essential. The integration of a trustworthy odds API becomes essential because operators who do not implement it will lose ground to competitors who provide better betting experiences based on secure data-driven platforms. Key Factors to Consider When Choosing a Sports Odds Aggregator The selection of an appropriate sports odds aggregator depends on multiple important factors for assessment. Crypto sports betting demands precise real-time data because odds change quickly during betting sessions. Top aggregators rely on fast data streams and AI-driven analysis to continuously update odds in real time. For optimal security and seamless, delay-free crypto payment transactions, API integration with payment gateways must be flawless. Security and compliance stand as essential factors in the industry, so top aggregators use blockchain encryption together with 2FA and anti-fraud protection systems. Following regulations provides legal stability to operations. Sportsbooks gain better user satisfaction through customization because they can adjust odds and betting limits and market options to specific preferences. A design that embraces user-friendliness enables better customer commitment both during initial engagement and for continued use. Maximizing profits in sports betting increasingly depends on AI analytics, which provide predictive sports predictions, personalized betting guidance, and effective risk optimization. The Impact of Sports Odds Aggregators on Crypto-Friendly Sportsbooks Crypto sportsbooks differ from traditional bookmakers in that they incorporate decentralized finance (DeFi) principles throughout their operations. Every component of betting operations must function at high speed with robust security and transparency. A dependable sports odds aggregator enables crypto-friendly betting platforms to update their odds instantly, an essential feature given the constant price volatility of digital assets. The efficient operation of an odds API eliminates betting rate differences to stop users from placing wagers with old prices. The acceptance of multiple currencies through wagering support becomes possible because leading odds aggregators enable sportsbooks to work with various cryptocurrencies and stablecoins which expands their betting audience worldwide. Blockchain-based odds aggregation provides transparent betting records that prevent data tampering while reducing concerns about data manipulation. The system establishes confidence levels that benefit both gamblers and oversight organizations. Selecting the Best Sports Odds API Provider Sportsbook operators need to perform thorough assessments of multiple odds aggregation services that exist in the market. Sports betting technology includes reputable companies such as Odds88 that provides both sportsbook-compatible real-time odds aggregation and API solutions. Their platform delivers sportsbook operators an advanced API that provides smooth integration and real-time betting updates, and extensive market coverage. The Future of Sports Betting and Odds Aggregation in 2025 Multiple developments in the sports betting sector will transform odds aggregation during the upcoming years. AI technology together with machine learning, will assume a more influential position to refine odds while delivering predictive information to betting customers. The growing decentralized betting market is creating increased adoption of blockchain technology which will produce transparent and fair odds generation. The expanding esports industry alongside virtual betting will escalate the need for adaptable odds aggregation solutions, and regulatory changes in crypto gambling will impact API security procedures. Conclusion Sportsbook operators within the crypto betting industry must select the perfect sports odds aggregator because it represents their most vital operational choice. A perfect sports odds API must deliver real-time precise betting information with crypto transaction support and blockchain encryption for security purposes. The competitive crypto betting market demands advanced odds aggregation technology to stay ahead since user demand for crypto-friendly platforms continues its upward trend. Sportsbook operators who integrate Odds88 solutions into their operations can provide their users with the best betting experience through competitive odds.

After severe downtrend, the SOL price found support at $114 level and has since witnessed a brief uptick. The price of Solana has declined by nearly 50% since its January high, when Donald Trump’s meme coin was introduced, due to the network’s transaction volumes and fees being affected by the meme coin winter. Since reaching its high in December of last year, the market cap of meme coins has decreased by 65.2%, and the price of most assets in this category has dropped to levels seen before the election or even lower. Because of the large number of transactions they facilitate, meme coins play a crucial role in the Solana ecosystem. Having said that, the majority of these assets have seen substantial declines since the beginning of the year. Bulls Striving Hard At the time of writing, SOL is trading at $134.41, up 8.91% in the last 24 hours as per data from CMC. Moreover, the trading volume is up 9.75%. The price surge follows general uptick in the overall crypto market with Bitcoin regaining the $84k mark. Despite the recent uptick, the SOL price is still down 4.15% in the last 7 days. After severe downtrend, the SOL price found support at $114 level and has since witnessed a brief uptick. The pace of SOL is increasing on the hourly chart after a breach of the $130 local barrier. It is still too soon to tell whether the recent price respite for Solana represents a sustained bounce or just a pump. The uptrend should likely extend to the $140 region, if the bulls can maintain their newly-won advantage. Breaking above $140 level should likely propel the SOL price towards $153 resistance level. However, if the price falls below the $124 mark, then it will likely retest $114 support level.",Editors News|Investing News|Altcoin|Solana,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BTC,"{'name': 'The News Crypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thenewscrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thenewscrypto,2025-03-15 00:23:29

Key Metrics Predict A Strong Bounce,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/dogecoin-recovery-in-sight-key-metrics-predict-a-strong-bounce/,"After months of struggle in gathering momentum, Dogecoin (DOGE) might be about to undergo a dramatic price reversal. Monitoring the movements of the meme coin, analysts believe it has hit a turning point and might thus launch a quick comeback. The question at hand is whether Dogecoin can seize this opportunity and emerge from its decline, as key indicators are currently displaying bullish signals. Related Reading: Bitcoin And S&P Decline Together, But Data Predicts A Turnaround Analysts Spot Signs Of A Bottom Some analysts contend that Dogecoin has already reached its lowest price point, which could potentially lead to a rebound. A prominent crypto analyst, Trader Tardigrade, has observed that DOGE has been adhering to a long-term price channel. The overall pattern indicates that a bottom has likely formed, despite the fact that it has momentarily moved outside the channel’s boundary. #Dogecoin has been following this Macro Channel since its inception 🔥 Deviations have occurred at the channel’s edges historically. If $Doge remains within the channel without deviation this time, it has already reached the bottom 🚀 pic.twitter.com/fzDDW4HDqe — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) March 13, 2025 Other analysts noted that the TD Sequential indicator, which is used to predict trend reversals, has sent out a buy signal on Dogecoin’s daily chart. This indication has historically been linked to price gains, suggesting that DOGE might be about to enter an upward trend. Crucial Levels To Keep An Eye On Support and resistance levels will be critical in determining Dogecoin’s next moves. At the moment, the $0.16 level is showing signs that a support will emerge. Market observers believe that if the meme coin can keep a solid footing on this level, it could muster enough steam to rally toward much higher price targets. Under ideal conditions, some predictions suggest that Dogecoin may reach $2.74. Compared to its current state, this would represent a significant price hike. However, DOGE needs to surpass a number of resistance zones, including the $0.30 and $0.50 marks, before this can happen. Uptick In Market Activity Encourages Optimism Another element that is giving Dogecoin a good ounce of lift is the elevated market activity of the meme crypto. For instance, in a 24-hour span, the number of active wallets on the network jumped 270% and totaled 264,000 overall. Usually, an increase in this department indicates rising enthusiasm among consumers and investors. Meanwhile, significant investors, referred to as “whales,” have been acquiring DOGE at an accelerated rate. Whales accumulated 1.7 billion DOGE in their accounts over the past 72 hours. This level of accumulation suggests that significant stakeholders value Dogecoin at its present price. Related Reading: TRUMP Token Takedown—Did Insiders Plan The Crash?

The Minnesota Bitcoin Act is somewhat deceptively titled, however, as the bill refers to “Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies” throughout. The bill, while made public on March 14, is dated March 17. It makes no mention of any kind of reserve. The Minnesota bill is simple but comprehensive The proposals are fairly simple. The bill adds crypto to the list of investment options available to the State Board of Investment. It adds crypto to the list of forms of payment the state will accept. In addition, the bill allows cryptocurrency received to be subtracted from federal adjusted gross income and it excludes cryptocurrency gains from certain tax calculations. It will be introduced into the state senate by Republican Jeremy Miller. After that, the bill will be referred to that body’s State and Local Government Committee. Changes made under the act would become effective on either Dec. 31 or Jan. 1, 2026. Minnesota revised its legislation to incorporate updates to the Uniform Commercial Code, but has little oversight over cryptocurrency beyond that. The Department of Commerce requires cryptocurrency exchanges to be registered as money transmitters, which is a common practice among states. Minnesota also has a law protecting consumers who use cryptocurrency kiosks (ATMs), which was enacted in 2024. Minnesota lawmakers are divided on crypto on the federal level Although the state is hardly a crypto hub, Minnesota is the home of cryptocurrency proponent Tom Emmer, who has served in the U.S. House of Representatives since 2014. Emmer is the vice chair of the House Financial Services Committee Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Artificial Intelligence. Emmer reintroduced the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, aimed at preventing the United States from issuing a central bank digital currency, on March 6. He has been pushing the bill since 2022. A different version of it passed the House in 2024. U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order prohibiting federal agencies from establishing, issuing, or promoting CBDCs on Jan. 23. Emmer’s seven colleagues in the House are divided 4-3 in favor of crypto across party lines, according to Stand with Crypto. Its senators are firmly against it.

This marks the firm’s first attempt at an AVAX-focused ETF, adding to its recent efforts in niche investment products. The registration statement filed on Friday noted: “The Trust’s investment objective is to reflect the performance of the price of ‘AVAX,’ the native token of the Avalanche network, less the expenses of the Trust’s operations.” VanEck registered for the ETF in Delaware this past week for what’s believed to be the first AVAX ETF. “Notably — the trust registration was shared widely on this earlier this week,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart on Friday in a post on X. “But this is the first actual filing with the SEC.” VanEck joins the crypto ETF race with first-ever avalanche (AVAX) filing Following Bitcoin’s remarkable rally, investment firms are increasingly rolling out new products aimed at investors who are looking for the next breakout token. Applications for exchange-traded funds have shot up since Gary Gensler stepped down as SEC Chair. A number of companies have applied to the SEC for approval for different crypto ETFs, such as SOL, XRP, DOGE, and LTC. The previous administration saw the SEC approve the listing of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 and spot Ethereum ETFs in July. However, AVAX and the expanded ETF market are presently weighted down by bearish sentiment. The SEC’s approval, however, may not result in inflows until market conditions improve. Today brought the first-ever Avalanche ETF, as VanEck filed for the product. In recent months, VanEck has played around with various experimental ETF constructions. In January, the firm submitted an ETF based on crypto exchanges, mining firms, and payment gateways. If approved, this particular fund would invest in a collection of various crypto companies. VanEck might explore a couple of ETF types, but its Avalanche product could still be a long shot. T he filing sparked a more than 4% uptick in AVAX’s price, suggesting potential bullish momentum. Crypto ETFs face headwinds as market struggles The current market cycle for the crypto ETF industry has been brutal. Bitcoin ETFs have now been subject to five straight weeks of net outflows, and Ethereum funds have similarly been subjected to institutional skepticism. At the same time, the SEC has delayed decisions on several submissions, including Solana and XRP ETFs. With no clear relief in sight, concerns around a potential U.S. recession continue to fuel bearish sentiment across the crypto space. Even if VanEck’s AVAX ETF secures SEC approval, its immediate market appeal may be limited, though it could prove valuable in the long run. The regulatory watchdog has signalled a more friendly approach to the industry. In a matter of just a few weeks, the agency has rescinded controversial crypto accounting guidance, dropped enforcement actions against major crypto industry players, created a crypto task force and issued a meme coin statement.

Crypto sell-off in an effort to prevent conflict of interest The memorandum said “significant steps” were taken to reduce potential conflicts of interest before Sacks began his tenure as the White House AI and crypto czar — in which a major part of his role is to help create a legal framework for the crypto industry. Sacks offloaded all the “liquid cryptocurrency” in his portfolio, as well as Craft Ventures' portfolio — the investment firm he co-founded in 2017 — including holdings in Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ether ( ETH ), and Solana ( SOL ) before US President Donald Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20. The memorandum outlined which cryptocurrencies and crypto-related stocks David Sacks sold prior to Trump’s inauguration. Source: The White House Since Trump’s inauguration, the crypto market has seen a major decline amid a broader market downturn, with many blaming Trump’s proposed tariffs and uncertainty over US interest rates. While Bitcoin tapped a new all-time high of $109,000 just hours before Trump was sworn in as the 47th US president, it recently dipped below $80,000 on Feb. 27 , erasing all post-election gains. At the time of publication, Bitcoin is trading at $84,155, as per CoinMarketCap data. Sacks also divested from publicly traded crypto-related firms, including Coinbase (COIN), Robinhood (HOOD), and stakes in private digital asset companies. Additionally, he sold his limited partner interest in Solana-focused Multichain Capital and crypto-focused venture capital firm Blockchain Capital. At the same time, Craft Ventures offloaded its holdings in Multichain Capital and Bitwise Asset Management. Sen. Warren urged Sacks to prove he no longer holds crypto The memorandum is dated one day before Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren urged Sacks in a March 6 letter to prove he no longer holds any digital assets, following Sacks’ claim in an X post that he sold off all his crypto. “Despite your public statements via X, it remains unclear exactly when you personally divested from BTC, ETH, and SOL, when Craft Ventures divested from Bitwise, and whether people close to you ‘may have held positions and sold into the recent price surge,” Warren said. Since Sacks started the White House crypto role, he has been a vocal advocate on various issues in the crypto industry, from the importance of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to not over-taxing the crypto industry. Related: Bitcoin panic selling costs new investors $100M in 6 weeks — Research Sacks recently shut down the idea of crypto transaction taxes on an episode of the All In Podcast after host Jason Calacanis proposed charging a 0.01% tax on every cryptocurrency transaction. “That’s always how taxes start. They are described as being very modest,” Sacks said. “You know, when the income tax started, it only applied to like a thousand Americans, and the legislators swore up and down that it would never be applied to middle-class people,” Sacks added.

Key technical indicators on the XRP/USD weekly charts show critical levels XRP price must cross to hit $20 if the ETF filings are approved. Ripple (XRP) surges 5% as SEC Settlement Talks Begin Rippple (XRP) price jumped 5% to reclaim the $2.3 support level following reports that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could classify XRP as a commodity in its ongoing legal battle with Ripple Labs. This development comes as part of a potential settlement framework that could remove regulatory barriers surrounding XRP ETF approval. XRP price action | XRPUSDT On March 14, sources close to the negotiations revealed that SEC officials are discussing whether to treat XRP similarly to Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are already considered commodities under U.S. law. If XRP secures commodity status, it could facilitate the approval of an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF), a move that has driven speculation among investors. Crypto market analysts note that an official SEC statement confirming XRP’s commodity classification could act as a catalyst for a major price rally. The last time similar speculation surfaced, XRP price surged from $0.90 to $3.1 in under two months. If the SEC provides regulatory clarity soon, XRP could test resistance levels at $3.50 and $5 before eyeing a more ambitious target at $20. When Could the US SEC Approve XRP ETF? The timeline for an XRP ETF approval hinges on several key regulatory developments. The SEC is currently reviewing multiple crypto ETF applications, including those for Ethereum and XRP, amid increasing pressure from institutional investors seeking diversified exposure to digital assets. Industry experts predict that an XRP ETF could gain approval in late Q3 or early Q4 of 2025, depending on how Ripple’s legal battle unfolds. If Ripple successfully secures commodity status for XRP and resolves the SEC lawsuit through a settlement, the regulatory pathway for an XRP ETF could become significantly clearer. XRP ETF Fillings in Progress as of March 12, 2025 | Source: Cointelegraph Historically, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 triggered a wave of institutional inflows that pushed BTC price to new all-time highs. A similar scenario could unfold for XRP if the SEC greenlights a dedicated ETF product. Analysts project that an XRP ETF could attract over $5 billion in inflows within the first few months, potentially pushing XRP price towards $10 in the short term and $20 in a prolonged bullish cycle. With growing institutional interest and positive regulatory momentum, XRP remains one of the top contenders for the next big ETF approval. The next major catalysts to watch include upcoming court rulings in the Ripple vs. SEC case and further statements from SEC Chair Gary Gensler on the regulatory framework for crypto-based ETFs. XRP Price Forecast 2025: Is $20 a viable target? XRP price is consolidating around $2.38 after retracing from its recent high of $3.10, with technical indicators signaling a potential move toward the $20 target by 2025. The Bollinger Bands on the monthly chart show an expansion phase, suggesting increased volatility, while the price remains above the midline support, indicating sustained bullish momentum. The MACD histogram continues to trend positively, confirming strong upward momentum, though the signal line crossing above 0.23 warrants caution. XRP Price Forecast 2025 A bullish scenario unfolds if XRP reclaims the $2.57 resistance and maintains a monthly close above this level. This would confirm support at the upper Bollinger Band, allowing for a continuation toward the next psychological resistance at $5, where historical sell pressure previously emerged. If buying pressure sustains through 2024, a breakout above $5 could pave the way for a parabolic rise, with Fibonacci extensions pointing to $10 and beyond, fueled by ETF speculation and increased institutional adoption. Conversely, a bearish divergence in MACD or a failure to hold $2.00 as support could signal a deeper correction. A breakdown below $1.90 would expose XRP to downside risks, potentially testing the $1.00 psychological floor before a renewed uptrend. However, given the current technical setup, the path of least resistance remains upward.

The market expert Patrick Bet-David predicts XRP prices will reach $100 if SWIFT picks up 5% of its transactions and subsequent universal adoption pushes prices to $1,000. The latest phase of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is at $0.02 and anticipates a remarkable 15,354% price surge following its launch. XRP’s path of growth depends on regulatory rights and institutional adoption but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) uses its practical DeFi features to create active market interest leading to better returns than Bitcoin according to seasonal forecasts. XRP’s Ascent Hinges on Market Shifts XRP has gained 6% after experiencing a rough week with a 10% reduction in value to reach its current trading price at $2.20. The success of XRP Ledger depends on SWIFT processing volume rates which need extraordinary institutional support to materialize. The prospective SEC resolution and new stablecoin RLUSD stand as main forces behind market changes although analysts maintain doubts about their immediate impact. Franklin Templeton submitted a filing to launch an XRP exchange-traded fund while increasing XRP network user activity although the token price currently rests at 80% less than its 2018 high. Integrated commentary indicates that reaching $1,000 probably seems impossible right now yet advancing from $100 to $1 could establish meaningful change within international financial operations. Mutuum Finance Gains Momentum Real-world usage of MUTM trumped widespread speculations by designating its lending model to produce buy pressure through organic means. Presale the project reached $3.2 million an is currently priced at $0.02. Overall, investments are from over 5,500 holders as they anticipate Phase 4 to bring a $0.025 price level. The listing price of $0.06 shapes the Tokenomics model which guarantees Phase 3 participants will achieve 200% gains. Experts expect Mutuum Finance’s tokens to reach $3.07 following its launch resulting from its revenue-dependent purchase mechanism and_mtToken model which builds interest through time. Strategic Tokenomics Drive Demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) reduces token price volatility through its usage-based price mechanism. Part of protocol fees used to buy MUTM tokens on open markets provides stakers with redistributed tokens while maintaining market demand. MUTM maintains its position as a liquidity center through this preventative system together with overcollateralized loans and peer-to-peer lending operations. Investors who purchased MUTM tokens as low as $0.02 at the presale phase would reach a maximum gain of 200% in the beginning but could potentially earn a 2900% return through conservative market targets of $0.060. The presale experienced swift purchasing growth that indicates urgency because Phase 3 distribution levels fall before exchange listings start. A Calculated Opportunity Emerges MUTM provides immediate opportunities for investors since its performance remains independent of macroeconomic events which impact XRP. The presale framework employs a different strategy from speculative tokens because its approach provides clear pricing steps powered by real-world applications and accounting for specific increments. The market opportunity for investors to acquire MUTM at $0.02 price becomes more restricted as Phase 4 approaches and institutional investors show increased interest. Investors who value measurable growth above abstract projections should consider MUTM’s dual appeal of DeFi innovation along with mathematical advantages because the combination represents a hard-to-find asymmetric investment opportunity. Mutuum Finance demonstrates the evolution of decentralized finance by merging lending markets while giving financial rewards to those who enter early. The Ripple (XRP) raises its goals whereas MUTM develops its presale process faster. The price of Secure tokens stands at $0.02 during this phase so investors can secure them now before the upcoming market increase while anticipating over 15,000% profit growth in 2025. Presently you can sign up for Phase 3 at Mutuum Finance through their official website.

This consolidation phase often serves as a launching pad for a potential upward move as buyers step in. Traders are now eyeing key resistance levels, which, if broken, could trigger a short-term rally. As the crypto market shows signs of recovery, DOT’s technical setup and fundamentals suggest that a bullish breakout might be on the horizon. Could this be the start of a fresh rally for Polkadot? Market Sentiment Improves As Polkadot Holds Steady DOT is exhibiting resilience as it continues to hold firm above the $3.5 support zone, signaling a potential shift in market sentiment. This stability is a positive sign, suggesting that selling pressure is subsiding, allowing bullish momentum to build gradually. The market’s confidence in Polkadot appears to be improving, as reflected by steady buying interest and a noticeable slowdown in bearish activity. Related Reading: Polkadot Price Crisis: Further Losses Incoming After DOT Falls Under $4.8 Moreover, DOT’s resilience amid broader market shifts highlights its ability to attract demand at current levels. If market sentiment continues to improve, an upward push could be imminent. However, a decisive move above key resistance levels is needed to confirm a sustained recovery and prevent prolonged consolidation or a possible retracement. A key bullish signal emerges from the MACD indicator, which is gradually rising toward the average, hinting at a potential shift in momentum. This upward movement suggests that bearish pressure is fading, allowing buyers to regain control and build confidence in a possible trend reversal. As the MACD line approaches the average, buying interest has risen, which could translate into a stronger push toward higher price levels. If this trend continues, it may serve as an early indication of a breakout attempt. Short-Term Rally Or Fakeout? Key Levels To Monitor Polkadot’s price stability has sparked hopes for a short-term rally, but traders remain cautious about the possibility of a fakeout. Key resistance and support levels will be crucial in determining the next move. Related Reading: Polkadot Rebounds Slowly As Oversold Conditions Ignite Bullish Hopes A breakout above the $4.8 resistance level could serve as a strong confirmation of upside momentum, signaling increased buyer interest. Should this level be successfully breached, DOT may gain the necessary traction to push higher, targeting the resistance zones at $6.2 and $7.7. However, failure to sustain upward movement may indicate a lack of strong buying pressure, leading to a retracement toward $3.5. Monitoring price action around critical levels, volume, and technical indicators will be essential in assessing whether Polkadot is gearing up for a true breakout or merely experiencing a temporary uptick.

Strategic investments today could yield 100x returns by 2026. Trump’s Election Victory Sparks Renewed Altcoin Demand Demand for crypto assets spiked after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election in November 2024. While prices have retraced since his inauguration, institutional demand—one of the key forces behind last year’s rally—has only grown. Since the start of 2025, several altcoins have been targeted by U.S.-based corporate investors. Firms are racing to list altcoin ETFs as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) has relaxed its stance on crypto under the Trump administration. Litecoin ETF Approval Odds, March, 14 2025 | Source: Polymarket More so, the recent departure of Gary Gensler has led to the rollback of multiple regulatory sanctions, with the SEC dropping existing charges against Coinbase, Robinhood, Ripple (XRP), and Uniswap. This policy shift has significantly increased the likelihood of multiple altcoin ETFs receiving approval, further fueling institutional interest. According to Polymarket data , crypto bettors are now pricing in 70% chance of Litecoin ETF approvals, with similar odds inferred for all other altcoin with filings in progress. Here are five altcoins that could deliver astronomical returns as institutional adoption accelerates. 1. Cardano (ADA) Cardano has maintained its reputation as one of the most secure and decentralized proof-of-stake (PoS) networks. With growing enterprise adoption and strategic partnerships in Africa and Latin America, ADA is a prime candidate for institutional investment. If the SEC approves an ADA ETF, price discovery could push Cardano to new all-time highs. Cardano Price Action With ADA price currently trading at $0.7401, a move to $740.10 could turn a $100 investment into $100,000. 2. Solana (SOL) Solana has dominated the Layer-1 race, boasting lightning-fast transactions, low fees, and an expanding ecosystem. Recent partnerships with Visa and Shopify have strengthened its position as a leader in real-world blockchain applications. If institutions begin allocating large capital to SOL-based ETFs, a parabolic price surge is inevitable. Solana (SOL) Price Action With Solana price currently trading at $133.18, a move to $133,180 could turn a $100 investment into $100,000. 3. Litecoin (LTC) Litecoin has long been considered the silver to Bitcoin’s gold. With its strong security, low transaction fees, and recent privacy upgrades, LTC remains a favorite for institutional investors seeking a reliable store of value. The approval of an LTC ETF could trigger substantial price appreciation. Litecoin price action With Litecoin price currently trading at $91, a move to $91,000 could turn a $100 investment into $100,000. 4. Hedera (HBAR) Price Action Hedera Hashgraph is backed by major corporations, including Google, IBM, and Boeing. Its energy-efficient consensus mechanism and high-speed transactions make it an ideal choice for institutional adoption. With governments and enterprises integrating Hedera for tokenization and CBDCs, HBAR has massive upside potential. Hedera (HBAR) Price Action With Hedera price currently trading at $0.19, a move to $195 could turn a $100 investment into $100,000. 5. Aptos (APT) – The Next-Gen Blockchain Infrastructure Aptos, developed by ex-Meta engineers, is gaining traction as a high-performance Layer-1 blockchain designed for mass adoption. Its parallel execution engine enables unmatched scalability, making it attractive for institutions looking beyond Ethereum and Solana. With corporate backing growing, APT is a top pick for explosive growth. Aptos price action With Aptos price currently trading at $5.29, a move to $5,290 could turn a $100 investment into $100,000. Summary: With institutional capital flowing into crypto and regulatory hurdles fading, the next bull cycle is set to be historic. Smart investors positioning themselves in high-upside altcoins today could witness 100x gains by 2026. As the ETF narrative unfolds, Cardano, Solana, Litecoin, Hedera, and Aptos are poised for considerable growth as the year unfolds.

Meanwhile, XYZVerse Defies Market Trends With Massive Buying Momentum!",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/are-chainlink-and-pi-network-prices-about-to-surge-meanwhile-xyzverse-defies-market-trends-with-massive-buying-momentum/,"Signs point to significant shifts in the values of Chainlink and Pi Network tokens, hinting at possible upcoming price hikes. Meanwhile, XYZVerse is catching the eye by moving against the general market trends, showing strong buying interest. This piece explores the reasons behind these developments and what they could mean for those involved in digital currencies. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it’s attracting both sports fans and crypto enthusiasts, creating a unique crossover that’s gaining serious traction. With a strong presale and an engaged community, some investors are already eyeing major potential gains. More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.003333 by Stage 12, with over 70% of the $15 million milestone already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a final presale target price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” Of course, in crypto, nothing is guaranteed, but the excitement is undeniable. Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing that separates XYZVerse from the pack is the platform’s community engagement. Recently the team introduced the Ambassador Program, allowing users to earn free tokens by helping the project. And that’s only the beginning — major sports celebrities are already in discussions to help increase visibility. By unifying traditional sports fans with the fast-moving world of crypto, XYZVerse is creating something unique — something engaging and entertaining, not simply a way to win or lose. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With an ongoing presale, a dedicated community, and an ambitious vision, XYZVerse is generating buzz! Those components suggest serious potential. Although this case highlights the volatility of the crypto market, it is also perceived as an opportunity for many to have an early investment in something that could amount to a fortune in the future. The presale isn’t going to be around forever — so if you’re interested, now may be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Chainlink: Bridging Blockchain and Real-World Data Chainlink Bridge The gap between smart contracts and the real world This enables smart contracts to react to events outside the blockchain. Chainlink is a decentralized network of oracles that deliver reliable data with reputation scores to help ensure accuracy. When smart contracts run, they require real data; these oracles collect, verify and reliably transmit data to inviolable contracts. One of the standout projects in the crypto market today is Chainlink, which connects blockchain technology to the outside world and resolves a major issue that many aggressively marketed cryptocurrency has trouble solving — generating tangible use cases. With the increase in blockchain adoption, there will be an increasing requirement for reliable data, thus making LINK tokens a very good investment. A vital currency for builders, but it also goes beyond that into one of the most important technologies for decentralized applications of the future. Pi Network: Mining Cryptocurrency on Your Phone Made Easy Launched in 2019 by graduates of Stanford, Pi Network makes it easy to mine cryptocurrency on mobile phones. Users can mine Pi coins with little energy consumption, logging in daily from their smartphones to mine coins. Pi Network operates off of an expansive series of small, personal networks based on the notion of trust amongst peers, using the low-energy Stellar Consensus Protocol rather than the PoW systems used in the traditional model. It is now mainnet, although closed, with plans to open it as the users are vetted for identity verification in the future. By now, Pi Network’s aim is to be for the cryptocurrency available for everyone and build a strong community that may distinguish it from any other cryptocurrency in the world of Crypto. Conclusion Although Chainlink (LINK) and Pi Network (PI) provide different solutions to target various pain points and has great potential, XYZVerse (XYZ) shouldn’t be overlooked as it also has the upcoming sports-centric meme ecosystem alongside promising growth.

In the constantly evolving world of digital assets, Qubetics is emerging as a leader in offering tangible solutions that go beyond speculation. Alongside it, coins like Quant (QNT) and Toncoin (TON) have been making significant strides, each presenting unique opportunities for community members. This article dives deep into these three projects and explores their current updates, market performance, and their potential to reshape the future of finance. In the realm of real-world asset tokenization, Qubetics is setting the stage for what many believe will be the future of business and finance. From tokenizing real estate properties to simplifying complex financial transactions, Qubetics provides a seamless way for individuals, businesses, and professionals to access a more transparent and efficient digital economy. Let’s explore the latest updates on these three projects and why Qubetics is the best crypto under a penny for those looking to jump into an asset that promises both utility and future growth. Qubetics: Real-World Asset Tokenization Meets Blockchain Innovation Qubetics is revolutionizing the concept of digital asset ownership. By offering a marketplace for tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs), Qubetics solves a fundamental issue that many blockchain projects have struggled with: providing practical, real-life utility to the average user. For example, imagine tokenizing physical assets like real estate, art, or even rare collectibles. With Qubetics, businesses can now leverage blockchain technology to create fractional ownership of physical assets, making investments more accessible and transparent. The platform’s real world asset tokenization marketplace has the potential to disrupt industries ranging from real estate to finance. This technology will allow participants to easily trade shares of assets, thereby opening up markets that were previously reserved for the elite. As a result, even small businesses and everyday individuals will have access to new forms of capital, all while ensuring complete security and traceability through blockchain. Qubetics is already gaining momentum, with over $15 million raised in its presale and more than 23,000 token holders. The token price currently sits at $0.1074, but projections suggest that it could see a massive 831% return if it hits $1 after the presale ends. For community members who want to get in early, the crypto presale offers one of the best crypto opportunities under a penny. Qubetics is positioning itself as the best crypto under a penny for anyone looking to get into a groundbreaking project with real-world applications. Quant (QNT): Blockchain Interoperability Pioneer Quant (QNT) continues to redefine how blockchains communicate with one another. With the Quant Overledger, this platform allows different blockchain networks to work together seamlessly. Unlike other projects that focus on single-chain solutions, Quant focuses on enabling cross-chain interoperability, which is crucial as the blockchain ecosystem grows and diversifies. The project is seeing steady growth, with its market performance showing a 1.16% increase as of March 14, 2025. As of now, Quant is priced at approximately ₹6,622.22, reflecting the community’s trust in its long-term viability. With growing adoption across industries, Quant could serve as the backbone for enterprises seeking to integrate blockchain technology without the restrictions of siloed networks. While Quant’s ecosystem continues to expand, the technology’s potential to bridge traditional finance with blockchain-based solutions is one of its most exciting attributes. The project’s ongoing updates and developments position it as a strong contender in the crypto space, especially for professionals and businesses aiming for seamless blockchain integrations. Toncoin (TON): DeFi and Beyond Toncoin has faced its fair share of price volatility, with fluctuations ranging between $1.50 and $6.00. Despite these ups and downs, Toncoin remains a noteworthy player, especially with the TON Foundation’s recent launch of a 5 million Toncoin DeFi Incentive Program. This initiative aims to enhance the liquidity and adoption of USDt-TON pairs within Toncoin’s DeFi ecosystem, making it an attractive option for those seeking liquidity solutions within the space. However, Toncoin’s current challenge is a significant portion of its addresses being in loss territory. Despite this, the TON Foundation’s efforts to boost adoption and facilitate growth within the DeFi sector showcase Toncoin’s determination to recover and expand. As the project seeks to enhance its market position, participants may find opportunities to gain exposure to Toncoin at a discounted price, depending on market conditions. Toncoin’s current focus on decentralized finance highlights the shift toward community-driven ecosystems, making it a valuable asset for those looking to diversify their portfolios. Conclusion: Seizing the Future with Qubetics When it comes to the best crypto under a penny , Qubetics stands out due to its focus on real-world solutions and its potential to reshape digital finance. While Quant and Toncoin provide innovative blockchain solutions in their own right, Qubetics offers something unique—a bridge between the physical and digital world. Through its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace, Qubetics is providing businesses and individuals with new opportunities that other platforms simply cannot match. For community members looking for long-term value, getting in on Qubetics’ presale at such an early stage offers a chance for significant returns, with the potential for over 9,000% ROI upon mainnet launch.

If approved by the SEC, it would be the first-ever ETF tied to AVAX, marking a significant step for both the fund and the broader crypto space. “The Trust’s investment objective is to reflect the performance of the price of ‘AVAX,’ the native token of the Avalanche network, less the expenses of the Trust’s operations,” the filing noted. The VanEck Avalanche ETF will directly hold AVAX and determine its share value based on the MarketVector Avalanche Benchmark Rate. This rate combines pricing data from the five largest trading platforms, as identified in CCData’s exchange benchmark report. Analysts Place High Odds Of Approval James Seyffart from Bloomberg Intelligence stated on Friday that although the VanEck Avalanche ETF had been widely discussed earlier this week, this is the first official filing with the SEC. Besides, Several firms are seeking the SEC’s approval for different types of cryptocurrency ETFs, such as ones tracking SOL (Solana), XRP (Ripple), DOGE (Dogecoin), and LTC (Litecoin). Bloomberg ETF analysts have given a 90% chance of approval for a Litecoin-based ETF, while XRP and Solana have lower odds. Avalanche’s strong track record, including its role in Franklin Templeton’s tokenized fund, could help boost its chances for approval. Positive Regulatory Shift This push comes after the SEC approved the listing of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 and spot Ethereum ETFs in July 2024 under the previous administration, signaling a shift toward more crypto-related investment products being allowed in the market. In just a few weeks, the agency reversed its controversial crypto accounting rules, dropped enforcement actions against major crypto players, created a crypto task force, and even issued a statement on memecoins. This shift indicates a more open approach to the crypto space.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,REGULATION|AVAX|DOGE|LTC|SOL|XRP|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-15 02:41:18

Arctic Pablo Is Among the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now,https://thecoinrise.com/floki-inus-early-day-hype-faded-arctic-pablo-is-among-the-top-new-meme-coins-to-invest-in-now/,"Once upon a time, Floki Inu was the undisputed king of meme coin hype. A wild ride fueled by Elon Musk tweets and a devoted community saw Floki Inu explode onto the crypto scene, promising investors riches beyond their wildest dreams. Its early investors raked in astronomical gains, turning tiny investments into six and seven-figure fortunes. But as the dust settled and the hype cooled, many latecomers were left holding the bag. The once-thriving frenzy surrounding Floki Inu has waned, leaving crypto enthusiasts searching for the next big thing. If you missed out on Floki Inu’s early days and regret not getting in at those rock-bottom prices, there’s a fresh opportunity knocking at the door. Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) isn’t just another meme coin—it’s an entire experience, a thrilling adventure set in the mystical, ice-covered lands of the Arctic.

Right now, it’s stationed at Frosty Falls, the 14th location in its journey, with a jaw-dropping potential ROI of 10,694.59%. This is the kind of early entry point investors dream about.

Armed with sheer determination and a snowmobile, he carves through icy landscapes, unearthing the legendary Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC). These aren’t just any tokens—they are mystical artifacts infused with the power of forgotten lands, ready to bring wealth to those who dare to claim them. Right now, Arctic Pablo Coin is stationed at Frosty Falls, the 14th location in its journey.

With a total raise of over $1.88 million, this expedition is gaining serious momentum. The presale isn’t just a way to buy tokens—it’s an immersive experience. Unlike Floki, where external endorsements drove the hype, Arctic Pablo is all about the journey. Each week, Pablo advances to a new location, and the price of $APC rises with him. Investors who get in now can potentially see over 10,694.59% returns by the time the presale concludes. But that’s not all.

The 66% APY staking program allows investors to earn substantial passive income while securing their place in the Arctic Pablo ecosystem. With its unique approach, deflationary mechanism, and compelling narrative, Arctic Pablo isn’t just another meme coin—it’s an adventure. The hype is just beginning; those who seize this opportunity could see life-changing gains. It is one of the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now. Floki Inu: The Rise, the Hype, and the Fizzle Floki Inu entered the market as part of the wave of dog-themed meme coins that followed Dogecoin’s success. With a powerful narrative tied to Elon Musk’s dog and a name straight out of Viking mythology, Floki Inu quickly built a dedicated following. Early investors saw exponential gains as the coin surged in value, leveraging aggressive marketing campaigns, celebrity endorsements, and strategic partnerships to fuel its ascent. At its peak, Floki Inu’s market cap soared into the billions, and investors who got in at the ground floor celebrated life-changing gains. However, as the crypto space evolved, the hype that once propelled Floki Inu began to wane. The market’s appetite for new and exciting meme coins led investors to fresh opportunities, leaving Floki struggling to maintain its former glory. Despite various ecosystem developments, including FlokiFi and its metaverse Valhalla, the magic that once made Floki Inu a must-have investment isn’t as potent as it once was. Those who missed the early train are left wondering if there’s a new, high-reward opportunity out there. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, the era of Floki Inu’s explosive gains may be over, but the search for the next top-performing meme coin continues. Arctic Pablo Coin has everything investors look for in an early-stage meme project—scarcity, staking rewards, a unique narrative, and an engaged community. Right now, the window of opportunity is still wide open, but it won’t last long. With the price set to rise every week and unsold tokens permanently burned, waiting too long could mean missing out on a potential 100x opportunity. If you’ve ever regretted not getting into Floki Inu early, don’t make the same mistake twice. Join the Arctic Pablo meme coin presale now and be part of the greatest meme coin adventure of 2025.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are beginning to bounce off an important Fibonacci level, and Solana is still showing a short-term bullish divergence. However, XRP is breaking out above a critical resistance zone. Currently, XRP continues to face bearish pressure, particularly on the 3-day time frame. The chart reveals a significant bearish divergence, suggesting that a sustained bullish momentum is not likely in the near future. According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, this signal on the larger time frames indicates that a major upward movement is not expected. However, short-term bullish movements remain possible. Recent Price Movements and Support Levels XRP has recently bounced off key support levels, particularly between $1.95 and $2.25. For several hours, the price struggled to break past a short-term resistance zone in the $2.25 to $2.30 range. However, a positive shift occurred with a confirmed breakout, as the price closed above $2.30 on an 8-hour candle, signaling a potential short-term bullish trend. Resistance Levels to Watch Looking ahead, the next key resistance levels for XRP are expected to be between $2.65 and $2.80. If the price continues to rise, additional resistance may appear near the $3 mark. In the short term, potential resistance could be seen around $2.50 and $2.38–$2.40, as previous support zones could now act as resistance. Bitcoin’s Influence on XRP Price To predict XRP’s price movements more accurately, monitoring Bitcoin’s price trends is crucial. If Bitcoin experiences short-term bullish relief, XRP and many altcoins are likely to follow suit.

Why the Market Crashed Despite the President’s Crypto Support,https://dailyhodl.com/2025/03/14/trump-to-the-rescue-why-the-market-crashed-despite-the-presidents-crypto-support/,"HodlX Guest Post Submit Your Post At the beginning of 2025, Donald Trump’s return to power led to a sharp revision of the government’s crypto policy and explosive market movements. The Trump administration declared a pro-crypto stance, from establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve to softening the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) positions. However, instead of a prolonged rally, the Web 3.0 industry faced volatility and liquidity outflows. Why did the market drop despite expectations of support The key question is why the crypto market declined when many believed that a pro-Republican administration would drive growth instead. The effect of unmet expectations According to experts, the market had already priced in the ‘best-case scenario.’ When the anticipated multi-billion-dollar government Bitcoin purchases turned out to be mere verbal commitments with no actual buying, traders rushed to take profits. Essentially, the classic rule of ‘buy the rumor, sell the news’ played out. However, the government fund did not start purchasing BTC , removing a strong hypothetical growth driver and instead triggering a sell-off. Institutional investors used the rally to exit Large funds began selling BTC and ETH futures as early as February 2025, locking in profits from December 2024’s peaks. By March, this trend had intensified. The futures curve flipped into backwardation (futures prices falling below spot prices) – a typical signal of declining capital inflows. The broader macroeconomic landscape triggered the market decline Simultaneously, Trump launched a trade confrontation, announcing 25% tariffs on Mexican imports and 50% on Canadian imports starting in March. This sparked economic concerns – t reasury yields dropped, and the S&P 500 index retreated to post-election lows. Cryptocurrencies – as risk assets – also came under pressure, further intensified by news of a Bybit hack. Analysts note that macroeconomic factors were the primary driver of March’s price decline, overshadowing any positive sentiment from Trump’s actions. As a result, while the new president’s policies were officially more crypto-friendly, they did not immediately bring a liquidity influx. Instead, speculative excitement gave way to a correction phase. Which Web 3.0 projects were affected A hit to funds and liquidity The first weeks of March saw significant capital outflows from the crypto market , impacting funds, exchange-traded products and decentralized finance (DeFi). In the last week of February, investors withdrew a record $2.6 billion from US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) – the largest weekly outflow since their inception. This capital flight caused the total cryptocurrency market capitalization to shrink from approximately $3.7 trillion in December to $3.1 trillion by the end of February. The DeFi sector took a blow TVL (total value locked) in DeFi protocols declined by roughly $45 billion over the winter. The growth accumulated after Trump’s election – with TVL reaching $138 billion by December – completely evaporated. By March 10, TVL had fallen to $92.6 billion, returning to early November levels. Crypto hedge funds and arbitrage traders suffered losses Crypto hedge funds and arbitrage traders faced heavy losses as market structure changes disrupted their strategies. First, the popular ‘cash-and-carry’ arbitrage between futures and spot markets disappeared. Previously, funds profited from a positive basis by going long on spot BTC – including through ETFs – while shorting futures, earning returns higher than Treasury yields. However, as the market fell, futures prices dropped below spot prices, collapsing the basis and rendering this arbitrage unprofitable. Funds specializing in altcoins were also hit hard. In early March, an anomaly occurred – Bitcoin initially declined more than most altcoins, causing BTC dominance in total market capitalization to drop by five percentage points within a week. This temporary capital rotation into altcoins – as investors sought higher returns in less liquid assets before a major summit – could have severely impacted funds with poorly calibrated risk models. However, after the summit, altcoins crashed at an even faster rate, pushing BTC’s dominance back to approximately 61%. Investment outflows and capital flow shifts By March, it became clear – c rypto ecosystem capital flows had reversed. Institutional investors and funds were pulling out, falling prices triggered margin liquidations and arbitrage unwinding and retail investors were scared off by high volatility. All of this reduced available funding for Web 3.0 startups. Venture capital investments, already declining in 2024, fell even further in early 2025. Additionally, regulatory uncertainty remains high. While the SEC has eased its crackdown, no concrete new rules have been enacted yet. A stablecoin regulation bill is expected in August, raising concerns about potential strict oversight for DeFi and stablecoin-related projects. This creates a stressful environment for Web 3.0 businesses, requiring founders to take proactive steps to safeguard their projects. What should Web 3.0 founders do right now Given the current landscape, founders should plan for two phases – stabilization and growth. In the stabilization phase, the key priorities are preserving resources, maintaining the team, refining the product and satisfying existing users. Founders must avoid unnecessary risk. Now is not the time for speculative bets or reckless treasury management. Instead, focus on achievable short-term goals – delivering promised features, fixing issues and improving UX. This will help maintain and grow an active user base, attracting investors when they return. During the growth phase, as the market rebounds, scaling ahead of competitors will be crucial. This means having a well-prepared strategy for acquiring users and capital. For example, if you’re running a DeFi protocol, plan a liquidity mining program or partnerships with wallets to capture market share when fresh liquidity arrives. If you’re an infrastructure project, collaborate with corporations that may begin integrating blockchain in 2025 as regulations become clearer. Web 3.0 startups should start thinking like Web 2.0 businesses with a clear business model, strong value proposition and path to profitability. The projects that will thrive are those with real revenue, engaged users and fundamental utility. Founders should honestly evaluate their projects – i f the product doesn’t solve a real problem or lacks product-market fit, it may be time to pivot or merge with other teams before it’s too late. Conversely, if there’s a solid core, doubling down on execution will position the project as a leader when the next cycle begins. Conclusion The current crypto market correction – driven by both Trump’s policies and external factors – differs from past downturns due to the heightened role of institutional players and new structural dynamics such as ETFs and arbitrage. Bitcoin now reacts not just to retail demand but also to moves by major funds and governments, introducing new forms of volatility. However, fundamentally, the Web 3.0 industry is gaining something invaluable – political support at the highest level of the US government – even if driven by questionable motives. This lays the groundwork for long-term growth. Challenging months lie ahead, but the projects that navigate the storm will be at the forefront of the next bull run.

The index jumped 2.13% to close at 5,638.94, which is its biggest one-day gain of the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average spiked 674.62 points to end at 41,488.19, while the Nasdaq Composite surged 2.61%, closing at 17,754.09. After weeks of brutal losses, traders rushed back in, sending stocks flying. Tech stocks led the charge. Nvidia soared over 5%, Tesla jumped by nearly 4%, and Meta gained close to 3%. Amazon and Apple also rallied. The market snapped back after Thursday’s sharp sell-off, which had dragged the S&P 500 into correction territory—down by 10% from its record close just 16 days ago. The Nasdaq had already fallen into correction, and the Russell 2000 was inching toward a bear market, down nearly 20% from its peak. Stocks rally as tariff fears fade for now After three weeks of chaos driven by President Donald Trump’s trade policies, stocks finally caught a break. No new tariff headlines came out of the White House on Friday, giving traders a reason to buy back into beaten-down stocks. The market had been spiraling in uncertainty, with Trump’s back-and-forth on tariffs keeping investors on edge. Even with Friday’s rally, the Dow still ended the week down by 3.1%, its worst performance since March 2023. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both lost more than 2%, logging their fourth straight weekly drop, according to data from CNBC. Adding to the market’s relief, Chuck Schumer said he wouldn’t block a Republican government funding bill, easing concerns about a potential shutdown. But fresh economic data wasn’t as optimistic. The University of Michigan reported that consumer confidence dropped to 57.9, far below the expected 63.2. Tariff uncertainty, inflation concerns, and stock market volatility have left consumers uneasy. Traders are questioning whether Friday’s bounce was just a dead cat bounce or if markets have finally found a bottom. Thomas Martin, a portfolio manager at Globalt Investments, isn’t convinced. “Consumer sentiment came in worse, inflation expectations are rising, the 10-year Treasury yield is rising. You would think that the market would be off. So a lot of folks are watching to see if this rally has any breadth or legs,” he said . Investors focus on the Federal Reserve’s next move The next big test for the market comes next week when the Federal Reserve holds its policy meeting. CME’s FedWatch Tool puts the odds of rates staying unchanged at 97%, but traders will be listening closely to Jerome Powell’s post-meeting comments for any hint of future moves. Martin warned that any rate hikes would shake investor confidence. “What we would like to see is rates not go up, because that would be an indication that the Fed is losing control. If the Fed says they’re cutting and rates go up, that’s a lack of confidence,” he said. Investors are also watching upcoming economic reports, including retail sales, housing starts, and industrial production. The market is on edge after airlines and retailers issued warnings about weakening consumer demand. Airline CEOs from American, Delta, and Southwest have all slashed their first-quarter forecasts, citing slowing travel. Kohl’s and Dick’s Sporting Goods also signaled that 2025 would be a rough year. The S&P 500 remains in a fragile state. Vishal Khanduja, who runs broad markets fixed income at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, doesn’t think stocks have hit bottom yet. “We don’t think that we’ve seen the bottom. Volatility will be high, so there could be a little bit more downside before there is clarity from the policy side,” he said. Nvidia’s GTC event and global markets add to uncertainty While the Federal Reserve and economic data will dominate headlines, tech investors are locked in on Nvidia’s GTC developer conference next week. Jensen Huang will take the stage to talk about AI and the company’s next-gen chips. Nvidia, which has been in a bear market after falling by more than 20% from its highs, could see a major move. According to Wells Fargo, Nvidia has historically outperformed the SOXX index by 6.5 percentage points during GTC week. Meanwhile, Germany is reacting to Trump’s policies. Friedrich Merz, the leader of the Conservative Party, has unveiled plans to change the country’s “debt brake” to boost military spending. The German 10-year bund yield has already climbed by 2.9%, up from 2.3% last month, showing that markets are preparing for fiscal policy changes from Trump.

Pi Network, a cryptocurrency that allows users to mine coins via their smartphones, has experienced significant price swings since its mainnet launch and subsequent exchange listings. After an initial spike to $2.10, the value of Pi Coin dropped to $1, causing a wave of speculation regarding a potential Binance listing. However, Binance has stated that there is no official confirmation of such a listing, leaving the claims unverified. Currently, Pi Coin is trading at $1.47, with the price hovering just below the $1.50 mark. The weekend could potentially see further downward pressure, but Pi has managed to stay above $1, maintaining a strong position amidst market uncertainty. There are expectations of a potential bull run, which could drive the coin’s value even higher in the near future. If Pi manages to close above the $1.50 mark, a continued rally could follow, potentially pushing the price to $2 or higher. With the broader market sentiment turning positive, Pi’s price could reverse in a favorable direction. Pi Network Faces Migration Issues, Coin Price Drops 10% Pi Network users who have completed their KYC (Know Your Customer) process are facing challenges transferring their Pi tokens. The issue, reportedly coming from the PI$PI team, has led to a 10% drop in the coin’s price over the past 24 hours. Despite this, the Pi Network’s economy continues to expand, with more businesses across China accepting Pi for real-world transactions, from restaurants to retail shops.

However, it sparked a heated debate within the Democratic party on how to confront Donald Trump. The vote was 62-38, with 10 Democrats joining almost all Republicans in supporting the bill. Under pressure from his left and House Democrats to block the GOP bill, Schumer kept his plan quiet all week. But on Thursday, he said he would support the bill, allowing other Democrats to do the same and reducing the risk of a big shutdown during tough economic times. Shutdown Would Be Far Worse Schumer noted that while the funding bill isn’t ideal, allowing a government shutdown would give Trump and DOGE too much power, which would be even worse. He believes a shutdown would give them too much control over the country. Notably, nine Democrats joined Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer to support a bill to prevent a government shutdown, giving up some Democratic power over President Trump for now. These Democrats are a mix of moderates, Schumer’s allies, senators from states with many federal workers, and those close to retirement. They agreed with Schumer that Trump and Elon Musk could cause more harm during a shutdown than with the bill, which was mainly created by Republicans. Schumer said that the decision to avoid a shutdown is now up to Trump, Elon Musk, and DOGE, warning that a shutdown could last six to nine months and would be very unpredictable. Some party critics argue Schumer gave up a rare chance to use his leverage too quickly, after House Republicans passed a spending bill with Trump’s support. “I’ll take Some Bullets,” Says Schumer The vote was mostly split between parties, 54-46. Many Democrats were frustrated, feeling the bill didn’t address key issues like healthcare and housing. Schumer said that he was ready to face criticism from both moderate House members and angry progressives, saying, “I’ll take some of the bullets.” The nine senators who supported him may also face political backlash, but none of them are likely to face immediate challenges in their next election. Schumer’s decision to support the GOP funding bill upset House Democrats. They had voted against it earlier. House leaders, like Hakeem Jeffries, wanted a short-term funding bill to give more time to negotiate. They said the GOP bill gave too much power to Trump and cut important services. It also cut spending in Washington, D.C. Senate Republicans, like John Thune, said Democrats didn’t finish last year’s budget, which led to another stopgap bill. However, the president praised Chuck Schumer for making the right decision, calling it a courageous and bold move.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,REGULATION|DOGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-15 04:01:51

Connolly has called on the US Treasury Department to immediately halt efforts to establish a strategic cryptocurrency reserve. Connolly, who serves as the Ranking Member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, raised concerns over what he described as a blatant conflict of interest, arguing that the initiative appears designed to enrich Trump and his financial backers rather than serve the broader American public. His formal request was outlined in a letter sent on March 13 to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Connolly Challenges Trump’s Crypto Reserve The controversy stems from Trump’s executive order which was signed earlier in March. It details the creation of a federal Bitcoin reserve capitalized with approximately 200,000 Bitcoin already in the government’s possession. In addition, the order establishes the US Digital Asset Stockpile, a separate entity tasked with managing forfeited digital assets, including Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. While the administration has stated that the reserve aims to strengthen the country’s leadership in digital financial technology, Connolly contends that the initiative is a misguided policy decision that could undermine economic stability while disproportionately benefiting the president’s personal business ventures. Central to Connolly’s objections is Trump’s financial interest in the World Liberty Financial Initiative (WLFI). He warned that Trump’s personal stake in the company presents an alarming conflict of interest, as any government policy that boosts cryptocurrency values would directly enhance the profitability of Trump’s business interests. Additionally, the lawmaker pointed to Trump’s controversial involvement in the memecoin Official Trump (TRUMP). Critics have described the token as a speculative money-making scheme, while Connolly said that Trump and his allies stand to gain financially from its volatility. Adding to the scrutiny, Connolly took issue with the manner in which the cryptocurrency reserve is being implemented and highlighted that the US President has not sought congressional authorization for the initiative. By sidestepping legislative input, the administration’s approach raises concerns over transparency and accountability in the handling of federal financial policy. Connolly’s letter cited a Federal Reserve official who dismissed the cryptocurrency reserve plan as “the dumbest idea” ever proposed. Connolly has urged the Treasury Department to abandon all efforts to move forward with the strategic cryptocurrency reserve and requested a full briefing on the matter by March 27. As opposition mounts, the debate over Trump’s cryptocurrency policies is expected to intensify. Meanwhile, lawmakers and financial experts continue weighing the implications of a federal government-backed digital asset reserve. Crypto Market in Turmoil Following Trump’s March 6 executive order establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve, crypto markets experienced a sharp downturn. Bitcoin, for one, plummeted from over $93,400 to a low of $77,234 in a span of less than a week. While the price has since staged a partial recovery to $83,176, investor sentiment remains fragile as broader macroeconomic uncertainty continues to weigh on the market. Altcoins also suffered significant losses, with Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano posting double-digit declines in the aftermath of the announcement.

Sacks’ sales of his assets are very different from others in the administration and come after Trump’s first term, where conflicts of interest were often ignored. Sacks Responds To Criticisms Sacks responded to criticism from officials like Senator Elizabeth Warren, who raised concerns about his financial ties to cryptocurrencies. Ahead of the White House Crypto Summit, Senator Warren sent a letter to Sacks, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest and urging him to disclose his holdings in bitcoin, ether, solana, and other assets linked to Trump’s strategic reserve proposal. Sacks and his venture firm sold all their cryptocurrency, including bitcoin, ether, solana, and shares in Coinbase and Robinhood. He also started selling his stake in crypto investment funds like Multicoin Capital and Blockchain Capital. He still has a small amount of digital assets left, less than 0.1% of his total investments, and plans to sell them soon. President Trump holds a major stake in Trump Media & Technology Group, which owns Truth Social, and has launched several crypto projects that could be affected by government policies. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, and other companies, is also one of Trump’s top advisers and could influence regulations to benefit his businesses. Cabinet Members Hold Major Stakes Just days before his inauguration, Trump launched a meme token called TRUMP through his company CIC Digital LLC, which controls 80% of the coin. The Trump family also gets 75% of the profits from a crypto bank called World Liberty Financial, launched last year. Besides, Musk, heading DOGE, relies on government contracts like SpaceX’s $1.8 billion deal for spy satellites. Also, reports also show that several cabinet members, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, have significant investments in cryptocurrencies.

This marks a significant shift in Wall Street’s attitude toward digital assets, especially as many major banks are slowly adapting to the crypto market. In the 2024 letter, Goldman Sachs opened up about the increasing competition brought by new technologies, including cryptocurrencies and AI, which have reshaped financial markets. The bank also noted that its competitors might offer crypto products that Goldman Sachs currently does not provide, further emphasizing the growing demand for such services. The company said, “We also compete on the basis of the types of financial products and client experiences that we and our competitors offer. In some circumstances, our competitors may offer financial products that we do not offer and that our clients may prefer, including cryptocurrencies and other digital assets that we cannot or may choose not to provide.” “The growth of electronic trading and the introduction of new products and technologies, including trading and distributed ledger technologies, such as cryptocurrencies, and AI technologies, has increased competition,” the company added. Goldman’s decision to mention cryptocurrencies contrasts with its previous stance. Up until 2017, terms like “cryptocurrency” and “blockchain” were absent from the firm’s annual shareholder letters. However, the success of Bitcoin and the broader embrace of crypto by various sectors, including the Trump administration, have forced a shift in perspective. Goldman Sachs has already taken steps to enter the crypto space. In 2021, it launched a crypto desk, followed by a digital asset platform in 2022. The bank has also tested blockchain-based systems such as the Canton Network. Experts believe that Goldman Sachs’ acknowledgment of crypto indicates broader industry trends. The bank, along with others, is preparing for the future of tokenized financial products and blockchain integration.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,FIAT|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-15 04:49:42

Colin Langan, an analyst at the bank, lowered his 12-month price target from $135 to $130 on Friday and maintained an underweight rating. His new forecast means the company could drop 46% from where it is now. The Wall Street average price target for Tesla is $372, but Langan’s outlook tells a different story. “We’ve been bearish on Tesla’s sales and margins since last year, and the concerns were largely correct,” Langan said . He pointed to a 40% drop in European sales this year, which triggered the latest stock decline. That’s not the only problem. Protests and vandalism have hit the company’s facilities, and with no sales growth in sight, Langan believes the stock’s downward momentum will continue. Tesla’s European sales collapse adds to the crisis Tesla is on track for its eighth straight weekly loss, the longest losing streak since it went public in 2010. In Europe, the company’s January sales fell 45%. The problem is bigger than just weak demand. The company is dealing with political backlash after Elon Musk backed Germany’s far-right AfD party in recent elections. The response has been brutal. Customers are abandoning the brand, and the company’s facilities in Europe have been vandalized. Langan says many investors saw weaker profits coming, but they didn’t want to bet against the stock. Now, they don’t have a choice. “Despite the 40% drop this year, we still see another 40% downside,” he said. “If fundamentals matter, the momentum likely turns negative as consensus estimates fall.” It isn’t the only company losing support. UBS and Redburn Atlantic have also reiterated sell ratings, adding to the pressure. Tesla and SpaceX fight U.S. trade policies Tesla isn’t just battling falling demand. The company is also getting hit by tariffs. On Friday, Tesla and SpaceX sent letters to U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, raising concerns about Trump’s tariff policies. Tesla’s letter, submitted by Miriam Eqab, associate general counsel, said U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods are driving up the cost of Tesla’s U.S.-made vehicles. “U.S. exporters are disproportionately impacted when other countries retaliate against U.S. trade actions,” the letter said . The company warned that these tariffs are making its vehicles less competitive, both at home and overseas. SpaceX had a different problem. The company’s Starlink satellite service is facing foreign trade barriers that increase its costs. “The import duties in some countries significantly increase Starlink’s operating costs, while the U.S. has no such tariffs on competing products,” said Mat Dunn, senior director of global business and government affairs at SpaceX. The letters were part of a public comment process, with over 700 companies responding to Trump’s trade policies. But the message was clear: tariffs are making its cars more expensive, damaging sales, and cutting into profitability. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Bulls have lost control, with SOL plunging over 37% since the start of March, reflecting the broader market’s risk-off sentiment. Related Reading: Dogecoin Network Activity Surges 47% In A Month – What’s Next for DOGE? The downturn isn’t limited to crypto—trade war fears and macroeconomic uncertainty have pushed the crypto and U.S. stock markets to their lowest levels since late 2024. With investor confidence deteriorating, SOL remains in a vulnerable position, failing to reclaim critical price levels. Despite the recent weakness, some analysts see potential for a turnaround. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared insights on X, highlighting that Solana is forming a textbook cup-and-handle pattern, a bullish technical formation that could lead to a breakout. If this pattern plays out, SOL could reclaim higher price levels, reversing some of its recent losses. For now, Solana must overcome key resistance levels before confirming a bullish trend. If market conditions improve, SOL could see renewed momentum, but failure to hold current support could result in further downside. The next few weeks will be critical in determining Solana’s short-term direction. Solana Bullish Setup Hints at a Potential Breakout Solana is currently trading below the $130 mark, struggling to establish a foundation for a recovery phase. The broader market downturn continues to weigh heavily on SOL, with volatility and speculation driving short-term price action. With bears still in control, Solana’s direction remains uncertain, and short-term sentiment remains bearish. Despite the recent decline, many investors remain hopeful that SOL is poised for a significant recovery once the broader market starts trending upward. Optimism comes from historical patterns, where Solana has shown strong comebacks following extended periods of selling pressure. Related Reading: Ethereum Net Taker Volume Signals Huge Selling Pressure – Can Bulls Hold Key Levels? Martinez’s long-term technical analysis on X highlights that Solana is forming a textbook cup-and-handle pattern, a bullish formation that often precedes major breakouts. SOL could potentially surge to $3,800 if price action confirms this pattern, marking an astonishing 2,900% gain from current levels. The next few days will be crucial as Solana and the broader crypto market attempt to establish local lows and build momentum for a potential rebound. If market sentiment shifts and key resistance levels are reclaimed, SOL could be one of the top performers in the next primary bullish phase. Price Struggles Around $125 Solana is currently trading around $125, facing resistance at the $130 level after multiple failed attempts to reclaim it. With bears still in control, SOL remains under selling pressure, and bulls must act quickly to avoid further declines. For a recovery to take shape, SOL needs to break above the $130 mark and push toward $150. If bulls manage to reclaim this key level, it will signal renewed buying strength, potentially setting the stage for a larger recovery rally. A move past $150 could shift market sentiment and open the door for higher price targets. However, if SOL fails to hold the current demand, a further downside is likely. A drop below $125 could send the price toward lower support levels between $100 and $105, a zone where buyers may step in to stabilize the price.

Optimism grows among those beyond crypto natives Paul said that while traders and analysts have turned bearish on crypto recently, crypto developers — and more broadly, those working for crypto companies less focused on the market cycle itself — remain much more bullish. “All the data points I’m hearing from basically any crypto-related project or company that doesn’t rely on “natives” near-term is positive,” Paul said. Source: Nic Puckrin Based on this, he’s confident that crypto is a “good buy” over the “12 month timeframe” but isn’t sure if it has reached a short-term bottom yet. Crypto analyst Matthew Hyland recently said the only way for Bitcoin to confirm that the bottom is actually in would be to close a week back above $89,000. However, on March 14, the broader crypto market rose slightly, giving traders a bit more short-term confidence. Bitcoin ( BTC ) spiked 3.16% to $84,638 over the 24 hour period, while Ether ( ETH ) rose 1.79% and XRP ( XRP ) jumped 6.01%, according to CoinMarketCap. Over the same 24 hours, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index , which measures overall crypto market sentiment, surged 19 points to 46, which is still in the “Fear” zone but nearing neutral territory. Source: Dan McArdle MN Trading Capital founder Michael van de Poppe said Bitcoin’s price spike over the past 24 hours has strengthened his confidence in the asset resuming its uptrend by June. Crypto market presenting opportunity for “sustainable value” investments “Clearly made a higher low, clearly touching the highs,” van de Poppe said in a March 14 X post. Related: Bitcoin bull market in peril as US recession and tariff worries loom “It’s very likely that we’re starting a new uptrend on the lower timeframes going into a good Q2,” he added. Paul also said it may be the right time to explore traditional venture capital crypto investments with a longer-term outlook. “A good time to be looking for “traditional” style VC crypto investments. By “traditional” I mean longer term, genuinely focusing on sustainable value creation, no quick monetization scheme,” Paul said.

SEC’s Latest Move Explained!,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-set-to-skyrocket-secs-latest-move-explained/,"The post XRP Price Set to Skyrocket? SEC’s Latest Move Explained! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After years of legal challenges under Biden’s administration, Ripple Labs can finally take a breath as Donald Trump’s administration seeks to tap XRP to implement its strategic Bitcoin (BTC) reserve . According to a recent comprehensive proposal by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), XRP is not a security but a strategic financial asset for the country. According to the proposal, XRP can help unlock $27 trillion in global nostro accounts, starting with the $5 trillion share of the United States. From this, the United States will release $1.5 trillion through using XRP, and be directed to purchasing Bitcoin. “Donald Trump’s recent comments regarding a Bitcoin reserve have led to confusion about the U.S. government’s cryptocurrency strategy. While Bitcoin serves as a strategic digital reserve asset, other cryptocurrencies such as XRP, Solana, and Cardano could play critical roles in the national digital economy,” the SEC’s proposal noted . XRP Legal Clarity Pathway According to the proposal, XRP should be classified as a payment network and not a security. Such a move by the U.S. SEC will enable the settlement of the ongoing legal dispute with Ripple. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction For March 15 , Additionally, the proposal highlighted that the Department of Justice must remove restrictions for banks to enable XRP-based transactions. Finally, the proposal noted that the Federal Reserve and the OCC must mandate the use of XRP for bank liquidity solutions through integration with the XRPL network. The U.S. SEC has set out a standard implementation timeline of 24 months or an accelerated schedule of between 6-12 months. Expected Impact The imminent legal clarity for XRP in the coming months will trigger a major bull run potentially akin to 2017. Already, the XRP price has broken out of a six-year consolidation and is in the process of entreating price discovery in the near future. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Upon seeing the perks, terms, and utility it brings, LTC and HBAR holders promptly joined the $FXG public presale, boosting their crypto portfolio with a token that shows massive long-term potential. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Has Litecoin Fallen Behind? Even though Litecoin is a well-known name in the crypto market, it has failed to generate much buzz lately. Namely, as competition becomes fierce, with crypto players adapting new technologies and adding new features, Litecoin seems to have fallen a bit behind. Still, Litecoin remains a force to be reckoned with, having amassed many loyal LTC fans over the years. And with a market cap of over $7.8 billion, Litecoin continues to be one of the bigger crypto players. However, the recent LTC movements are far from Litecoin’s prime. Currently trading at $103.31, LTC has lost over 18% of its value in the past week alone. Experts and many LTC holders attribute the recent poor performance of Litecoin to the lack of innovation and interest from outside investors. Moreover, LTC holders themselves have begun to look for other investments to add to their crypto portfolio in hopes of boosting their earnings, with FXGuys being the most popular choice. This new crypto trading platform offers everything Litecoin does not – innovation, utility, perks, great terms. So, it’s no wonder that many LTC holders have added it to their crypto portfolio. Hedera Surges After Its Partnership With SWIFT After partnering with SWIFT, a global payment network, Hedera has been surging. The HBAR price increased by over 19% in the past week and it currently trades at $0.24. This has caused a major shift in the Hedera community, with the confidence of HBAR holders soaring. Experts believe that if the Hedera community manages to keep this momentum, the HBAR price could increase by a further 10% in the following week. However, as Hedera fails to capture the attention of outside investors, experts predict that the HBAR price will go down to $0.1. As it turns out, many HBAR holders agree with this sentiment, and have decided to invest in FXGuys, a new crypto trading platform that shows massive growth potential. HBAR holders see $FXG as the perfect token to boost their crypto portfolio, rushing to its public presale to stock up before its price surges. FXGuys’ New Crypto Trading Platform: Bringing Utility and Huge Growth Potential to Life Despite being a new crypto trading platform, FXGuys has quickly become the go-to investment for all those looking to create a better crypto portfolio. Those who don’t know about FX Guys and what it brings might find this hard to believe. But those who do know about this new crypto trading platform know exactly why $FXG has become one of the most popular tokens in the market. So let’s explore the reasons. First off, FXGuys offers incredible perks and benefits, some of them being same-day payouts and unlimited withdrawals. This combo enables traders to manage and take out their money whenever they want to without worrying about delays. Additionally, FXGuys is a great place to learn and improve, offering features like charts, AI trading tools, and copy trading. Moreover, investors can now test out FXGuys for themselves as FX Guys recently launched a free trial for its BETA trading platform. This is something that does not often happen with DeFi presales, as most of them do not release anything until the presale has ended. This move by FXGuys has boosted investor confidence even more, especially since positive feedback continues to roll in each day. This new crypto trading platform is also a great place for traders who need funding. Namely, FXGuys provides excellent terms for funded traders, including an 80/20 profit split and access to $500,000 in funds. This way, funded traders will be able to make thousands in profits with just one FX Guys account. Traders will also benefit from incredible rewards on this new crypto trading platform. One of them is the FXGuys Trade2Earn program, which allows traders to earn $FXG tokens by simply making trades. Another is the FX Guys staking rewards platform, which traders can use to earn a share of the FXGuys trading volume and fees by staking their $FXG tokens. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE $FXG: The Perfect Addition to Your Crypto Portfolio The perks, utility, and massive growth potential have made $FXG the must-have token in every crypto portfolio. Currently in Stage 3 of its public presale, $FXG is available for $0.05, making this the perfect time to stock up on this incredible token before its price rises. Once $FXG reaches $0.10 and launches, its first rally will start. Experts say this rally will bring 100x gains to $FXG holders by Q2 of 2025! But the growth will not stop there as experts predict $FXG will rise even more before 2025 ends.

The company argues that its competitors from foreign countries have no such import restrictions in the United States. According to a Reuters report , SpaceX sent a letter to the US Trade Representative Office on Tuesday. The letter described the requirements imposed on the company as a “protectionist non-tariff trade barrier.” SpaceX must pay additional costs to foreign governments for Starlink to access their spectrum. These costs include imports of Starlink equipment and other regulatory charges. Such payments lead to “artificially” increased international operating expenses. Starlink operates in over 120 countries. However, to run its service, it must coordinate spectrum sharing with local satellite operators in some countries. Matt Dunn, SpaceX’s senior director for global government affairs, stated in the letter that “foreign operators have used these anti-competitive policies to block or slow SpaceX from providing a better quality and lower cost service to customers in those countries.” SpaceX has raised these concerns during the rising tensions regarding trade limitations for US companies. Tesla also sent a letter urging the US to consider the downstream impacts of trade restrictions SpaceX’s letter is among the 700 sent to the trade representative office in response to his invitation to take a public stance about “unfair trade practices by other countries.” These responses are available on a public portal . In another letter sent to Jamieson Greer, Musk’s Tesla requested that USTR “consider the downstream impacts of certain proposed actions taken to address unfair trade practices.” Miriam Eqab, Tesla’s associate general counsel, sent this letter. An excerpt from Tesla’s letter to USTR. Source: comments.ustr.gov The two letters by Elon Musk’s companies arrive as he continues overseeing his Department of Government Efficiency, which is currently focused on reducing the federal government’s spending and staff count.

Pi’s emergence among the top altcoins has been met with a lot of optimism following the coin’s six-year run until its current launch process this year. Holders have been rewarded for their patience and persistence over the course of the last six years. However, while the market continues to grapple with the success of Pi joining the top altcoins, there is a new altcoin projected to see a bigger breakout in the coming months. Hence, if the success of Pi has interested you, Remittix might stun you more. What Made the Pi Top Altcoins Breakout Possible There is strong optimism currently growing around the Pi coin in the last few weeks as it approached the end of its onboarding process for new users. The coin breakout has been a major sensation, breaking out amongst the top altcoins with a massive market cap in the upwards of $10B. This has continued to boost the hype around this new altcoin as it brings a fresh atmosphere to the market during these turbulent times in the crypto market. However, unlike other new crypto assets, which usually face a strong dump after an official launch, the Pi coin has launched on a strong foot, keeping a consistent growth spirit. The first few days saw the Pi coin on a continuous growth, opening at $0.6287 and hitting a new high of $2.9817 by the end of the sixth day. But the coin’s innovative approach for providing utility for the coin using local businesses has kept the coin waxing stronger. Although the Pi coin is currently about 49% down from the ATH of $2.9817 set late February, analysts predict the utility of this new token could see it at a new ATH before the end of the second quarter. Could Remittix Break The Pi Coin Growth Record This Year Remittix is another new token that has become a sensation during its presale round in the last few weeks. Experts are quickly catching up on this new token. One standout projection predicts that the Remittix token could join the top altcoins this year with a 100x breakout. This follows a careful analysis of the growing investor list and positive sentiments around the ongoing Remittix presale. One factor that stood the Pi coin out for success in the last few years was the fact that it continues to enjoy a positive outlook even while it was yet to launch. However, with careful evaluation of the Remittix token, analysts believe the Remittix presale has also been following this path, enjoying a strong buzz around its presale. Although the Pi launch process in the last few years didn’t give a hint of the price change, the Remittix presale round, on the other hand, has shown over 7x change since it began. Given the high optimism about the Remittix token and its more user-focused utility, the token is projected to see a breakout that could see it above $5 before the end of the year. Experts believe the demand for the Remittix token will continue to enjoy a surge as the exchange allows users to make crypto to FIAT payments smoothly. The Remittix exchange uses a user-friendly interface while also implementing an approach that makes transactions easy and at a low fee. Investors have continued pushing the Remittix price higher, and it has now raised more than $13.8M, making it one of the best crypto ICOs this year. Join the Remittix presale today as it moves towards becoming one of the top altcoins in the market this year, with a projected 100x before the end of 2025.

Top Factors Driving Prices Higher appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The total crypto market cap surged by over 1.2 percent in the past 24 hours to hover about $2.84 trillion on Saturday, March 15, 2025. The mild crypto recovery was heavily welcomed, despite the industry having lost over $1 trillion in net valuation during the last two months. The wider altcoin market followed Bitcoin’s (BTC) price in a bullish recovery during the past 24 hours. As a result, the fear of further crypto capitulation significantly dropped as shown by Bitcoin’s fear and greed index which surged to 46 percent, which represents market neutrality. Major Factors that Influenced Crypto Recovery Today Sustained Gold Price Rally In the past three days, gold price has rallied over 3 percent to hit a new all-time high of around $3k per ounce for the first time in its history as a store of value for humanity. With Bitcoin regarded as digital gold, speculation about a V-shaped BTC price reversal surged across different social media channels. The wider crypto market, which has over the years moved in tandem with Bitcoin, benefited from the mild BTC price rebound. Stock Market Gains The wider crypto market followed major stock indexes in a bullish outlook in the last 24 hours. After a notable decline earlier this week, the S&P 500, NASDAQ Index, and the Dow gained around 2 percent in the last 24 hours. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Holds Around Key $85K Level: Will BTC Price Meet Buyers’ Demand? , Since the second inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump is an American former president politician, businessman, and media personality, who served as the 45th president of the U.S. between 2017 to 2021. Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President the wider crypto market has signaled a positive correlation with major stock indexes. Crypto Regulatory Clarity The cryptocurrency market recorded a mild recovery in the past 24 hours as the United States Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposed the implementation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve through the use of XRP. According to the U.S. SEC, XRP should be considered a payment asset and not a security investment. As a result, the agency believes that XRP can be used to free up funds locked up in the U.S. Nostro account, which can be used to purchase more Bitcoins. The regulatory clarity from the U.S. SEC has played a crucial role in instilling confidence in the wider crypto market. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The bill’s passing, however, unearthed the deep rifts in the Democratic Party, showing that the members are divided on how to deal with President Donald Trump. Failing to pass the government’s spending bill would have given the Democratic party room to stop Trump and Elon Musk’s mass dismissals and the dismantling of federal agencies. However, with a number of Democrats, like Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, joining in to pass the bill, they’ve cleared a major procedural impediment for Trump’s administration. Chuck Schumer says he’d rather drop a procedural blockade on the bill than risk having a government shutdown The Democrats who helped pass the bill are now being heavily criticized by the public, seeing how Trump’s opponents will only have to rely on courts to halt his plans. Within the party, Democratic leaders also clashed over a difference in opinion. Those who backed the spending bill argued that a government shutdown would harm Americans more than Trump’s cost-cutting agenda. For instance, Senator Schumer claimed that his party had no good alternatives: they could either force a prolonged government shutdown to counter Trump or accept a Republican bill that would slash funding for veterans’ health care, firefighters, and police in Washington, DC. He added that he’d rather block the spending bill later than risk a government shutdown. He commented: “I believe it is the best way to minimize the harm that the Trump administration will do to the American people. Clearly, this is a Hobson’s choice. The CR is a bad bill, but as bad as the CR is, I believe allowing Donald Trump to take even much more power via a government shutdown is a far worse option.” – Chuck Schumer Schumer’s bill support, however, is a political victory for Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, who persistently pushed for the bill to advance the government’s cost-cutting plans. Trump even commended Schumer, saying he did the right thing by supporting the bill. Democrat leaders are second-guessing minority leader Chuck Schumer Before the bill’s passing, Democrats like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had called for the public to push against it. As a result, Americans called multiple senators’ offices, asking them to vote against the bill. However, as matters stand, many Democrats believe Schumer let them down. On Friday, when reporters asked House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries whether he still had confidence in Schumer, he did not give a direct answer and only asked reporters for the next question. The 52nd speaker of the United States House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, also argued that senators made the wrong choice by accepting the bill rather than fighting against it, taking a hit at senators like Schumer without naming them directly. Biden’s domestic chief policy adviser Susan Rice even asked Democrat leaders to “grow a spine”, asking them why they would want to “roll over and play dead.” Schumer has, however, stated that he’s proud of the decision he made, believing it was the right thing to do to protect his party. He even said he expected that some would disagree with his choice, claiming that’s always the case in such situations. Additionally, Senator Martin Henrich asked Democrats to come together, telling them that it’s not the right time to doubt their leader, Schumer, if they are going to stand against Trump. Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, also claimed he had confidence in Schumer, although he voted no on the Republican spending bill. He added that he respects all other democrats who supported the bill, claiming they were all torn between two awful choices. So far, the party’s more progressive voters are still insistent on opposing Musk’s plan to eliminate federal agencies. Many moderates, however, are leaning towards fighting to protect Medicaid and against the impact of Trump’s destructive trade tariffs. Nevertheless, the Senate approved a separate measure to allow Washington, DC, to have some authority over spending, but the measure still needs the House’s approval .

Dogecoin Is Retesting The Lower Bound Of An Ascending Channel In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has shared a long-term Ascending Channel that the 1-week price of Dogecoin has been trading inside over the years. The “Ascending Channel” here refers to a pattern from technical analysis (TA) that forms when an asset’s price observes consolidation towards a net upside between two parallel trendlines. The upper line of the channel is drawn by connecting successive higher highs. Similarly, the lower one joins higher lows. When the price is moving between these two lines, it’s likely to face resistance at the former level and support at the latter one. Related Reading: Bitcoin & Altcoin Volume Fades—Investor Exhaustion Setting In? In the scenario that the resistance or support line breaks, the asset can be likely to see a continuation of the trend in the direction of the break. This means that escapes above the channel can be bullish, while drops under it can be bearish. Like the Ascending Channel, there is also the Descending Channel, which occurs when the asset’s consolidation happens toward a net downside instead. But other than this fact, the latter works similarly to the former. There is also a third type of parallel channel, where the consolidation is exactly sideways. In this case, the trendlines are not only parallel to each other, but also to the time-axis. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the Ascending Channel that the weekly price of Dogecoin has seemingly been stuck inside for the past decade: As is visible in the above graph, the 1-week price of Dogecoin has recently observed a sharp decline toward the bottom line of the Ascending Channel. Last year, the memecoin also made a retest of the line, which proved successful and helped its price find a rebound to the upside. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Shift To Strong Distribution As Demand Fades, Glassnode Reveals It’s possible that the line may once again end up holding for DOGE, but it’s still too early to say anything, considering that the last retest saw the coin move along the line for a while before bullish momentum returned. The latest retest of the line has come following a crash that has shaken assets across the cryptocurrency space and instilled fear in the minds of the investors. As long as DOGE stays inside the Ascending Channel, though, not all hope may be lost for the memecoin’s holders. As the analyst says, “Dogecoin $DOGE still has a chance to go parabolic if the $0.16 support level holds!” DOGE Price Dogecoin has been one of the worst-hit top coins in the sector during the past week, as its price has plummeted almost 17%, coming down to the $0.17 level.

Recently, the rounds of the SEC ending the lawsuit against Ripple made huge noise. Ripple also acquired a license in Dubai to become the first blockchain-based payment provider. Meanwhile, the latest reports suggest the SEC is also considering the possibility of recognizing XRP as a commodity, not a security, and also published a document mentioning replacing the SWIFT system with XRP, making it a strategic financial asset for the US. Is this the Right Time to Buy XRP? The XRP price is accumulating around the pivotal resistance zone after a rebound from the crucial support at $2. In the times when the technicals have turned bullish and positive updates are surrounding the token, here is why the value remains less impacted. Firstly, the exchange reserve has seen a sudden increase, which suggests the XRP tokens have flown back onto the exchanges since the start of the month. The rise in the exchange reserve also suggests that volatility is expected to increase heavily in the coming days, which will either positively or negatively impact the price. On the other hand, the number of active addresses has been dropping since December 2024. The XRP price and active address count surged magnificently after the token broke out from the consolidation around $0.5 in November 2024 to mark local highs close to $3. However, the XRP price remained within a range-bound consolidation between $2.02 and $3, and the active address count continued to plunge, forming constant lower highs and lows. This suggests a massive drop in trading activity with a decrease in the participation of retail traders. This raises the speculation of the price remaining within the same consolidated zone for an extended time frame. Will the XRP Price Ever Rise Above $5 in 2025? The XRP price surged above an important resistance level, hinting towards a rise from the bearish influence. The chart pattern suggests the token is heading towards the upper resistance close to $3, but the decreasing volume raises some concerns. Meanwhile, the technicals have turned bullish, which keeps the bullish hopes alive. The MACD has just turned bullish, while the +Di and -Di of the DMI underwent a bullish crossover, which suggests a substantial change in the market trend. Meanwhile, the MACD continues to remain within the negative range, and the ADX is heading towards the lower threshold. Therefore, it may not be easy for the price to rise above $3, which could lead towards a new ATH as the bulls do not possess the required strength, and as a result, bears may exert pressure at frequent intervals, hindering the progress of the rally. If Bitcoin demonstrate strength and rises above $90,000 and reaches $95,000, the market sentiments may turn bullish, elevating the XRP price towards a new ATH.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|BTC|ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-15 06:10:51

The world of Ethereum ETFs is experiencing a notable shift. After a period of optimism and inflows, U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs have now recorded their eighth consecutive day of net outflows. On March 14th alone, these ETFs saw a substantial $46.9 million exit the door, according to data from Farside Investors. This development raises eyebrows and begs the question: Is this a temporary blip, or the start of a more concerning trend? Let’s dive deep into the numbers and explore what this could mean for the future of crypto investments. What’s Behind the Recent Ethereum ETF Outflows? The immediate headline is clear: ETF outflows are happening. But to truly understand the situation, we need to break down where these outflows are originating and what might be driving them. On March 14th, BlackRock’s ETHA ETF took the brunt of the exodus, leading the pack with a net outflow of $36.4 million. Fidelity’s FETH followed with a $11.6 million outflow. Interestingly, other Crypto ETFs in the market didn’t register significant inflows or outflows on the same day, suggesting the trend is specifically impacting these two major players in the Spot Ethereum ETF space. Here’s a quick look at the numbers: ETF Net Outflow (March 14) BlackRock ETHA $36.4 Million Fidelity FETH $11.6 Million Other ETFs No Significant Net Flow Total Net Outflow $46.9 Million So, what could be causing these Spot Ethereum ETF outflows? Several factors could be at play: Profit Taking: After a period of price appreciation in Ethereum and the broader crypto market, some investors might be taking profits. ETFs, being easily tradable, are a convenient vehicle for this. Market Correction Fears: The crypto market is known for its volatility. Concerns about a potential market correction could be prompting investors to reduce their exposure to riskier assets like Ethereum, leading to ETF redemptions. Shifting Institutional Sentiment: While institutional investment in crypto is growing, sentiment can be fickle. Large institutional investors might be re-evaluating their positions in Ethereum ETFs based on macroeconomic factors or internal portfolio adjustments. Alternative Investment Opportunities: Other investment avenues might be appearing more attractive at the moment. Investors could be rotating capital into different asset classes, including other cryptocurrencies or traditional markets. Is This a Setback for Ethereum ETFs and Institutional Investment? While eight consecutive days of outflows and a nearly $47 million single-day exodus sound alarming, it’s crucial to maintain perspective. The Crypto ETF market is still relatively young, especially in the U.S. market for spot products. Volatility in flows is expected, and short-term outflows don’t necessarily indicate a long-term trend reversal. However, sustained outflows do warrant attention. If this trend continues, it could signal: Diminished Institutional Appetite: Prolonged outflows might suggest that institutional investment interest in Ethereum ETFs is waning, at least temporarily. This could impact the overall market sentiment and potentially exert downward pressure on Ethereum prices. Impact on ETF Performance: Significant and consistent outflows can affect the performance of ETFs themselves. Fund managers might need to sell underlying Ethereum holdings to meet redemption requests, which could further amplify price volatility. Re-evaluation of Crypto ETF Strategy: Asset managers offering Spot Ethereum ETFs will be closely monitoring these flows. Sustained outflows might prompt them to re-evaluate their marketing strategies, fee structures, or even the underlying product itself. Navigating ETF Outflows: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors For crypto investors, especially those holding or considering Ethereum ETF investments, what are the key takeaways and actionable steps? Don’t Panic Sell: Short-term market fluctuations are normal. Avoid making impulsive decisions based solely on a few days of ETF outflows. Focus on your long-term investment strategy and risk tolerance. Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on ETF flow data and broader market trends. Resources like Farside Investors and other financial news outlets can provide valuable insights. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification across different asset classes and crypto investments can help mitigate risk. Understand ETF Mechanics: Familiarize yourself with how ETFs work, including creation and redemption mechanisms. This knowledge can help you better interpret flow data and market signals. Consider Long-Term Potential of Ethereum: Remember that Ethereum and its underlying technology still hold immense long-term potential. Short-term ETF outflows don’t negate the fundamental value proposition of Ethereum and its ecosystem. Conclusion: Weathering the Waves in the Crypto ETF Ocean The recent Ethereum ETF outflows are undoubtedly a noteworthy development in the evolving crypto investment landscape. While the $46.9 million net outflow on March 14th and the eight-day outflow streak raise concerns, it’s essential to analyze these trends within the broader context of market dynamics, institutional investment flows, and the inherent volatility of the crypto market. Whether this is a temporary dip or the beginning of a more prolonged outflow trend remains to be seen. For investors, the key is to stay informed, maintain a long-term perspective, and navigate these market fluctuations with a balanced and strategic approach. The crypto ETF journey is still in its early chapters, and like any nascent market, it will experience periods of both exhilarating growth and concerning corrections.

The world of spot Bitcoin ETFs has just witnessed another day of net outflows, signaling potential shifts in investor sentiment. On March 14th, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced a combined net outflow of $59.2 million, marking the second consecutive day of such movement. Let’s delve into the specifics of these Bitcoin ETF outflows and understand what might be driving this trend. Decoding the Shocking Bitcoin ETF Outflows: What Happened on March 14th? According to data from Farside Investors, March 14th wasn’t a rosy day for all spot Bitcoin ETFs . While some funds saw inflows, the overall picture was painted in red due to significant outflows from certain key players. Let’s break down the numbers to get a clearer picture: Net Outflow Total: $59.2 million Consecutive Outflow Days: 2 This marks a notable shift after periods of net inflows, prompting questions about the underlying reasons. Are investors losing interest, or is this a temporary market correction? Let’s investigate further. BlackRock’s IBIT Leads Bitcoin ETF Outflows In a surprising turn of events, BlackRock’s IBIT, which has been a dominant force in attracting inflows, spearheaded the Bitcoin ETF outflows on March 14th. The ETF recorded a substantial outflow of $96.2 million. This is noteworthy because IBIT has consistently been a top performer in terms of attracting capital into the spot Bitcoin ETF market. Could this be a sign of profit-taking, or is there a deeper concern driving investors away from IBIT? Analyzing the performance and market sentiment around BlackRock and IBIT might offer some clues. Bright Spots: Which Spot Bitcoin ETFs Saw Inflows? Despite the overall net outflow, it wasn’t all gloom and doom for spot Bitcoin ETFs . Several funds managed to attract inflows, demonstrating continued investor interest in specific products. Here’s a look at the ETFs that bucked the trend: Bitwise (BITB): $23 million net inflow Fidelity (FBTC): $9.2 million net inflow VanEck (HODL): $4.8 million net inflow These inflows suggest that while some investors might be reducing their exposure through certain ETFs, others are still actively allocating capital to spot Bitcoin ETFs, albeit selectively. Why are BITB, FBTC, and HODL attracting investors even amidst overall outflows? Analyzing Investment Trends: Are Bitcoin ETFs Losing Steam? The recent Bitcoin ETF outflows raise a crucial question: Are Bitcoin ETFs losing their appeal? While two consecutive days of outflows might seem concerning, it’s essential to consider the broader context of investment trends and market dynamics. Here are some factors to consider when analyzing these outflows: Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. Bitcoin’s price fluctuations can significantly impact investor sentiment and ETF flows. Profit Taking: After periods of price appreciation, some investors might choose to take profits, leading to outflows from ETFs. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic conditions, interest rate changes, and inflation concerns can influence investment decisions across all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies and related ETFs. ETF Competition: The spot Bitcoin ETF market is becoming increasingly competitive. Investors may be shifting funds between different ETFs based on fees, performance, or perceived risk. Long-Term Perspective: It’s crucial to remember that ETFs are long-term investment vehicles. Short-term outflows don’t necessarily indicate a fundamental shift in the long-term investment thesis for Bitcoin. Spot Bitcoin ETFs: Benefits and Challenges Spot Bitcoin ETFs have revolutionized access to Bitcoin for many investors. Let’s quickly recap the key benefits and challenges associated with these investment products: Benefits of Spot Bitcoin ETFs: Accessibility: ETFs make Bitcoin investment accessible through traditional brokerage accounts, simplifying the process for retail and institutional investors. Regulation: ETFs operate within a regulated framework, providing a level of investor protection and transparency. Liquidity: ETFs offer high liquidity, allowing investors to easily buy and sell shares during market hours. Diversification: Bitcoin ETFs can be used to diversify investment portfolios. Challenges of Spot Bitcoin ETFs: Volatility: Bitcoin’s inherent price volatility is reflected in ETF performance, which can be a concern for risk-averse investors. Fees: ETFs charge management fees, which can eat into returns over time. Tracking Error: While spot Bitcoin ETFs aim to track the price of Bitcoin, there can be slight deviations or tracking errors. Market Sentiment: ETF flows are susceptible to shifts in market sentiment, as seen with the recent outflows. Actionable Insights: Navigating Bitcoin ETF Investment Trends So, what are the actionable insights we can glean from these investment trends in crypto ETFs ? For investors, it’s crucial to: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on ETF flow data and market analysis to understand prevailing trends. Diversify Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your crypto investments and broader portfolio. Long-Term View: Focus on the long-term potential of Bitcoin and avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term market fluctuations. Due Diligence: Research different spot Bitcoin ETFs, compare fees and track records before investing. Risk Management: Understand your risk tolerance and invest accordingly. Bitcoin and crypto ETFs are inherently volatile investments. Conclusion: Understanding the Dynamic Bitcoin ETF Landscape The recent $59.2 million net outflow from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs serves as a reminder of the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of the cryptocurrency market. While BlackRock’s IBIT experienced significant outflows, other ETFs like BITB, FBTC, and HODL continued to attract investors. Understanding these Bitcoin ETF outflows , investment trends , and the broader context of crypto ETFs is essential for navigating this exciting yet volatile asset class. As the market matures, we can expect to see continued fluctuations in ETF flows, reflecting the ongoing interplay between investor sentiment, market dynamics, and the inherent characteristics of Bitcoin itself.

He outlined a scenario where banks are legally permitted to hold XRP, allowing investors to leverage their holdings for mortgage-backed property purchases. Van Code’s proposed method involves transferring XRP to a bank and taking out a mortgage against it to acquire real estate. He suggested renting out the properties to generate income while covering shortfalls in the first two years by selling a portion of the XRP holdings. The strategy hinges on the assumption that XRP’s price will increase over time, enabling further borrowing to expand the property portfolio. He projected that investors could establish significant real estate holdings within five years while maintaining most of their original XRP. He concluded his post by clarifying that his idea was “not financial advice.” An idea of how I might use my XRP in the future: 1. Assume banks can custody XRP 2. Transfer your XRP to bank 3. Take a mortgage on XRP to buy as much property as you can 4. Rent out property 5. Make up short fall of rent/repayment for first 2 years by selling some XRP 6. Get to… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) March 13, 2025 Community Response and Alternative Perspectives The post drew attention from the cryptocurrency community, with users offering different viewpoints. One response came from an account named John Denver (parody), who expressed skepticism about the reliance on banks. He suggested an alternative approach involving private lenders instead of traditional financial institutions. His perspective emphasized using XRP as collateral or proof of reserves rather than transferring it to a bank. He proposed purchasing a multi-family property, such as a fourplex, and using rental income to repay the loan while allowing the XRP to appreciate. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Feasibility of Using XRP in Real Estate Van Code’s concept reflects ongoing discussions about cryptocurrency’s potential role in traditional finance. The idea of leveraging digital assets for real estate purchases is not new, but regulatory and institutional adoption remain key factors. Some financial entities have explored crypto-backed loans, and private lending options for digital assets are already in use. However, whether banks will widely adopt XRP custody and provide mortgages is uncertain. The discussion highlights the evolving nature of digital asset utility beyond trading. If banks or private lenders increasingly accept cryptocurrency as collateral, investors may explore such strategies in the future. The debate also underscores differing risk tolerances, with some preferring to integrate XRP into conventional financial systems while others advocate for decentralized solutions. While Van Code’s strategy remains hypothetical, it contributes to broader conversations about the intersection of cryptocurrency and real estate investment. As institutional attitudes toward digital assets develop, the feasibility of such approaches may become clearer.

41686055,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=140326,1742020214,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Explosive News: VanEck Files for Groundbreaking Avalanche AVAX ETF,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/vaneck-files-avalanche-avax-etf/,"Get ready for a potential game-changer in the crypto investment world! Leading asset manager VanEck has just thrown its hat in the ring for a spot Avalanche (AVAX) Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). According to a recent update from Unfolded on X, VanEck has officially filed an S-1 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This news is sending ripples of excitement through the crypto community, and for good reason. But what exactly does this mean for Avalanche, for crypto ETFs, and for you as an investor? Let’s dive into the details. What is a Spot Avalanche ETF and Why is it a Big Deal? Before we get too far, let’s break down what a spot ETF actually is. In simple terms, a spot ETF is an exchange-traded fund that directly holds the underlying asset – in this case, Avalanche (AVAX). This is different from futures-based ETFs, which track futures contracts rather than holding the actual asset. Why is this distinction important? Because a spot Avalanche ETF is widely considered to be a much more direct and potentially efficient way for investors to gain exposure to the price movements of AVAX. Think of it like this: Direct Exposure: A spot AVAX ETF mirrors the actual price of Avalanche more closely than a futures ETF. Accessibility: ETFs are traded on traditional stock exchanges, making them easily accessible to a broader range of investors, including those who may be hesitant to navigate the complexities of crypto exchanges and wallets. Regulation and Security: ETFs operate within a regulated framework, offering a layer of security and investor protection that some may find reassuring compared to holding crypto directly. The approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF earlier this year paved the way and set a precedent, demonstrating the SEC’s evolving stance on crypto investment products. Now, with VanEck’s filing for a spot Avalanche ETF , the crypto industry is watching closely to see if this trend of wider acceptance will continue. VanEck’s Bold Move: Why a VanEck Avalanche ETF Matters VanEck is no stranger to the ETF world. They are a well-established global investment manager with a long history of offering innovative and specialized ETFs. Their decision to file for a spot VanEck Avalanche ETF is a significant vote of confidence in both Avalanche and the broader crypto market. Here’s why VanEck’s involvement is noteworthy: Reputable Issuer: VanEck’s established reputation and expertise in the ETF space lend credibility to the idea of a crypto ETF. Their involvement can instill greater confidence in potential investors. Market Demand Signal: VanEck likely sees strong market demand for a spot Crypto ETF Avalanche . Their filing suggests they believe there’s a substantial appetite among investors to access AVAX through a regulated and familiar ETF structure. Pushing Crypto Adoption Forward: Each filing for a spot crypto ETF, especially from a major player like VanEck, contributes to the ongoing narrative of mainstream crypto adoption. It signals that institutional players are taking crypto seriously and see its potential as an asset class. VanEck has been actively involved in the crypto space for some time, previously launching Bitcoin futures ETFs and expressing strong interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs before their eventual approval. This consistent engagement suggests a long-term commitment to the crypto market and a belief in its growth trajectory. Unpacking the S-1 Filing: What Does it Mean for a Spot AVAX ETF? The S-1 form is a registration statement that companies file with the SEC prior to publicly offering new securities, like an ETF. Filing an S-1 is a crucial step in the ETF approval process. While it doesn’t guarantee approval, it signifies a serious intent to launch a spot AVAX ETF and starts the formal review process with the SEC. Key aspects of the S-1 filing process include: Stage Description Filing the S-1 The company submits the registration statement to the SEC, detailing the ETF’s structure, investment strategy, risks, and other essential information. SEC Review The SEC reviews the S-1 to ensure it meets all regulatory requirements and adequately protects investors. This process can involve multiple rounds of feedback and amendments. Approval or Rejection After the review process, the SEC will either approve the S-1, allowing the ETF to launch, or reject it. The SEC’s review process for crypto ETFs has been historically rigorous. However, with the precedent set by spot Bitcoin ETF approvals, there’s growing optimism that the path for other crypto ETFs, including a spot Avalanche ETF , may be becoming clearer. It’s important to remember that SEC approval is not guaranteed, and the timeline for review can be unpredictable. Benefits of an Avalanche ETF: Why Investors Might Be Excited The potential launch of a spot Avalanche ETF brings a host of potential benefits for investors, making AVAX more accessible and potentially driving further adoption. Let’s explore some key advantages: Simplified Investment: Investing in an ETF is significantly simpler than buying and storing AVAX directly. Investors can purchase shares of the ETF through their existing brokerage accounts, just like any other stock or ETF. Reduced Custodial Risk: With an ETF, investors don’t need to worry about the complexities and security risks associated with managing private keys and crypto wallets. The ETF provider handles custody of the underlying AVAX. Tax Efficiency (Potentially): Depending on the investor’s jurisdiction and tax situation, ETFs can sometimes offer tax advantages compared to direct crypto ownership. It’s always advisable to consult with a tax professional for personalized advice. Institutional Investment Flow: A spot Avalanche ETF could open the door for greater institutional investment in AVAX. Many institutional investors are restricted from directly holding crypto but can invest in ETFs. Increased Liquidity: ETFs traded on major exchanges generally offer high liquidity, making it easier for investors to buy and sell shares. For investors who are interested in the potential of Avalanche and its ecosystem but are hesitant to dive into the technical aspects of crypto ownership, a spot AVAX ETF could be an attractive and user-friendly entry point. Challenges and Considerations: Navigating the Crypto ETF Landscape While the prospect of a spot Avalanche ETF is exciting, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges and considerations that still exist in the crypto ETF landscape: Regulatory Uncertainty: The SEC’s stance on crypto ETFs is still evolving. While spot Bitcoin ETFs have been approved, there’s no guarantee that other crypto ETFs will follow suit, or that the approval process will be swift. Market Volatility: The crypto market is known for its volatility. An Avalanche ETF , while offering diversification within the crypto space, will still be subject to the inherent price fluctuations of AVAX and the broader crypto market. Fees and Expenses: ETFs come with management fees and expense ratios. Investors should carefully consider these costs and compare them to the potential benefits of ETF investment versus direct AVAX ownership. Tracking Error: While spot ETFs aim to closely track the price of the underlying asset, there can be instances of tracking error, where the ETF’s performance deviates slightly from AVAX’s price movements. Investors should conduct thorough research, understand the risks involved, and consider their own investment goals and risk tolerance before investing in any crypto ETF, including a potential spot Avalanche ETF . The Future of AVAX and Crypto ETFs: What to Expect? VanEck’s Crypto ETF Avalanche filing is a significant step forward for both Avalanche and the broader crypto ETF market. If approved, it could pave the way for more spot crypto ETFs focused on other leading cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. This increased product diversity would offer investors a wider range of options to gain exposure to the crypto asset class through regulated and accessible investment vehicles. The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs will likely play a crucial role in the SEC’s decision-making process for subsequent crypto ETF applications. Positive performance and investor adoption of Bitcoin ETFs could strengthen the case for approving other spot crypto ETFs, including the VanEck Avalanche ETF . For Avalanche, ETF approval could mean: Increased Demand: ETF inflows could drive up demand for AVAX, potentially impacting its price positively. Enhanced Legitimacy: ETF listing on traditional exchanges can further legitimize Avalanche as a recognized and investable asset. Ecosystem Growth: Increased investor interest and capital flow could fuel further development and growth within the Avalanche ecosystem. A Pivotal Moment for Avalanche and Crypto Investment VanEck filing for a spot Avalanche ETF is more than just another news headline; it’s a powerful indicator of the maturing crypto market and the growing acceptance of digital assets by traditional finance. As the SEC reviews VanEck’s application, the crypto community and investors alike will be watching closely. The potential approval of a spot AVAX ETF could mark a pivotal moment, further bridging the gap between traditional and decentralized finance and opening up new avenues for crypto investment. This exciting development underscores the continued evolution of the crypto landscape and its increasing integration into mainstream investment portfolios. The journey of Crypto ETF Avalanche is just beginning, and its outcome could reshape the future of crypto investment.

TRUMP’s 98% Collapse? $BLEM’s Presale Is the Real Crypto Headline,https://timestabloid.com/doges-318-price-surge-trumps-98-collapse-blems-presale/,"By Trend Tracker on March 15, 2025 | Market Insights On-chain data tells an interesting story. Dogecoin’s network activity is up 47%, TRUMP memecoin’s trading volume has collapsed by 98%, and BitLemons ($BLEM) ? It’s seeing an explosive presale that’s nearly completely sold out before even hitting public exchanges. In a market filled with speculation, Bitlemons is standing out as a Web3 gaming token with real utility. And with a massive $1 million USDT giveaway , investors can enter by simply investing $50 in BLEM tokens for the chance to become one of 20 winners pocketing 50,000 USDT each. With such a compelling incentive, it’s no wonder crypto investors are quickly pivoting towards BLEM as their next big play. What’s Fueling $BLEM’s Rapid Rise? Bitlemons is more than just a token—it’s a fully operational Web3 gaming platform with a revenue-generating model that sets it apart from speculative cryptos. Unlike many projects that rely on hype alone, Bitlemons has already launched three original games: $BLEM Keno by Bitlemons, Crash by Bitlemons, and Wheel of Bitlemons. These proprietary games generate higher margins because they don’t require gross gaming revenue (GGR) payments to third-party providers, maximizing profits for the platform and token holders. The roadmap is packed with new games, incentives, and strategic partnerships, ensuring continuous engagement and long-term value growth. But that’s not all—Bitlemons has strategic partnerships in the works with influencers and sports celebrities, a move that could propel it into mainstream adoption. Can DOGE Really Surge Another 318%? Dogecoin has once again captured the market’s attention. Analysts predict DOGE could surge 318%, reaching an estimated price of $0.6533 based on historical breakouts. This growing optimism is further fueled by on-chain data, which shows a 47% increase in network activity over the past month—an indication that whales and long-term holders may be accumulating. Beyond price speculation, one of the biggest potential catalysts for DOGE is the prospect of a Bitwise Dogecoin ETF. If approved in 2025, this fund would allow institutional investors to easily access Dogecoin, driving demand and potentially pushing its value to new heights. Why Did TRUMP Token Suddenly Collapse? Unlike Dogecoin, the TRUMP memecoin is facing a different reality. After briefly peaking at $75, its price has now plummeted to around $10, representing a staggering decline. This downward trend is largely due to fading interest, as trading volume has dropped by 98%, signaling that investors are pulling out. Adding to its woes, market skepticism is growing. Many traders believe the TRUMP token’s rise and fall resemble a classic pump-and-dump scheme, where early adopters capitalize on hype while late investors bear the losses. With no clear utility or roadmap for future development, the TRUMP memecoin faces an uncertain future. How Far Could $BLEM Really Go? While Dogecoin is rallying and TRUMP is fading, Bitlemons continues to build real value. The project isn’t just a token—it’s a live and operational gaming platform that is already generating revenue. Investors benefit directly from the platform’s success, as 30% of all Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) is allocated to token holders through staking rewards for long-term investors and buybacks and burns to reduce supply and drive value growth Additionally, Bitlemons is fostering an active and engaged community of gamers and investors. With continuous game releases and incentives, the ecosystem is designed to increase token utility and long-term demand. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of BitLemons ($BLEM) Presale Today!

Whether it’s blockchain innovations, new tokens, or the latest trends, the digital finance world never stays still. Now, in 2025, three altcoins are making waves, and if you’re hunting for the best altcoins to buy and hold for short term, you should definitely keep your eyes on Qubetics , Maker, and Aptos. So what sets these three apart from the pack? Let’s break it down. From revolutionary blockchain interoperability with Qubetics to Maker’s decentralized finance (DeFi) dominance and Aptos’s blazing-fast blockchain, these coins are turning heads. By the end of this article, you’ll be clued in on why these altcoins are worth considering for anyone looking to make a move in the near future. But here’s the thing: While Qubetics promises unique blockchain interoperability and real-world problem-solving, it’s crucial to look at each project separately, understanding their strengths and potential. Let’s dive in and see what makes each one tick and why they might be the best altcoins to buy and hold for short term. Qubetics: Revolutionizing Blockchain Interoperability and Solutions Qubetics isn’t just another cryptocurrency—it’s a complete game-changer. Right now, as part of its crypto presale , over 23,000 holders have already snatched up more than 499 million $TICS tokens, raising more than $15 million. Currently, at $0.1074 per token, the Qubetics presale is in its 25th stage. And if the predictions hold true, this could be one of the best altcoins to buy and hold for short term. But why is Qubetics generating so much buzz? It’s all about interoperability. What sets Qubetics apart from its predecessors is its focus on making blockchain easier for businesses, professionals, and individuals by enabling smoother, more efficient cross-chain interactions. Unlike other blockchain projects that focus primarily on scalability or security, Qubetics has zeroed in on solving the real-world problems that hinder the seamless flow of digital assets across different chains. Its innovative interoperability protocols allow different blockchain systems to connect and share information, essentially making it much easier for businesses to operate and thrive in a blockchain-powered world. From decentralized finance (DeFi) applications to cross-border transactions, Qubetics is paving the way for a more efficient, interconnected crypto ecosystem. Qubetics Presale Milestone The presale has been highly successful. Analysts predict a 132% ROI by the end of the presale. $TICS may climb to $0.25 by the end of the presale. After the mainnet launch, some analysts expect $TICS to reach $1 or higher. Potential for an 830% ROI after the mainnet launch. Why it’s worth considering: With such strong backing and predictions, Qubetics looks like a solid short-term play. It’s not just about price potential but also about how its unique interoperability features could help tackle long-standing issues in the blockchain space. MakerDAO MKR Token Soars 23% Amid Proposal and Blockchain Expansion MakerDAO’s MKR token has experienced a significant surge, with its price increasing by 23% over the past 24 hours. This rise is attributed to heightened demand and the approval of an emergency proposal aimed at boosting lending limits for MKR holders. The proposal has generated discussions within the community, with some members expressing concerns over the expedited process and potential implications for governance. In addition to the recent price movement, MakerDAO is actively exploring the deployment of its native tokens on the Solana blockchain. Co-founder Rune Christensen has indicated that the team will present three voting options to the community on October 28, 2024, to decide on this strategic expansion. Aptos (APT) Surges 13% Amid Market Rebound and Strategic Blockchain Partnership Aptos (APT) demonstrated notable market activity, surging over 13% to reclaim the $6 level after an initial 15% decline earlier in the week. Currently trading at approximately $5.16, Aptos exhibits significant volatility, presenting both risks and opportunities for short-term traders. In a landmark development, Aptos has partnered with Bluprynt to integrate U.S. securities law documents onto the blockchain. This collaboration marks the first time a Form Reg D filing, along with its metadata, has been tokenized, paving the way for compliance and real-world asset integration into decentralized finance ecosystems. The Importance of Interoperability: Why It’s the Future When it comes to the best altcoins to buy and hold for short term, interoperability is becoming a key factor. Simply put, interoperability allows different blockchain networks to work together seamlessly, eliminating the need for manual processes and cutting down on inefficiencies. Qubetics, as mentioned earlier, is tackling this issue head-on by enabling cross-chain transactions and making it easier for users and businesses to move assets and data across different blockchain platforms. This capability is huge because, without it, blockchains are essentially islands of data that can’t communicate with one another. The more projects embrace interoperability, the more fluid and connected the entire crypto ecosystem becomes. In the context of short-term altcoin strategies, interoperability can be a game-changer. The greater the flexibility and connectivity between networks, the more valuable a project can become. It’s not just about the price—it’s about solving real-world problems, like making blockchain technology more accessible and usable on a daily basis. Conclusion: Making the Right Move in 2025 So, if you’re on the lookout for the best altcoins to buy and hold for short term , Qubetics, Maker, and Aptos should absolutely be on your radar. Each of these projects has a unique angle, from Qubetics’s interoperability to Maker’s DeFi dominance and Aptos’s speed and scalability. These altcoins offer real-world solutions that could revolutionize how blockchain technology is used. Whether you’re drawn to Qubetics’s presale opportunities, Maker’s steady DeFi position, or Aptos’s cutting-edge blockchain innovations, it’s clear that 2025 holds exciting possibilities for anyone ready to dive into the world of cryptocurrency. Make a move now before these projects truly explode in the coming years.

41685539,https://coinpedia.org/?p=432002,1742020313,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Dogecoin (DOGE) vs. BinoFi (BINO) – Why Major Investors are Choosing Utility Over Viral Trends,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/doge-vs-binofi-bino-why-major-investors-are-choosing-utility-over-viral-trends/,"The post Dogecoin (DOGE) vs. BinoFi (BINO) – Why Major Investors are Choosing Utility Over Viral Trends appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Dogecoin (DOGE) may have started as a joke, but it leveraged humor and celebrity endorsements to become a well-known cryptocurrency. Yet, for serious investors seeking lasting value, its reliance on virality feels outdated. Meanwhile, BinoFi (BINO) stands out by addressing real market needs with innovative technology, offering substantial growth opportunities for those ready to look beyond the surface. DOGE’s Challenges in the Modern Market Dogecoin achieved fame through community-driven hype and social media buzz. But fame alone doesn’t ensure longevity. Lacking significant technical advancement or utility, it remains a speculative asset dependent on public sentiment. This uncertainty has left many investors seeking more meaningful opportunities. Simultaneously, BinoFi is attracting attention with its practical solutions for trading and portfolio management. It’s not about fleeting trends but delivering tools that enhance the investment experience, setting it apart in a sea of speculative projects. BinoFi’s Utility Drives Investor Confidence Hybrid Exchange Model for Real Functionality BinoFi redefines trading with its hybrid exchange model , combining the liquidity and speed of centralized exchanges (CEXs) with the transparency and security offered by decentralized exchanges (DEXs). For traders frustrated by traditional platforms’ inefficiencies, this innovative integration is the future of crypto. Dogecoin doesn’t offer any comparable framework; its appeal is driven solely by market sentiment, leaving it without the advanced capabilities many investors now expect. Cross-Chain Trading for Better Access The crypto ecosystem remains fractured, making it hard for traders to move assets between blockchains. BinoFi overcomes this barrier with cross-chain functionality, improving access across networks like Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. This flexibility is nonexistent in Dogecoin’s single-chain operation, further limiting its appeal to investors who manage diverse portfolios. BinoFi simplifies trading in a way Dogecoin cannot. Gasless Transactions to Optimize Profits Network fees can quietly erode gains, but BinoFi tackles this problem with gasless transactions. By eliminating these charges, it ensures users retain more of their investment returns, a rare and valuable feature. While Dogecoin is known for its low fees, it still relies on conventional systems tied to its blockchain’s limitations. Investors in BinoFi are spared from unpredictable costs, gaining a clear financial edge. Advanced Security for Peace of Mind BinoFi prioritizes user safety with Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology. This cutting-edge security measure protects wallet keys and funds, adding a layer of trust that’s essential for investors navigating a volatile market. Although Dogecoin has proven itself as a reliable blockchain, it lacks such advanced security enhancements, putting BinoFi ahead in addressing modern investor concerns. MVP Launch Builds Credibility Unlike projects that overpromise and underdeliver, BinoFi is proving its reliability with the upcoming launch of its Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Features like gasless transactions and cross-chain trading will soon be live, giving investors real-world value from the start. Dogecoin has no comparable initiatives to show for its longevity. For investors, BinoFi’s clear roadmap and execution set it apart as a trustworthy option. The Better Choice for Serious Investors While Dogecoin’s meme appeal was groundbreaking, it lacks the depth to sustain serious investor interest. BinoFi’s focus on utility, efficiency, and security positions it as a smarter long-term choice. From its hybrid exchange model to gasless transactions and cross-chain functionality, BinoFi offers tools designed for growth in the evolving crypto landscape. Conclusion With its presale pricing at just $0.02 and the potential for a 150x return, BinoFi presents a rare opportunity for early investors. Dogecoin’s time in the limelight proved the power of community, but BinoFi adds substance to the buzz, making it the clear choice for those ready to move beyond memes. Exploring BinoFi could be your step toward uncovering the next big opportunity in the world of crypto.

After weeks of navigating choppy waters, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is flashing signs of a shift in market mood. For those keeping a close eye on the volatile world of digital assets, this could be a significant indicator. Let’s dive into the latest movement of this crucial sentiment gauge and what it means for your crypto portfolio. Decoding the Crypto Fear and Greed Index: A Beacon for Market Sentiment The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a widely tracked metric provided by Alternative, has registered a noteworthy climb. As of March 15th, the index stands at 46, a substantial leap of 19 points from the previous day’s reading. This jump reflects a palpable improvement in overall crypto sentiment . However, it’s crucial to note that despite this positive momentum, the index remains anchored in the “Fear” zone. This nuanced position suggests a market that’s becoming less fearful, but not yet embracing outright greed. For those new to this indicator, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index operates on a scale of 0 to 100. Here’s a quick breakdown: 0-24: Extreme Fear – Signifies a market gripped by intense fear, often presenting potential buying opportunities as assets may be undervalued. 25-49: Fear – Indicates prevalent fear, suggesting investors are still cautious and potentially risk-averse. 50-74: Greed – Points to growing greed in the market, where investors become more bullish and potentially prone to impulsive buying. 75-100: Extreme Greed – Signals excessive greed, often a warning sign of a potential market bubble or overvaluation. Currently positioned at 46, the index suggests we’re moving away from pronounced fear, but the market isn’t yet exhibiting greedy behavior. This transitional phase is often characterized by uncertainty and could present both risks and opportunities for investors. What Fuels the Fear & Greed Index? Unpacking the Metrics of Market Analysis The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t just a random number; it’s a composite score derived from a meticulous market analysis of six key factors. Each factor contributes to the overall sentiment reading, providing a holistic view of the crypto landscape. Let’s break down these components: Factor Weight Description Volatility 25% Measures the current and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing it with the average values over the last 30 and 90 days. Unusually high volatility can indicate fear. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Compares the current market momentum and volume (Bitcoin) against the last 30 and 90-day averages. High buying volumes can signal greed. Social Media 15% Analyzes sentiment trends on social media platforms, primarily Twitter, for crypto-related hashtags. Positive sentiment leans towards greed, negative towards fear. Surveys 15% Weekly crypto polls are conducted to gauge investor sentiment. While paused currently, this factor historically provided direct insight into market feelings. Bitcoin Dominance 10% An increasing Bitcoin dominance suggests fear as investors may be moving away from altcoins towards the perceived safety of Bitcoin. Conversely, decreasing dominance could indicate growing risk appetite. Google Trends 10% Analyzes Google Trends data for Bitcoin-related search queries. Spikes in searches often correlate with market uncertainty or excitement, influencing the fear and greed perception. By weighting these factors, the index aims to provide a balanced and data-driven assessment of fear and greed index within the cryptocurrency market. Understanding these components can empower investors to make more informed decisions, moving beyond purely emotional reactions to market fluctuations. Why Does Crypto Market Sentiment Matter? Navigating Investment Decisions Understanding market sentiment is more than just reading the temperature of the crypto room; it’s a strategic tool for navigating the inherent volatility of digital assets. The Fear & Greed Index acts as a compass, helping investors gauge whether the market is driven by excessive fear or irrational exuberance. Why is this so important? Identifying Potential Buying Opportunities: Periods of extreme fear often drive asset prices down to potentially undervalued levels. Savvy investors may see this as a chance to buy low, anticipating a market rebound. Recognizing Potential Selling Signals: Conversely, extreme greed can inflate asset prices beyond sustainable levels, creating potential bubbles. Recognizing this over-optimism can prompt investors to take profits before a potential correction. Managing Risk: Understanding market sentiment can aid in risk management. During fearful periods, investors might consider reducing exposure to riskier assets, while in greedy phases, a more cautious approach might be warranted. Gauging Market Cycles: The Fear & Greed Index can offer insights into broader market cycles. Shifts from fear to greed (or vice versa) can indicate potential shifts in market trends, helping investors anticipate changes. It’s crucial to remember that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is just one tool in a comprehensive investor toolkit. It should be used in conjunction with other forms of technical and fundamental analysis, and never as a standalone predictor of market movements. However, its ability to distill complex market emotions into a single, digestible number makes it an invaluable resource for both seasoned traders and newcomers to the crypto space. Taking Actionable Insights from the Fear & Greed Shift The recent 19-point surge in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is undoubtedly a positive signal. It suggests a lessening of the intense fear that may have dominated the market recently. But what are the actionable insights investors can glean from this shift? Cautious Optimism: While the move out of extreme fear is encouraging, the index is still in the “Fear” zone. This calls for cautious optimism rather than unbridled enthusiasm. It might be a good time to reassess portfolio allocations and consider strategic entries, but with careful due diligence. Monitor Key Levels: Keep a close watch on the index as it approaches the “Neutral” zone (around 50). Crossing into neutral could signal a more sustained shift in sentiment. Conversely, a reversal and a move back towards extreme fear would warrant a more defensive stance. Diversification Remains Key: Regardless of sentiment shifts, diversification remains a cornerstone of sound crypto investing. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, and spread investments across different types of crypto assets to mitigate risk. Stay Informed: Market sentiment can change rapidly in the crypto world. Stay updated on the Fear & Greed Index, as well as other market indicators, to adapt your strategies as needed. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a dynamic tool that reflects the ever-evolving emotions of the crypto market. By understanding its nuances and incorporating it into a broader investment strategy, you can navigate the exciting, yet often unpredictable, world of cryptocurrencies with greater confidence. Conclusion: Riding the Waves of Crypto Sentiment The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s latest upward movement is a breath of fresh air for the crypto market, signaling a move towards less fear and potentially laying the groundwork for renewed growth. While the index remains in the “Fear” zone, the 19-point jump is an undeniable sign of improving crypto sentiment . For investors, this is a crucial moment to observe, analyze, and strategically position themselves. By understanding the dynamics of market sentiment , utilizing tools like the Fear & Greed Index, and staying informed, you can navigate the crypto landscape with greater clarity and potentially capitalize on emerging opportunities. The journey through the crypto markets is often a rollercoaster of emotions, and tools like this index help us keep our bearings.

In March 2024, Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $73,679 before entering a consolidation phase, swinging within a range of around $20,000 up until Donald Trump was elected as US president in November. Bitcoin’s current chart signals “market indecision” Thielen said he had this thought even two months ago, around the time Bitcoin hit its current all-time high of $109,000 on the day of Trump’s inauguration . He explained in his most recent market report on March 15 that Bitcoin’s current chart resembles a “High and Tight Flag,” which, despite typically being a bullish continuation pattern, shows signs of weakness. Bitcoin’s price chart is forming a High, Tight Flag Pattern. Source: 10x Research “Two flags instead of a single, precise formation weakens this setup,” Thielen said. “As a result, the pattern currently suggests market indecision rather than a straightforward bullish consolidation,” he added. Meanwhile, he also pointed out that the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) market shows no signs of a “buy-the-dip” mentality. “Little incentive” to take advantage of Bitcoin’s recent price dip “This aligns with our view that most ETF flows came from arbitrage-driven hedge funds. Given the persistently low funding rates, there’s little incentive or willingness to deploy additional capital despite the recent price correction,” Thielen said. Since the beginning of March, when Bitcoin fell below $90,000, spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have recorded total outflows of around $1.66 billion, according to Farside data. Bitcoin is trading at $84,290 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap. This represents a 23% decline from its $109,000 January all-time high. Bitcoin is down 12.86% over the past month. Source: CoinMarketCap Thielen is unsure if Bitcoin’s uptrend will resume in the short term. ”Therefore, it may be prudent to close short positions at this stage, although there remains little evidence to support a strong price recovery,” Thielen said.

On March 10, BitMEX co-founder and Maelstrom chief investment officer Arthur Hayes said “it looks like Bitcoin will retest $78,000.” “If it fails, $75,000 is next in the crosshairs,” he added. Meanwhile, Iliya Kalchev, dispatch analyst at digital asset investment platform Nexo, told Cointelegraph on March 11 that the low $70,000 range could “provide a foundation for a more sustainable recovery.” Magazine: Crypto fans are obsessed with longevity and biohacking: Here’s why",,EN,0,0,BTC|ZRX|TRADING|RESEARCH|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-15 06:35:20

Strongly criticising top media outlets, specifically WSJ and Bloomberg, for publishing unsubstantiated articles, the WLFI team aggressively denounced all the allegations as politically motivated.

In a post on X, he highlighted several key factors that have had little to no impact on the asset’s market value. He noted that XRP was mentioned first in a “strategic stockpile,” suggesting its importance in future financial frameworks. Additionally, he pointed out that over fifteen XRP-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have been filed, indicating institutional interest in the asset. “These big asset funds aren’t wrong,” he stated, referring to the level of research and strategic planning that typically precedes such filings. Confidence in XRP is so low that even the juiciest news doesn't move price: 1. XRP in strategic stockpile, mentioned first 2. Over 15 XRP ETFs filed – these big asset funds aren't wrong 3. @EleanorTerrett breaks news that 2 of her close sources advised the case is going to end… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) March 12, 2025 Legal Case Nearing Conclusion Van Code referenced a report from journalist Eleanor Terrett, who cited two close sources claiming the ongoing legal battle involving XRP was nearing its conclusion. “She hasn’t been wrong and never makes up ‘source,’” he stated, reinforcing the credibility of her information. The resolution of this case is expected to significantly impact XRP, yet the market has not reacted accordingly. Stablecoin and Custody Advancements Developments in digital asset custody and stablecoins were also mentioned. Van Code pointed out that RLUSD and Ripple’s custody are positioned to become standard, particularly with new regulations around stablecoins. He also referenced the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which has confirmed that banks are permitted to run validators and custody of digital assets. Despite these advancements, he criticized the market’s focus on speculation and unconventional theories. “But you go right on ahead and decrypt cartoon characters and Simpsons prophecies,” he remarked, implying that attention is being diverted from fundamental developments. Institutional Interest May Be Ahead of Retail Sentiment In response to Van Code’s observations, X user Rogue Trader shared his perspective, suggesting that major institutional investors may already be positioning themselves. “Do you think any of these ETF guys are waiting for approval to buy? These are big businesses, they started before they submitted.” He indicated that firms investing in ETFs likely began accumulating XRP well before filing, signaling long-term confidence in the asset. Rogue Trader also emphasized XRP’s technological strength compared to other digital assets. “BTC has no pedigree or progression,” he commented, arguing that only a few cryptocurrencies have a clear technological advantage. Market Outlook Van Code’s remarks reflect broader concerns about the disconnect between fundamental progress and XRP’s price action. Despite regulatory clarity, institutional adoption, and technological advancements, investor sentiment remains subdued. Whether this represents a delayed market response or continued skepticism toward XRP remains uncertain. However, the points raised suggest that major institutions may already position themselves, even if retail investors remain hesitant.

41686580,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=712485,1742022054,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/41686580.jpeg,"Ethereum, Dogecoin, And The Altcoin Market: Why Up-Only For 217 Days Is Possible",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-dogecoin-altcoin-market/,"A new technical analysis suggests that the crypto market, which includes altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and Dogecoin (DOGE), is about to experience a major altcoin season that could last 217 days. If critical support levels are maintained, the analyst suggests that we may finally see the long-anticipated altcoin season. Ethereum And Dogecoin To See An Altcoin Season Soon Sporia, a TradingView crypto analyst, has shared a detailed technical analysis of the altcoin market. The analysis highlights key indicators within the Total2 chart, which represents the total crypto market cap excluding Bitcoin. The market expert emphasizes the importance of holding a critical support level, noting that the highly anticipated altcoin season could finally begin if this zone is maintained. Related Reading: Crypto Pundit Says Ethereum Price Is ‘Destined’ To Reach $10,000 This Cycle, Here’s Why Notably, top cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Dogecoin could benefit from this market shift into an altcoin season. The analyst also noted that current market conditions coincide with Fibonacci time sequences, which may signal an inflection point for altcoin prices. Sporia shared a price chart, describing it as his secret weapon in determining bottom signals for altcoins. Since 2022, the chart has indicated a significant bottom each time the market encountered resistance at a crucial point. As of this week, the chart has recorded a bottom, marking the fourth hit around the critical resistance zone. The analyst has expressed excitement about this trend, solidifying his confidence in a strong altcoin season. He further underscores that the alignment of events, including key support line formations during the week of the Fibonacci time sequences, indicates the heightened possibility of a major market shift. While tracking Fibonacci-based time cycles, Sporia revealed that the first two hits did not trigger any major events, but the third hit at the 2.618 level led to a significant pivot. Currently, this fourth hit at the 3.618 level coincides with the August 2024 altcoin crash, which mirrored the COVID crash in the last cycle. This suggests a 50% accuracy rate for the current Fibonacci sequence, making it an ideal target to watch for a potential bottom and pivot. Altcoin Market Bull Rally To Last Only 217 Days Diving further into his analysis, Sporia predicts that the altcoin market could rally for 217 days, peaking by October 13, 2025, roughly 20 to 30 days after Bitcoin reaches its projected cycle top. He argues that, historically, Bitcoin has always hit a cycle top before altcoins. Related Reading: Altcoins Season: Recent Crypto Dip Shows Decline May Be Over And Bulls Are Taking Charge In 2021, Bitcoin peaked in April, and the altcoin market topped 28 days later. Similarly, in 2017, Bitcoin reached the top of the market, and altcoins followed 22 days later. For this market cycle, Sporia projects that Bitcoin will hit its highest point by mid-September after a typical 1,050-day cycle from its previous market bottom. Notably, the analyst revealed that the last time the altcoin market hit the 3.618 Fib level, its total market capitalization surged to $5 trillion. Overall, Sporia has indicated a 99% surety that the altcoin market will bottom so long as the key diagonal support holds. If it does, he highlights that the market should expect a V-shaped recovery and an uptrend lasting for 217 days.

In a new video, Cowen tells his 886,000 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin may be repeating a similar pattern from 2017, when it tested the prior year high. However, he warns that if Bitcoin drops below the 2024 low of about $71,000 and enters the $60,000 range, the bull cycle may be over. “In 2017 Bitcoin had a drop in early 2017 where it tested the 2016 high. And it happened, by the way, fairly early on. I would argue that’s very much an outcome to consider for this cycle, testing the 2024 high, which is in the lower $70,000s… If we get closes, and especially if there’s a wick in the low $60,000s, then there’s a good chance the cycle is over. If it stays above the 2024 high, then the party could easily go on.” Source: Benjamin Cowen/YouTube He also says that if Bitcoin maintains the $70,000 range, a bull cycle will probably remain intact, whereas anything lower may result in a bearish price pattern of lower highs later in the year on the weekly chart. “If it holds support above $70,000, $73,000, [the] structure of the market is fine. If it goes into the $60,000s, then I would argue that the more likely outcome would be a macro lower high in Q2, Q3, potentially around like the August timeframe.” Bitcoin is trading for $84,059 at time of writing, up 3.8% in the last 24 hours.

While both tokens remain leaders in the space for the meme coins, the space is evolving with investors seeking out options with tangible use cases. Of the new faces, Remittix (RTX) promises to be the potential game-changer in blockchain finance. While SHIB and PEPE depend on hype and fanfare, RTX is set to transform the way crypto is transferred to fiat. When it comes to making the call in terms of trading, many are asking themselves: Can RTX replace meme coins in 2025? PEPE’s Price Surge Signals Strength Pepe Coin (PEPE) keeps gaining momentum at around $0.057141, with its price rising by 7.53% in the last 24 hours. Market cap is at $3 billion, with trading volume decreasing by 26.08%, which shows some sellers are taking profits. Source: Tradingview PEPE is the dominant force in the meme coin space during volatility, riding on its popularity and demand in the market. With constant momentum, PEPE can reach new heights, but it will have to see steady investor demand to grow for the long term. Since the traditional meme coins have always recorded rapid price swings, PEPE investors are also considering other growth prospects like Remittix (RTX) Shiba Inu (SHIB) Continues Expanding Its Ecosystem Shiba Inu (SHIB) is still one of the largest meme coins, trading at around $0.00001264, having gained 5.70% over the past day. Its market capitalization is $7.44 billion, with trading volume rising by 6.03%, reflecting continued interest in SHIB’s ecosystem. Source: Tradingview The Shibarium layer-2 network is continuing to expand, allowing SHIB to position itself beyond the role of being more than a meme coin. However, even with the growth in the ecosystem, SHIB remains extremely reliant on market speculations, which can make long-term growth unpredictable. Traders are looking beyond SHIB and PEPE, with many opting for Remittix (RTX) as the new utility-focused option. Remittix (RTX): The Crypto Set to Eclipse PEPE and SHIB Remittix (RTX) is also rising to give PEPE and SHIB a run for their money, providing instant crypto to fiat transactions with no fees. Trading at $0.0734 currently, RTX raised more than $13.8 million and sold 518 million tokens, reflecting investor confidence. Unlike PEPE and SHIB, both reliant on social media buzz, RTX provides real-world use cases for companies and freelancers. Consider the small business owner in Asia who receives payment for services rendered by customers in Europe with RTX, they can instantly off-ramp crypto to fiat, without delay and extortionate banking fees. This real-world utility makes RTX more than the subject of speculative token but positions it for widespread adoption beyond the trading of meme coins. Will RTX Outperform PEPE and SHIB in 2025? While SHIB and PEPE remain at the forefront among the meme coins, Remittix (RTX) is gaining popularity due to its real-world use. Since the typical meme coins have always been plagued by price volatility, RTX’s payment orientation brings less volatility and more potential for sustainable growth. For investors looking for the next hot thing, RTX offers the rare combination of high growth coupled with real-world use cases. Whereas the fortunes of PEPE and SHIB are governed by market hype, RTX’s fortunes are governed by financial use cases, which makes it a more viable investment. If RTX keeps increasing at the same level, it can beat meme coins by percentage return by the year 2025. Secure Your Spot in the Next Big Crypto Investment As PEPE and SHIB are doing great, investors are eyeing RTX for potential future growth and stability in finances. With its crypto to fiat payment platform, it is raising new standards for the blockchain ecosystem. In short, while PEPE and SHIB remain the most dominant, RTX’s growing adoption may make it an attractive long-term play. While investors seek utility tokens, RTX is proving to be a force to be reckoned with in the evolving crypto space. Want to invest in a real-world utility-based cryptocurrency? Take a glance at the Remittix presale and find out why RTX might outperform PEPE and SHIB in 2025.

As of 2022, all global assets were estimated at $450 trillion, suggesting a tokenization market of at least $45 trillion by 2030. This gives cryptocurrencies like XRP a major advantage, as the XRP Ledger (XRPL) is well-known for its speed, reliability, and low cost, which lend themselves well to tokenization. The XRPL is already one of the leading blockchains for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, and EGRAG CRYPTO called out investors who can’t see XRP’s potential, and are bearish because of a minor price drop. #Tokenization : By 2030, it's projected that 10% of assets worldwide will be tokenized. Given that the total asset value as of 2022 is around $450 trillion, that means 10% of $450 trillion is $45 trillion set to be tokenized. And you're #Bearish on a 20% move in #XRP ?… pic.twitter.com/ObvURdgwdF — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) March 14, 2025 Understanding Tokenization on the XRP Ledger Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David Schwartz, has elaborated on tokenization , and how it can enhance efficiency in asset management. He noted that traditional processes, such as real estate transactions, involve extensive paperwork and verification. Tokenization simplifies these processes by converting physical assets into digital tokens, allowing for streamlined ownership verification and transfer. This approach reduces the risk of fraud and increases transparency in transactions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Schwartz emphasized that the XRPL facilitates easy token creation without requiring knowledge of smart contracts or programming languages. Once issued, these tokens can be immediately traded on the XRPL’s decentralized exchange (DEX), enabling swift and efficient transactions. Major Advancements for Ripple On March 11, 2025, RWA.xyz announced its integration with the XRPL , achieved through collaboration with Ripple. This integration allows users to access data about tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) and RLUSD, Ripple’s stablecoin, via RWA.xyz’s dashboard. Such developments enhance transparency and accessibility for institutional and retail users, highlighting the XRPL’s growing role in the tokenization of RWAs. XRP’s Future in the Tokenization Market Despite recent price fluctuations, EGRAG CRYPTO suggests that a 20% decline in XRP’s value is minor compared to the potential growth stemming from widespread asset tokenization. The integration of stablecoins like RLUSD and the XRPL’s capabilities in facilitating tokenization position XRP favorably in the evolving digital asset landscape. RWA tokenization holds many benefits for XRP and the global financial market. The projection that $45 trillion in assets could be tokenized by 2030 shows the transformative potential of blockchain technology. The XRPL, with its robust features, is poised to play a significant role in this financial evolution. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This staggering 9,900% surge mirrors the early success of ADA, which once traded for pennies before reaching multi-dollar valuations. Analysts are eyeing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that is attracting crypto users who see the platform as a rising interest area. Mutuum Finance tokens available during their Phase 3 presale. A strong investor backing emerged through the acquisition of more than 5600 buyers who have raised $3.3 million during the presale process. Investors participating in Mutuum Finance Phase 3 token purchase earn 200% profit at $0.06 at exchange launch. Mutuum Finance Presale Accelerates To Phase 3 The third phase of Mutuum Finance presale has started while the platform attracts increasing investor interest. The DeFi solution provided by Mutuum Finance operates as a scalable long-term solution instead of hyper-inflated meme coins. Investor confidence remains high since Phase 3 of the presale has surpassed $3.3 million total shares and attracted more than 5600 token holders before the following price adjustment. The presale token price has reached $0.02 during Phase 3 of the presale while the launch will bring it to $0.06. Investors who bought in Phase 3 obtained 200% growth from their investment once MUTM launches. Furthermore analysts predict MUTM will reach $1.5 upon listing resulting in almost 25x the original amount. The current cost of MUTM attracts investors to buy during Phase 4 since it will undergo another pricing increase to 0.025. Revolutionizing DeFi Lending with an Advanced Dual-Model System The non-custodial liquidity protocol of Mutuum Finance delivers decentralized lending which grants users absolute control of their assets. Through lending activities users accumulate passive earnings from lenders and borrowers instantly access funds by placing multiple assets above their loan value.

Mutuum Finance operates a dual-lending framework that delivers exceptional flexibility to users which features Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system enables smart contracts to regulate lending pools that shift interest rates in harmony with market conditions. Lenders receive dependable income while borrowers get secure financing opportunities through this system. The P2P approach takes out middlemen by enabling direct communication between borrowing parties and lending participants. Any asset with volatility needs this complete decentralized model which provides maximum flexibility to users. Security takes precedence in this ecosystem through combination with open-source smart contracts along with third-party audits to establish complete transparency. The MUTM token holders benefit from both price growth potential and earn passive income while receiving investments through a strategic buyback system that strengthens long-term token value. Mutuum Finance aims to increase accessibility and liquidity by implementing multi-chain expansion which will include EVM and non-EVM blockchain support. $100,000 Giveaway & Community Incentives The $100,000 giveaway conducted by Mutuum Finance aims to give away $10,000 in MUTM tokens to 10 participants as part of its adoption drive. The referral system within Mutuum Finance provides users with rewards for bringing new members into the platform which helps the community to expand while accelerating its growth naturally. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as a game-changer in the DeFi market, with over 5,600 token holders and more than $3.3 million raised. investor confidence continues to surge as the project advances into Phase 4.

Within the last 45 minutes, the trader deposited 2.875M USDC into Hyperliquid to open a LINK long position with 10x leverage. Since February 7, this high-risk trader has pocketed $16.4M by flipping leveraged positions on ETH, BTC, HYPE, and YGG. Now, all eyes are on whether this LINK bet will deliver another payday or end in liquidation. However, his past trades have not only brought him massive profits but also raised concerns about the risks of extreme leverage on decentralized trading platforms. This whale is long $LINK on #Hyperliquid and #GMX , with a position size of ~$31M. He also spent 12.1M $USDC to buy 863,174 $LINK at $14. https://t.co/SncLPnog4v https://t.co/3fXA7ctoOh pic.twitter.com/kx7WWCiJ4R — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) March 14, 2025 The Big LINK Bet On March 14, the whale opened long positions on LINK worth approximately $31 million using 10x leverage on Hyperliquid and GMX, two major perpetual trading platforms. On top of that, he accumulated around $12 million in spot LINK. However, on-chain data shows that he has been gradually selling portions of his LINK holdings back into stablecoins, possibly securing profits or adjusting his exposure. The ETH Trade That Shook Hyperliquid This comes just days after his massive $200 million ETH long position on March 12, which led to millions in losses for Hyperliquid’s liquidity providers. The trade resulted in a $4 million deficit for the platform’s liquidity pool but landed the trader $1.8 million in profits. Over the past month, his total earnings from Hyperliquid alone have soared to $17 million, according to Web3 analytics firm Lookonchain. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : World Liberty Financial Denies Bloomberg’s Claims on Binance Stablecoin Talks , The incident highlighted the risks of leveraged trading, where traders can control huge positions with little capital. While some thought the whale exploited a loophole, Hyperliquid confirmed it was all within the rules—just an extreme case they hadn’t accounted for. To prevent future disruptions, the platform tightened its collateral requirements on March 13. Hyperliquid’s Growing Dominance Controversy aside, Hyperliquid continues to dominate decentralized derivatives trading. Since launching in 2024, it has taken 70% of the market, outpacing GMX and dYdX, as noted by VanEck. Adding to its momentum, the platform recently hit a major milestone of $1 trillion in lifetime trading volume, solidifying its spot among the top decentralized exchanges . What’s Next for Chainlink? Chainlink’s price has been all over the place. It shot up by over 150% after Trump won the election but has since dropped from nearly $30 in December to under $14 now. But with big traders like the ETH 50x whale jumping in, many are wondering if LINK is about to make another big move. Right now, it has a market value of $8.7 billion and is still an important player in the DeFi world. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The discussion follows a Bloomberg report claiming that WLFI, referred to as World Liberty Financial, was in talks with Binance over a potential collaboration. The talks reportedly include the possibility of developing a stablecoin backed by the US dollar. However, the extent of these negotiations and whether any formal agreements have been reached remain unclear. WLFI has positioned itself as a decentralized finance (DeFi) startup with a mission to democratize the financial system. “To get the facts straight: WLF is a DeFi project with a monumental mission to build and democratize a new financial system for the benefit of millions. It’s that simple,” the statement said.

The flagship coin surged 3 percent in the last 24 hours to trade at about $84,233 on Saturday, March 15, 2025. As a result of the mild rebound, more than $71 million was liquidated from the leveraged Bitcoin market, mostly involving short traders. Top Reasons Why Bitcoin Price Gained Today Encouraging Inflation Data In the past two days, major U.S. stock indexes led by the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq recorded mild recovery following an encouraging inflation update. Earlier this week, the U.S. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that overall prices rose less for consumers last month than expected despite the ongoing tariff wars triggered by President Donald Trump. The mild gains in major stock indexes trickled down to the wider crypto assets, led by Bitcoin. Cooled Leveraged Market The cryptocurrency market experienced a rather calmer period in the past two days after a notable forced liquidation earlier this week. The heavy liquidation of long traders, which previously triggered a long squeeze, has created an atmosphere that allows mild crypto recovery, led by Bitcoin. Moreover, the total Bitcoin futures Open Interest (OI) surged by over 5 percent in the last 24 hours to hover about $49 billion. Gold Price Surge For the first time in the history of humanity, gold price surged close to $3k per ounce earlier this week. With Bitcoin price perceived as digital gold by nation-states led by the United States, a mild recovery was imminent, and likely to continue in the coming days. What Next? After a nearly 30 percent correction since the second inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump is an American former president politician, businessman, and media personality, who served as the 45th president of the U.S. between 2017 to 2021. Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President Bitcoin price is possibly approaching the bottom of the multi-week correction phase. The highly anticipated implementation of the U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve has rejuvenated bullish sentiment for a parabolic rally beyond $108k in the near future. However, Bitcoin demand from whale investors remains low compared to last year. The U.S. spot BTC ETFs have now recorded five consecutive weeks of cash outflows. The overall supply of Bitcoin on centralized exchanges has not been dropping in the past few weeks, signaling low demand from whale investors.

As we enter March 2025, many investors are seeking the next big opportunities that could offer significant returns. Among the top contenders for attention are Cardano (ADA), Pi Network (PI), and Coldware (COLD) , all of which have seen increased interest and strong growth potential. An analyst forecast suggests that these three cryptocurrencies could experience a remarkable 28% uplift in March, making them the go-to options for investors looking to capitalize on the ongoing market momentum. Coldware (COLD): The ‘Solana 2.0’ with Web3 Mobile Mining Among the new entrants in the cryptocurrency space, Coldware (COLD) stands out as a promising alternative to traditional tokens like Cardano (ADA) and Pi Network (PI). Market analysts have dubbed Coldware (COLD) as the potential “Solana 2.0” due to its innovative Web3 mobile mining features and decentralized applications. The project focuses on providing scalable solutions in mobile mining, blockchain applications, and decentralized finance. Coldware (COLD) has been gaining traction as an emerging Web3 powerhouse, offering mobile mining capabilities to users in a way that rivals both Pi Network (PI) and Cardano (ADA). As the project continues its presale, more investors are flocking to Coldware (COLD) for its disruptive potential in the Web3 space. With the upcoming launch of its main website and Web3 mobile mining platform, Coldware (COLD) is poised for significant growth. Analysts predict that it could become a key player in the Web3 ecosystem, offering a new level of scalability and accessibility that traditional cryptocurrencies like Cardano (ADA) have yet to achieve. Cardano (ADA): A Resilient Force in the Crypto Market Cardano (ADA), the eighth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, continues to hold a strong position despite recent market volatility. Over the past few weeks, Cardano (ADA) has faced a price drop of 25.67%, but its fundamentals remain solid. With continued development of its smart contract platform and the growing DeFi ecosystem on Cardano (ADA), investors are increasingly bullish on its long-term potential. Technical analysis shows a potential for recovery, and many investors are betting on Cardano (ADA) bouncing back in March. As the market stabilizes and the project continues its technological advancements, Cardano (ADA) remains a safe bet for those seeking both short-term and long-term gains. Pi Network (PI): Mobile Mining with Massive Potential Pi Network (PI), which has gained considerable traction due to its unique approach to mobile mining, has seen a significant 15% price surge overnight, as it continues to garner interest from investors. Pi Network (PI) is rapidly gaining a large user base, with millions mining tokens directly from their smartphones. This has given Pi Network (PI)a massive advantage in terms of accessibility and inclusivity, making it a strong contender in the cryptocurrency space. The recent surge in trading volumes and the ongoing excitement surrounding Pi Network (PI), especially with its growing community, are signs of significant momentum. As Pi Network (PI) looks set to list on major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, it could see even more substantial growth in March, potentially pushing the token price closer to its all-time high of $2.99. Why These Three Cryptocurrencies Are Gaining Attention The continued focus on Cardano (ADA), Pi Network (PI), and Coldware (COLD) is not without reason. Cardano (ADA) is a well-established blockchain with a strong community and a solid track record, making it a safe investment for long-term growth. Pi Network (PI), on the other hand, continues to capture attention with its innovative mobile mining model and rapidly growing user base. Finally, Coldware (COLD), often referred to as the “Solana 2.0”, offers a new level of scalability and accessibility that could revolutionize the Web3 space. These three cryptocurrencies have strong fundamentals and unique features that set them apart from their competitors. Investors looking for solid returns in March 2025 should keep an eye on Cardano (ADA), Pi Network (PI), and Coldware (COLD) as they all have significant upside potential. As the crypto market continues to evolve, these three projects could offer significant returns for investors who act now. Whether you are looking for stability with Cardano (ADA), the revolutionary potential of Pi Network (PI), or the future of Web3 with Coldware (COLD), these cryptocurrencies are expected to show impressive gains in March 2025.

Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez outlined a slightly ridiculous price tag of $15, which would require a mindblowing surge. Being one of the largest cryptocurrencies for roughly a decade, XRP has attracted a substantial community that remains bullish no matter the current developments. Although the asset struggled for years after the 2017/2018 cycle, they kept making bold predictions and some of their faith was rewarded after the US presidential elections when XRP jumped from under $0.6 to match its 2018 ATH of $3.4. However, it couldn’t keep the momentum going, and the subsequent market-wide crash pushed it south hard. As of now, Ripple’s token, which could soon be categorized as a commodity in the US, trades at around $2.38. The positive predictions continue, and the latest to highlight a notable target for XRP was Ali Martinez, who said : “Since January 2018, XRP appears to be forming a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating a potential bullish continuation where every lower high XRP made created a descending trendline at the top and every higher low created a rising trendline at the bottom. Now that XRP has broken out of the triangle, there’s a chance XRP can continue rising to reach a target of $15.” The aforementioned current price tag means that the asset needs to surge by approximately 530% to reach that line, which sounds somewhat outrageous given the market conditions as of late. Moreover, it would put its market cap at close to $900 billion, which would be a lot higher than ETH and close to BTC. Although the $15 target does seem difficult to achieve, let’s not forget that XRP skyrocketed by 470% in mere months after the elections. Moreover, a potentially favorable resolution in the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit and an approved XRP ETF could boost the asset north once again.

Meanwhile, in the United States, a new bill seeks to formalize former President Donald Trump’s executive order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. However, Democrat Representative Gerald is pushing for the US Treasury to halt any efforts toward creating a crypto reserve. Sacks and his VC firm sold over $200M in crypto and stocks before WH role David Sacks and his venture capital firm sold over $200 million in crypto and crypto-related stocks before he commenced his role as the White House AI and crypto czar, a White House memorandum disclosed. “You and Craft Ventures have divested over $200 million of positions related to the digital asset industry, of which $85 million is directly attributable to you,” said the memorandum dated March 5. The memorandum said “significant steps” were taken to reduce potential conflicts of interest before Sacks began his tenure as the White House AI and crypto czar — in which a major part of his role is to help create a legal framework for the crypto industry. Sacks offloaded all the “liquid cryptocurrency” in his portfolio, as well as Craft Ventures' portfolio — the investment firm he co-founded in 2017 — including holdings in Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), and Solana ( SOL ), before US President Donald Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20. Argentina finalizes rules for virtual asset providers Argentina’s securities regulator has finalized rules for virtual asset service providers (VASPs), which cover general codes of conduct and custody requirements for cryptocurrency exchanges and other platforms facilitating digital asset transactions. The regulations were published on March 13 by the National Securities Commission, also known as CNV, under General Resolution No. 1058. According to a translated version of the announcement , the regulations impose “obligations regarding registration, cybersecurity, asset custody, money laundering prevention, and risk disclosure” on VASPs operating in the country. The stated goal of the rules is to guarantee “transparency, stability, and user protection in the crypto ecosystem,” the announcement said. Argentine tax lawyer Diego Fraga said the final guidelines include mandatory separation of company and client funds, annual audits and monthly reporting with the CNV. Source: Diego Fraga Since 2024, VASPs operating in Argentina have been required to register with the registry of virtual asset service providers, also known as PSAV. According to the new rules, registrations may be revoked for noncompliance, and any company operating without registration may be blocked by court order. US Rep. Byron Donalds to introduce bill codifying Trump’s Bitcoin reserve A new bill set to be introduced in Congress aims to formalize President Donald Trump’s executive order establishing a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, a move that could further integrate Bitcoin into the nation’s financial strategy. Trump signed an executive order on March 7 to use Bitcoin (BTC) seized in government criminal cases to establish a national reserve . The legislation, introduced by US Representative Byron Donalds, seeks to ensure the Bitcoin reserve becomes a permanent fixture, preventing future administrations from dismantling it through executive action. Source: Margo Martin “For years, the Democrats waged war on crypto,” Donalds, a Florida Republican, said in a statement to Bloomberg . “Now is the time for Congressional Republicans to decisively end this war.” If the bill is passed, it would ensure that the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the US Digital Asset Stockpile could not be eliminated via executive actions by a future administration. The bill will require at least 60 votes in the Senate and a House majority to pass. With Republicans holding a Senate majority — and amid a generally more crypto-friendly environment — the bill has a chance of passing.",Trump memecoin|Solana memecoin|TRUMP token|Solana|SOL|Nova Labs|SEC|Securities and Exchange Commission|crypto regulation|TRUMP rally|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|ICO|BCH|ETH|USDT|XRP|MATIC|ZK|ADA|TON|BNB|WLD|SOL|APT|ARB|AVAX|LINK|ASIA|MINING|USDC|FIAT|ARKM|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-15 07:45:00

At the heart of the discussion is whether XRP should be considered a commodity, similar to Ethereum (ETH), or if it falls under securities regulations. The SEC’s past decision not to take action against Ethereum despite its initial coin offering (ICO) has raised questions about inconsistent enforcement. Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David Schwartz, responded to these comparisons by emphasizing a key difference: ETH was privately sold before its blockchain existed, whereas XRP had no such pre-sale. Schwartz’s remarks were made in response to Fox Business Senior Correspondent Charles Gasparino, who discussed the ongoing settlement negotiations between Ripple and the SEC. Gasparino pointed out that the SEC is considering whether XRP’s utility and trading characteristics now align more closely with those of a commodity. He also emphasized the significance of Ethereum’s (ETH) regulatory treatment, stating that ETH was initially issued through an initial coin offering (ICO) but later recognized as a commodity. Gasparino questioned why XRP was singled out for legal action while ETH was not. David Schwartz’s clarification ties into ongoing SEC-Ripple settlement talks, where XRP’s classification as a commodity or security is debated, pic.twitter.com/pkBSa7F7rl — 𝗕𝗮𝗻𝗸XRP (@BankXRP) March 13, 2025 David Schwartz Refutes ETH-XRP Comparison In response, David Schwartz directly challenged the comparison between ETH and XRP. He stated, “ETH was privately sold by an issuer prior to any ledger or blockchain existing. XRP was not.” His argument reinforces the view that ETH had a pre-sale before its blockchain was operational, whereas XRP did not undergo a similar process. This distinction is critical because the SEC’s case against Ripple has largely relied on the claim that XRP’s issuance was akin to an unregistered securities offering. However, Schwartz’s statement highlights a fundamental difference in how the two assets were initially distributed. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Members of the XRP community have called out the SEC since the beginning of the lawsuit, as the regulator did not take legal action against Ethereum despite its pre-sale, whereas Ripple has faced years of litigation. What’s Next for XRP? The SEC’s inconsistent treatment of XRP and ETH highlights regulatory bias and selective enforcement. However, with former SEC Chair Gary Gensler out of the picture and his war on crypto winding down, many in the XRP army are willing to put the past behind them and work toward a future with sensible crypto regulation. Recent reports suggest that Ripple is negotiating for the removal of the permanent injunction preventing institutional sales. The end of the lawsuit would remove all questions about XRP’s status as a commodity and level the playing field.

The sudden spike comes amid growing speculations that the leading asset manager BlackRock could soon file for an ETF for Ripple’s native asset and Solana. Besides, renowned experts predicted a potential rally for the asset, potentially sending it to a new ATH. BlackRock’s ETF Filing Speculations Gain Traction The XRP community is abuzz with speculation following a recent statement from ETF Store President Nate Geraci. In a recent X post, Geraci suggested that BlackRock may file for both Solana and XRP ETFs in the near future. He emphasized that the giant asset manager, which currently leads in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF assets, is unlikely to let competitors take the lead on two of the top five non-stablecoin crypto assets. Geraci stated : “BlackRock will file for both Solana and XRP ETFs. Solana could be any day. Think xrp once the SEC lawsuit concluded. I simply don’t see them allowing competitors to come in & launch ETFs on 2 of the top 5 non-stablecoin crypto assets w/out any sort of fight.” Meanwhile, his comments have reignited investor confidence in XRP’s potential, especially as BlackRock’s involvement could drive major institutional interest. XRP Price Targets $5 Amid Bullish Projections Following Geraci’s statement, market analysts have turned bullish on XRP. Notably, a recent report hints at a potential rally for Ripple’s native asset to $15 in the coming days. Besides, another expert has shared a bullish forecast, hinting towards a new ATH ahead. Well-known crypto expert, Rose Premium Channels, shared an optimistic price prediction, suggesting that XRP could soon hit $5. According to the analysis, XRP’s key support levels lie at $2.1 and $2.2, while its next targets stand at $3, $4.2, and ultimately $5. With the potential ETF filing and the broader market recovery, traders anticipate a strong uptrend for XRP. Some analysts even project a double-digit long-term target, should the ETF materialize and market conditions remain favorable. XRP Price & Performance XRP price has jumped nearly 6% today and exchanged hands at $2.46 while touching a 24-hour high of $2.47. However, its one-day trading volume fell 20% to $4.6 billion. Besides, CoinGlass data showed that XRP Futures Open Interest soared more than 6% to $3.38 billion, reflecting the bullish market sentiment. Besides, a recent report also showed why Ripple’s coin is poised to continue its rally ahead. However, with soaring anticipation over the potential XRP ETF launch in the US, the market sentiment remains high with many expecting the crypto to touch a new high ahead.

Interestingly, he made headlines just before joining for selling $200M worth of crypto holdings, including Bitcoin. While he believes it is a strategic exit considering his role, others question whether he will regret it later, as Bitcoin looms into the full cycle, where experts anticipate a price rally (cycle top) to $440k. Bitcoin Price Rally: Crypto Analyst Predicts $440K Cycle Top Crypto analysts have been quite optimistic about the Bitcoin price trajectory for years. However, the recent downturn amid the market’s bearish sentiments and the crypto market crash caused investors to worry about this digital asset’s future. However, things align to change, as BTC’s price overcame the $84k barrier and is moving upward. Adding to the enthusiasm. Crypto analyst Josh Mandel has predicted BTC’s next milestone after his previous one came true. In a few-month-old post, he forecasted this digital asset to hit $84k on March 14, 2025, and that’s what happened. Not only that, the other mentioned dates also had the proper mention of big moves or turning points, shocking everyone with the accuracy of the forecast. Now, the eyes are on the next hint, built on the ‘Fourth Turning’ concept- a historical cycle theory suggesting drastic societal and economic shifts. In a poem, Josh Man says: When 84 becomes the base, Bitcoin CALLS will melt their face. This is how you get ahead of Buy IBIT calls in size. Instead of ten to one, you’ll write it up. The analyst Peter Duan, who decoded it, claims that the poem suggests $444k is the ultimate Bitcoin cycle top. This shot a new enthusiasm among investors, especially as a lot is happening around this asset, including the Bitcoin Reserve Executive Order signing. The global adoption is also at its peak; as Godman Sachs mentioned BTC & crypto for the first time in its annual shareholder letter, and a Minnesota senator introduced a bill to accept BTC payments. Did David Sacks Sell Too Early? Josh’s Bitcoin price prediction is just an anticipation, and the market’s unpredictability may change the direction. However, simultaneously, the accuracy of his predictions made people question whether David Sacks made the right decision. Sacks probably made this decision due to a conflict of interest. Many critics, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, have objected to Sack’s Crypto Czar role with high crypto holdings, but that’s no longer a discussion. Although this selling step aligns with his role, Donald Trump still holds his cryptos , resulting in investors questioning any additional motive. In the All-In podcast, Savid revealed that he did it “because I didn’t want to even have the appearance of a conflict,” said CNBC. Interestingly, there have been incidents where people sold their holdings at a low amid circumstances but regretted it. Now, it is time to see how things will take a turn, as analysts anticipate the BTC price will reach $440k. Final Thoughts: David Sacks & Bitcoin Price Trajectory in Doubt Predicting Bitcoin’s exact price trajectory accurately is challenging, but analyzing historical trends, institutional demand, and speculative enthusiasm could determine a perfect result. Josh Man succeeded in his predictions, and now the eyes are on his $440k BTC target. David Sacks’s $200M sale would become a missed opportunity if this happened. However, a different result would make his crypto exits worth it.

ADA price could now be on the verge of a massive upswing, with analysts predicting a 15% rally. However, there are also concerns that the listing may mark a local price top. Will this Coinbase listing drive sustained growth for Cardano price or trigger a sell-the-news event? Let’s explore. Cardano Price in Focus as Coinbase Files for ADA Futures Coinbase Derivatives is expanding its crypto offerings with ADA futures. The exchange has filed with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for this product. If it launches, it will boost liquidity and institutional interest in Cardano and potentially fuel gains. The Cardano futures will enable traders to gain exposure to ADA without holding the underlying asset. This offering will allow investors to use leveraged trading strategies. If the product is approved, it will launch on March 31. Coinbase Cardano Futures Futures listings have often spiked price volatility, and traders are now speculating about the impact that the launch will have on ADA price, which has been recording choppy price moves. At press time, Cardano trades at $0.74 with a 4.8% gain in 24 hours as the crypto market today rebounds. Will the Coinbase Listing Mark a Local Top for ADA? The upcoming launch of ADA futures could break Cardano from consolidation if it leads to a spike in social volumes. Historically, exchange listings drive speculative discussions that in turn result in high trading activity. Data from Santiment shows that Cardano social volumes peaked earlier this month after President Trump endorsed ADA as one of the US altcoins that will be part of the US digital asset stockpile. This saw the price hit a local top of around $1.12 before a sharp reversal. Cardano Social Volumes The recent Coinbase listing has yet to cause a surge in social volumes. This indicates that Cardano price still has room for growth before reaching another local top. However, this listing could end up being a sell-the-news event that will lead to a bearish reversal. Cardano Price Gears for a 15% Rally Analysts have shared a bullish Cardano price prediction after it bounced by nearly 5% to an intra-day high of $0.75 following the news of the Coinbase listing. Popular analyst Ali Charts forecasts that the altcoin could be on the verge of a 15% upswing after forming a symmetrical triangle pattern. ADA/USDT 1-hour Chart If ADA price breaks out of the upper resistance trendline, it could pave the way for the altcoin to reclaim $1 as traders buy into the rally that will be realized with the Coinbase listing later this month. Data from Coinglass also shows an uptick in activity in the derivatives market. The Cardano open interest has increased slightly in the last 4 days to $770M. If this rise in OI continues, it could add more fuel to the ADA price rally.

Analysts believe that it could continue climbing and reach $90,000 as long as it remains above the $84,000 support level, which is being tested now. Whales Buying, BTC Rising Large BTC wallets, typically referred to as whales or sharks, are crucial to the asset’s price movements due to their ability to purchase or offload massive portions in a rather short timeframe that could impact the entire market. After months of accumulating before and during the run toward $110,000, they changed their stance in early February following Trump’s tariffs against several countries. Inevitably, BTC’s price tumbled, and its most recent bottom came earlier this week with a drop below $77,000 – a four-month low. During this correction, though, whales and sharks reversed their strategy once again and began accumulating more of the asset. The last few days of the business week saw another buying spree, with more than 20,000 BTC going into their wallets, according to Ali Martinez, who cited data from Santiment. In terms of USD value, this stash is worth close to $1.7 billion. Whales have bought over 20,000 #Bitcoin $BTC in the last 48 hours! pic.twitter.com/5e6eLvYEiN — Ali (@ali_charts) March 14, 2025 The popular analyst told his 130,000 followers on X that bitcoin could surge to $90,000 as long as the $84,000 support, which is being tested as of press time, holds. Leveraged Run? Although whales purchasing substantial portions of BTC within a few days could indeed impact bitcoin’s price, as well as the entire market, which has jumped since Thursday, CryptoQuant’s Maartunn outlined another possible reason behind the relief rally. He noted that the Bitcoin Open Interest had increased by about 13% from the recent lows and is close to $28 billion now. Consequently, he warned that this surge could be driven by a large number of leveraged positions, which is a double-edged sword. In case of a rapid BTC price crash, those leveraged longs could result in a massive liquidation cascade , as we have witnessed on a few occasions since the February correction. Leverage Driven Pump!

However, XRP lawyer John Deaton set the record straight, stating that the regulator hasn’t shared any such information. Did US SEC Release Details on Crypto Roles? John Deaton Weighs In According to recent reports, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has released details on the potential roles of altcoins such as XRP, SOL, and ADA within the government. Reportedly, XRP is recognized as suitable for state-level financial transactions. Its primary goal is to optimize government payments and enhance interbank liquidity. Meanwhile, ADA is deemed ideal for academic credentialing, smart contracts for government services, and secure infrastructure management. At the same time, SOL may be used for high-speed blockchain applications. These includes real-time government databases, secure voting mechanisms, and digital identity management. However, XRP lawyer John Deaton dismissed these rumors asserting that the SEC still remains silent on the potential roles of these assets under the Trump government. He stated, “The SEC did not release any such thing.” US SEC Acknowledges XRP as a Strategic Financial Asset Reportedly, the US SEC acknowledged XRP as a strategic financial asset. The official website of the US SEC published a document entitled “Comprehensive Proposal: XRP as a Strategic Financial Asset for the US,” which explained how XRP is poised to play a pivotal role in the US financial landscape. The regulator also proposed the potential roles of other cryptocurrencies too. The document read, Solana and Cardano should be integrated into U.S. digital infrastructure but not included in the reserve strategy. Instead, they enhance efficiency and security for state applications, while XRP remains the key asset for financial transactions. While some claim this as the SEC’s clarification on the potential roles of these assets in the US government, John Deaton denies it. He has disputed the claim, stating that the regulator has not released any such clarification. This denial has sparked confusion and debate among crypto enthusiasts, highlighting the need for official confirmation from the US SEC. This comes following John Deaton’s recent endorsement of Bitcoin amid the BTC vs XRP war. He highlighted Bitcoin’s potential, pointing out the significance of holding BTC in one’s portfolio. Community Seeks Clarity on SEC Proposal, Appreciates John Deaton Notably, John Deaton’s post gained widespread attention as it provides clarity to the prevailing rumors about the SEC’s clarifications on XRP, SOL, and ADA. This development comes on the heels of Trump’s decision to include these altcoins, along with Bitcoin, into the US reserve. Many remain concerned about the circulating misinformation. Meanwhile, XRP lawyer Bill Morgan reinforced Deaton’s claim stating, “Where does it come from. Endless false information.” Following John Deaton’s clarification, the community acknowledged that the document on the SEC’s website is merely a proposal submitted by someone. They believe that it might not be authored by the SEC itself. This development highlights the importance of verifying information through reputable sources to avoid spreading misinformation.

There’s a mix of excitement and anxiety, as some believe the case is close to ending, while others think there’s still a long wait ahead. Jeremy Hogan Thinks a Private Settlement Could End It All Recently crypto legal expert Jeremy Hogan dropped a major prediction, saying the SEC and Ripple could settle the lawsuit privately. If that happens, there would be no court battles, no appeals, and no delays—just clarity for Ripple and XRP. This would be a game-changer, allowing banks and institutions to start using XRP without fear of legal trouble.

Meanwhile,… pic.twitter.com/pdKWuilhcZ — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) March 14, 2025 Crypto analyst X Finance Bull backed Hogan’s view, saying that once clear rules are in place, XRP’s true value will finally be unlocked. He pointed out that XRP is already outperforming Bitcoin and Ethereum, and if clarity comes soon, XRP could see a massive rally. According to him, patience will pay off for those holding onto their tokens. Some Analysts Say It’s Not That Simple Not everyone is convinced. X user Steven Hausser says a private settlement isn’t happening anytime soon. He believes nothing will move until former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins joins in May or June. After that, regulatory clarity needs to come before XRP can truly take off. Hausser does see a bright future, though—he expects XRP’s price to rise in spring and summer, continue growing in the fall, and possibly hit $6 or $8 by 2026. X Finance Bull agreed, saying that once regulations are in place, XRP holders who stayed patient will be the real winners. Is XRP a Commodity? The SEC Might Decide Soon In another twist, the SEC is reportedly considering classifying XRP as a commodity. Crypto journalist Eleanor Terrett, citing anonymous sources, says the lawsuit is nearing its conclusion. This case started back in 2020, and in 2023, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple’s open-market sales of XRP weren’t securities, going against the SEC’s claims. However, she did agree with the SEC that Ripple’s direct sales to big investors were securities. Ripple’s legal team is still fighting to reduce a $125 million fine, which is causing more delays. Meanwhile, Fox Business reporter Charles Gasparino confirmed that the SEC is actively discussing XRP’s status. SCOOP: Off of @EleanorTerrett 's scoop from yesterday on the @Ripple – @SECGov settlement negotiations, one issue that is being weighed by the commission is whether $XRP continues to trade and have a utility that makes it more a commodity and not a security. I am told the… — Charles Gasparino (@CGasparino) March 13, 2025 What Happens Next? If XRP is officially labeled a commodity, it could clear the way for bigger adoption and finally end the legal drama. With the SEC dropping other crypto cases and the Trump administration pushing for friendlier regulations, the timing couldn’t be more interesting.

According to Ali Martinez, Solana has the potential to surge by a staggering 2,900%, pointing to the formation of a cup and handle pattern as a strong indicator of a bullish trend, he said in an X post on March 14. Solana price analysis chart. Source: Ali Martinez Martinez noted that since November 2021, Solana has experienced a U-shaped decline, followed by a level-off phase, which is now evolving into the pattern’s “handle.” This technical formation is often seen as a precursor to a major upward movement in price. The cup and handle pattern is bullish, where the price forms a rounded bottom (the cup) followed by a consolidation phase (the handle). A breakout above the resistance level signals a potential rally. Martinez suggested that Solana could break the $200 resistance, paving the way for a surge toward $4,000. He emphasized that if Solana can decisively break above the $200 mark, the odds of a continued bullish rally increase significantly. In this case, a $4,000 valuation would likely elevate Solana to the highest-ranked digital asset with a market cap exceeding $2 trillion, provided Bitcoin ( BTC ) stagnates during this period. Meanwhile, another analysis by Ted Pillows in an X post on March 14 also stressed the significance of Solana holding the $110 level, as dropping below this mark could usher in a sustained correction for SOL. Solana price analysis chart. Source: Ted Pillows The expert stated that Solana stands at a key juncture, considering its retest of a multi-year support zone and a long-term uptrend line. Historically, these levels have provided strong buying opportunities. He highlighted the importance of the $110 to $120 zone, noting that failure to hold support could open the door for a deeper correction of 30% to 40%. However, a successful bounce could signal a reversal, with a potential upside if bullish momentum returns. Solana price fundamentals Although technical indicators are crucial to Solana’s next price trajectory, other fundamentals are also coming into play, with the spot exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) ranking as a key factor. Several entities have applied for the product with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). On March 11, the SEC postponed its decision on multiple altcoin ETFs, including those for XRP , Solana, Litecoin ( LTC ), and Dogecoin ( DOGE ). The agency extended its review period, pushing decisions on Grayscale’s XRP ETF and Cboe BZX’s Solana ETF to May. SEC ETF verdict.

Fellow analyst Eric Balchunas added that other ETF proposals, including one for Ethereum ( ETH ) staking, were also delayed. Eth staking and in-kind also delayed. Everything delayed. It's like the NYC-bound Amtrak on monday morning: ""Mechanical issues in DC"" — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) March 11, 2025 The SEC has previously extended crypto ETF decisions amid leadership changes following Gary Gensler’s exit from the regulator. Although part of Solana’s momentum last year was driven by meme coin activity on its network, an ETF approval could help broaden SOL’s appeal and attract long-term investors. On the other hand, a proposal to slash Solana’s inflation rate by 80% (SIMD-228) has failed to pass after falling short of the required 66.67% approval. Despite securing 61.39% “Yes” votes, opposition from smaller validators tipped the balance, keeping SOL issuance unchanged. The decision could lead to short-term selling pressure, as lower inflation would have reduced token supply, potentially driving up SOL’s price. However, higher rewards may sustain validator participation and network security, a long-term positive. SOL price analysis As of press time, Solana was trading at $133.10, well below its 50-day ($183.93) and 200-day ($186.79) moving averages ( MA ), signaling a strong downtrend. The asset’s market sentiment remains bearish, with the Fear & Greed Index at 27 (Fear). However, the 14-day relative strength index ( RSI ) stands at 35.38. SOL must reclaim $150 and break above key resistance levels to reverse the bearish trend. Until then, downside risks remain in play.

The U.S. Treasury Department’s daily reports show that despite Elon’s massive layoffs and budget cuts, the federal government is spending money even faster than before. Since January 21, 2025, when Donald Trump took office for his second term and put Elon in charge of federal budget cuts, the government has spent more than it did during the same periods in 2023 and 2024. Adjusting for inflation barely changes the picture—spending is still higher than last year. D.O.G.E was supposed to slash government waste, shut down costly agencies, and end reckless spending. But after weeks of cuts, contract cancellations, and chaos, the government’s financial reports show no actual savings. Elon promised that his strategy would cut spending deeper than Margaret Thatcher’s policies in the 1980s, but reality is telling a different story. Nothing has changed—except for the people who lost their jobs. D.O.G.E cuts aren’t lowering government spending The biggest problem for D.O.G.E is simple: it’s cutting in the wrong places. The Treasury’s financial breakdowns show that the parts of the budget Elon can actually touch don’t add up to much. In 2022, the total payroll for civilian government employees was just 4% of federal spending. Adding in active-duty military salaries only raised it to 7%. Even if D.O.G.E fired every single government worker, the government would still be spending over 90% of its budget. Government contracts aren’t the issue either. In 2023, nondefense agency contracts made up 5% of federal spending, and with the Defense Department included, it was 12%. Elon’s team has cut plenty of contracts, but those reductions barely make a dent in overall spending. Source: D.O.G.E website The real money? Entitlement programs and debt interest. Spending on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid accounts for most of the budget, and interest on the national debt grows every year. But D.O.G.E doesn’t control any of that. Elon can fire as many employees as he wants and shut down as many agencies as possible—the money will still be spent. The numbers also show that discretionary spending, which once accounted for three-quarters of the federal budget in the 1960s, has now shrunk to just over a quarter. The part that D.O.G.E actually controls—nondefense discretionary spending—was only 14.9% of total spending in 2023. Even if Elon eliminated every single thing D.O.G.E was targeting, the federal budget would still be massive. Elon is running into the same problem David Stockman faced in the Reagan administration. Stockman cut real non-defense discretionary spending by 18% in three years, but it still didn’t stop the government from spending more overall. That’s because defense spending grew, and entitlement programs remained untouched—just like today. D.O.G.E is causing chaos, not efficiency Since its launch, D.O.G.E has moved quickly, but not effectively. Elon’s department has laid off thousands, shut down agencies, and slashed contracts faster than anyone expected. But instead of improving efficiency, the strategy has backfired. The first round of layoffs hit probationary employees first, removing the newest hires and recently promoted staff—the people who were supposed to help modernize government operations. D.O.G.E had to walk this decision back. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) was dismantled, but then partially restored when banks realized they needed it to roll back regulations. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) saw major cutbacks, which contrasted with the Reagan administration’s strategy of increasing IRS funding to boost tax enforcement. The result was less money being collected and an even bigger deficit for America. Even D.O.G.E’s financial reports are unreliable. The department claims to be saving billions, but independent financial experts keep finding major discrepancies. Instead of making the numbers clear, D.O.G.E has made it harder to check federal spending data at all. While Elon’s leadership team includes tech industry names like Joe Gebbia, co-founder of Airbnb, and Steve Davis, one of Elon’s longtime business partners, none of them have government experience. Running a business is not the same as running a government. The U.S. budget isn’t a startup that can be optimized through layoffs and automation. The biggest problem might be Elon himself. The man who built Tesla and SpaceX is the same one who spends hours posting on X (formerly Twitter). There’s a difference between Elon Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur, and @elonElon, the account posting non-stop rants about politics and crypto. The federal government has handed real power to the second one. Santi Ruiz, a policy researcher at the Institute for Progress, summed up the situation: “Everyone evaluating D.O.G.E right now is like a blind man feeling different parts of an elephant.” No one can see the whole picture yet. But the parts we can see don’t look good.",OP-ED|CFPB|D.O.G.E|IRS|USD,EN,0,0,DOGE|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-15 08:15:06

Crypto analyst David (@david_dogecoin) suggests that, if confirmed, Dogecoin could be targeting an ambitious price target of $4. Dogecoin Cup And Handle Pattern The first stage of this pattern, the cup, began taking shape when Dogecoin initially declined from its May 2021 all time high at $0.74. This downward movement led to an extended consolidation period, where the asset gradually formed a rounded bottom in the $0.05–$0.06 range. The curvature of the price action suggests a slow but steady shift in market sentiment, where selling pressure was gradually absorbed by buyers accumulating DOGE at lower levels. As time progressed, Dogecoin started to recover from this bottom, pushing back towards its December 2024 high at $0.48. The gradual and steady rise back to this high signals that bullish momentum has been building, with increasing interest from market participants. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breakout Alert! This Pattern Could Trigger A ‘Parabolic’ Surge After reaching the $0.48 resistance level, Dogecoin faced a rejection, leading to a moderate pullback. This decline formed the handle, a smaller downward retracement that typically precedes the final breakout. The handle in this setup is forming around the $0.14–$0.17 price zone, where the market is currently consolidating. The handle serves as the last phase where weaker hands exit, and stronger buying interest gathers momentum before a decisive move higher. If Dogecoin successfully breaks out of the cup and handle pattern, the projected price target can be estimated using the measured move technique. This involves calculating the depth of the cup and adding that value to the breakout point. Based on this method, the expected target is around $4, according to the chart shared by analyst Kevin. Critique: Why This Is Not A Classic Cup And Handle A textbook cup and handle requires specific structural characteristics, including a rounded bottom and a shallow handle, forming near a prior all-time high or key resistance zone before a breakout. However, there are critical deviations in this analysis that cast doubt on its validity. Related Reading: Dogecoin’s Darkest Hour? Sentiment Tanks, Whales Accumulate The decline from $0.74 (May 2021 ATH) to $0.05–$0.06 is too deep and prolonged to be considered a proper cup formation. Classic cup patterns typically form over weeks to months, not multiple years of extended downtrend. The recovery from $0.05–$0.06 to $0.48 is not symmetrical with the initial drop, making the “rounded bottom” aspect of the cup questionable. Instead, the price action resembles a multi-year accumulation phase rather than a continuous rounding structure. Moreover, the handle is forming too deep in the structure. A valid handle should develop near the rim (i.e., close to $0.48), but in this case, Dogecoin has retraced all the way down to $0.14–$0.17—which is a massive drop of over 65% from the supposed cup rim. A healthy handle should not drop below 50% of the cup’s depth, but here, it retraces nearly to the lower third of the structure, invalidating the classical pattern. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.17.

Is the SOL hype train a myth? Will price recover and kickstart an uptrend here? Let’s find out. Why 40M Unique Crypto Tokens Were Created On Solana Even as the Price Crashed 62%? The unique value proposition of PumpFun that allows investors even a layman to simply create a token with a click of a button is why the total unique crypto tokens on Solana Blockchain continue to explode. Even as SOL value shed 62% in the last 52 days, this metric continues to rise, showcasing that retail investors’ risk-taking appetite is yet to climax. Unique Crypto Tokens Created on Solana Blockchain Does this mean a reversal in Solana price is what’s next? Unlikely. The price action of Solana is dependent on the larger crypto market ecosystem and the macroeconomic policies that impact Bitcoin (BTC). So, what’s next for SOL? Will Solana Price Soar as Altcoin Dominance Hints Reversal? The altcoin dominance, which is the combined market capitalization of cryptocurrency ecosystem excluding Bitcoin. The recent recovery of altcoin market cap above $218 billion notes that a resurgence of bullish momentum. A decisive breakout above the $229 billion to $230 billion level will suggest a shift in market structure favoring bulls. Such a development will indicate that there could be a mini bull run, which pushes the market cap to the $300 billion to $310 billion range. Altcoin Market Capitalization Hence, investors can expect Solana, which is at the forefront of top altcoins to hold, to trigger a bullish reversal. How High Can Solana Go? Based on the recent price action, Solana has recovered above the February 28 swing low of $125, signaling a resurgence of bullish momentum. To add credence to the buying pressure, SOL has also produced a higher high on the daily chart. The next key support zone is $128 to $120, a bounce here could see the altcoin propel to the range high of $179. But ideal take profit levels based on bullish Solana price predictions extend from $180 to $186.

The announcement sparked significant whale activity, with popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighting the trend early Monday. “Whales bought an additional 140 million DOGE in the last 24 hours,” Martinez tweeted. This followed a significant accumulation spree over the weekend, with whales amassing 910 million DOGE in just 48 hours. On Friday, Martinez reported that whales were “buying the dip,” acquiring more than 530 million DOGE over 72 hours. The renewed interest comes after a prolonged quiet period, particularly since January 25, when DOGE’s price began to decline, leading to a loss of investor enthusiasm and waning whale activity. However, the latest surge has reignited momentum, primarily driven by Elon Musk’s involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The agency’s acronym aligning with Dogecoin’s name has sparked renewed excitement, mirroring its November 2024 rally when Trump announced the department, appointing Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to key roles. This event triggered a 15% price spike. Speaking on The Joe Rogan Experience last week, Musk acknowledged the unexpected link between Dogecoin and the newly formed government agency. “Doge started as a meme coin, right? A joke cryptocurrency with memes and dogs. But somehow, the letters just lined up perfectly, ” Musk explained . “ Originally, I was going to call it the Government Efficiency Commission, which is a very boring name. Then people online were like, ‘No, it needs to be the Department of Government Efficiency,’ and I was like, you know what? You’re right.” Notably, the growing attention around DOGE and its unusual but high-profile connection to a government agency has fueled speculation that Dogecoin could also soon be considered for the crypto reserve becoming the first meme coin. If that happens, Dogecoin’s price and legitimacy could spike, solidifying its place not just as a joke, but as a serious asset in the evolving digital economy. With renewed interest and increasing whale accumulation, analysts predict further gains for DOGE. On Monday, analyst Kaleo shared a chart highlighting DOGE’s breakout from a multi-month resistance trendline. “DOGE is currently sitting at resistance from the downtrend it has been stuck under for the past two months. I wouldn’t be surprised if it takes a brief pause before breaking higher, but when it does, I expect the move up to be violent and much quicker than the move down.” Kaleo noted . At press time, the meme coin was retesting this critical level. Meanwhile, analyst ByllifyX pointed to a bullish flag formation, offering an even more aggressive outlook. “DOGE isn’t just mooning, it’s teleporting to another galaxy. $3+ soon. Stay bullish,” he stated. At press time, DOGE was trading at $0.17 reflecting a 1.19% surge in the past 24 hours.",Cryptocurrency|News|Doge|Dogecoin,EN,0,0,DOGE|TRADING|FIAT|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-15 08:32:49

The initiative, unveiled on Sunday, included XRP, SOL, and ADA before BTC and ETH were added. The news, arriving just days ahead of the highly anticipated first-ever crypto summit later this week, sent Bitcoin soaring past $94,000. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization reclaimed the $3 trillion mark as traders scrambled to capitalize on the potential impact of the development. However, while many in the crypto community have lauded the announcement as a step toward legitimizing crypto assets nationally, others have raised concerns, questioning the timing and potential conflicts of interest surrounding the decision. One of the most immediate concerns surfaced after an anonymous crypto whale executed a highly leveraged trade just hours before Trump’s announcement. On Sunday morning, the trader went 50x long on Bitcoin and Ethereum, turning a $4 million position into $200 million. By the time the news broke, the whale had already exited most of their trades, securing a profit of just over $6.5 million in less than 24 hours, triggering widespread speculation about potential insider trading. Another point of controversy revolves around David Sacks, Trump’s newly appointed Crypto Czar. Derek Martin, founder of Pathfinder Research, pointed out that Sacks has long-standing financial ties to Bitwise Asset Management, which holds Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana , XRP , and Cardano , the very assets included in the proposed Crypto Reserve. Martin argued that Sacks’ role as a major investor in Bitwise via Craft Ventures since 2017 suggests a potential conflict of interest, as the announcement directly benefited Bitwise and its investors. “These coins are all pumping like crazy on this strategic reserve announcement, which means Bitwise and it’s investors – like David Sacks – are making a ton of money right now .” Said Martin . “Congress must investigate and determine if David Sacks or Donald Trump’s personal investment holdings are driving US crypto policy.” However, in a separate post, Sacks quickly denied the allegations, stating, “I sold all my cryptocurrency (including BTC, ETH, and SOL) before the start of the administration.” He further clarified that he previously held a $74,000 position in the Bitwise ETF, which he sold on January 22. Dismissing claims of “large indirect holdings,” he assured that he would provide an update once the ethics review process is complete. Beyond concerns over insider trading and conflicts of interest, industry leaders have voiced differing opinions on the structure of the U.S. Crypto Reserve. In a tweet, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong suggested that Bitcoin alone might be the best choice, arguing that it provides the clearest narrative as a digital successor to gold. He proposed a market cap-weighted index of top cryptocurrencies to maintain neutrality. Meanwhile, Ki Young Ju, founder of CryptoQuant, offered a more geopolitical perspective, warning that the U.S. could be weaponizing cryptocurrency markets. He asserted that Trump’s policies have shifted moral standards in the industry, favoring assets that align with U.S. national interests. According to Ju, this strategy could marginalize Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have long sought neutrality as global digital assets.",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano|Donald Trump|Ripple|USA|XRP News,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-15 08:45:20

According to an announcement by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), the crypto influencer TJ Stone committed wire fraud, scamming investors out of more than $1.3 million. In the announcement, the DOJ mentioned that Sfraga, who had already pleaded guilty in May 2024, was sentenced in the Eastern District of New York. According to the authorities, TJ Stone lied to investors, posing as the owner of multiple businesses, including Vandelay Contracting Corp, a name he got from the sitcom Seinfeld. Authorities also said he presented himself as an emcee at several crypto events around New York. Sfraga convinced investors to invest in a fake cryptocurrency called virtual wallet, promising them returns as high as 60% over the next three months after their initial deposit. Instead of using the funds for the reasons he was paid, Sfraga was said to have used some of it for personal businesses and to pay off earlier investors, making it a Ponzi-like investment scheme. United States authorities arrest crypto influencer for fraud Aside from the prison sentence, Sfraga has been ordered to pay about $1.3 million in forfeiture, with his restitution amount to be determined at a later date. United States Attorney John Durham mentioned that he stole from several investors including his next-door neighbors and other people he was able to convince to invest in the cryptocurrency. “There was nothing funny about his use of a Seinfeldian company, Vandelay Industries, to carry out this fraud, which caused severe financial and emotional harm to the hard-working men and women who trusted him,” he added. According to the court filing, Sfraga carried out his criminal activities from 2016 to 2022, lying to investors about being the owner of multiple businesses which included Building Strong Homes LLC. Authorities connected his use of Vandelay Contracting Corp to a fictional Vandelay Industries to the TV show called Seinfeld. Authorities added that he defrauded about 17 victims, including investors from Brooklyn, Long Island, and Staten Island. Aside from his illegal crypto business, he also convinced other investors to loan him money or invest in multiple sham businesses, which he said involved purchasing, renovating, and sometimes flipping homes. The court filing noted that he convinced one of his victims to lend him $100,000 in cash to cover start-up costs on a construction project that was non-existence. New York intensifies crypto fraud crackdown United States authorities mentioned that they started looking into Sfraga after several investors filed complaints about him not fulfilling the end of their agreements. The lawsuit led to him fleeing to Arizona to live under a false identity. He was eventually apprehended in Las Vegas after he was arrested for running out on his bill at the Wynn Casino. This latest conviction is part of a broader crackdown on crypto fraud in New York after United States President Donald Trump appointed John Durham as the interim United States Attorney. Other notable cases involve that of SafeMoon CEO Braden John Karony, who has requested a delay in the case because of the shift in the approach to enforcement by the current administration. In addition, there have been some high-profile crypto personalities docked for several crimes that have explored the option of a presidential pardon. According to reports, former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has explored the option while still serving his 25-year jail term. Another personality is former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, who completed a four-month jail term in 2024, but Zhao has denied any interest in a pardon. The recent crypto personality vying for a presidential pardon is Roger Ver nicknamed Bitcoin Jesus, who is currently facing a life sentence for tax evasion and mail fraud. Several influential crypto personalities have spoken up for Ver, urging President Trump to grant him a pardon, with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin campaigning for him. The crypto community is still divided over the issue, with some seeing the case as the same with previously pardoned Ross Ulbricht, while others say he has to face the consequences of his actions.

The latest burn metrics by the coin’s community indicated a staggering 535 million tokens destroyed in the past 7 days. As an upshot, traders and investors eye looming price gains, whilst a renowned market analyst further highlights the potential for a 22% rally soon. Shiba Inu Price Bullish As 535M Tokens Burnt Weekly SHIB coin’s price today gained over 2% intraday and closed in at $0.00001276. The meme coin bottomed and peaked at $0.00001244 and $0.0000129, respectively. For context, the rising price trajectory aligns with the massive blow to the supply brought by a phenomenal weekly burn chronicle. According to the data from Shibburn on X , 535.85 million SHIB tokens were burnt over the past seven days, resulting in a 415% upswing in the weekly burn rate. With this massive burn weighing in, a staggering 410.49 trillion coins have been burnt to date in total. For context, the burn mechanism deals a massive blow to the meme coin’s market supply by sending tokens to a null address. Therefore, crypto market traders and investors anticipate a bolstered effect on Shiba Inu price amid reduced supply, mirroring the law of supply and demand. Intraday Burn Meanwhile, the intraday burn data indicated that 5.11 million coins were destroyed in the past 24 hours. The constant burns further fuel market optimism surrounding the crypto’s long-term price prospects. Notably, a total of 999.99 trillion SHIB tokens were created, of which roughly 410 trillion have been destroyed to date. Yet, market watchers eagerly await phenomenal returns as the current bull cycle halted amid macro heat. Can SHIB Price Gain 22%? Nevertheless, with the broader crypto market showing a recovery trend this weekend, investors remain optimistic about future movements. As mentioned above, Shiba Inu’s price entered the green zone leveraging its burn rate surge today. In the midst of this optimism, a crypto market analyst took to X, revealing crucial price statistics. As per analyst ‘Rose Premium Signals,’ SHIB recently challenged the upper resistance of a falling wedge pattern on the 4H chart, marking a crucial move.

Crypto and Stock Holdings Offloaded Before Trump’s Inauguration Before Donald Trump was sworn in as the 47th U.S. president on January 20, Sacks liquidated all his personal cryptocurrency holdings, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). Craft Ventures also sold off its crypto investments, ensuring that neither Sacks nor his firm held digital assets upon his appointment. Sacks also divested from publicly traded crypto firms such as Coinbase (COIN) and Robinhood (HOOD), along with stakes in private digital asset companies. Furthermore, he exited his limited partner interests in Solana-focused Multichain Capital and Blockchain Capital, while Craft Ventures offloaded its holdings in Multichain Capital and Bitwise Asset Management. Since Trump’s inauguration, the crypto market has experienced a downturn, with many attributing the decline to uncertainty surrounding U.S. interest rates and proposed tariffs. Bitcoin had reached an all-time high of $109,000 just hours before Trump took office, but by February 27, it had fallen below $80,000, wiping out all post-election gains. As of publication, Bitcoin is trading around $84,155, according to CoinMarketCap. The memorandum surfaced one day before Senator Elizabeth Warren sent a March 6 letter demanding that Sacks prove he no longer holds any cryptocurrency. The request followed Sacks’ public statement on X confirming that he had sold all his crypto holdings. Correct. I sold all my cryptocurrency (including BTC, ETH, and SOL) prior to the start of the administration. https://t.co/dN6nuGQUtu — David Sacks (@DavidSacks) March 3, 2025 Warren questioned the timing of Sacks’ divestment, asking for transparency regarding when he and Craft Ventures offloaded their positions and whether individuals close to him benefited from the recent price surge before selling. Sacks’ Views on Crypto Regulation Since assuming his role at the White House, Sacks has been a vocal advocate for the crypto industry. He has pushed for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and warned against excessive taxation on digital assets. Most recently, on the All In Podcast, he rejected the idea of a crypto transaction tax , after host Jason Calacanis proposed a 0.01% tax on all cryptocurrency transactions. “That’s always how taxes start. They are described as being very modest,” Sacks warned, referencing how income tax was initially applied to only a few Americans before expanding to the broader population. President Donald Trump has previously proposed eliminating the federal income tax and replacing it with tariffs on imported goods. He has argued that tariffs once fully funded the U.S. government in the 19th century, a period he described as an era of significant prosperity.

Top Trader Says It Will Happen If This History Repeats,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-to-reach-100-top-trader-says-it-will-happen-if-this-history-repeats/,"Crypto influencer Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) recently sparked a debate on X by comparing today’s skepticism about a $100 XRP price to the doubts surrounding $1 XRP in the early years. His post drew a flood of responses from the community, with some asserting that history is repeating itself and that a three-digit valuation is inevitable. Back the early days of XRP (2013-2016) $1.00 per coin was thought to be impossible I’m seeing similar rhetoric today about a $100 XRP — Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) March 13, 2025 XRP’s Price Trajectory Through the Years XRP was created in 2012 to facilitate fast and efficient cross-border transactions. From 2013 to 2016, its price remained below $0.01, and many investors doubted it would ever reach $1. However, things quickly began to change for the digital asset. In 2017, it experienced an unprecedented rally, rising from fractions of a cent to an all-time high of approximately $3.84 in January 2018. This surge was fueled by speculative interest, a booming cryptocurrency market, and growing institutional adoption of Ripple’s payment solutions. However, the price crashed in 2018 amid a broader market downturn. The SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple in 2020 further suppressed the cryptocurrency’s price , keeping it below $1 for extended periods. While it surpassed this level to hit a multi-year high of $1.96 in 2021, it quickly fell and remained below $1 until late 2024 shortly before former SEC Chair Gary Gensler announced his resignation . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The $100 XRP Target While the asset struggled for years, many criticized the community for their faith in the asset, laughing at the prospect of hitting $1. However, the digital asset hit a multi-year high of $3.39 in January 2025 and has stayed well above $1 since it surpassed that level in November. Although the lawsuit is still ongoing, XRP remains a top cryptocurrency. The debate over its future price trajectory continues, with some predicting that XRP will eventually reach $100. Despite the skepticism from the crypto space, many investors share Cobb’s optimism. One commenter stated , “History repeats itself. $100 XRP is not only possible but inevitable given XRP’s utility and institutional adoption.” Another pointed out that once the asset hits $100, people will say $589 is impossible. Others remained cautious, with one remarking , “Let’s get to 10 first,” while another pointed out , “So many things need to happen for it to even get to $10.” Many experts are convinced that XRP is going to $100 soon , and while multiple factors will determine its trajectory, its short, and long-term outlooks are bullish.

Recent data from Arkham Intelligence shows BlackRock added 268 BTC ($22 million) on March 14, despite ongoing market fluctuations. Beyond Bitcoin, BlackRock also owns 1.2 million ETH ($2.3 billion) alongside other altcoins, showcasing its diversified crypto strategy. More notably, in February 2025, BlackRock integrated its Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) into its model portfolio, a move that could attract institutional investors seeking indirect BTC exposure.

While short-term Bitcoin ETF outflows have spurred market uncertainty, BlackRock’s strategic accumulation suggests long-term confidence, potentially supporting price stability and renewed bullish momentum. U.S. Lawmaker Moves to Secure Bitcoin as National Reserve In a pivotal legislative push, U.S. Representative Byron Donalds is drafting a bill to legalize former President Donald Trump’s executive order establishing the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Trump’s directive, signed on March 7, mandates the government to utilize seized BTC as a national reserve asset. Donalds’ proposal aims to prevent future administrations from dismantling the Bitcoin reserve, ensuring long-term government involvement in digital assets. The bill requires Senate and House approval, and with Republican leadership, the chances of passage appear strong.

Daily Technical Outlook: Bitcoin (BTC/USD) – March 15, 2025 The Bitcoin price today is $83,657, with a 24-hour trading volume of $28.33 billion. Bitcoin has gained 1.46% in the last 24 hours, holding the #1 market ranking with a $1.66 trillion market cap. The circulating supply stands at 19,837,137 BTC, with a fixed maximum of 21 million BTC. Technical Analysis Bitcoin recently broke above a descending trendline, signaling bullish momentum above $82,640—where the 50-period EMA has acted as a key support level. The breakout pushed BTC toward $85,312, its immediate resistance, but momentum has slowed, raising the possibility of a short-term consolidation or a pullback. A break above $85,312 would clear the path toward $88,046 and $91,117, potentially triggering a new leg up in the bull cycle. However, failure to maintain momentum could result in a pullback to $82,640 or lower support levels. Conclusion Bitcoin remains in a critical breakout phase, with $85,312 acting as the make-or-break level. A sustained push higher could send BTC toward $88K-$91K, while a failure to hold momentum may trigger a retracement to $82,640 or lower.

This downturn mirrors the broader economic volatility as investors react to shifting macroeconomic trends and regulatory developments. Despite this short-term decline, the medium-term outlook for the crypto sector remains optimistic. At the start of 2024, the total market cap was just $1.7 trillion, meaning that even after recent corrections, the market has surged by 64% over the past 15 months. This long-term growth trajectory has led investors to seek out bargain opportunities, hoping to acquire undervalued assets before the next major market upswing. Among the promising opportunities available at a low price, three standout options are BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) , Ripple (XRP), and Dogecoin (DOGE). Each of these assets presents a unique value proposition with the potential to deliver substantial returns as the market recovers. BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) is the only presale asset on this list, making it a unique opportunity for investors looking to secure tokens at a fixed price before it enters mainstream exchanges. Priced at $0.002405 per token, BTCBULL has already raised an impressive $3.5 million since the start of its presale, signaling strong investor confidence in its potential. BTC Bull Token: Bitcoin’s Best Crypto Presale The project is closely tied to Bitcoin’s price movements, positioning itself as a direct beneficiary of BTC’s growth. One of its most innovative features is its Bitcoin airdrop mechanism. BTCBULL holders will receive free real Bitcoin airdrops at predetermined price milestones, ensuring added value as Bitcoin’s price appreciates. A major airdrop will take place when BTC hits $250,000, resulting in BTC Bull Token allocating 10% of its entire 21 billion token supply to early presale investors. Additionally, the token burn milestones built into BTCBULL’s framework reduce supply over time, increasing scarcity and, potentially, value. BTC Bull Token’s staking rewards further enhance its attractiveness. With an APY (annual percentage yield) of 121% and 871 million tokens already staked, the project offers significant passive income opportunities for long-term holders. As BTCBULL approaches its exchange listing, anticipation is building for potential price appreciation, mirroring past successes of Bitcoin-linked assets. Visit BTC Bull Token Ripple (XRP) Ripple (XRP) is one of the most widely adopted digital assets in the financial sector, designed by Ripple Labs to facilitate cross-border payments for banks and financial institutions. Despite being the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap at $129 billion, XRP remains one of the most affordable high-cap tokens, currently trading at just $2.23 per coin. For several years, XRP’s growth was hindered by an ongoing lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which created uncertainty and prevented major price breakouts. However, regulatory sentiment has begun shifting, with the SEC retracting several lawsuits against crypto firms since Donald Trump’s return to office. Following Trump’s election victory in November 2024, XRP surged from $0.50 to a peak of $3.30 by January 2025 – an astonishing 560% rally in just a few months. Although the price has since corrected, XRP’s inclusion in Trump’s Crypto Strategic Reserve plan signals potential for further institutional adoption. With its renewed regulatory optimism and previous breakout performance, XRP remains a top bargain buy for investors looking for a major altcoin with strong growth potential. Dogecoin (DOGE) Originally created as a joke in 2013, Dogecoin (DOGE) has since evolved into the largest and most influential meme coin in the market. Despite its lighthearted origins, DOGE has cultivated a dedicated community and gained the backing of high-profile figures like Elon Musk, making it a formidable force in the crypto space. Currently priced at $0.1679, Dogecoin offers an accessible entry point for investors looking to capitalize on its high volatility and history of dramatic price surges. Over the past 30 days, DOGE has seen a sharp 35.7% decline, mirroring broader market trends. However, its history suggests that it could stage a strong comeback in the next bull run. Dogecoin has already experienced a staggering 193,000% increase since its inception and remains 77% below its all-time high of $0.73. Analysts from Crypto News Flash have projected that DOGE could surge to $5 in the future, though its meme-based nature makes it inherently volatile. As a result, Dogecoin may be best suited for investors willing to tolerate high risk in pursuit of outsized rewards.",Press Release,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|DOGE|MARKET|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-15 09:05:57

After briefly stabilizing above $91,000, renewed selling pressure dragged BTC to fresh yearly lows. By mid-Tuesday, the price had plummeted to $87,081, with daily liquidations surpassing $870 million, according to Coinglass data. The broader crypto market also suffered, with total market capitalization dropping 8.9% to $3.01 trillion over the same period. Despite the downturn, Bitcoin whales seized the opportunity to accumulate more BTC. Analysts from IntoTheBlock revealed that large holders acquired approximately $2.35 billion worth of Bitcoin within hours of the drop. “Whales are buying. 26,430 BTC just flowed into whale accumulation addresses, often linked to OTC deals and long-term custody,” the analysts tweeted. Bitcoin’s latest dip coincides with multiple factors contributing to selling pressure. Crypto analyst Nic highlighted that ETF outflows have been significant, with cumulative withdrawals reaching $649 million so far this week. He suggested a slowdown in institutional “cash and carry” trades may also add to the pressure. Macroeconomic uncertainties are further weighing on the market. Nic pointed to postponed tariffs against Mexico and Canada as a possible trigger for recent sell-offs. Additionally, Bitcoin’s break below its 100-day moving average, an important historical support level, raises concerns. Based on on-chain data, he suggested that BTC could find support for around $71,600, aligning with the lower standard deviation of the short-term holder (STH) cost basis. Former Bitmex CEO Arthur Hayes also shared his outlook, attributing the drop to ETF sales, hinting at further downsides for Bitcoin. “Bitcoin goblin town incoming: Lots of $IBIT holders are hedge funds that went long ETF short CME futures to earn a yield greater than where they fund, short-term US treasuries,” Hayes tweeted . “If that basis drops as $BTC falls, these funds will sell $IBIT and buy back CME futures. These funds are in profit, and given basis is close to UST yields, they will unwind during US hours and realize their profit. $70,000 I see you” . However, other analysts remain cautiously optimistic. On Monday, Darkfost from CryptoQuant noted that the 30-day retail demand indicator has returned to the neutral zone at 0%, a shift that preceded price rebounds. “This marks a significant shift from the previous highly negative value of approximately -21%, a level not seen since 2021. Notably, past instances of recovering retail demand have often coincided with upward price movements in the short-term (several weeks or months).” He wrote. Elsewhere, analyst Rekt Capital stressed the importance of Bitcoin reclaiming the $96,700 level by the end of February. According to him, a monthly close above this level would confirm a breakout from the bullish flag formation, potentially setting the stage for a renewed uptrend. At press time, BTC was trading at $83,940 reflecting a 1.44% upsurge in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|LUNA,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-15 09:08:27

According to a White House fact sheet, the president’s action eliminates non-statutory functions and reduces others that are considered “unnecessary” for these entities. Trump’s order seeks to downsize “unnecessary” U.S. government entities Mass firings across multiple federal agencies have defined the first months of President Trump’s second term as the administration attempts to strip the executive branch of many powerful assets unilaterally. Elon Musk’s “D.O.G.E,” along with agencies like the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), are choking off services to the public by incapacitating the agencies that are legally bound to deliver them. Trump’s administration is still preparing to further reduce agency capacity through reductions in force, or RIFs. This time, they will target employees who do not work during a government shutdown. Furthermore, on February 11, President Trump issued Executive Order 14210, directing agencies to use “efficiency improvements and attrition” to shrink the federal workforce. According to the order, agency heads were told to “promptly undertake preparations to initiate large-scale reductions in force (RIFs).” On Friday, Trump ordered cuts to eight federal agencies, including the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which oversees Voice of America and other news outlets. The move also impacts the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, the Woodrow Wilson Center, the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the Interagency Council on Homelessness, the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, the Minority Business Development Agency, and the Arctic Research Commission, potentially affecting many workers. According to the White House fact sheet, cutting these governmental entities will save taxpayers dollars, reduce unnecessary government spending, and streamline government priorities. The White House even shared an X post quoting Elon Musk’s words: “It’s not optional for us to reduce the federal expenses. IT’S ESSENTIAL.” However, opponents are turning to courts to impose restrictions on their cost-cutting plans. U.S. judges order the Trump administration to reinstate thousands of fired workers Following the rising concerns of the firing of federal workers, federal judges in California and Maryland on Thursday ordered the U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration to reinstate thousands of probationary federal workers who lost their jobs as part of mass firings carried out at 19 agencies. The court’s decision was the biggest setback for Trump and his top adviser, Elon Musk, in their attempt to significantly reduce the size of the federal bureaucracy. James Bredar, U.S. District Judge in Baltimore, concurred and opened a new tab with 20 Democratic-led states, finding that 18 of the agencies that had mass-fired probationary employees in recent weeks had broken rules about federal employee layoffs. Bredar’s restraining order covered agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the U.S. Agency for International Development. The Trump administration has targeted these three organizations for cost-cutting and deregulatory measures. Other agencies covered by the judge’s order include the U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Labor, Transportation, Treasury, and Veterans Affairs. Moreover, the judge said the administration’s argument that it dismissed each employee for performance or other individualized reasons was untrue. Therefore, the job cuts would be considered a mass layoff, requiring the states, which are obligated to support their newly unemployed citizens, to give advance notice. Bredar wrote, “The sheer number of employees that were terminated in a matter of days belies any argument that these terminations were due to the employees’ individual unsatisfactory performance or conduct.” During a hearing in San Francisco, the U.S. District Judge William Alsup had also ordered the reinstatement of probationary employees terminated at six agencies, including the U.S. Department of Defense.

Solaxy aims to introduce a Layer-2 (L2) scaling solution for Solana, designed to address the blockchain’s ongoing congestion and network issues. Despite launching in a period of broader market downturn – where the overall crypto space is down 3.23% in the last 24 hours and Solana meme coins have dropped by 8.4% – Solaxy’s presale has continued to surge.

This model is expected to improve processing speeds while reducing congestion significantly. Beyond its scalability upgrades, Solaxy plans to introduce a highly flexible framework tailored for developers, allowing them to build optimized decentralized applications (dApps). Additionally, Solaxy is working toward cross-chain interoperability, which would enable seamless asset transfers between Solana and Ethereum. This integration aims to combine Solana’s speed and affordability with Ethereum’s liquidity and established ecosystem, potentially increasing SOLX adoption and overall market value. Why Are Analysts Keeping an Eye on Solaxy? Solaxy’s record-breaking presale has drawn the attention of leading crypto analysts and influencers. One of them is ClayBro, a popular YouTuber with over 136,000 subscribers, who has described Solaxy as one of the most promising presales of the year. Over $26,000,000 So Far! Crypto Is Rebounding And Solaxy Token Could Lead The Way! In a recent video, ClayBro highlighted that while crypto markets have been struggling in the short term, meme coin and crypto search volume are reaching all-time highs. As Solana’s trading volume and investor activity grow, its network congestion is expected to increase, creating demand for a Layer 2 scaling solution like Solaxy. Given its strong presale performance, ClayBro suggests that Solaxy has significant long-term growth potential. ClayBro also cautioned that, like any new crypto investment, there are inherent risks. He emphasized that investors should always do their own research and invest only what they can afford to lose. Earn Rewards With Solaxy’s Staking Program Beyond its Layer-2 developments, Solaxy offers an attractive staking model that allows token holders to earn a passive income. With an annual percentage yield (APY) of 156%, the staking rewards are among the highest in the industry. From a total supply of 138.046 billion tokens, more than 7.3 billion SOLX tokens have already been staked. This reflects strong investor confidence in the project’s long-term vision and potential. Get Involved in the Solaxy Presale Solaxy’s promised Layer-2 solution, along with its surging presale success, has positioned it as one of the most anticipated crypto projects of 2025. While the project is still in its presale phase, its continued success and investor demand could set the stage for significant growth post-launch. Investors looking to participate in the presale can purchase SOLX tokens directly from the official Solaxy presale website . The platform supports multiple payment options, including ETH, USDT, BNB, and Credit Card options. SOLX tokens are also available for purchase through the Best Wallet app , which is available for download on both Google Play and the Apple App Store.

A Santiment report highlights that on March 12, the on-chain activity of Tether (USDT) reached a six-month high, with over 143,000 wallets transferring USDT in a single day. Notably, since January 1, the aggregate stablecoin supply has also increased by $20.17 billion (+10.9%), now surpassing $205 billion, according to Glassnode data. Stablecoins—digital assets pegged to traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar—serve as a reliable store of value for investors during periods of high market volatility. As their scope expands with increasing use cases in cross-border payments, and as they gain institutional and financial acceptance, CoinGape speaks exclusively with Mark Boiron, CEO of Polygon Labs in this #PoweTalk.Sta With Polygon PoS emerging as the third-largest blockchain for on-chain stablecoin transactions, Boiron discusses the growing role of stablecoins, evolving regulatory landscape, and future prospects. He also explores whether stablecoins could replace traditional payment rails and whether they can coexist with Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) in the future. Polygon Labs CEO Marc Boiron begins, “Stablecoins are making it faster and cheaper to move money across borders—whether you’re an individual or a business. And as yield-bearing stablecoins gain traction, especially in 2025, they’ll likely become a bigger draw for traditional financial players, opening up even more opportunities in the space. This shift is massive, and it’s just getting started.” First appearing on the Web3 landscape in 2014, stablecoins are combining the technological benefits of Blockchain such as transparency, efficiency and programmability, with the financial stability needed for quick adoption in the real-world. This include Fiat-pegged stablecoins such as USD-pegged Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC); commodity-pegged such as PAX Gold (PAXG), Tether Gold (XAUT), and Crypto-backed Stablecoins such as Dai (DAI). Stablecoins moving beyond Applications of Trading and Speculation Evolving from their mere applications of speculation and trading with BitUSD (on BitShares) and NuBits among the first stablecoins, Stablecoins are emerging as a reliable asset for cross-border payments, peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions. They are enabling cheap and fast cross-border money transfers, bypassing traditional banking fees and delays. They are also acting as the on-ramp to DeFi by facilitating lending, borrowing yield farming for many DeFi protocols. For instance, Aave & Compound offer stablecoin-based loans, enabling users to lend stablecoins to earn interest or use them as collateral for crypto loans. Stablecoins have moved far beyond just crypto trading—they’re now playing a big role in things like cross-border payments, remittances, and corporate treasuries. Over the next few years, I see stablecoins becoming a key part of the global financial system. We’re already seeing a market cap of over $200 billion, but that’s just the beginning. To put it in perspective, the U.S. M2 money supply is over $21 trillion, so we’re still under 1% penetration. Hitting $3 trillion by 2030 is totally within reach, and that would only be about 15% of the current M2 supply,” explains CEO Marc. In another new instance of stabelcoins usecases, Binance, the leading global Crypto exchange, recently secured a $2 billion investment from tech investor MGX, marking it the largest crypto-related deal conducted using stablecoins. Highlighting the growing utility of stablecoins in VC Fundings and Investments as well, Binance deal was followed by another stablecoin supported funding of $82M received by Mesh , as reported by CoinGape. Source: https://x.com/glassnode/status/1900146408407114107 Will Stablecoins Replace Traditional Payment Rails No doubt, stablecoins offer faster, cheaper and borderless transactions, in comparison to their traditional counterparts of banking payment rail such as SWIFT and Visa. While traditional cross-border transactions via SWIFT can take 1–5 business days to settle due to multiple intermediaries, stablecoins since they operate on blockchains networks, can settle such transactions in seconds to minutes, regardless of geography. Further, transactions by them cost fractions of a cent in comparision to traditional payment rails, implying significant cost savings for the users. But on the queston of whether stablecoins would end up replacing traditional payment systems, CEO Marc says, “Traditional payment systems are due for an upgrade, and stablecoins are stepping in to offer a much-needed solution. While they won’t replace existing systems overnight, they already provide clear benefits like faster global transactions, lower costs, and greater accessibility, making them an increasingly appealing choice.” Further, with the growing adoption and development of stablecoins, traditional payment systems can also taking cues from it – in order to stay relevant in the rapidly growing scenario of borderless payments. Visa and PayPal are already integrating USDC & PYUSD for payments while JPMorgan’s Onyx blockchain is using tokenized dollars for real-time settlements. Prominent Players Entering as Stablecoin Issuers Amid the growing acceptance of stablecoins among regulators around the world, some of the World’s largest banks and Fintech are also rushing to launch their own stablecoins. Notable entrants include Bank of America with the bank signalling last month that it is exploring the issuance of its own stablecoin to enhance cross-border payment efficiency and reduce transaction costs. CEO Marc points out, “Even companies that aren’t traditionally in crypto are jumping on board. Launching a stablecoin isn’t just about making money—it’s also a way to attract new users and create stronger communities. For consumers, this means cheaper, faster, and more efficient payment options, especially for things like remittances, where traditional systems often hit you with high fees. Take Tether’s massive $2.5 billion profit last year as an example—it’s no surprise so many companies are eager to get involved. Plus, the regulatory landscape is shifting in favor of crypto, with Europe’s MiCA regulation offering more clarity and the U.S. likely to follow suit. This combination of profit potential and clearer rules is pushing stablecoins into the spotlight, and consumers are poised to benefit from the improvements to payment systems.” In 2023, PayPal introduced PayPal USD (PYUSD), a USD-pegged stablecoin integrated into its existing payment platform while Stripe recently acquired Bridge, a stablecoin orchestration platform, for $1.1 billion, to enhance cross-border payment processing capabilities. Revolut, the fintech company is also venturing into the stablecoin sector. Notably, in December 2024, Ripple, XRP’s largest issuer. also launched its stablecoin, RLUSD, pegged to the U.S. Dollar, after receiving an approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). Challenges and the Evolving Regulatory Environment Governments and financial regulators worldwide are still debating how to classify and regulate stablecoins (as securities, commodities, or digital payments). Jurisdictions like the U.S. and the EU have different approaches, making global compliance difficult. However, in a recent move that augurs well for the regulatory scenario of stablecoins, the US Senate is set to vote on the “GENIUS Act,” a bill co-sponsored by Senators Bill Hagerty and Kirsten Gillibrand, which seeks to grant federal legitimacy to stablecoins and promote their mainstream adoption. When it comes to stablecoin regulations, Europe is definitely leading the way with MiCA. The U.S. is likely to follow suit with an approach that achieves the same goal, and Asia will probably have its own regulations tailored to the region. Looking ahead five years, I think we’ll have a well-regulated global stablecoin ecosystem with clear rules and standards. This will open the door for stablecoins to be used in everyday retail transactions, just like cash or credit cards. On the Competition with CBDCs Some governments are pushing for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), but I think private stablecoins and CBDCs will end up coexisting rather than one dominating the other. They serve different but complementary roles, each with its own strengths. Notably, the European Central Bank (ECB) is actively working on a Digital Euro, expected to enter its preparation phase by 2025. However, China is leading the CBDC race with the Digital Yuan (e-CNY), developed by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC). It has been piloted in major cities like Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen and the Winter Olympics of 2022 in Beijing was the first large-scale international use case of the Digital Yuan. Stablecoins to become Everyday Tool by 2030, says Marc Stablecoins offer efficiency, stability, and accessibility in digital finance, but they also face significant challenges across regulatory, economic, and technological fronts. For instance, as with all digital assets, stablecoins can present money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risks. If I had to make a bold prediction about stablecoins in 2030, I’d say they will be the go-to form of digital payment worldwide, with a market cap that could easily surpass $5 trillion. We’ll see them integrated into nearly every major financial app and service, making transactions smoother and more efficient for everyone. The technology is already there, capable of supporting widespread use. The main hurdles are regulatory and educational. Once those are addressed, they could become a common, everyday payment method, making things faster, cheaper, and more efficient for consumers. By 2030, the line between traditional finance and crypto will be pretty much gone, with stablecoins playing a key role in bringing everyday users into the Web3 space. Central banks will have embraced private stablecoins as part of their broader monetary policies, recognizing the benefits they bring to the table. The real game-changer, though, is how they will make financial services available to billions of people who are currently underserved by traditional banks. They’ll be the tool that helps democratize access to the global economy, making it easier for people around the world to take part in the digital financial world. For users, this means faster, cheaper, and more inclusive financial services that open up opportunities for growth and financial freedom.

Though he refrained from making direct accusations, his comments have started a new speculation about the events that shook the crypto market. Did FTX Play a Role in the LUNA Collapse? CZ responded to a post by an FTX creditor, @Mbottjer, who revealed that 3AC had recently outbusted proofs indicating that FTX had liquidated $1.53 billion worth of its assets just two weeks before 3AC collapsed. The claim, which has been approved by a judge, adds another layer to the complex web of crypto failures that rocked the industry. https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1900445304371241161 CZ called this an “interesting turn of events” and admitted it was news to him. He then questioned whether there was a link between FTX and the collapse of Terraform Labs’ LUNA token and UST stablecoin in May 2022. That crash sent shockwaves through the market, dragging down Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Was it Planned? In response to CZ’s remarks, Crypto analyst MartyParty stated that he had already revealed on-chain evidence showing Celsius and FTX withdrawing massive amounts of UST from the liquidity pool at the exact moment the market was vulnerable. According to him, both firms executed $200 million UST withdrawals, triggering the stablecoin’s depeg and ultimately causing the LUNA meltdown. His statement adds weight to theories that powerful players in the crypto space may have intentionally orchestrated the collapse. If true, it would mean the 2022 market crash wasn’t just a result of bad risk management but a coordinated attack. CZ’s Book Will Address These Controversies—But With Caution A user on X suggested that the entire FTX scoop deserved a documentary series, to which CZ responded that he had thought about this connection while writing his book. However, he made it clear that he found no concrete evidence, saying, “I didn’t want to speculate; there were rumors, but I never saw hard evidence.” CZ has already completed a 114,000-word draft of his book and has printed a physical copy. However, he believes it will take three times the effort to refine it before it’s ready for publication. Given the controversies surrounding FTX, 3AC, and Binance itself, the book could provide an insider’s perspective on the crypto industry’s most chaotic years. What’s Next for CZ’s Book? With the crypto world still recovering from the aftermath of the 2022 crashes, CZ’s book is expected to shed light on key industry events from his point of view. Whether it will contain major revelations or remain a personal reflection, the anticipation is growing. For now, CZ remains careful with his words, ensuring that his account sticks to facts rather than speculation.",News,EN,0,0,LUNA|MARKET|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-15 09:13:51

In a new strategy session, the analyst pseudonymously known as DonAlt tells 66,000 subscribers of the TechnicalRoundup YouTube channel that he believes XRP has more upside potential and could outperform other crypto assets including Ethereum ( ETH ). “I’m a big XRP believer in the sense that I think the XRP price is going to go up, just generally. I think it’s the best. And I’ve been saying this since [it was priced at] $0.60. I think it’s the best coin to capture altcoin strength this entire market cycle.” XRP is trading at $2.30 at time of writing, up by around 342% from the November 1st, 2024 price of around $0.52. The pseudonymous analyst, however, says that while XRP possesses more upside potential than Ethereum, the latter would be a better crypto asset to hold during a downturn. “If the market goes down, you’re going to be more happy having ETH than XRP. But if the market goes up, you’re going to massively outperform with XRP.” Ethereum is trading at $1,900 at time of writing, down by around 31% from the November 1st, 2024 price of about $2,500. Next up is Bitcoin ( BTC ). According to the pseudonymous analyst, Bitcoin’s recovery after falling to around $76,600 earlier this week is “good” but further downside corrections could indicate a bearish tilt. “We bounced quite a bit before support [at slightly below $72,000], which I find good. I really don’t want to see us trade below $80,000 for too long. I generally think if we retest $70,000, that’s a massive sign of weakness. And it’s going to be much harder to come back from that.” Bitcoin is trading at $84,319 at time of writing.

The initial crypto FUD in the past few weeks was largely overshadowed by positive sentiment from the United States in the last two days. Furthermore, Bitcoin price led the wider altcoin industry in mirroring gold bullish outlook as major stock indexes recorded mild rebounds. Factors Influencing Cardano and XRP Rally Today Clear Regulatory Outlook from the U.S. SEC As Coinpedia reported, the U.S. SEC acknowledged the role of XRP and Cardano in the country’s digital economy. Whereby the agency noted that XRP will play a crucial role in state-level financial transactions, optimizing government payments, and enabling interbank liquidity. On the other hand, the agency noted in the proposal that Cardano is best suited for academic credentialing, smart contracts for government services, and secure infrastructure management. Rising Adoption from Institutional Investors Following the notable interest of Cardano by the United States, institutional investors have made strategic moves to adopt ADA before the anticipated altseason. On Friday, Coinbase Global announced that it has filed with the U.S. CFTC to offer Cardano futures, with the product expected to go live on March 31, 2025.

41691685,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=140257,1742030264,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crucial Revelation: Ripple CTO Confirms RLUSD Can Be Frozen for Regulatory Compliance,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/rlusd-stablecoin-crypto-regulation/,"The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with discussions around regulation and compliance, and a recent revelation from Ripple’s CTO, David Schwartz, has added fuel to the fire. It appears Ripple’s upcoming dollar-pegged stablecoin, RLUSD, is designed with a crucial feature: it can be frozen or seized if legal and regulatory obligations demand it. This news, initially reported by BeInCrypto, has sparked conversations about the balance between decentralization and regulatory adherence in the burgeoning stablecoin market. Let’s delve into what this means for RLUSD and the broader landscape of stablecoin regulation . What is RLUSD and Why a Ripple Stablecoin? Before diving into the regulatory aspects, it’s important to understand what RLUSD is and why Ripple, a major player in the crypto space, is venturing into the stablecoin arena. RLUSD is Ripple’s newly announced dollar-pegged stablecoin, intended to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the world of digital assets. But why is Ripple, known for its XRP cryptocurrency and enterprise solutions, launching a Ripple stablecoin ? Expanding Ripple’s Ecosystem: A stablecoin allows Ripple to broaden its offerings beyond XRP and cater to a wider range of financial applications, including payments, DeFi, and trading. Facilitating Enterprise Adoption: A compliant and reliable stablecoin like RLUSD can encourage greater adoption of blockchain technology by institutions and businesses seeking stable digital currencies for transactions and settlements. Capitalizing on Stablecoin Demand: The stablecoin market has witnessed explosive growth, indicating a strong demand for digital assets that offer price stability. RLUSD positions Ripple to tap into this lucrative market. Essentially, RLUSD is a strategic move by Ripple to solidify its position in the crypto industry by providing a regulated and enterprise-grade RLUSD stablecoin solution. The Revelation: RLUSD Can Be Frozen for Regulatory Compliance Now, let’s address the core of the news: David Schwartz’s confirmation that RLUSD can be frozen or seized. This isn’t a bug; it’s a feature, designed to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory frameworks. According to Schwartz, this functionality is not only permissible but necessary for issuers to operate within the bounds of the law. What does this mean in practical terms? Legal and Regulatory Obligations: Issuers of stablecoins, like traditional financial institutions, are subject to various laws and regulations. This includes obligations to comply with court orders, sanctions, and other legal mandates. Off-Ledger Actions: Schwartz clarified that actions taken outside the blockchain, such as court orders, can necessitate modifications to the on-chain obligations related to RLUSD. This could involve freezing or seizing funds to comply with legal directives. Reserve Maintenance: To maintain the 1:1 peg with the US dollar, RLUSD issuers are obligated to hold reserves equal to the total supply of the stablecoin. This reserve backing is crucial for maintaining stability and investor confidence. In essence, the ability to freeze or seize RLUSD is presented as a necessary mechanism for Ripple to operate within the existing legal and crypto regulation landscape. This feature is not unique to RLUSD; many centralized stablecoins incorporate similar controls to ensure compliance. Understanding Stablecoin Regulation and Digital Asset Compliance The discussion around RLUSD’s features highlights the broader context of stablecoin regulation and digital asset compliance . Regulators worldwide are increasingly focusing on stablecoins due to their potential systemic importance and their growing integration with the traditional financial system. Here’s why compliance is becoming a central theme: Aspect Importance for Stablecoin Regulation Financial Stability Regulators are concerned with maintaining financial stability and preventing risks associated with stablecoin runs or failures. Reserve requirements and regulatory oversight are key. Consumer Protection Protecting consumers from fraud, manipulation, and loss is paramount. Regulations aim to ensure transparency, accountability, and adequate safeguards for stablecoin holders. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) Stablecoins, like any financial instrument, can be used for illicit activities. AML and CTF regulations require issuers to implement measures to prevent and detect illegal use. Systemic Risk Mitigation As stablecoins become more interconnected with the financial system, regulators are focused on mitigating systemic risks that could arise from their widespread adoption. Therefore, features like the ability to freeze or seize assets are often seen as necessary tools for stablecoin issuers to meet these regulatory expectations and ensure digital asset compliance . Implications and Considerations: Centralization vs. Decentralization While regulatory compliance is crucial, the ability to freeze or seize RLUSD also brings to the forefront the ongoing debate about centralization versus decentralization in the crypto space. For proponents of decentralization, this feature might raise concerns. Points to Consider: Centralized Control: The ability to freeze or seize funds inherently implies a degree of centralized control over RLUSD. This contrasts with the ethos of some cryptocurrencies that prioritize decentralization and censorship resistance. Transparency and Due Process: It becomes crucial to understand the processes and conditions under which RLUSD can be frozen or seized. Transparency around these procedures and ensuring due process are essential to maintain user trust. User Concerns: Users holding RLUSD might have concerns about the potential for their funds to be frozen, even if for legitimate regulatory reasons. Balancing security and compliance with user autonomy is a key challenge. Broader Crypto Ecosystem: The approach taken with RLUSD could set a precedent for other stablecoins and digital assets, influencing the future trajectory of crypto regulation and the balance between centralized and decentralized systems. Ultimately, the design of RLUSD reflects the pragmatic reality of operating within existing legal frameworks. While it might not align perfectly with the ideals of complete decentralization, it underscores the increasing need for compliance as the crypto industry matures and seeks broader mainstream adoption. The key will be finding the right balance that fosters innovation while ensuring the safety and stability of the financial system. Conclusion: Navigating the Regulatory Maze David Schwartz’s confirmation that RLUSD can be frozen or seized is not necessarily a surprising revelation in the context of evolving stablecoin regulation . It highlights the ongoing efforts to bring digital assets within established legal and regulatory frameworks. For Ripple, this feature is likely a strategic imperative to ensure RLUSD can operate compliantly and gain acceptance from both regulators and institutional users. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, the interplay between decentralization, regulation, and compliance will remain a central theme, shaping the future of digital currencies and their role in the global financial system.

Carney Closes Gap on Polymarket with BTC-Friendly Poilievre,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/03/15/new-canadian-p-m-carney-closes-gap-on-polymarket-with-btc-friendly-poilievre,"Newly elected Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who recently won a leadership contest of the Liberal Party to replace Justin Trudeau , has dramatically increased his odds of winning the next federal election in the eyes of Polymarket bettors. Carney now has a 49% chance of winning the next Canadian election, compared to 26% a month ago. Conservative opposition leader Pierre Poilievre's chances are at 51%, down from 72% in February. The next Canadian federal election is scheduled to occur on October 20, 2025. However, under Canada's Westminster system, if the opposition Conservatives and NDP jointly vote against the minority Liberal government on a confidence motion after Parliament resumes from prorogation on March 24, requested by Trudeau on Jan. 6 , as he announced his resignation plans pending a new Liberal leader, the government would fall, triggering an election. Carney closing the gap against Poilievre on Polymarket – despite a lag between prediction markets and the polls – echoes what the polls are showing. The Conservatives are just one percentage point ahead of the Liberals, according to Canadian pollster Nanos Research , down from nearly a 16-point lead a month ago according to a polling average. Observers credit this dramatic shift to trade threats from the U.S., with pollsters indicating Canadians prefer Carney's business sense and central bank experience over his opponent. This is all a bit of a contrast to last year's U.S. election, where prediction markets consistently showed that then-Republican candidate Donald Trump had a lead over his Democratic opponents. The election result, as CoinDesk wrote in an editorial at the time , was only a surprise to those who get their information from CNN. Crypto on the Canadian campaign trail? Crypto doesn't seem to be a major plank of a hypothetical Canadian election. While Poilievre holds a Canadian-issued BTC ETF , according to disclosures, and has previously made pro-blockchain and crypto comments , most of the campaign rhetoric appears to be about the trade war. Likewise, Carney, who has made mixed if not skeptical comments on crypto in his role as Bank of England governor hasn't yet spoken about the topic in his new role as Liberal leader.",Markets,EN,0,0,MARKET|FIAT|BTC|BUSINESS|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-15 09:18:11

The recent movements in the US Dollar Strength and the Euro Dollar Exchange Rate are prime examples. As crypto traders navigate volatility, understanding macroeconomic factors driving fiat currencies like the dollar and euro becomes increasingly crucial. Today, the dollar is exhibiting resilience, inching upwards as traders brace for the release of the closely watched Michigan consumer sentiment data. Meanwhile, the euro is experiencing a slip, creating ripples across the forex landscape. What does this mean for the broader financial ecosystem, and how can it inform your crypto strategies? Decoding the Dollar’s Ascent: What’s Fueling US Dollar Strength? The US Dollar Strength is often seen as a barometer of global economic confidence. When the dollar strengthens, it typically reflects investor sentiment leaning towards the perceived safety and stability of the US economy. Several factors are currently contributing to the dollar’s upward trajectory: Anticipation of Economic Data: The market is keenly awaiting the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index. Positive data is expected to reinforce the narrative of a robust US economy, further bolstering the dollar. Safe-Haven Demand: In times of global economic uncertainty or geopolitical tensions, the US dollar often benefits from safe-haven flows. While not currently in a crisis mode, underlying economic anxieties can still drive investors towards the dollar. Interest Rate Differentials: The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy and interest rate stance play a significant role in dollar strength. Expectations regarding future rate hikes or the maintenance of current high rates can make the dollar more attractive to yield-seeking investors. But is this surge sustainable? Let’s consider some potential headwinds: Data Dependency: The dollar’s current strength is heavily reliant on positive economic data. A disappointing Michigan sentiment reading could quickly reverse its gains. Global Economic Slowdown: While the US economy shows resilience, concerns about a global economic slowdown persist. A significant downturn could eventually weigh on the dollar as well. Overvaluation Risks: Continued dollar appreciation could lead to concerns about overvaluation, potentially triggering a correction down the line. Euro Under Pressure: Analyzing the Euro Dollar Exchange Rate Dip Conversely, the euro is currently facing headwinds, leading to a slip in the Euro Dollar Exchange Rate . Several factors are contributing to the euro’s weakness: Economic Growth Concerns: The Eurozone economy faces more pronounced growth challenges compared to the US. High energy prices, inflation, and the ongoing impact of geopolitical events are weighing on the region’s economic outlook. ECB Monetary Policy: While the European Central Bank (ECB) has also been raising interest rates to combat inflation, the pace and magnitude of these hikes, and the overall economic outlook for the Eurozone, may be perceived as less supportive for the euro compared to the dollar. Risk Sentiment: Periods of heightened risk aversion can sometimes disproportionately impact the euro, as investors may favor the dollar as a safer alternative. However, it’s crucial to remember that currency markets are dynamic. The euro also has potential catalysts for recovery: Improved Economic Data: Positive surprises in Eurozone economic data could shift sentiment and provide support for the euro. ECB Hawkishness: If the ECB signals a more aggressive stance on inflation and further rate hikes, it could boost the euro. Resolution of Geopolitical Risks: Any easing of geopolitical tensions affecting the Eurozone could improve investor confidence and support the euro. Michigan Consumer Sentiment Data: The Key Catalyst All eyes are now on the upcoming release of the Michigan Michigan Consumer Sentiment data. This report is a crucial gauge of consumer confidence in the US, reflecting how optimistic or pessimistic households are about the economy. Why is this data so important for the forex market? Economic Health Indicator: Consumer sentiment is a leading indicator of economic activity. Strong sentiment typically translates to increased spending, driving economic growth. Fed Policy Implications: The Federal Reserve closely monitors consumer sentiment as it influences spending and inflation. Strong data could reinforce the Fed’s hawkish stance, supporting further dollar strength. Market Volatility Trigger: Unexpectedly strong or weak sentiment data can trigger significant volatility in the forex market, particularly in the Euro Dollar Exchange Rate . Scenario Analysis: Michigan Sentiment Data Outcomes Scenario Michigan Sentiment Data Potential Dollar Impact Potential Euro/Dollar Impact Positive Surprise Data exceeds expectations Further Dollar Strengthening Euro likely to weaken against Dollar In Line with Expectations Data meets forecasts Dollar strength may be maintained, but less pronounced Euro/Dollar may see limited movement Negative Surprise Data falls short of expectations Potential Dollar Weakening Euro could potentially strengthen against Dollar Navigating Forex Market Trends: Actionable Insights for Crypto Traders Understanding Forex Market Trends , especially the dynamics between the dollar and euro, can provide valuable context for crypto traders. Here’s how you can leverage this information: Risk Assessment: Dollar strength often correlates with risk-off sentiment in broader markets. Monitoring dollar movements can help gauge overall market risk appetite, influencing your crypto trading decisions. Stablecoin Strategies: Stablecoins pegged to the US dollar can be affected by dollar fluctuations. A strengthening dollar might increase the relative purchasing power of dollar-pegged stablecoins against other assets, including cryptocurrencies. Macroeconomic Awareness: Being aware of macroeconomic factors driving forex markets enhances your overall understanding of global financial flows, which can indirectly impact crypto markets. Diversification Considerations: Forex market analysis can inform diversification strategies. Understanding currency trends might lead you to consider diversifying into assets that are less correlated with the dollar or euro. Looking Ahead: Currency Market Outlook and Potential Shifts The Currency Market Outlook remains dynamic and subject to various evolving factors. While the dollar currently holds a stronger position, several potential shifts could alter the landscape: Global Growth Trajectory: The relative growth performance of the US versus the Eurozone and other major economies will be a key driver of currency valuations. Central Bank Policies: Future monetary policy decisions by the Federal Reserve, ECB, and other central banks will significantly impact currency movements. Geopolitical Developments: Unforeseen geopolitical events can trigger sudden shifts in currency valuations as investors react to changing risk perceptions. Inflation Dynamics: The trajectory of inflation and how central banks respond will continue to be a major factor influencing currency markets. In conclusion, the dollar’s current edge reflects a confluence of factors, primarily driven by anticipation of positive US economic data and ongoing concerns about the Eurozone economy. The Michigan consumer sentiment data release is a pivotal event that could either solidify the dollar’s gains or trigger a reversal. For crypto traders, keeping an eye on these forex market dynamics provides valuable insights into broader market sentiment and macroeconomic trends, aiding in more informed decision-making in the volatile world of digital assets.

According to Mandell, if the Bitcoin price were to be between $80,000 and $84,000 at the exact close of the day yesterday London time (UTC0), this would mean that the rally would continue and possibly reach $100,000 by the end of this month. If the BTC price were to close above $84,000, it would also signal a drop and mean that the recent recovery rally would fail. However, according to the analyst, if the Bitcoin price were to close at exactly $84,000, this would indicate “historical movements.” Last night, in an event that was met with great surprise by the cryptocurrency community, at exactly 00:00 London time, the BTC price closed at $83,980, according to Coinbase data. Mandell said that since it is not exactly $84,000, this means the current modest rally will continue. Chart showing BTC price above $84,000 at closing time.

41692219,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=140254,1742031016,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Visionary Move: SoftBank’s $676M Investment Fuels Japan’s AI Revolution with OpenAI,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/softbank-openai-japan-ai-data-center/,"In a groundbreaking move that underscores the escalating global race in artificial intelligence, SoftBank has announced a massive $676 million investment to acquire a former Sharp LCD plant in Osaka, Japan. This strategic acquisition is not just about real estate; it’s a bold declaration of SoftBank’s commitment to spearheading Japan’s AI Data Center infrastructure and deepening its collaboration with AI powerhouse OpenAI. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors keenly observing technological shifts, this development signifies the growing importance of robust computational power – the very backbone that supports blockchain networks and the burgeoning field of decentralized AI. Let’s dive into why this deal is a game-changer and what it means for the future of AI and Japan’s tech landscape. Why is SoftBank Investing Heavily in an AI Data Center in Japan? SoftBank’s hefty investment into converting a Sharp plant into a cutting-edge AI Data Center is driven by several key factors: Strategic Autonomy in AI: SoftBank aims to establish a strong, independent AI operation in its home market. This move reduces reliance on external AI infrastructure and strengthens Japan’s position in the global AI arena. Fueling Generative AI Growth: The explosion of generative AI models like those from OpenAI demands massive computational resources. Data centers are the engine rooms that power the training and deployment of these advanced models. SoftBank recognizes this critical need and is proactively building capacity. OpenAI Collaboration: The data center is explicitly linked to SoftBank’s partnership with OpenAI. This facility will likely serve as a crucial hub for deploying and potentially developing OpenAI’s advanced AI models specifically for the Japanese market through their joint venture, SB OpenAI Japan. Market Opportunity: Japan, like many nations, is eager to harness the transformative power of AI across various sectors. SoftBank is positioning itself to capitalize on this growing demand by providing the necessary infrastructure and services. Essentially, SoftBank is not just buying a plant; it’s investing in the future of AI and Japan’s technological competitiveness on a global scale. This is reminiscent of the early days of the internet boom, where infrastructure investments laid the foundation for today’s digital giants. For the crypto world, this highlights the parallel need for scalable and decentralized infrastructure to support the next wave of blockchain innovation. OpenAI and SoftBank: A Powerful Partnership for Japan AI Advancement The collaboration between OpenAI and SoftBank is central to this data center initiative. Here’s a breakdown of what this partnership entails: Joint Venture – SB OpenAI Japan: This JV is specifically designed to bring OpenAI ’s foundational AI models to the Japanese market. It’s not just about importing technology; it’s about tailoring and innovating for local needs. Customized AI Agents: SB OpenAI Japan plans to train AI models using client data from various sectors like marketing. This allows for the creation of highly customized AI agents, offering businesses in Japan bespoke AI solutions. Data Sovereignty and Localization: By building a data center in Japan, SoftBank and OpenAI address growing concerns around data sovereignty and localization. Japanese businesses will have the option to process and store data within the country, which is crucial for regulatory compliance and data privacy. Expanding Global Footprint: For OpenAI , this partnership with SoftBank is a strategic move to expand its global presence and tap into the lucrative Japanese market. It mirrors OpenAI ‘s broader strategy of collaborating with key players to build AI infrastructure worldwide. This partnership signifies a powerful synergy. OpenAI brings its cutting-edge AI models, and SoftBank provides the local market expertise, infrastructure, and investment muscle. This combination is poised to accelerate the adoption of advanced AI across Japan, impacting everything from enterprise solutions to consumer applications. Breaking Down the $676 Million Deal: What is SoftBank Acquiring? The $676 million price tag is for more than just bricks and mortar. Here’s what SoftBank is getting for its investment: The Sharp Sakai Plant: This is a substantial facility, previously used for LCD panel production. It includes both the land and the existing buildings, offering ample space for a large-scale data center. Existing Infrastructure: A key advantage of repurposing an existing plant is the pre-existing infrastructure, particularly power capacity. SoftBank anticipates the plant will initially support 150 megawatts, scaling up to 240 megawatts – crucial for powering energy-intensive AI workloads. Speed to Market: Acquiring an existing facility significantly shortens the timeline for establishing a data center. SoftBank aims to commence operations in 2026, a relatively quick turnaround for such a massive project. Strategic Location: Osaka is a major economic hub in Japan. Locating the data center there provides proximity to businesses and talent, enhancing its accessibility and impact. By acquiring an existing plant, SoftBank is not only saving time and potentially costs compared to building from scratch, but also leveraging existing infrastructure to expedite its Japan AI ambitions. This pragmatic approach is characteristic of SoftBank’s strategic investments. The Broader Implications for Japan AI and the Tech Landscape SoftBank’s Generative AI data center investment is more than just a company-specific initiative; it has broader implications for Japan and the global tech landscape: Boosting Japan’s AI Ecosystem: This investment is a significant boost to Japan’s ambition to become a leader in AI. It creates jobs, attracts talent, and fosters innovation within the country. Economic Growth: The development and operation of a large data center will stimulate economic activity in Osaka and surrounding regions. It will attract related businesses and investments in the AI sector. Competition and Innovation: SoftBank’s move is likely to spur further investment in AI infrastructure by other players in Japan and Asia, fostering healthy competition and driving innovation in the data center and AI industries. Global AI Race: This investment is part of the larger global race to dominate the AI landscape. Nations are vying for AI leadership, and investments like SoftBank’s are crucial for staying competitive. For the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, these developments are highly relevant. AI and blockchain are increasingly converging, with AI enhancing blockchain analytics, security, and scalability, while blockchain can provide transparency and trust to AI systems. Robust AI Data Center infrastructure like SoftBank’s is foundational for this convergence to flourish. What’s Next for SoftBank and its Generative AI Vision? SoftBank’s acquisition of the Sharp plant is just the beginning. Here’s what we can expect in the near future: Data Center Construction and Build-out: The immediate next steps involve retrofitting and equipping the Sharp plant to become a state-of-the-art AI Data Center . This will involve significant engineering and technological deployments. SB OpenAI Japan Operations: As the data center comes online, SB OpenAI Japan will likely ramp up its operations, focusing on training customized AI models and deploying AI solutions for Japanese enterprises. Further Investments: SoftBank’s commitment to AI is likely to extend beyond this data center. We can anticipate further investments in AI startups, research, and talent development in Japan and globally. Monitoring the $25 Billion OpenAI Investment: The rumored $25 billion investment in OpenAI is still pending official confirmation. Its closure would further solidify the partnership and provide OpenAI with substantial capital for its continued growth and innovation. SoftBank’s visionary investment in this AI Data Center is a clear signal that it is placing a massive bet on the future of AI, particularly Generative AI , and its transformative impact on industries and societies worldwide. This is a development that tech enthusiasts, investors, and particularly those in the cryptocurrency space should watch closely, as AI and blockchain technologies continue to intertwine and shape the future.

Multiple releases today include a new .pi Domains Auction that facilitates an important… pic.twitter.com/Xfyaw1CFvl — Pi Network (@PiCoreTeam) March 15, 2025 According to the network’s blog page, users will be required to use Pi coins in buying domain names in the auction, set to run from March 14 to June 28, 2025, and periods could be extended if new bids are placed within the final 24 hours before closure. How the .pi domain auction works The .pi Domain Auction is open to all members of the Pi community, including individuals who acquire Pi through centralized exchanges. Users can participate by visiting the Pi Browser, where they can bid on domain names with a minimum bid of 10 Pi. The highest bidder will secure domain names to use exclusively. Registration and maintenance fees will be similar to traditional domain services like the ones provided on Web2. The Pi team also talked about the auction’s reversible bid system feature, where participants are allowed to withdraw their Pi until the auction closes. Still, individuals that have bought Pi on exchanges will have to follow a different process. Rather than using claimable balances, they will receive a custom Pi blockchain address for each domain they bid on, where they can send their Pi as payment. Refunds for these standard payments will only be processed after the auction ends. Once an exchange-based bidder wins a domain, they will need to establish a standard Pi blockchain account to receive it. First Open network PiFest commences Pi Network has also launched a shopping event that involves users and merchants on the network, dubbed PiFest, which will run from March 14 to March 21, 2025 worldwide. PiCoreTeam claims the merchant registration period began two days before the event, and over 100,000 businesses have already signed up, with 49,000 active sellers listed on the Map of Pi, a platform where users can find the participating businesses. The Web3 project has updated its ecosystem Interface, removing the pre-approval requirement for developers. Previously, developers had to meet specific eligibility criteria before applying to list their apps in the Pi Browser ecosystem. With this update, any developer meeting Mainnet requirements can now apply immediately, eliminating delays in the application process. Pi Coin continues downtrend after mainnet migration mishap Pi Coin’s price has fallen from an intraday high of $1.72 to levels below $1.5, against the backdrop of network issues that saw users struggle to migrate their tokens on deadline day. The token has shed over 22% of its value since Thursday. According to CoinGecko, the token reached its all time high value of $2.99 six days after it started trading, but is now about 51% down from the February 26 highs. It has also seen a 35.3% downtick in a fortnight, and a 19% drop intraweek. As of this publication, Pi Coin is consolidating between $1.44 and $1.46, as market watchers wait for more fluctuations over the weekend. The crypto has managed to stay above the $1.40 psychological support level, but is trading way below its 10-day and 20-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) at 1.59 and 1.66, and will need to climb past those levels for a positive price correction.

Tom Lee’s Bold Prediction,https://coinpedia.org/news/can-bitcoin-outperform-gold-in-2025-tom-lees-bold-prediction/,"The post Can Bitcoin Outperform Gold in 2025? Tom Lee’s Bold Prediction appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin is one of the cryptos that have benefited hugely from the shift in political attitude towards the cryptocurrency industry. Just weeks after the victory of Donald Trump against Kamala Harris in the U.S. presidential election, the Bitcoin market achieved the impressive milestone of $100K. Like the majority of the top ten cryptos, the upward momentum in the BTC market has started to slow down since the beginning of 2025. The YTD change of BTC stands at -10.2%. In the last seven days alone, the Bitcoin price has declined by over 2.71%. However, Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee predicted that Bitcoin would become the best-performing asset class of the year. He even asserted that BTC would outperform gold in 2025. Unbelievable, isn’t it? Let’s dive deep! Bitcoin Will Outperform Gold in 2025 In the previous year, the gold price reported a rise of 27.44%. Meanwhile, during the same period, the Bitcoin price registered a surge of at least +121.1%. Though BTC strongly outperformed XAU in 2024, the crypto, popularly known as digital gold, struggled to maintain its growth pace in the first quarter of 2025. The YTD change of gold is nearly 13.7%, but the YTD of Bitcoin is -10.2%. Bitcoin’s poor performance in the first quarter has raised questions about its potential to challenge the dominance of Gold in the market as the most trusted store of value. However, Lee predicted that the Bitcoin market would outperform the gold market this year. Bitcoin’s Performance in 2025 So Far At the start of 2025, the price of BTC was at $93,536.41. In January, the BTC market experienced a moderate growth of 9.54%. However, in February, the market saw a significant drop of -17.55%. The MTD of BTC stands at -0.48%. At the beginning of this month, the price of Bitcoin was at $84,381.04. In the first two days of the month, the market witnessed a rise of 11.68%. At one point on March 2, the market reached as high as $95,048.73. This month, the market has recorded two major corrections: an 8.5% drop on March 3 and a 13.25% decline between March 6 and 10. The market has not yet fully recovered from these corrections. Currently, the BTC price remains at $83,873 – at least 13.32% below the peak of the month. Lee’s Bold Prediction for 2025 According to Lee, the price of Bitcoin would reach as high as $150,000 in the year 2025. It appears that this analyst is extremely optimistic about the future prospects of the BTC market. An analysis of the previous Bitcoin price predictions of Lee indicates that he has a mixed record in BTC predictions. However, Lee is a very respected figure in the financial sector.

41692556,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=140165,1742031643,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Turbulence in Asian Forex: Trade War Escalation Dips Markets, Yuan Shows Resilience",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/asian-fx-trade-war-yuan/,"Navigating the cryptocurrency world requires a keen eye on global financial currents. Recent developments in traditional markets, particularly in Forex, can offer valuable insights and even foreshadow movements in the crypto sphere. The escalating trade tensions spearheaded by former US President Trump are sending ripples across Asian currency markets, creating a climate of uncertainty. Let’s dive into how this Trade War is impacting Asian FX and what’s keeping the Yuan afloat. Why are Asian Currencies Feeling the Heat from the Trade War? The resurgence of trade war rhetoric has injected a fresh dose of anxiety into global markets. When trade disputes escalate, they directly impact economies reliant on international trade, and Asia is at the heart of global supply chains. Here’s a breakdown of why Asian FX is particularly vulnerable: Export Dependence: Many Asian economies, such as South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore, are heavily reliant on exports. A trade war, characterized by tariffs and trade barriers, directly threatens their export competitiveness, weakening their currencies. Supply Chain Disruptions: Trade wars disrupt established supply chains, leading to uncertainty for businesses. This uncertainty can deter investment and negatively impact economic growth prospects, further pressuring Asian FX . Risk-Off Sentiment: Escalating trade tensions typically trigger a “risk-off” sentiment in global markets. Investors tend to flock to safe-haven assets like the US dollar and Japanese yen, pulling capital away from perceived riskier assets, including emerging market currencies in Asia. Currency Devaluation as a Weapon: In a trade war, countries might be tempted to devalue their currencies to make their exports cheaper and more competitive. This can lead to a ‘race to the bottom’ and further volatility in the Forex Market . Yuan Resilience: Is China’s Stimulus a Game Changer? Amidst the broader downturn in Asian FX , the Chinese Yuan has shown a degree of resilience. This relative strength can be attributed, in part, to proactive measures taken by the Chinese government to stimulate its economy. But how effective is this stimulus, and can it truly shield the Yuan from the storm? China’s policymakers have been deploying a range of stimulus measures to bolster economic activity. These include: Monetary Policy Easing: The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has been cautiously easing monetary policy, including measures like reducing reserve requirement ratios for banks. This injects liquidity into the financial system, encouraging lending and investment. Fiscal Stimulus: Increased government spending on infrastructure projects and targeted tax cuts for businesses are designed to boost domestic demand and offset the negative impacts of external trade pressures. Support for Key Sectors: Specific sectors facing headwinds, such as technology and manufacturing, may receive targeted support to maintain growth and employment. However, the effectiveness of China Stimulus in fully offsetting the negative impact of a protracted trade war remains a subject of debate. While stimulus measures can provide a buffer and support domestic demand, they may not be sufficient to completely insulate the Yuan from external pressures if trade tensions continue to escalate. Decoding the Dips: Which Asian Currencies are Most Affected? While the overall trend in Asian FX is downward pressure, the degree of impact varies across different currencies. Some currencies are proving more vulnerable than others. Let’s examine a few key examples: Currency Factors Contributing to Weakness Outlook South Korean Won (KRW) High reliance on exports (especially electronics), sensitivity to global trade cycles, geopolitical risks related to North Korea. Likely to remain under pressure if trade tensions persist. Vulnerable to fluctuations in global demand for electronics. Taiwan Dollar (TWD) Strong technology export sector exposed to global trade disruptions, close trade links with China. Similar to KRW, susceptible to trade war impacts and global tech sector performance. Singapore Dollar (SGD) Open economy highly dependent on trade, regional financial hub sensitive to global economic sentiment. May experience volatility due to its open economy nature, but generally considered more resilient due to Singapore’s strong fundamentals. Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) & Indian Rupee (INR) Emerging market currencies sensitive to risk-off sentiment, potential capital outflows, and commodity price fluctuations (for IDR). Face challenges from both trade war uncertainties and broader emerging market risks. Central bank intervention may be necessary to manage volatility. Forex Market Volatility: What Does This Mean for Crypto? The turbulence in the Forex Market , driven by trade war escalations and currency fluctuations, can indirectly impact the cryptocurrency market. Here’s how: Risk Sentiment Spillover: The risk-off sentiment prevailing in traditional financial markets can spill over into the crypto market. When investors become risk-averse, they may reduce exposure to both traditional risky assets and cryptocurrencies. Dollar Strength and Crypto: A strengthening US dollar, often a consequence of risk-off flows during trade wars, can sometimes exert downward pressure on cryptocurrency prices, particularly Bitcoin, which is often priced against the dollar. Alternative Asset Appeal: Conversely, in times of economic uncertainty and currency volatility, some investors may view cryptocurrencies as alternative assets or hedges against traditional market risks. This could potentially lead to increased interest in crypto, though this is not always a guaranteed outcome. Geopolitical Uncertainty and Decentralization: Trade wars and geopolitical tensions highlight the interconnectedness and potential vulnerabilities of the traditional financial system. This can, in turn, strengthen the appeal of decentralized and borderless cryptocurrencies for some investors seeking alternatives. Actionable Insights: Navigating Forex and Crypto in Uncertain Times For those involved in cryptocurrency trading and investment, understanding the dynamics of the Forex Market and the impact of events like trade wars is crucial. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of developments in global trade relations, macroeconomic indicators, and central bank policies, especially in Asia. These factors can significantly influence both Forex and crypto markets. Diversification: Diversify your investment portfolio across different asset classes, including both traditional and cryptocurrencies, to mitigate risk during periods of market volatility. Risk Management: Implement robust risk management strategies. Use stop-loss orders and manage your position sizes carefully, especially when markets are experiencing heightened volatility. Monitor Currency Movements: Pay close attention to the movements of key Asian FX currencies and the Yuan . Significant fluctuations can provide clues about market sentiment and potential ripple effects in the crypto space. Consider Stablecoins: In times of extreme volatility, consider temporarily moving some of your crypto holdings into stablecoins to preserve capital and reduce exposure to market swings. Conclusion: Riding the Waves of Global Financial Shifts The current climate of escalating trade tensions and its impact on Asian FX underscores the interconnectedness of global financial markets. While the immediate focus might be on currency fluctuations, these events have broader implications that extend to the cryptocurrency world. By staying informed, understanding the underlying dynamics, and implementing sound risk management practices, investors can navigate these turbulent times and potentially identify opportunities amidst the uncertainty. The resilience of the Yuan , despite the headwinds, highlights the complex interplay of global economics and policy responses in shaping market outcomes. As the trade war saga unfolds, continued vigilance and adaptability will be key for participants in both the Forex Market and the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies.

ETH’s most recent performance has been even more painful, as the asset dumped to its lowest level since November 2023 at under $1,800. The question raised now by analysts is whether ETH will continue losing ground and dump to $1,250. ETH at $1,250? Remember 2021? Back then, ETH was charting massive gains and its price soared toward $5,000. In fact, speculations emerged about a potential event called the ‘flippening,’ in which Ethereum could surpass Bitcoin and become the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Fast-forward some three and a half years later and that seems as distant from reality as fiat money becoming disinflationary. ETH bottomed below $1,000 during the 2022 bear market but went on the offensive again two years later. It failed to decisively overcome the $4,000 target despite its numerous attempts to conquer it in 2024. The latest rejection came in mid-December. Since then, ETH’s price has nosedived hard, which culminated (for now) earlier this week with a drop below $1,800. As such, Ethereum not only erased all the gains registered after Trump’s presidential election victory but even plunged to its lowest levels since November 2023. According to Ali Martinez, a crypto analyst with over 130,000 followers on X, the asset’s price drop meant that it had broken out of a years-long parallel channel, which could spell further trouble. In fact, he forecasted a slump to $1,250 – a level not seen in over two years. #Ethereum $ETH targets $1,250 after breaking out from this parallel channel! pic.twitter.com/XS3N9p8Unr — Ali (@ali_charts) March 14, 2025 But ETH Whales Keep Buying CryptoPotato has repeatedly reported in recent weeks Ethereum whales’ predominantly bullish behavior. Recall that within a 48-hour period alone, they accumulated 1.1 million ETH, which is nearly 1% of the total supply. At the prices back then, it was worth over $2 billion in USD . Martinez brought another chart showing that these large entities acquired more than 420,000 ETH in the following five days, valued at $800 million at today’s prices. Such massive accumulations should benefit the underlying asset as they decrease the immediate selling pressure. However, ETH’s price is yet to stage a notable recovery as it still sits below $2,000.

Speaking at a conference on Monday, SEC Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda reaffirmed his commitment to reshaping the agency, delivering a sharp critique of Gary Gensler’s handling of the crypto sector and broader financial markets. “What occurred under the Biden Administration was a stark aberration from longstanding norms regarding the Commission’s legal authority, policy priorities, and enforcement approach,” Uyeda stated , echoing concerns long held by the crypto community about regulatory overreach. A key takeaway from Uyeda’s speech was the rescission of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121, which had restricted banks and broker-dealers from handling crypto assets. In addition, Uyeda unveiled a broader initiative aimed at revitalizing U.S. capital markets, the “Make IPOs Great Again” plan, designed to streamline the IPO process and encourage more companies to go public. Notably, central to this initiative was the rollback of restrictive policies that have hindered businesses, particularly crypto firms, from raising capital efficiently. “In the past the number of IPOs has drastically declined.” He added. “As entrepreneurs grow businesses past the startup stage, they will likely require capital from institutional investors, such as venture capital funds. Without attractive opportunities for the company to sell itself or become publicly traded, what incentive does a venture fund have to make an investment? …there are things that the Commission can do to help make IPOs attractive again.” Uyeda also emphasized that Commissioner Hester Peirce would lead a newly established crypto task force to develop a comprehensive and practical regulatory framework for digital assets , “providing realistic paths to registration and crafting sensible disclosure standards.” Following these developments, the XRP community has grown increasingly optimistic, viewing the SEC’s pivot as a potential opening for Ripple to reconsider its long-delayed IPO. With SEC Chair Gary Gensler stepping down and a shift in regulatory policy, speculation around Ripple’s potential IPO has intensified, with some anticipating a launch as early as 2025 or 2026. Notable figures in the XRP community, including attorney John Deaton , have weighed in on potential valuations, linking Ripple’s stock price to its XRP holdings. Recently, popular XRP analyst Nietzbux suggested that Ripple could trade at three times the value of its XRP holdings, drawing parallels to MicroStrategy’s valuation model. According to this approach, if XRP reaches $8.72, Ripple’s valuation could surpass $1 trillion, a scenario market veteran Peter Brandt has previously considered possible. Moreover, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has previously expressed interest in taking the company public. However, Ripple’s long-standing legal battle with the SEC, which began in 2020, has been a significant obstacle , prompting Ripple to shelve those ambitions once clearer regulations were in place. That said, while IPO discussions remain speculative, the SEC’s evolving stance could be a turning point for Ripple and the broader crypto industry, potentially paving the way for more crypto companies to pursue public offerings.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|MARKET|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-15 09:49:24

According to a recent Reuters report, sources familiar with the matter have revealed that Russia is increasingly turning to digital assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether to facilitate oil transactions, particularly with economic giants China and India. Is this a game-changer in international finance, or a desperate measure in the face of mounting pressure? Let’s dive deep into this fascinating development and explore the implications for the global economy and the future of cryptocurrency. Russia Crypto Sanctions: A Calculated Move? The backdrop to this intriguing development is the stringent sanctions imposed by Western nations in response to geopolitical events. These sanctions have significantly hampered Russia’s ability to conduct international trade using traditional financial systems. Faced with these obstacles, Russia appears to have adopted a proactive approach, exploring alternative financial avenues. The use of cryptocurrency emerges as a potentially viable solution, offering a decentralized and, to some extent, less regulated pathway for international payments. Last year, Russia made a significant move by passing legislation that officially permits cross-border payments using cryptocurrencies. This legal framework laid the groundwork for the current scenario, enabling Russian entities to explore and implement crypto-based solutions for their international trade activities. But why is crypto proving to be such an attractive alternative? The Allure of Crypto Oil Trade: Benefits and Mechanisms Cryptocurrencies offer several advantages that make them appealing for nations seeking to circumvent traditional financial sanctions: Decentralization: Cryptocurrencies operate outside the purview of traditional banking systems, making them harder for sanctioning bodies to control or block transactions directly. Reduced Intermediation: Crypto transactions can occur directly between parties, reducing reliance on intermediaries like banks that are subject to international regulations and sanctions. Speed and Efficiency: Cross-border crypto transactions can be faster and potentially cheaper than traditional international wire transfers, especially for large sums. Anonymity (Pseudonymity): While not entirely anonymous, cryptocurrency transactions can offer a degree of pseudonymity, making it harder to trace the origin and destination of funds compared to traditional banking systems. Reuters’ report highlights that Russian oil firms are specifically using cryptocurrencies to convert Chinese yuan and Indian rupees – currencies received from oil sales – into Russian rubles. This conversion process is crucial as it allows Russia to repatriate revenue from oil exports despite limitations on access to international financial infrastructure. The cryptocurrencies mentioned – Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Tether (USDT) – are all well-established and liquid digital assets, facilitating relatively easy conversion and transfer. Sanctions Evasion: Is Crypto the Ultimate Loophole? The use of cryptocurrency to facilitate oil trade raises significant questions about the effectiveness of international sanctions. While sanctions aim to restrict a nation’s access to global financial systems and resources, the emergence of crypto as an alternative payment mechanism presents a potential challenge. Is sanctions evasion becoming easier in the age of digital currencies? It’s important to note that while crypto offers a route to bypass traditional financial channels, it is not without its challenges and limitations: Challenge Description Volatility Cryptocurrency prices are notoriously volatile. This volatility can introduce risks and complexities in large-scale trade transactions, requiring sophisticated risk management strategies. Scalability and Liquidity While Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether are liquid, the overall crypto market’s capacity to handle extremely large volumes of oil trade transactions on a sustained basis is still being tested. Regulatory Scrutiny Governments and regulatory bodies worldwide are increasingly focused on regulating cryptocurrencies. Increased scrutiny and potential future regulations could impact the long-term viability of crypto-based sanctions evasion strategies. Transparency Concerns While offering pseudonymity, blockchain transactions are not entirely untraceable. Sophisticated blockchain analysis tools are becoming more advanced, potentially allowing authorities to monitor and analyze crypto transactions. Cross-Border Payments Reimagined: The Future of International Trade? Russia’s move to utilize crypto for oil trade underscores a broader trend: the increasing role of digital currencies in cross-border payments . As traditional financial systems grapple with geopolitical tensions and evolving technological landscapes, cryptocurrencies are emerging as a potentially transformative force in international trade and finance. This development prompts us to consider: Will other sanctioned nations follow suit? If Russia’s crypto strategy proves effective, other countries facing sanctions may be incentivized to explore similar approaches. How will regulators respond? Western governments and international regulatory bodies are likely to intensify their efforts to monitor and regulate crypto transactions to prevent sanctions evasion and illicit activities. What are the long-term implications for the global financial system? The increasing use of crypto in international trade could potentially lead to a more fragmented global financial landscape, with traditional and decentralized systems coexisting and competing. Cryptocurrency: A Double-Edged Sword? The situation highlights the double-edged nature of cryptocurrency technology. While it offers innovative solutions and opportunities for financial inclusion and efficiency, it also presents challenges in terms of regulation, illicit finance, and, as seen in this case, potential sanctions evasion. The global community faces the complex task of harnessing the benefits of crypto while mitigating its risks and unintended consequences. The unfolding situation with Russia’s crypto-based oil trade is a significant development to watch. It serves as a real-world example of how digital currencies are being used in the context of international geopolitics and sanctions. It raises critical questions about the future of sanctions effectiveness, the evolution of international trade, and the ongoing debate about the role and regulation of cryptocurrencies in the global economy.

The recovery follows a challenging February, driven by renewed investor confidence and improved market sentiment. XRP’s resurgence aligns with broader market stability, as institutional and positive legal speculation fuel optimism. However, this cryptocurrency is currently above its 100-hour Simple Moving Average (SMA), reflecting a short-term upward trend, yet it remains below the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), highlighting ongoing long-term resistance. XRP Price Action We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 February 2025 Recap Last month, XRP experienced a 30% decline after reaching a seven-year high in January. Several factors contributed to this downturn, including: Widespread market corrections affecting major cryptocurrencies, Regulatory uncertainty, particularly concerning Ripple’s ongoing legal dispute with the SEC, and Profit-taking by investors following XRP’s strong rally earlier in the year. Despite the sharp drop, XRP found support near $2.00, setting the stage for its March recovery. March 2025 Performance March has seen XRP regain momentum, with a 13.7% recovery, driven by: Renewed investor confidence as market conditions stabilize, Positive sentiment surrounding Ripple’s SEC case, with speculation about a favorable resolution, Increasing institutional interest, as financial institutions explore XRP’s potential for cross-border transactions, and Altcoin market strength is supported by Bitcoin’s strong performance.

You Won’t Believe What Analysts Are Saying,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/is-mutuum-finance-mutm-the-next-big-thing-in-crypto/,"The post Is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) the Next Big Thing In Crypto? You Won’t Believe What Analysts Are Saying appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has ignited a frenzy in the crypto market as its presale races toward Phase 4, amassing $3.4 million from over 5,700 investors. Currently priced at $0.02 in Phase 3, the token’s value is set to leap 25% to $0.025 once the next stage begins—a shift analysts describe as a precursor to explosive growth. With an exchange listing planned at $0.06, early buyers could secure instant 200% returns upon launch. But forecasts stretch further: projections hint at a climb beyond $3.50 by late 2025, positioning Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a potential titan in decentralized finance (DeFi). Presale Momentum Builds Rapidly Investors are scrambling to acquire Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens before Phase 3 sells out, driven by its structured presale model and real-world utility. Unlike speculative assets, the project anchors itself in decentralized lending, allowing users to borrow, lend, and earn through mtTokens—a system converting deposits like ETH or DAI into interest-bearing assets. This practicality has translated into staggering demand, with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Phase 3 allocations dwindling faster than previous stages. Those entering now stand to gain not only from the imminent price jump to $0.025 but also from the anticipated listing surge. Should Mutuum Finance (MUTM) hit its post-launch target of $3.50, a $500 investment today could balloon to $87,500—a 17,400% windfall. Innovative Mechanics Drive Sustained Demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) distinguishes itself through a self-reinforcing ecosystem. A buy-and-distribute mechanism funnels platform revenue into repurchasing tokens, which are then allocated to mtToken stakers. This creates perpetual buy pressure, countering volatility while rewarding long-term holders. In order to further stabilise the network and provide liquidity, borrowers lock up collateral that exceeds loan values. Peer-to-peer financing for assets such as Dogecoin (DOGE) or Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been introduced, expanding its appeal and reaching niche sectors that are neglected by conventional platforms. Market Analysts Spotlight Unmatched Potential While meme coins and speculative tokens dominate headlines, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly reshaping DeFi’s foundations. Its overcollateralized model and dynamic interest rates offer lenders competitive yields, drawing risk-averse participants seeking stability. Security audits by reputable firms and a $100,000 giveaway for presale contributors further bolster credibility. Analysts emphasize that MUTM’s presale structure—where each phase incrementally hikes the price—creates urgency among investors. With Phase 4 approaching, the window for securing tokens at $0.02 is narrowing rapidly. Additionally, Mutuum Finance’s smart contracts are undergoing a CertiK audit to guarantee optimal security. Following completion, the results will be posted on various social media channels, emphasising the team’s proactive efforts to create a reliable and robust environment for its expanding user and investment base. A Groundfloor Opportunity in DeFi’s Evolution Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t merely chasing trends; it’s engineering them. The platform’s roadmap includes launching a decentralized stablecoin backed by user collateral, enhancing transparency in a sector often criticized for opacity. Early adopters today aren’t just buying tokens—they’re securing stakes in a system designed to thrive beyond hype cycles. As adoption accelerates and exchange listings loom, the math becomes irresistible: a 25% gain between phases, a 200% surge at launch, and potential quadruple-digit growth thereafter. The crypto market rarely offers second chances, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is no exception. With Phase 3 filling rapidly and analysts forecasting historic returns, hesitation could mean missing the decade’s most promising DeFi entry. Visit Mutuum Finance’s official site to participate in the presale before the next price hike—and position yourself at the forefront of a financial revolution.

What The Charts Are Saying",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-to-70000-or-300000/,"Bitcoin’s price trajectory has become a significant point of interest in light of the recent downtrend, which has disappointed many bullish traders. According to on-chain analytics platform IntoTheBlock, the recent price crash up to the current price has seen over 6.5 million BTC addresses falling into losses. Still, technical analysis suggests Bitcoin could experience further drops. The question is whether Bitcoin will test the $70,000 mark before regaining strength or can rebound from here toward a $300,000 price target. Insights from price structure and historical patterns help provide a clearer picture of what’s next. Bitcoin Price Decline: A Normal Cycle Within Uptrends Despite concerns over Bitcoin’s recent price swings, crypto analyst Philip (BasicTradingTV) maintains that the market is behaving normally within a long-term bullish structure. He highlights that on the higher monthly timeframe, Bitcoin continues to create higher highs and higher lows and maintains a solid uptrend that dates back to 2017. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Suffers Bearish Deviation After Filling CME Gap, Is This Good Or Bad? This technical outlook, which was noted on the TradingView platform, comes as a response to concerns about whether BTC is still bullish after the ongoing 25% correction from its recent all-time high. Traders have been unsettled following the recent drop, but historical trends suggest this kind of movement is part of the market’s natural cycle. According to the analyst, Bitcoin is still forming a bullish market structure, and while short-term fluctuations may continue, the broader uptrend channel from 2017 is still in place. Furthermore, the analyst noted previous instances of 25% and 40% corrections during Bitcoin’s rallies from the lower trendline of this uptrend channel. What’s Next For BTC? Possible Retest Of Resistance Before Rally To $300,000 With the notion of a long-term uptrend still intact, the analyst noted, however, that Bitcoin could continue its downtrend until it reaches $70,000. This level holds significant importance, as it previously marked Bitcoin’s all-time high before turning into resistance around mid-2024. After multiple attempts, Bitcoin eventually broke through this resistance toward the end of the year, leading to its new all-time high of $108,786 in January 2025. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Action Says Bottom Is In, Analyst Reveals What’s Coming As such, this $70,000 level is now a major psychological support zone, making it a key area to watch amidst the ongoing Bitcoin price correction. From here, the analyst predicted a rebound that would send BTC to reach as high as $300,000. “Levels to watch: 70.000, $300.000,” the analyst said. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $82,555, having spent the majority of the past 24 hours trading between $79,947 and $83,436. This leaves Bitcoin still about 14% away from testing the $70,000 support level. However, there is also the possibility that BTC may not drop as low as $70,000 before bullish sentiment takes over once again. If Bitcoin continues to follow the trajectory of past cycles, Fibonacci extensions point to price targets between $150,000 and $300,000.

41693388,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=140263,1742032832,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Groundbreaking Bill: Byron Donalds Champions National Bitcoin Reserve for Secure Digital Future,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/byron-donalds-bill-bitcoin-reserve/,"Get ready for a potential seismic shift in U.S. digital asset policy! U.S. Representative Byron Donalds is set to introduce a bill on March 14th that could fundamentally reshape how America handles Bitcoin. This isn’t just another piece of legislation; it’s a bold move to establish a national Bitcoin reserve, potentially locking in a digital asset strategy for years to come. Are you ready to dive into the details of this groundbreaking initiative? Why a National Bitcoin Reserve? Understanding the Vision The core of this bill, as reported by Wu Blockchain on X and cited by Bloomberg, revolves around solidifying a policy initially outlined in a recent executive order by former President Trump. This order directed the U.S. government to treat seized Bitcoin – a substantial amount, estimated around 200,000 BTC – as a reserve asset. Furthermore, it authorized the Treasury and Commerce Departments to strategically acquire even more Bitcoin without burdening taxpayers. But why is Congressman Donalds taking legislative action now? Preventing Policy Whims: Executive orders can be reversed by subsequent administrations. To ensure the national Bitcoin reserve policy isn’t just a fleeting idea, this bill aims to codify it into law. This means future presidents would need to go through Congress to overturn it, providing long-term stability and commitment to the digital asset strategy. Securing Seized Assets: Currently, the U.S. government holds a significant amount of Bitcoin seized from illicit activities. Instead of simply auctioning it off, this bill proposes strategically holding these assets as part of a national reserve, potentially benefiting the nation in the long run as Bitcoin adoption grows. Strategic Digital Asset Stockpile: Beyond seized assets, the bill empowers the Treasury and Commerce Departments to proactively build a digital asset stockpile. This proactive approach signals a forward-thinking strategy, positioning the U.S. to be a major player in the evolving digital economy. Byron Donalds Bill: A Deeper Dive into the Details While the full text of the Byron Donalds bill is yet to be released, we can infer key aspects based on the available information. It appears to be laser-focused on establishing a legal framework for the national Bitcoin reserve and the broader digital asset stockpile. Let’s break down what we know and what we can anticipate: Aspect Details Core Objective To codify the executive order establishing a national Bitcoin reserve and digital asset stockpile into law. Key Proponents U.S. Representative Byron Donalds (leading the bill), potentially supported by other pro-crypto lawmakers. Assets in Focus Primarily Bitcoin (BTC), but the bill also mentions a broader “digital asset stockpile,” suggesting potential inclusion of other cryptocurrencies in the future. Acquisition Methods Holding seized BTC and authorizing Treasury/Commerce Departments to acquire more without increasing taxpayer burden (details of acquisition methods are still to be clarified). Timeline Bill introduction expected on March 14th. Legislative process and potential enactment timeline are yet to unfold. Trump Bitcoin Policy: The Foundation for the Bill It’s crucial to understand the context of the Trump Bitcoin policy that serves as the bedrock for this legislative effort. Earlier this month, the executive order signed by President Trump laid the groundwork. This order wasn’t just about holding Bitcoin; it was a statement about recognizing the strategic importance of digital assets. Here’s what the Trump administration’s directive aimed to achieve: Legitimizing Bitcoin as a Reserve Asset: By directing the government to hold seized Bitcoin as reserves, the order signaled a shift in perception, acknowledging Bitcoin’s potential role in national finance. Proactive Acquisition Strategy: Authorizing the Treasury and Commerce Departments to acquire more Bitcoin indicates a proactive approach to building a digital asset portfolio, rather than just passively managing seized assets. Economic Opportunity: The move can be seen as a way to tap into the growing digital economy and potentially benefit from the appreciation of Bitcoin over time, without directly impacting taxpayers. Benefits of a National Bitcoin Reserve: What’s in it for the U.S.? Establishing a national Bitcoin reserve could bring several potential advantages to the United States. Let’s explore some key benefits: Financial Innovation Leadership: By embracing Bitcoin as a reserve asset, the U.S. could solidify its position as a leader in financial innovation, attracting talent and investment in the digital asset space. Economic Diversification: Holding Bitcoin as part of national reserves could diversify the U.S.’s asset portfolio, potentially mitigating risks associated with traditional assets and currencies. Future-Proofing National Finances: As the world increasingly moves towards digital currencies, having a Bitcoin reserve could position the U.S. for a smoother transition and greater financial resilience in the digital age. Potential Revenue Generation: If Bitcoin’s value continues to appreciate, the national reserve could become a significant source of revenue for the government in the future. Challenges and Considerations: Navigating the Road Ahead While the concept of a national Bitcoin reserve is exciting, there are also challenges and considerations to address: Volatility Concerns: Bitcoin’s price volatility is a well-known factor. Managing a large Bitcoin reserve requires robust risk management strategies to mitigate potential value fluctuations. Regulatory Clarity: Clear regulatory frameworks are essential for managing and utilizing a national Bitcoin reserve effectively. This includes addressing issues related to custody, security, and accounting. Public Perception and Education: Public understanding and acceptance of Bitcoin and digital assets are crucial for the success of this initiative. Education and transparent communication will be key. Security and Custody: Securing a large amount of Bitcoin requires robust cybersecurity measures and secure custody solutions to prevent theft or loss. The Digital Asset Stockpile: Beyond Bitcoin The bill’s mention of a broader “digital asset stockpile” is intriguing. This suggests the U.S. government might be considering expanding its holdings beyond just Bitcoin to include other cryptocurrencies or digital assets. This could be a strategic move to: Diversify Digital Asset Holdings: Including a variety of digital assets could reduce risk and capture opportunities across different segments of the crypto market. Support Innovation Across the Digital Asset Ecosystem: Holding a broader range of digital assets could signal support for innovation and growth across the entire digital asset ecosystem. Strategic Advantage in Emerging Technologies: As blockchain technology and digital assets evolve, a diversified stockpile could provide the U.S. with a strategic advantage in emerging technologies and financial systems. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? This potential legislation has implications for everyone interested in the cryptocurrency space. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on the progress of the Byron Donalds bill. Follow news outlets and cryptocurrency publications for updates. Engage in the Conversation: Share your thoughts and opinions on social media and with your representatives. Public discourse can influence policy decisions. Educate Yourself About Bitcoin: If you’re new to Bitcoin, now is a great time to learn more about its fundamentals, technology, and potential. Consider the Long-Term Implications: Think about how a national Bitcoin reserve could impact the cryptocurrency market, the U.S. economy, and the future of finance. Conclusion: A Bold Step into the Future of Finance U.S. Representative Byron Donalds’ bill to establish a national Bitcoin reserve is a significant development in the cryptocurrency landscape. It represents a bold step towards embracing digital assets at a national level and could have far-reaching implications for the U.S. economy and its role in the global financial system. Whether this bill will become law remains to be seen, but it undoubtedly signals a growing recognition of Bitcoin’s importance and the transformative potential of digital assets. The journey towards a digital future is unfolding, and this bill could be a pivotal moment in that evolution.

Yet contrary to pessimistic outlooks, several underlying narratives suggest this correction may actually signal the early stages of an extended growth phase – and not the conclusion of favorable market conditions. Wall Street Giants Are Reshaping Crypto Market Dynamics The entrance of established financial behemoths into the cryptocurrency ecosystem is creating previously unseen market patterns. Organizations managing trillions of dollars in assets are starting to dampen the typically extreme price swings of digital currencies. Industry observers are noting a maturation process where digital assets increasingly mirror conventional equity behavior. As highlighted by online commentator Alyo , the integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream investment portfolios through ETFs and treasury positions is likely transforming traditional boom-bust sequences into more gradual appreciation phases. “This cycle is different!” Yes, because this time, financial giants are buying through their #Bitcoin ETFs. When Gold ETFs launched, gold rallied for 10 years straight. It was cyclical too, until the ETF changed everything. What makes you think $BTC won’t do the same? pic.twitter.com/ObMiEoEqOP — Crypto Anbu (@CryptoAnbu_) March 12, 2025 These changes will involve less dramatic fluctuations, but potentially more enduring upward movement. Economic Indicators Point to Monetary Policy Shifts The latest consumer price metrics reveal inflationary pressures subsiding more rapidly than economists projected. This development carries substantial implications for cryptocurrency valuations, as it enhances the probability of upcoming monetary easing measures. Great PPI & CPI data this week. Those are signs that inflation isn't picking up momentum and could ease a lot for the FED to potentially do a rate cut. Waiting for M2 Supply to pick up momentum and then #Bitcoin should restart its uptrend. — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) March 13, 2025 Historical patterns demonstrate that central bank rate reductions typically create favorable conditions for digital asset appreciation. For instance, the monetary policy adjustment last September ignited a robust upward momentum that only diminished following conservative Federal Reserve commentary in December, and unchanged rates in January. Current futures trading activity suggests markets anticipate three potential rate adjustments in 2025, creating a potentially supportive environment for renewed cryptocurrency appreciation. Crypto Presale Enthusiasm Reveals Underlying Market Strength Despite widespread price corrections across established digital assets, participation in early-stage crypto presales continues at unprecedented volumes. This phenomenon indicates that individual investors remain both financially capable and optimistic about the Web3 sector’s prospects. For example, consider the presale success of Solaxy ($SOLX) , which has attracted $26 million for its Solana-based Layer 2 scaling solution. Expected to launch later this year, Solaxy is designed to enhance the scalability potential of the Solana blockchain, and eliminate the possibility of failed transactions on the network. Leading analysts predict 50x gains for the SOLX crypto, which will also be compatible with Ethereum, Solana, and Solaxy itself. Equally noteworthy is the $11 million raised by the ICO for Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , which will provide users of the Best Wallet crypto management platform with benefits including lower transaction fees, premium staking rewards, early crypto presale access, and much more. As Best Wallet has over 500,000 users, some of the biggest investors in the market have embraced BEST as a key investment opportunity for 2025 – one that could potentially 100x in value . The enthusiastic response to these fundraising initiatives reveals a resilient optimism among cryptocurrency participants, which contradicts surface-level bearish market sentiment. Trump’s Trade Strategy May Be Designed to Force Rate Cuts The recent US government transition brought market volatility as Donald Trump adopted an aggressive negotiating stance toward key international trading partners, threatening a series of trade wars. While this move has been publicly framed as domestic economic prioritization, market analysts suspect alternative motivations. Financial commentators including Ran Neuner propose these economic pressure tactics may deliberately create short-term market uncertainty, which is designed to influence central banking decisions toward accommodative policies – and potentially foster extended economic expansion. Trump is working to a plan. The endgame is to force the FED’s hand. The plan means cooling the markets and confidence off in the short term. The lack of confidence will slow the economy and this will cool GDP and inflation. Companies will be less bullish and therefore will… — Ran Neuner (@cryptomanran) March 9, 2025 This approach aligns with a potential transition toward more sustained growth cycles, and would ultimately benefit digital asset markets once monetary policy adjustments materialize. Government Crypto Reserves Authorized, When Will Acquisitions Begin? US federal authorities recently established the framework for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve – but have not yet initiated active purchasing to expand their existing holdings. Nonetheless, the creation of the aforementioned reserve still represents an unprecedented legitimization of the crypto industry that has yet to be priced in through market activity. Just a few minutes ago, President Trump signed an Executive Order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The Reserve will be capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings. This means it… — David Sacks (@davidsacks47) March 7, 2025 The financial institution Standard Chartered has also suggested that funding for such acquisitions might come through gold reserve reallocation , rather than public expenditure. The mere possibility of sovereign cryptocurrency acquisition by the world’s largest economy represents a transformative milestone for the digital asset sector, and could trigger renewed market momentum when implementation begins.",Press Release,EN,0,0,MARKET|FIAT|TRADING|BTC|ZRX,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-15 10:01:49

Bitcoin ( BTC ) price fell over 3% during the past week, to trade above $83,748 as of 9:33 a.m. in UTC, Cointelegraph Markets Pro data shows. Bitcoin price continues to risk significant downside volatility due to growing macroeconomic uncertainty around global trade tariffs, according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research. BTC/USD, 1-year chart. Source: Cointelegraph Closing the week above $81,000 will be key to avoid more Bitcoin downside, the analyst told Cointelegraph, adding: “The key level to watch for the weekly close is $81,000 range, holding above that would signal resilience, but if we see a drop below $76,000, it could invite more short-term selling pressure.” The analyst's comments come days ahead of the next FOMC meeting scheduled for March 19. Markets are currently pricing in a 98% chance that the Fed will keep interest rates steady, according to the latest estimates of the CME Group’s FedWatch tool . Source: CME Group’s FedWatch tool The outcome of the meeting may significantly impact Bitcoin investor sentiment, said Lee, adding: “The market largely expects the Fed to hold rates steady, but any unexpected hawkish signals could put pressure on Bitcoin and other risk assets.” “Even a dovish surprise, like a rate cut, might not be the immediate boost some are hoping for, as investors are still weighing macro uncertainties,” added the analyst.

Byron Donalds to introduce bill codifying Trump’s Bitcoin reserve Bitcoin close above $85k may reignite investor optimism for more upside: analyst Other analysts are seeing a silver lining in Bitcoin’s stagnant price action. A weekly close above $85,000 may inspire more investor confidence and lead to the next breakout, according to Enmanuel Cardozo, market analyst at Brickken real-world asset tokenization platform. The market analyst told Cointelegraph: “Traders and investors alike are keeping a close eye on the $80,000 support and the $85,000–$90,000 resistance, with a break above the latter potentially sparking a strong upward movement.” While Bitcoin’s short-term momentum may be limited by the upcoming economic releases, the regulatory developments around Trump’s Bitcoin reserve plan may gradually bring more market optimism and mass adoption, added the analyst. Related: Bitcoin’s next catalyst: End of $36T US debt ceiling suspension Trump’s Bitcoin reserve came one step closer to fruition on March 14, after US Representative Byron Donalds introduced a bill that seeks to ensure the Bitcoin reserve becomes a permanent fixture, preventing future administrations from dismantling it through executive action. If the bill is passed, it would ensure that the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the US Digital Asset Stockpile could not be eliminated via executive actions by a future administration. The bill will require at least 60 votes in the Senate and a House majority to pass. With Republicans holding a Senate majority — and amid a generally more crypto-friendly environment — the bill has a chance of passing.

A well-known crypto millionaire who turned early bets on Dogecoin (DOGE) and Floki Inu (FLOKI) into a 17,000% portfolio gain is now setting his sights on five undervalued altcoins for 2025. With the market still recovering from volatility, these low-cost assets could present massive growth potential for investors seeking high returns. Among them, a new project has already gained traction in early investment circles, showing signs of strong momentum. Priced at just $0.006 and having already raised $17 million, Lightchain AI is emerging as one of the most talked-about opportunities. As 2025 approaches, these five cryptos could follow the path of past meme coin success stories and deliver exponential gains for early adopters. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at each of these undervalued coins and why they could be set to pump in 2025. Why Crypto Millionaire Is Focusing on These Undervalued Coins A crypto millionaire who turned small investments in Dogecoin (DOGE) and Floki Inu (FLOKI) into a 17,000% portfolio gain is now shifting focus to undervalued altcoins. While many investors chase established assets, he believes that hidden gems often yield the highest returns. His latest picks for 2025 include projects with strong fundamentals, growing communities, and the potential to replicate past meme coin rallies. These altcoins are currently flying under the radar but could explode as market sentiment improves. With increasing institutional interest and retail adoption, undervalued cryptos are becoming a prime target for early movers. Among them, one project stands out due to its strong early traction and investor confidence. As the market gears up for the next bull cycle, these selections could deliver exponential gains for those who act early. 5 Undervalued Coins Set to Pump In 2025 Identifying undervalued cryptocurrencies before they explode is key to maximizing returns. As the market evolves, several altcoins are positioning themselves for significant growth in 2025. One such crypto is Lightchain AI (LCAI ), which has gained traction due to its innovative approach and strong presale momentum . Another promising pick is Injective Protocol (INJ), known for its decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. SingularityNET (AGIX) is another contender, riding the wave of AI-powered blockchain adoption. Meanwhile, IOTA (MIOTA) continues to develop real-world applications for the Internet of Things (IoT), making it a strong candidate for future gains. Lastly, Render Token (RNDR) is gaining attention for its decentralized GPU-based rendering network, which supports AI and metaverse applications. These five cryptos have strong use cases and market potential, making them solid picks for investors in 2025. Can Undervalued Coins Really Deliver Exponential Gains? Investing in undervalued cryptocurrencies has historically been one of the most effective ways to achieve exponential returns. Coins like Dogecoin and Floki Inu once traded at fractions of a cent before skyrocketing in value, rewarding early investors with massive gains. The key to identifying such opportunities lies in recognizing strong fundamentals, growing adoption, and innovative use cases before mainstream hype sets in. While market conditions can be unpredictable, history has shown that undervalued assets with solid technology and real-world utility often outperform expectations. As the crypto market evolves, new contenders are emerging, presenting fresh opportunities for investors willing to take calculated risks. https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN|INJ,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-15 10:10:07

Bitget, a leading global cryptocurrency exchange, has just announced a thrilling opportunity for its users. Get ready to dive into the world of PAWS tokens even before their official launch. Bitget’s pre-market platform has opened its doors to PAWS, allowing you to get a head start and potentially earn crypto even before the token hits the broader market. This move is generating significant buzz in the crypto community, and here’s everything you need to know to make the most of this opportunity. What is Bitget Pre-Market and Why PAWS? Before we delve into the specifics of PAWS on Bitget pre-market, let’s understand what a pre-market trading platform is and why Bitget is offering this for the PAWS token. A crypto pre-market essentially allows users to trade tokens before they are officially launched and listed on spot exchanges. It’s a fantastic way to gauge early interest, discover price points, and for early adopters to position themselves advantageously. Bitget’s decision to introduce PAWS on its pre-market platform signals strong confidence in the project and a desire to provide its users with early access to promising new tokens. But why PAWS? While the specifics of the PAWS token project aren’t detailed in the initial announcement, the move suggests that PAWS is a project with considerable potential and community backing. Bitget, known for its strategic token listings and user-centric approach, carefully selects projects for its pre-market, indicating PAWS likely possesses compelling features or addresses a significant need within the crypto ecosystem. How to Engage with PAWS on Bitget Pre-Market and Earn Crypto Points? Bitget has made participating in the PAWS pre-market both engaging and rewarding. The platform isn’t just about passively waiting for the token launch ; it’s designed to encourage active community participation. Here’s a breakdown of how you can get involved and start earning points: Join Telegram Communities: A core component of earning points involves engaging within dedicated Telegram communities. This fosters a sense of community around the PAWS token and allows users to stay updated with the latest announcements and developments. Complete Activities: Beyond just joining Telegram groups, users are encouraged to actively participate by completing various activities. While the specific nature of these activities isn’t detailed in the initial announcement, they are likely to include tasks that promote community growth, awareness, and engagement with the PAWS project. Think along the lines of: Social Media Engagement: Sharing posts, retweeting announcements, and participating in discussions about PAWS on platforms like Twitter. Content Creation: Creating and sharing original content such as articles, videos, or memes about the PAWS token. Community Quizzes and Contests: Participating in quizzes to test your knowledge about the PAWS project or contests that reward creative contributions. Referral Programs: Inviting friends to join the Bitget pre-market PAWS community. Accumulate Points: By participating in Telegram communities and completing these activities, users accumulate points. The more actively you engage, the more points you can potentially earn. Point Conversion to PAWS Tokens: The most exciting part! These accumulated points are expected to be converted into actual PAWS tokens upon the official token launch scheduled for March 18th. This means your engagement isn’t just for fun; it directly translates into potentially owning PAWS tokens. Key Takeaway: Bitget’s pre-market approach for PAWS is innovative. It’s not just about early trading; it’s about building a strong, engaged community from the ground up. By rewarding participation with points convertible to tokens, Bitget is incentivizing users to become active stakeholders in the PAWS ecosystem. Benefits of Participating in the Crypto Pre-Market PAWS Launch on Bitget Why should you consider participating in the Bitget pre-market launch of PAWS? Here are some compelling benefits: Benefit Description Early Access Gain access to PAWS tokens before they are available on major exchanges. This early entry can be advantageous if the token performs well post-launch. Potential for Early Gains Pre-market trading can offer opportunities to acquire tokens at potentially favorable prices before they gain wider market attention and potentially increase in value after the official launch. Earn Crypto Rewards Through Engagement Bitget’s unique approach allows you to actively earn crypto by participating in community activities. This is a lower-risk way to accumulate PAWS tokens compared to purely financial investment in the pre-market. Community Building Be part of the ground-floor community for PAWS. Engage with like-minded individuals, contribute to the project’s growth, and stay informed about the latest developments directly from the source. Platform Familiarization Experience Bitget’s pre-market platform firsthand. This can be valuable for future pre-market opportunities and for understanding the dynamics of early token trading. Navigating the Challenges and Risks of Pre-Market Tokens While the Bitget pre-market PAWS launch presents exciting opportunities, it’s crucial to be aware of the potential challenges and risks associated with pre-market token trading: Volatility and Price Fluctuations: Pre-market token prices can be highly volatile. Prices are often driven by speculation and early sentiment, which can lead to significant price swings. Be prepared for potential fluctuations and understand that pre-market prices may not accurately reflect the token’s value post-launch. Liquidity Concerns: Liquidity in pre-market trading can be lower compared to established exchanges. This might make it harder to buy or sell large quantities of tokens at desired prices. Project Risks: Pre-market tokens are associated with newer projects, which inherently carry higher risks. The project might not achieve its goals, the token launch could be delayed, or the token’s value might not perform as expected after launch. Thorough research into the PAWS project (once more information is available) is crucial. Platform Risks: While Bitget is a reputable exchange, using any pre-market platform involves a degree of trust in the platform’s security and operational integrity. Information Asymmetry: Information about pre-market tokens might be less readily available compared to established cryptocurrencies. Conducting due diligence and staying informed is essential. Actionable Insight: Approach pre-market participation with caution and a clear understanding of the risks involved. Never invest more than you can afford to lose, and always conduct thorough research. The thrill of early access should be balanced with responsible risk management. Preparing for the PAWS Token Launch on March 18th With the official token launch of PAWS slated for March 18th, now is the time to prepare and maximize your potential benefits from the Bitget pre-market initiative. Here are some steps you can take: Join the Bitget PAWS Pre-market: If you haven’t already, navigate to the Bitget website and find the pre-market section to participate in the PAWS offering. Engage in Telegram Communities: Actively participate in the designated Telegram communities to stay informed and contribute to the community growth. Complete Activities and Earn Points: Look out for announcements regarding activities that allow you to earn crypto points. Maximize your participation to accumulate as many points as possible. Research the PAWS Project: While details might be limited initially, try to gather as much information as possible about the PAWS project. Understand its goals, team, technology, and potential use cases. This will help you make informed decisions about your involvement. Monitor Pre-market Trading: Keep an eye on the PAWS pre-market trading activity on Bitget. Observe price trends and market sentiment to gain insights. Prepare for the Token Conversion: Understand the process for converting your earned points into PAWS tokens after the official launch on March 18th. Ensure you meet any requirements set by Bitget for the conversion process. Conclusion: Embrace the PAWS Opportunity on Bitget Pre-Market Bitget’s introduction of PAWS to its pre-market platform is a compelling opportunity for crypto enthusiasts seeking early access to promising new tokens and a chance to earn crypto through community engagement. The innovative approach of rewarding participation with points convertible to PAWS tokens sets this pre-market launch apart.

Several altcoins have produced impressive gains over the past day, and ATOM stands out as the only one with a double-digit increase. BTC at $84K The primary cryptocurrency had a rocky start to the week as it lost the $86,000 level, which held during the previous weekend, and slumped to $80,000 on Monday. After a brief rebound to $84,000, the bears took complete control of the market and pushed it south hard to under $77,000 for the first time in approximately four months. After losing nearly ten grand in less than 48 hours, BTC finally reacted well and jumped above $80,000 hours later. It kept climbing on Wednesday after the favorable US CPI data but was stopped at $84,000 and driven back down to $80,000. More volatility ensued on Thursday and especially on Friday when it jumped from $82,000 to a multi-day peak of over $85,000 within hours. However, the rally faced another rejection, and BTC now trades quietly at around $84,000. According to some analysts, this is a crucial support zone that could determine whether bitcoin has the legs to challenge $90,000 soon. For now, its market cap remains under $1.670 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts is close to 59%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView SOL, SUI on the Rise As mentioned above, the two top gainers from the larger-cap alts are SOL and SUI. Both have jumped by over 6% and now trade above $230 and $2.35, respectively. ETH remains above $1,900 despite some warnings about a potential drop below $1,300, while XRP has tapped $2.4 after a 4% daily surge. BNB has neared $600, while DOGE, ADA, and LTC are up by around 3% each. The total crypto market cap has added about $60 billion since yesterday’s low and is up to $2.840 trillion on CG.

On-chain data also shows that the DOGE address activity has surged by 400% amid strong investor sentiment. Some market analysts believe that the gates for a parabolic rally in Dogecoin are still open. Dogecoin Price to See A Parabolic Rally to $6? Crypto market analysts are hopeful of a Dogecoin price rally all the way to $6 as the bulls take charge, bouncing back from the support of $6.

According to the report, active Dogecoin addresses have surged by 400%, reaching nearly 395,000. This significant uptick in activity underscores growing interest in the popular meme coin.

According to the analyst, maintaining the $0.14750 level is crucial for a bullish breakout scenario.

Experts are confident that FXGuys will outperform both SOL and TRX this year, as it brings incredible utility to the market. However, FXGuys’ utility isn’t the only reason why experts believe it will outperform Solana and TRON. It’s also because it brings a great new trading platform to our doorsteps, one that will make trading much more profitable. And if that wasn’t enough, FXGuys also offers a great prop firm for funded traders! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE FXGuys: Introducing the New Crypto Trading Platform That Will Beat Solana and TRON at Their Own Game Solana and TRON are widely known because of their utility. However, now, FXGuys is emerging as the next big crypto that will beat them at their own game. That’s because, as a new crypto trading platform, FXGuys offers utility that traders have been needing for months. Furthermore, this new crypto trading platform makes trading much easier than before. And lastly, it also offers a great prop firm with extremely generous terms. Because of all of this, experts are confident that FXGuys is the next big crypto that will take over the market, just like Solana and TRON did in the past. The utility that FXGuys offers can be broken down like this – it gives people access to a great new crypto trading platform, it doesn’t impose any barriers to entry, and it offers amazing rewards. With this new crypto trading platform, traders will get access to a wide range of great features. First off, they’ll get same-day payouts and unlimited profit withdrawals. Second, they’ll get access to a wide range of tools that will make trading easier, such as charts, AI trading tools, and copy trading. You can experience this new crypto trading platform for yourself right now, as FXGuys recently launched a free trial for its BETA platform. This lets you get a glimpse into what FXGuys offers before you take the plunge and join its public presale. As for the FX Guys prop firm, it comes with a very generous 80/20 profit split. It also gives funded traders access to up to $500,000 in funds. Furthermore, all FXGuys users will get access to great rewards programs. There’s the FXGuys Trade2Earn program, via which traders will earn $FXG tokens with every trade they make. FXGuys also has a great staking program, via which users can stake their tokens and get a share of FXGuys’ fees and volume in return. Also, anyone can use this new crypto trading platform, no matter where they’re from and what skill level they have! Will the SOL Price Drop to $60 Next? Analyst Says Yes Donald Trump’s recent inclusion of SOL as part of the U.S. Crypto Reserve helped SOL’s price to rise by over 6% on its weekly chart. Now, the SOL price is at $149, but all might not be as good as it seems. Namely, Solana holders were ecstatic about this news, as they believe this will push SOL’s price to $300+ in 2025. However, Solana’s co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko is against the Crypto Reserve as a whole. He states that the reserve will ruin decentralization. Now that he’s stated his opinion, Solana holders are also starting to be skeptical about the reserve. So, once again, SOL is plagued by uncertainty. Because of this and SOL’s performance, a prominent analyst says that its price will fall to $60 by mid-2025. He says that if Solana’s price breaks below its $125 support level, it will plunge to $60 in no time. With this in mind, it’s clear why experts are confident that FXGuys is the next big crypto that will outdo Solana – it has much better growth potential and offers amazing real-world utility! The TRX Price Is Headed to $0.30 as Active TRON Addresses Rise Unlike Solana, TRON’s near future seems much brighter. That’s because the TRX price has been very successful at holding strong above its key support level at $0.17, showing solid strength. Right now, the TRX price is at $0.24, up by over 6% in the past week. Also, the TRON network recently hit 2.94 million active TRON addresses, which is a 2-month high. This shows that the market’s interest in TRX is increasing, which is another bullish sign for TRX. Furthermore, a prominent analyst believes that, because of the strength that TRON is showing, the TRX price might reach $1 this year. This would mark a 316% rise from the current TRX price. But, still, TRON can’t compare with the potential that FXGuys offers. That’s why FXGuys is deemed the next big crypto that will outdo TRON this year! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE $FXG: Invest in the Market’s Next Big Crypto While It’s Still Early! When you consider the utility, perks, and profitable terms it offers, it’s easy to see why experts see $FXG as the next big crypto runner. And right now, you can invest in the market’s next big crypto runner early, as $FXG is still in Stage 3 of its public presale, available at $0.05. This price won’t be here for long, as $FXG is set to launch at $0.10. Once the launch is complete, $FXG’s first-ever rally will begin, and early investors will catch the entire move-up! Because of $FXG’s great potential, experts see $FXG’s price rising by 100x by Q2 of 2025, and even more in the following months and years!

According to reports, Vinnik arrived in Moscow on a flight from Turkey after he was released from custody in California. The Russian cybercriminal was accused of owning and operating one of the biggest exchanges globally. According to prosecutors, the exchange was used to facilitate and launder funds for criminals, with the tune of funds going into billions of dollars. Alexander Vinnik was first arrested in Greece in 2017 on several charges including a 21-count indictment for operating an alleged international money laundering scheme. He was also indicted for helping criminals launder funds from the hacked platform Mt. Gox. The chief in charge of the investigation mentioned at the time that he carried out activities beyond the scope of a legal crypto exchange. Aside from money laundering, he carried out identity theft and helped traffic drugs worldwide. US authorities release Russian cybercriminal According to records, Vinnik was first extradited to France after he was apprehended in Greece. He was subsequently handed a five-year sentence for his crimes. He was then sent back to Greece before being extradited to the United States in 2022 to face his crimes. During the proceedings, Vinnik pleaded guilty to crimes related to money laundering and how he operated the BTC-e cryptocurrency exchange from 2011 to 2017. According to court filings, Vinnik was one of the administrators on the website during the period, with investigations showing that the platform processed $9 billion in transactions, servicing several clients, including customers in the United States. The platform was a safe haven for criminals as they sent funds gotten from illicit transactions and activities to the platform to be processed. The platform received funds from numerous ransomware payments, identity thefts, Including funds from some corrupt officials looking to hide embezzled funds. While promoting the platform and carrying out the activities, Vinnik was responsible for losses estimated to be around $121 million. Authorities also alleged that the platform was unregistered in the United states, hence, it was illegal to offer services to users in the country. Aside from that, it also lacked the basic anti-money laundering requirements and also did not have a strict KYC policy. Vinnik was set to have set up numerous shell companies, owning accounts globally which helped BTC-e conduct its business without itch. American schoolteacher set to return home As part of the prisoner swap that freed Alexander Vinnik, American schoolteacher Marc Fogel will be freed by Russian authorities, returning home to his family in the United States. According to a previous report, Vinnik’s legal representatives were trying to include him in a potential prisoner swap that would involve freeing detained Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich. Fogel, who had been held in Russia since 2021, was sentenced to 14 years in prison on drug trafficking charges. Fogel was arrested at the Moscow airport after officials discovered that he was carrying less than an ounce of Marijuana in his luggage. In a statement to reporters, President Trump noted that the release was an important step to end the country’s war with Ukraine, adding that the United States did not give up too much for Fogel’s release. He added that the United States was treated well by Russia, and he hopes it is the start of a cordial relationship that will see to the end of the war with Ukraine. “The US and Russia negotiated an exchange that serves as a show of good faith from the Russians and a sign we are moving in the right direction to end the brutal and terrible war in Ukraine,” Trump’s national security adviser, Mike Waltz said. Vinnik’s sentencing was scheduled to take place in June, but the exchange will see him forfeit millions of dollars in assets, according to a New York Times report.

41695288,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=140281,1742035821,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin ETF Plunge: Smart Investors Flock to Gold ETFs as Market Correction Deepens,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-etf-plunge-gold-etfs/,"In a dramatic shift in investor sentiment, Bitcoin ETFs are experiencing a significant downturn, while their gold counterparts are shining brighter than ever. Are you wondering where smart money is flowing amidst the current market jitters? The answer might surprise you: it’s gold. Let’s dive into the fascinating dynamics at play, exploring why investors are ditching Bitcoin ETFs and flocking to the safe-haven appeal of gold. Bitcoin ETFs Face Massive Outflows as Gold ETFs See Inflows The numbers don’t lie. Over the last month, a staggering $5 billion has been pulled out of Bitcoin ETFs , according to CoinDesk data. This exodus contrasts sharply with Gold ETFs , which have witnessed a massive influx of $10 billion during the same period. This divergence highlights a clear change in investor preference as market uncertainties mount. Let’s break down the key trends: Gold ETF Gains: A substantial $10 billion inflow in the last 30 days. Bitcoin ETF Losses: A significant $5 billion outflow in the last 30 days. Gold Price Surge: Gold futures have broken records, surpassing $3,000 per ounce for the first time, marking a 15% increase year-to-date. Bitcoin Price Dip: Bitcoin, in contrast, is down 11% year-to-date, currently trading around $83,000. This stark contrast raises a crucial question: What’s driving this capital rotation? Why are Investors Shifting from Bitcoin ETFs to Gold ETFs? Several factors are contributing to this significant shift in ETF investments . Analysts point towards a confluence of macroeconomic and geopolitical events that are bolstering gold’s appeal as a safe haven asset while simultaneously dampening enthusiasm for riskier assets like Bitcoin. Here are the primary drivers behind gold’s resurgence and Bitcoin’s recent struggles: Inflation Fears: Persistent inflation continues to be a major concern for investors. Gold is traditionally seen as an inflation hedge, preserving value during times of rising prices. As inflation worries linger, investors are increasingly turning to gold to protect their portfolios. Geopolitical Tensions: Global uncertainties, ranging from ongoing conflicts to rising international tensions, are fueling demand for safe-haven assets. Gold, with its historical reputation as a store of value during crises, benefits from this risk-averse sentiment. Trump’s Tariff Policies: The resurgence of protectionist trade policies, particularly under former U.S. President Trump, adds another layer of economic uncertainty. Tariffs can disrupt global trade and potentially lead to inflationary pressures, further strengthening gold’s appeal. Market Correction Concerns: The S&P 500 entering correction territory signals broader market unease. A market correction , defined as a 10% to 20% decline from a recent peak, often prompts investors to reduce exposure to riskier assets and seek safer alternatives like gold. The Allure of Gold ETFs: A Time-Tested Safe Haven Gold ETFs offer investors a straightforward and efficient way to gain exposure to gold without the complexities of physical gold ownership. They track the price of gold, providing diversification and a hedge against economic uncertainties. In times of volatility, gold tends to maintain or increase its value, making Gold ETFs a popular choice for risk-averse investors. Benefits of Gold ETFs: Benefit Description Diversification Gold ETFs can diversify a portfolio, reducing overall risk by acting as a hedge against other asset classes. Inflation Hedge Historically, gold has served as a reliable hedge against inflation, preserving purchasing power over time. Safe Haven Asset During economic downturns and geopolitical instability, gold tends to perform well as investors seek safety. Liquidity and Accessibility Gold ETFs are traded on exchanges, offering high liquidity and easy accessibility for investors compared to physical gold. Bitcoin ETFs: Navigating Volatility in the Crypto Market Bitcoin ETFs , while offering exposure to the world’s leading cryptocurrency, are inherently more volatile than traditional assets like gold. The cryptocurrency market is known for its price swings, influenced by factors ranging from regulatory developments to technological advancements and market sentiment. While Bitcoin offers high growth potential, it also comes with significant risk, especially during periods of market uncertainty. Challenges for Bitcoin ETFs: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, making Bitcoin ETFs susceptible to significant price fluctuations. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, creating uncertainty and potential risks for Bitcoin ETFs. Market Sentiment: Bitcoin’s price is heavily influenced by market sentiment and social media trends, which can lead to rapid price changes. Technological Risks: The cryptocurrency space is subject to technological risks, including security breaches and network vulnerabilities. Actionable Insights: Adapting Your Investment Strategy The current market dynamics present valuable insights for investors. The shift from Bitcoin ETFs to Gold ETFs underscores the importance of portfolio diversification and risk management. Here are some actionable steps you can consider: Review Your Portfolio Allocation: Assess your current asset allocation and consider whether your portfolio is adequately diversified to weather market volatility. Consider Gold Exposure: Evaluate the role of gold in your portfolio. Gold ETFs can be a strategic addition to mitigate risk during uncertain times. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of macroeconomic trends, geopolitical developments, and market indicators to make informed investment decisions. Reassess Risk Tolerance: Understand your risk tolerance and adjust your investment strategy accordingly. In periods of market correction, it may be prudent to reduce exposure to higher-risk assets and increase allocation to safer havens. Conclusion: Navigating the Shifting Sands of Investment Trends The tale of diverging fortunes for Gold and Bitcoin ETFs provides a compelling snapshot of current investment trends . As investors grapple with inflation fears, geopolitical risks, and market correction anxieties, the allure of gold’s safe-haven status is proving irresistible. While Bitcoin ETFs have offered exciting opportunities in the past, the present climate favors the time-tested stability of gold. Understanding these shifts is crucial for navigating the complex and ever-evolving world of financial markets and making informed decisions to protect and grow your wealth.

This marks the first time the firm has explicitly mentioned cryptocurrencies in its annual report, reflecting the evolving world of digital assets on Wall Street. In its letter, Goldman Sachs cited the impact of advances in electronic commerce, emerging financial products, and technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and distributed ledger technology, including cryptocurrencies. “The growth of electronic commerce and the introduction of new products and technologies, including trading and distributed ledger technologies such as cryptocurrencies and artificial intelligence technologies, have increased competition,” the letter said. The admission signals a shift in Wall Street’s perspective on digital assets. Before 2024, Goldman Sachs’ shareholder letters did not mention “cryptocurrency” or “blockchain.” However, the financial giant’s approach appears to have shifted as Bitcoin’s growing adoption and the U.S. government takes a more positive stance. Related News: The Mystery Giant Whale that Deliberately Liquidated Ethereum with 50x Leverage Closes Long Positions, This Time in Another Altcoin Goldman Sachs has steadily increased its exposure to the sector, despite previously taking a cautious stance on Bitcoin and digital assets. The bank has significantly increased its spot Bitcoin ETF holdings, holding $1.27 billion in BlackRock’s IBIT and $288 million in Fidelity’s FBTC as of Dec. 31, 2024. Goldman’s investment in IBIT increased by 88% quarter-over-quarter, while its stake in FBTC grew by 105%. While Goldman Sachs embraces certain aspects of blockchain and crypto, it remains cautious about the risks associated with these technologies. The letter cited concerns about market volatility and cybersecurity vulnerabilities related to distributed ledger technology. “While the prevalence and scope of applications of distributed ledger technology, cryptocurrencies, and similar technologies are increasing, the technology is nascent and may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or have other inherent weaknesses,” the letter said. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon has previously expressed skepticism about Bitcoin’s long-term viability. “I’ve always said I think this is a speculative investment,” Solomon said last summer. However, he acknowledged blockchain technology’s potential to reduce inefficiencies in the financial system. In December 2024, Solomon said the firm would “consider” entering the Bitcoin and Ethereum markets if regulatory conditions in the U.S. changed. *This is not investment advice.

Set to take place on Wednesday, March 19 , at 02:00 PM UTC, this monetary policymaking meeting is anticipated to keep the current interest rates unchanged. FOMC Meeting 2025: What Recent Data Says About Upcoming Rate Cuts Market-wide sentiments of unchanged interest rates are up significantly, triggering investor speculations. According to the latest CME FedWatch Tool data , the upcoming FOMC meeting in 2025 is expected to keep the interest rates the same as January. There is a 98% chance that the U.S. Fed will continue with a 4.25% to 4.5% interest rate, per CME data. Traders and investors anticipated this potential mover ahead of time as the latest US CPI indicated cooling inflation . In tandem, the central bank is expected to reflect neither a hawkish nor a dovish stance with its policymaking endeavors, signaling that the current rate is apt for balancing inflation and economic growth. Powell’s Press Conference To Follow FOMC Meeting 2025 Further, U.S. Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference is to follow at 02:30 PM UTC. The press conference is expected to offer further clarity on the Fed’s stance on monetary policies. A dovish hint in the conference could prove bullish for risk assets, whereas the opposite could trigger a bearish action. Overall, these developments remain extensively eyed by traders and investors as global markets currently witness shockwaves in the wake of Donald Trump’s tariff turmoil. Will The Crypto Market React? No immediate interest rate cuts in the upcoming FOMC meeting in 2025 fuel a neutral crypto market sentiment, although with a bullish bias. Given that the U.S. sustains cooled-down inflation, rate cuts could be on the horizon. Historically, rate cuts have propelled a bullish crypto market wave, aiding Bitcoin, Ether, and other altcoins. However, it’s notable that the Fed may also delay its decision-making, primarily to see how new tariffs impact global markets. The current market scenario remains in turmoil, mostly for all sectors, due to new U.S. tariffs. In the aftermath, S&P 500 is down 8% over the past month, resting at $5,638. Japan’s Nikkei was down over 5% in the past month, at $21,778. Simultaneously, BTC and altcoins also faced severe heat recently, with Bitcoin hitting a multi-month low of $76K in recent days. However, amid cooling inflation and unchanged interest rate speculations, crypto prices showcase the potential for recovery despite macro-heat.

The partnership between Indian founded Polygon Labs and Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries gained significant attention this year when Jio Coins went live on the Jio Sphere Browser, marking a major milestone in India’s expanding Web3 landscape. Additionally, in a groundbreaking move, the town of Dantewada last week migrated over 700,000 land records to the Avalanche blockchain, further demonstrating India’s blockchain adoption. Adding to this momentum, Hashed Emergent has predicted that India will have the world’s largest Web3 developer base by 2028. In its latest third edition of the India Web3 Landscape Report, the firm highlights that India’s Web3 ecosystem continues to strengthen, showing remarkable resilience despite global uncertainties. Growing Web3 Startup Ecosystem in India According to the report, India boasts the world’s third-largest Web3 founder base, with over 1,200 startups across various sectors. Shedding light on emerging Indian start-ups in the world of Web3, Hashed reveals that over 12,000 startups are leading the innovation with Indian founders receiving cumulative funding of $564M in 2024. This shows an astounding growth of 109% from funds raised in 2023. The nature of the funded projects include AI, Real World Assets (RWAs) and Staking Solutions. Few startups emerging in these areas include Kuru, CoinDCX, Kelp, TradeX, KoinX, Rabble, etc. Web3 Indian Startups’ Funding Further, the report reveals that the kind of Venture funds that are investing in these Web3 startups include a good mix of local funds, ecosystem funds and corporate ventures arms of leading exchanges, including Hashed and OKX. Coinbase Ventures, Y Combinator, Animoca Brands, IOSG, and LD Capital, as well as homegrown Venture Capital firms such as Hashed Emergent, CoinDCX, PeakXV, Borderless, and Alpha Wave, are also aggressively investing in Indian projects. Notably, the funding in the infrastructure and finance sector projects saw significant growth last year while the Web3 entertainment sector witnessed continued decline in 2024. With investment activity shifting from L1s/L2s projects in favour of AI infra-related projects, Indian Web3 projects in the respective field garnered over $437M in 2024. Growing Web3 Developer Base in India The Hashed report states that the country contributed 17% (the highest) of all new developers entering the Web3 space in 2024. With 12% of Crypto developer base, India is currently the second largest developer market which is 5% of the global Web3 founder base. It further predicts that India is expected to leapfrog the US with the largest developer community by 2028. A total of 11.8% of crypto developers are based in India, making it the world’s second-largest crypto developer base. In terms of contributions, data shows that 45.3% of Indian Web3 developers contribute code, 29.7% address bug fixes, and 22.4% focus on documentation. Gaming and NFTs account for 30% of developer engagement, while DeFi and RWAs contribute 26%. Interestingly, most Indian developers are new and young to the Web3 space, with over 50% joining in the past two years and 85% under 27. While Hackathons remain the main entry point for developers, global Web3 ecosystems are partnering with universities in Odisha, Bhubaneswar, Madras, and Kerala, introducing students to Web3 technology early to build within the ecosystem. GenZ leads the Crypto Investors Base in India The 2024 growth outpaced the combined growth of 2022 and 2023 as Indian crypto traders grew more sophisticated. According to the repot, the country witnessed a 5x surge in meme coin trading volumes, showing the market’s appetite for emerging opportunities. Gen Z makes up 35% of the crypto investor base, and two-thirds of the futures traders are under the age of 35. Notably, 1 in 10 futures’ traders are females, indicating significant headroom for growth among women. What’s impressive is that 59% of the Indian crypto traders are using stop-loss orders, showing sophisticated risk management. Complex Regulatory Landscape Continues to Pose Challenges India lacks a dedicated regulator for the Web3 sector leaving rooms for further improvements and growth in its growing Web3 Landscape. While highlighting the existing complex regulatory jurisdiction in India, the report suggests that by adopting a disruptive Web3 regulatory, tax and policy framework, it can catalyze population scale on-chain innovation given positive political framing. It further highlights that since India lacks a dedicated regulator for the Web3 sector, the regulatory actions are often guided by perceived risks by the government. Thus, India must overcome its negative Policy perception and instead incentivize the Web3 sector to grow and thrive.

Due to this connection, the MSTR stock price has surged recently, closing at $294.49 on March 14, 2025, marking a 67% increase over the year. However, that is likely a start, as the charts show the potential multi-year breakout that could push its price to the $600-$800 range. Why? Let’s discuss this. MSTR Stock Price Technical Setup: W Bottom and RSI Divergence After a 13% rally with the Bitcoin price recovery, MSTR stock price stands at $297.49. Also, its 5-day timeframe has presented a significant uptrend after its earlier crash, building investor confidence, especially as analysts anticipate a further rally. According to one, the MicroStrategy stock price chart is forming the W bottom pattern on the 4-hour timeframe, which is a classic bullish trend formation. The structure is coupled with the bullish divergence on the Relative Strength Index (RSI), showcasing growing upside moments. These two points reveal a bullish technical setup for the token, but the falling wedge pattern formation further confirms a strong breakout. Not to forget, the 52-week range shows that the stock trades between a low of $101.00 and a high of $542.90, suggesting a wide volatility band. This could also allow for the significant upside momentum, MSTR Stock Price to Hit $800 In an X post , the aforementioned analyst concluded that if the bullish pattern was maintained, the MSTR stock price could reach a significant milestone of $600-$800 in Q2 2025. This is because of the presumption that under the impact of bullish factors, investor sentiments, and interest, MicroStrategy stock reclaims the Pitchfork (PF) midpoints and four-hour Ichimoku cloud, as these would ensure sustained bullish momentum. In addition, the day closes above the four-hour bear channel, signaling a shift in trend structure and opening the door for moving toward $600-$800 in Q2 2025. IF (emphasis on if) we can knock down all of these dominos, 600-800 in Q2 is possible based on multi-year PF However, it is essential to note that these bullish scenarios depend on the supporting macro trend and market conditions, especially Bitcoin’s bullish performance. Key Level to Watch: What Needs to Happen for the $800 Target? As the MicroStrategy stock is nearly three times lower than the anticipated target, a few conditions must be met for an $800 rally. It includes the April tariff dialogues to come favorable for these assets. Also, the stock market must have better stability, influencing investors’ sentiments. Most importantly, the Bitcoin price action must be stronger, as its further rally could drive the stock higher. Requires April tariff dialogue to go well, legacy markets to behave and obviously BTC to pull up significantly In addition, it would have to break out from the current channel, as it resides in a descending structure with a resistance between $330 and $370. It could bring bullish momentum once it breaks above $370-$400. This mid-range target includes the $480-$400 range, the previous highs, and key resistance. A breakout above $500 would ensure the move toward $600 and higher. Overall, investors must watch the short-term breakout confirmation above $330-$370, bullish term resumption above $400-$500, and the final channel resistance between $600-$800 as the final target range. Final Thoughts MicroStrategy stock has strong bullish technical signals, but there are still external risks, considering the crypto market’s instability . If the bullish momentum forms and it clears key resistance levels, the MSTR stock price could move toward $600-$800 in Q2 2025 per analysts. While this is a promising analysis, investors must monitor macroeconomic events, Bitcoin price trajectory, and other factors.

Selling at $0.02 for now, the token’s value will jump 25% to $0.025 in the next phase, and those getting in now stand to see a 200% return when it lists at $0.06. Yet some analysts suggest prices could climb even higher—between $3 and $5—far surpassing Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) legendary 16,000% growth. Meanwhile, Pepe Coin (PEPE) has climbed 7%, propelled by whales investing $4.3 million as rumors of a 215% surge swirl. Despite that, near-term volatility hangs overhead, placing a premium on MUTM’s structural model for potentially safer, exponential gains. MUTM Follows a Proven Presale Playbook As Phase 3 quickly approaches capacity, conversations around Mutuum Finance (MUTM) hint that investors should buy in at $0.02 before the token price climbs further. Early birds could net a 200% profit on launch day, and with a launch price estimate of $3.50, it’s possible to pocket a staggering 17,400% return—closing in on SHIB’s sensational rise. Driving organic demand is the platform’s DeFi-lending toolset, complete with mtTokens and overcollateralized loans. Ongoing revenue-based buybacks further limit supply, creating steady upward price pressure. Unlike meme coins that rely on buzz, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) grounds its value in genuine DeFi utility, appealing to investors who crave both growth and stability. Whales Feed Pepe Coin (PEPE) Volatility Pepe Coin (PEPE) saw a 7% uptick after three whales collectively snapped up 689 billion tokens. Analysts predict a potential 215% increase from its current $0.0000062 support level—provided it can maintain that baseline. Even so, the token’s technical indicators still suggest caution, especially since it remains below its 200-day moving average. Being primarily fueled by speculative trading activity, Pepe Coin (PEPE) faces ongoing uncertainty about its capacity to replicate SHIB’s meteoric performance. This factor stands in contrast to MUTM’s systematic design, which fosters long-term growth through strategic tokenomics. Positioning for the Next Crypto Bull Cycle Shiba Inu (SHIB) took the crypto world by storm in 2024 with extraordinary gains, but big wins generally aren’t due to hype alone. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)—with its well-crafted DeFi 2.0 features—delivers a clearer roadmap for substantial returns, potentially north of 4,000%. While PEPE navigates continued volatility, MUTM’s Phase 3 presale (already 85% full) signals a strong bullish sentiment. A $100,000 giveaway is injecting urgency, rewarding those who join early and reinforcing community trust. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also nearing completion of a CertiK audit for its smart contracts, demonstrating its commitment to security and transparency. Upon finalization, the findings will be released via the project’s official social media outlets, underscoring its robust infrastructure. Should You Bank on Speculation or Sustainable Growth? Rather than simply following trends, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to set them. With Phase 3 winding down, the token is still available at $0.02. Will you lean on speculative short-term swings, or secure your holdings in a framework engineered for lasting expansion? Join the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale now—before Phase 4 kicks in.

The exchange is featured in the latest edition of ‘The STO Financial Revolution,’ a book authored by UCLA professor Alex Nascimento. This inclusion underscores Bitget’s growing influence and innovative approach within the rapidly evolving world of digital finance. Let’s delve into why this recognition is a noteworthy moment for Bitget and the broader cryptocurrency community. Why is Bitget Featured in the ‘STO Financial Revolution’? Professor Alex Nascimento’s book, now in its fourth edition, is a respected resource in academic circles, including at UCLA itself. It explores the intricate landscape of blockchain technology, cryptocurrency, and Web3. A key focus is on Security Token Offerings (STOs) and how they offer a regulatory-compliant path for fundraising, alongside real-world applications of blockchain. The book highlights various organizations playing a pivotal role in this financial transformation, and Bitget’s inclusion is a testament to its impact. According to Bitget’s official website, the book showcases case studies from prominent entities in the blockchain and finance sectors. Alongside Bitget, names like DWF Labs, UNICEF, BTG Pactual, and Polymath are also featured. This diverse group of organizations illustrates the broad spectrum of applications and the widespread influence of blockchain technology across different industries and sectors. Bitget’s presence among such established and impactful organizations solidifies its position as a key player in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space. Understanding the Significance of Security Token Offerings (STOs) Before we proceed further, let’s understand what STOs are and why they are considered a revolutionary aspect of financial technology. Security Token Offerings are essentially the digital evolution of traditional securities. Here’s a breakdown: What are Security Tokens? : Unlike utility tokens that grant access to a service or product, security tokens represent ownership or rights to an asset, such as equity in a company, debt, or real estate. They are subject to securities regulations. Regulatory Compliance : STOs are designed to comply with financial regulations, making them a more legitimate and secure way to raise capital compared to initial coin offerings (ICOs) which often faced regulatory scrutiny. Bridging Traditional Finance and Blockchain : STOs are seen as a bridge connecting the traditional financial world with the innovative realm of blockchain. They bring the benefits of blockchain – transparency, efficiency, and accessibility – to regulated financial instruments. Real-World Applications : From fractional ownership of real estate to tokenized stocks and bonds, STOs are unlocking new possibilities for investment and asset management. The ‘STO Financial Revolution’ book likely delves into these aspects, providing readers with a comprehensive understanding of this burgeoning field and Bitget’s role within it. Bitget’s Contribution to the Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Ecosystem So, how exactly is Bitget contributing to this financial revolution, warranting its inclusion in Professor Nascimento’s book?

Known for its user-friendly platform and a wide array of trading options, including spot trading, derivatives, and copy trading, Bitget caters to both novice and experienced traders. Commitment to Compliance and Security : In the evolving regulatory landscape of cryptocurrencies, Bitget emphasizes compliance and security. This commitment is crucial for fostering trust and long-term sustainability in the crypto market. Driving Adoption of Digital Finance : By offering a robust and accessible platform, Bitget is playing a vital role in driving the broader adoption of digital finance. Its services make it easier for individuals and institutions to engage with cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Educational Initiatives : While the article doesn’t explicitly mention Bitget’s educational initiatives, many leading crypto exchanges invest in educating their users and the wider public about blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Inclusion in an educational book like ‘The STO Financial Revolution’ could also indirectly acknowledge Bitget’s contribution to crypto education. It’s likely that the case study in the book highlights specific initiatives or achievements by Bitget that align with the themes of STOs, regulatory compliance, and the broader financial revolution driven by blockchain. What Does This Mean for the Future of Cryptocurrency and Bitget? Bitget’s feature in ‘The STO Financial Revolution’ is more than just recognition; it’s an indicator of the exchange’s growing influence and its alignment with the future trajectory of finance. Here’s what this signifies: Enhanced Credibility and Reputation : Being featured in an academic book authored by a UCLA professor lends significant credibility to Bitget. It positions the exchange as a reputable and noteworthy player in the eyes of academics, institutions, and the broader public. Increased Visibility : The book serves as an educational resource in academic institutions like UCLA. This exposure can significantly increase Bitget’s visibility among students, researchers, and future leaders in finance and technology. Reinforcement of Bitget’s Strategic Direction : Inclusion in a book focused on regulatory-compliant fundraising and real-world applications suggests that Bitget’s strategic focus is in line with the industry’s move towards greater regulation and practical utility of blockchain technology. Positive Signal to Users and Investors : This news can be seen as a positive signal to Bitget’s existing users and potential investors, reinforcing confidence in the platform’s vision and operational excellence. Navigating the Financial Revolution: Key Takeaways The broader message from Bitget’s inclusion in ‘The STO Financial Revolution’ is about the ongoing transformation of the financial landscape. Blockchain technology, with cryptocurrencies and STOs at its forefront, is not just a fleeting trend but a fundamental shift. Here are some key takeaways: Blockchain is Reshaping Finance : The integration of blockchain into finance is no longer a futuristic concept; it’s happening now. STOs are just one example of how blockchain is creating more efficient, transparent, and accessible financial systems. Regulatory Compliance is Crucial : The focus on regulatory-compliant fundraising in the book highlights the importance of navigating the regulatory landscape. For the long-term success of crypto and blockchain, adherence to regulations is paramount.

Informed participation is essential for the healthy growth of the ecosystem.

According to Michael Gates, lead portfolio manager for BlackRock’s Target Allocation ETF models, Bitcoin has long-term investment potential and can add unique diversification to portfolios.

Bloomberg Senior Commodity Strategist Mike McGlone warned that Bitcoin could experience a major correction toward $10,000, comparing its current trajectory to past speculative bubbles, he said in an X post on March 14. Peak crypto bubble vs gold ETF. Source: Bloomberg Intelligence McGlone cited several factors that could weigh Bitcoin’s price, including rising gold prices, shifts in risk sentiment, and broader macroeconomic conditions. In particular, gold has climbed 15% in 2025, while Bitcoin dropped by the same percentage. The specialist claimed that this inverse link emphasizes the changing demand for risk assets compared to conventional safe-havens. Notably, on March 14, gold crossed the $3,000 mark for the first time as investors sought cover from the economic uncertainty generated by President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs. Still, the precious metal did somewhat retreat, a move attributable to profit-taking. McGlone also noted the S&P 500’s performance as a potential guide on Bitcoin’s path. Historically, Bitcoin has exhibited strong relationships with equities markets, especially during economic uncertainty. He also compared the surge in cryptocurrencies to earlier speculative bubbles, including the dot-com collapse of the early 2000s . The expert underlined record-breaking Bitcoin ETF listings and growing retail speculation as indicators of too great an optimism. Furthermore, since President Trump promotes cryptocurrencies, McGlone advised that more political focus on digital assets could intensify volatility. In another post, McGlone doubled down on his warning , predicting a potential price crash and suggesting that Bitcoin might “lose a zero.” As risk assets come under pressure, he expects investors to shift toward gold, reinforcing its status as a safe haven. #Gold appears more likely to stay above $3,000 a ounce if risk assets continue to decline. #Bitcoin a top leading indicator. #commodities #macroeconomics @BBGIntelligence https://t.co/df8Re4cjB5 — Mike McGlone (@mikemcglone11) March 14, 2025 Bitcoin price analysis At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $83,840, up 1.3% in the past 24 hours but down 3% for the week. Regarding the next price trajectory, on March 14, pseudonymous analyst Patron noted that Bitcoin has broken out of an ascending triangle, a bullish pattern with a measured move target of $90,405.

Therefore, a sustained close above $85,000 would strengthen the bullish case, but failure to hold support may trigger a retest of $80,000. Meanwhile, prominent online analyst TradingShot pointed to Bitcoin’s falling wedge pattern, a setup historically leading to significant price rallies. According to his TradingView analysis , Bitcoin remains below the 50-day Moving Average (50D MA) while finding support at the 50-week Moving Average ( 50W MA ), a structure that has preceded major breakouts.

Source: TradingView Bitcoin’s long-term channel up cycle, now over two years old, has formed similar falling wedge patterns six times, each marking a bottom before a breakout. Past rebounds from these formations have ranged between 26.68% and 106.96%, setting a potential price target of $96,800 to over $150,000 . With Bitcoin testing its long-term channel-up support, similar to previous bottoms in September 2024 and September 2023, the probability of a strong rebound is rising.

Ethereum’s next leap: Why ETH could soar by 2025 Ethereum , launched in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, is a game-changing blockchain platform known for its smart contracts and vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). It pioneered the use of ERC-20 tokens, which are now widely used for governance, utility, and value storage across various platforms. In 2022, Ethereum transitioned to Proof-of-Stake with the Merge, enhancing its efficiency and commitment to decentralization. Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon have been integrated to boost transaction speeds and reduce costs, making Ethereum more accessible. With plans for sharding to further improve scalability, Ethereum continues to evolve and solidify its position at the forefront of blockchain innovation. Ethereum’s potential remains strong, especially with upcoming developments aimed at increasing scalability and reducing transaction fees. The transition to Proof-of-Stake has made staking ETH more rewarding, attracting more participants. Based on historical price movements and Bitcoin halving cycles, Ethereum’s price could reach as high as $6,580.53 next year, with a yearly low prediction of $2,700.31 for 2025. In the current market cycle, Ethereum appears attractive compared to other cryptocurrencies, due to its robust ecosystem and continuous technological advancements. As the demand for decentralized finance grows, Ethereum’s role as the backbone of dApps and smart contracts positions it for significant growth in the coming years. Conclusion While ETH and others are performing well in the current bull run, XYZVerse excels with strong momentum and aims for significant growth as the all-sport memecoin.

The world of Bitcoin is seeing some fascinating shifts. While the price of Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced a dip, there’s a silver lining for users who are tired of hefty transaction costs. We’re diving deep into the latest data that reveals a significant drop in Bitcoin fees , reaching levels we haven’t seen since September 2023. Is this a fleeting moment, or a sign of changing dynamics in the Bitcoin network? Let’s explore this intriguing development. Why Are Bitcoin Fees Plunging to Such Low Levels? This week has brought a welcome change for Bitcoin users. Data from IntoTheBlock, a renowned crypto market intelligence platform, indicates that total BTC fees have fallen to a mere $2.5 million. This represents a substantial 24.4% decrease compared to the week prior. To put this into perspective, these are the lowest levels we’ve witnessed since September of last year. But what’s driving this remarkable reduction in Bitcoin fees ? Several factors could be contributing to this decrease: Reduced Network Congestion: One of the primary drivers of high crypto transaction fees is network congestion. When fewer transactions are being processed on the Bitcoin blockchain, the competition to get transactions included in blocks decreases, leading to lower fees. Price Correction Impact: The article notes a 7.3% drop in Bitcoin price to $80,780. Price corrections in the crypto market can sometimes lead to decreased trading activity, which in turn might reduce the number of transactions needing to be processed, thereby lowering fees. Potential Shift in User Behavior: Users might be choosing to consolidate transactions or utilize Layer-2 solutions like the Lightning Network for smaller, faster, and cheaper transactions. Increased adoption of such solutions can take pressure off the main Bitcoin blockchain, impacting Bitcoin fees . Bitcoin Price Dips: Is There a Correlation? Interestingly, this drop in Bitcoin fees coincides with a decrease in the Bitcoin price . The data reveals a 7.3% price decline, bringing Bitcoin down to $80,780. While correlation doesn’t always equal causation, it’s worth considering the potential links between these two events. Here’s a quick snapshot of the key metrics mentioned: Metric Value Change Bitcoin Transaction Fees $2.5 million ↓ 24.4% Bitcoin Price $80,780 ↓ 7.3% Exchange Flows $840 million – Total Volume $1.9 billion – It’s possible that the price correction has led to reduced on-chain activity, contributing to the lower fees. Traders might be less inclined to move their Bitcoin during periods of price uncertainty, which can lessen network congestion. However, it’s crucial to remember that the cryptocurrency market is influenced by a multitude of factors, and pinpointing exact causes can be complex. Exchange Flows and Volume: What Do They Tell Us? Beyond fees and price, the data also highlights exchange flows reaching $840 million and a total volume of $1.9 billion. Exchange flows represent the amount of Bitcoin moving into or out of cryptocurrency exchanges. High exchange flows can indicate increased trading activity or shifts in investor sentiment. The $840 million figure suggests a significant amount of Bitcoin is being moved across exchanges, which could be for various reasons, including trading, staking, or moving funds to cold storage. The total volume of $1.9 billion represents the overall trading activity for Bitcoin during the week. While substantial, it’s important to compare this volume to previous weeks to understand if it signifies an increase or decrease in market participation. Analyzing these metrics alongside Bitcoin fees and Bitcoin price provides a more holistic view of the current market dynamics. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? For the average Bitcoin user, lower crypto transaction fees are undoubtedly a positive development. It means: Cheaper Transactions: Sending Bitcoin becomes more affordable, especially for smaller transactions that might have previously been eaten up by high fees. Increased Accessibility: Lower fees can make Bitcoin more accessible for users in regions where high transaction costs were a barrier to entry. Potential for Increased On-chain Activity (if sustained): If lower fees persist, we might see a resurgence in on-chain activity as it becomes more economical to transact directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. However, it’s essential to consider that these lower fees might be temporary. If network activity picks up again, or if the Bitcoin price rebounds significantly, we could see fees rise once more. Keeping an eye on network congestion levels and overall market sentiment will be crucial to understanding the future trajectory of Bitcoin fees . Looking Ahead: Will Bitcoin Fees Remain Low? The current dip in Bitcoin fees is a welcome respite for users and a noteworthy market signal. Whether this trend continues depends on a complex interplay of factors, including network activity, market sentiment, and the evolving landscape of Bitcoin scaling solutions. Monitoring these metrics closely will be key to navigating the ever-changing world of cryptocurrency and understanding the true cost of transacting with Bitcoin. In conclusion, the recent data paints a picture of reduced Bitcoin fees alongside a price correction and significant exchange flows. While the exact reasons behind these shifts are multifaceted, the immediate benefit for Bitcoin users is clear: cheaper transactions. As the market continues to evolve, staying informed and adaptable remains the best strategy for navigating the exciting, and sometimes volatile, world of crypto.

One crypto catching investors’ eyes is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), currently priced at just $0.02 in its ongoing presale. With steady growth, solid DeFi utilities, and rising demand ahead of its exchange listings, MUTM presents an appealing alternative for investors seeking stability and substantial returns in a challenging market. Solana (SOL) Faces Risk of 30% Decline Solana (SOL) is currently navigating uncertain market conditions, with recent technical signals indicating a potential 30% price drop. After forming a bearish pattern known as a “death cross,” where short-term moving averages fall below long-term averages, analysts are becoming increasingly cautious about SOL’s immediate price direction. The altcoin recently tested critical support around the $125 mark but is showing signs of weakening investor sentiment. Analysts suggest that if this level fails to hold, SOL could see further losses, potentially dropping below $100 and reaching around $85. Despite Solana’s impressive transaction speeds and previous popularity among DeFi users, recent drops in network activity and reduced market enthusiasm have put additional pressure on the token. Investors remain cautious, monitoring closely whether SOL can stabilize above current support levels or if further declines lie ahead. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) With Solana (SOL) facing the possibility of further declines, holders are beginning to explore alternatives that offer better growth prospects. One of the cryptocurrencies gaining attention right now is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a promising DeFi project with a strong presale momentum. Mutuum Finance is currently in phase 3 of its presale, with tokens available at a low price of just $0.02. Investors have already noticed the project’s potential, with more than 5,700 holders securing their positions. Within the past 12 hours alone, the presale raised an additional $150,000, pushing the total funds raised to $3.35 million. This rapid growth in interest has triggered a sense of urgency (FOMO) among investors. Many are eager to buy MUTM before the price jumps significantly in the next presale phase. By entering at the current price of $0.02, investors stand to benefit substantially, as the token is projected to reach approximately $0.28 shortly after its official launch, reflecting a substantial return on investment. Supporting these optimistic price predictions is the team’s announcement that a beta version of the Mutuum Finance platform will launch alongside the token listing. Releasing a functional product immediately upon token launch will create significant demand, attracting more users and pushing MUTM’s value upwards. Another unique advantage of Mutuum Finance is its buy-and-distribute mechanism. The platform allocates part of its revenue to repurchase MUTM tokens from the open market, distributing these tokens directly to mtToken stakers. This mechanism consistently creates buying pressure, encouraging investors to hold onto their tokens. Holding MUTM is thus increasingly seen as a strategic decision, promising steady appreciation over time as the community expands and platform adoption grows. Mutuum Finance is also developing an overcollateralized stablecoin designed to maintain a stable value pegged to the U.S. dollar. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, this stablecoin allows users to borrow funds by locking their crypto assets within the platform, enhancing liquidity and flexibility. When loans are repaid, the borrowed stablecoins are burned, keeping the token supply balanced and stable. These practical features attract experienced crypto investors looking for reliable projects, positioning Mutuum Finance as a trusted long-term investment in the DeFi market. With Solana’s future looking uncertain, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a practical alternative for investors seeking growth. Backed by real DeFi utility, steady presale momentum, and a clear strategy to increase token value, MUTM represents a promising investment opportunity in today’s market.

However, this seasoned investor claims that three additional tokens are about to erupt with a startling 4500% growth before SHIB can even start to breathe. Strong foundations and creative ideas make these tokens— Rexas Finance (RXS), Ripple (XRP), and Cronos (CRO) very appealing. Here’s a closer look at why these initiatives are positioned to surpass Shiba Inu and offer exponential profits. A Bold Prediction for Shiba Inu (SHIB) According to renowned meme coin analyst Javon Marks, the SHIB price will likely jump to $0.0000810 soon. Although the price has remained stagnant for weeks, many investors believe this is a sign before the price explodes. Should Shiba Inu’s SHIB price prediction come true, its market cap will rise. The analyst argues that it might even touch the $0.0001553 mark, translating to more than an 840% price increase. This ‘Big pump’ is meager compared to the 4500% the other three tokens might offer. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Underdog with Explosive Upside Priced at just $0.20 during its last presale, RXS offers early-stage investors a fantastic prospect. Rexas Finance is designed for exponential expansion unlike established tokens with less space for percentage profits. Rexas Finance is a whole ecosystem meant to democratize blockchain innovation, not just a coin. Its package of tools—which includes a dynamic Launchpad, a user-friendly Token Builder, and an effective QuickMint Bot—empowers companies and developers to build and use unique tokens with low technical hurdles. This combined platform simplifies token generation and encourages ongoing innovation, enabling broad acceptance. Rexas Finance stands out, among other things, for its innovative emphasis on Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization. By digitizing tangible assets such as real estate, commodities, and financial instruments, RXS closes the distance between conventional finance and decentralized technology. Most cryptocurrencies still ignore this ability, opening access to a multi-trillion-dollar industry. By doing this, Rexas Finance offers actual, practical value—a crucial component that can propel its value to $18 or beyond. The presale of Rexas Finance already defines the direction of its bright future. Selling over 452 million tokens at a nominal price of $0.20, the project has generated an amazing $46.4 million. Early investor confidence indicates strong market support for the project’s long-term plan. With a projected listing price of $0.25, the formal launch is scheduled for June 19, 2025, ensuring that once RXS enters the public market, liquidity and momentum should explode, opening the path for phenomenal rewards. Ripple (XRP): The Future of Global Payments Right now, Ripple (XRP) sells for about $2.52 as of this writing. Its market capitalization is $146.4 billion, and its trading volume over 24 hours is $2.4B. Rising prices recently, XRP has broken past several resistance points like the $2.80 mark and the $3 price level before retracing to its current price. This increasing tendency points to XRP’s market attitude becoming favorable. Given a significant change in positive market attitude about XRP, this $3 psychological obstacle breach is especially noteworthy. However, at the $3.40 level, the increasing impetus has run across resistance, resulting in a consolidation period. XRP’s price has varied between a high of $3.18 and a low of $2.5 over this period of consolidation. Breaking the resistance can see XRP shoot up to at least $5. Cronos (CRO): The Crypto.com Ecosystem Expansion Cronos is the token of the Cronos Chain, native to the blockchain created by Crypto.com. It is among the tools offered by Crypto.com to hasten the worldwide acceptance of cryptocurrencies. With entrepreneurship, engineering, finance, and investment banking backgrounds, Cronos founders Kris Marszalek, Rafael Melo, Gary Or, and Bobby Bao have CRO sell for about $0.13. Ranked among the top 50 cryptocurrencies, CRO’s market value is around $2.2 billion. CRO has shown some volatility recently. However, the disclosure of Crypto.com’s 2025 road map has inspired optimism and might propel upcoming expansion. Final Thoughts Although Shiba Inu’s prospective pump in 2025 still has promise, the real explosive development will probably come from newly proposed projects with practical use and strong technology innovation. With its $0.20 entrance price, all-encompassing ecosystem, and innovative approach to RWA tokenization, Rexas Finance (RXS) is poised to surpass more established assets such as Ripple and Cronos in percentage returns. The decision is obvious for investors looking for transforming, life-changing profits. While established tokens offer stability, creative ideas like Rexas Finance will probably lead the next wave of exponential development. The race is on; hence, those who position themselves early in RXS will benefit greatly in the upcoming bull run. You have to act right now.

The ETH price chart against Bitcoin and Ripple (XRP) has a striking similarity to BlackBerry’s collapse against Apple in the early 2000s. This indicates a bearish future for Ethereum. Amid these headwinds, how low will ETH price drop? Let’s explore. BlackBerry & Apple Charts Hint At Dire Ethereum Price Future Ethereum price chart against its top competitors like Bitcoin and XRP suggests that ETH could be trouble. This is after the altcoin breached the lower trendline of the symmetrical triangle pattern on the ETH/BTC and ETH/XRP price charts. This pattern is similar to how BlackBerry performed against its top competitor Apple in the early 2000s. As Apple gained market share, BlackBerry’s performance dwindled and after BB/AAPL made a bearish breakout from the symmetrical triangle pattern, it never recovered. BlackBerry vs. Apple If Ethereum follows this pattern, the price could be on the verge of a major drop. Besides, ETH is about to close one of its worst Q1s in history with consistent monthly drops since the year began. With an Ethereum selling spree pushing the price down, ETH could fail to recover in the near term. As historical patterns hint at a bearish Ethereum price prediction , how low will it go? ETH/BTC Faces Another 30% Drop As XRP/ETH Hits 5-Year High Bitcoin’s rising dominance and institutional interest have been weighing on the Ethereum price. ETH/BTC has fallen to 0.02287, marking its lowest level since early 2021. ETH/BTC could be on the verge of another drop after forming a rounding top pattern, suggesting that the broader trend had flipped from bullish to bearish. ETH could continue dropping within this pattern to the neckline of $0.016. ETH/BTC: 1-Week Chart Meanwhile, XRP/ETH has surged to 0.00125, marking its highest level since March 2020. This follows a massive XRP price rally in late 2024. Moreover, as institutional interest in Ripple rises, this altcoin could continue to outperform Ethereum. XRP/ETH: 1-Week Chart One of the factors causing Ethereum price to underperform against Bitcoin and XRP is a lack of demand from institutions. Data from SoSoValue shows that in the last three weeks. Spot ETH ETFs have seen $598M outflows. As this demand weakens, the price of ETH will continue to face challenges. Crowd Sentiment on Ethereum Plummets – Bullish or Bearish? Data from Santiment reveals that the crowd sentiment on Ethereum has declined significantly, and currently shows that traders are extremely fearful. However, according to the on-chain analytics platform, the current sentiment hints at a potential breakout. Ethereum Crowd Sentiment Historical trends show that when the market sentiment is negative, it often triggers a recovery for the Ethereum price. If this drop marks a local bottom, it could push ETH price higher and possibly precede a bullish reversal.

According to reports, the agency is awaiting the confirmation of Paul Atkins as SEC Chair before moving forward with these approvals. A recent post by SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG), a notable crypto researcher on X, highlighted this development. The delay aligns with the stance of the previous administration, which refrained from approving crypto ETFs in its final days. Based on a trending calendar, Atkins may not be confirmed until 2026, giving the XRP community reason to be wary. The SEC is awaiting the confirmation of Paul Atkins before approving the XRP ETFs. pic.twitter.com/2lOlLt5P91 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) March 14, 2025 Paul Atkins’ Confirmation and Its Implications Paul Atkins, a former SEC Commissioner, has been nominated to lead the agency under the Trump administration. His confirmation process has not yet been completed, as the White House has not yet provided the documentation for review. The SEC’s stance on crypto-related ETFs has been a critical issue for the industry. Experts suggest the agency will approve XRP ETF’s pending applications once Atkins is confirmed. This anticipation has fueled discussions among investors, with many expecting a more favorable regulatory environment under Atkins’ leadership. Meanwhile, the regulator recently acknowledged many ETF applications for XRP and other cryptocurrencies. While none of these have received approval, the acknowledgment signals a willingness to engage with the crypto market. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Potential Resolution of the Ripple Lawsuit Another significant outcome expected from Atkins’ confirmation is the resolution of the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple. Reports indicate that the company is already engaged in settlement negotiations , which could lead to the case concluding even before Atkins formally assumes his role. The lawsuit, which has been ongoing for several years, has been a focal point for the cryptocurrency industry. Its outcome could set a precedent for how digital assets are classified and regulated in the U.S. If a settlement is reached soon, it could further accelerate the approval of XRP ETFs and contribute significantly to its price growth. Institutional Interest in XRP Despite regulatory delays, institutional interest in crypto ETFs continues to grow. Global investment firm Franklin Templeton recently filed for an XRP ETF , and SMQKE attached a document revealing that 60 ETF proposals are awaiting decisions from the SEC. SMQKE also highlighted comments from Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. The analyst advised market participants to remain patient. He noted that Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs were delayed multiple times, and while investors may have to wait, excitement is high for XRP’s future.

According to Shytoshi’s X account feed , the last “activity” the ambassador had on the platform was over a week ago, which was a repost of AGI-gaming ecosystem Astra Nova’s presale on March 7. Last Thursday, the Shibarium marketer and team member known as Lucie tried to calm the community down by explaining that Shytoshi had stepped away from socials to focus on his global marketing duties, as he had previously announced. “ The ambassador is working hard around the globe to bring awareness. I’m sure he will have a lot to talk about once he returns to socials ,” she surmised. Kusama continues with periodic social media absenteeism It is not the first time Shytoshi Kusama has taken a social media hiatus. In May 2024, he reduced his social media presence, later revealing that he had traveled to the Middle East to visit family. The ambassador has a well-documented “workaholic nature,” revealing back in late November last year that he often works up to 20 hours a day to “take SHIB from top 15 to top 5.” How it feels trying to give utility to a memecoin and take it from top 15 to top 5. In less than 5 years… without a huge budget. (Nice piece bro @Macbaconai ) https://t.co/eploEi2zS3 — Shytoshi Kusama™ (@ShytoshiKusama) November 28, 2024 Kusama was mostly active on social media during the December holiday season when many took time off to celebrate with loved ones. Some community members believe Kusama’s silence spells more good news for the development of the Shibarium ecosystem behind the scenes. “ The legend Shytoshi Kusama is cooking something big for sure. He always comes up with some breakthrough news for the $SHIB Army! ” an Astra Nova developer said on X. SHIB price goes up after weekly token burn event In other news, SHIB’s price is up 0.2% in the last hour, following the update of its weekly token burn event made through the Shibburn X account. Over the past seven days, the community has burned approximately 535 million SHIB tokens, taking the weekly burn rate up by 415%. According to data from Shibburn, the total number of SHIB tokens burned to date stands at 410.49 trillion. The project originally created 999.99 trillion tokens, leaving over 589 trillion still in circulation.

The meme coin’s price has been consolidating between $0.00001244 and $0.0000129 throughout the day. The token’s market capitalization now stands at approximately $7.5 billion, a 1.5% uptick from its valuations on Friday’s close. Still, trading volume has gone down by slightly above 7% in the last day, lingering around $172 million. Will SHIB bullish run start soon? According to TradingView’s technical indicators, Shiba Inu’s market sentiment is currently leaning towards strong selling conditions. Momentum oscillators are mostly neutral, but moving averages give the basis for a more bearish prediction . The crypto’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 42.86, which neither spells overbought nor oversold conditions. The Stochastic Index at 38.73 and the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) at -35.78 could also give holders reasons to wait and see where the chart moves before taking any position. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $0.00001530 and the Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $0.00001519 both show that the coin is battling downward pressure. Longer-term indicators remain well within bearish territory, with the 100-day EMA at $0.00001743 and the 200-day EMA at $0.00001853, both well above SHIB’s current price. Still, momentum indicators like the Awesome Oscillator are mostly negative, drowning out any possibility of price pullback that could start a bullish momentum. SHIB’s 10-day Momentum indicator is negative at -0.00000059, signaling a short-term selling trend that has also been witnessed in the spike in daily net deposits on exchanges, according to CryptoQuant.

Currently, XRP trades at around $2.23, meaning a surge to $12 would represent a 438% increase. Similarly, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), is anticipated to rise to $12, marking a substantial 19,900% growth trajectory. More than 5600 investors have joined the project so far at its current Phase 3 value of $0.02 while the entire platform exceeds $3.3 million in worth. After the forthcoming price surge the platform will reach a new value of $0.025 with a 25% increase from current market rates. Most investors buy MUTM tokens because of the Fear of Missing Out mentality that precedes its price increase. Mutuum Finance tokens are priced at $0.06 during the launch yet Phase 3 investors will reach 200% profit with their initial purchase of $0.02. Mutuum Finance Presale Gains Momentum The investor sentiment-driven growth of MUTM relies on its basic DeFi lending model which provides its momentum for advancement. Through Phase 3 investors have an opportunity to acquire MUTM tokens at $0.02 yet the value will rise to $0.025 after the following period begins. Strategy-based MUTM investors will achieve a 200% profit estimation while the platform functions at $0.06 market value supported by its strong tokenomic foundation. The funding campaign for MUTM has attracted many investors who pushed the platform’s capitalization beyond $3.3 million thus proving market interest in platforms connecting lending resources to growth potentials. Through its automated Buy-and-Distribute mechanism the ecosystem of MUTM purchases tokens in the market and distributes them to stakers during specific time intervals. The model maintains regular market purchases which stands out as a rare phenomenon against the general volatile and speculative market character. Mutuum Finance is in the process of having its smart contract audited by CertiK, a key measure to enhance security and trust. The official audit report will be published on their social media once completed. Innovative Growth Strategy Mutuum Finance defines its identity through its development of mtToken technology which serves as an investment token for both ETH and DAI alongside additional deposit assets. They can earn money from interest-accumulating mtTokens while maintaining complete access to their funds. The platform maintains participant deposits within its pool network while giving different APY yield rates to depositors alongside loan functions for users who have assets as collateral. On the platform users obtain $5,000 USDT by depositing $7,000 ETH with an optimized security measure that controls the loan-to-collateral ratio. A Smarter Alternative to Other Coins Mutuum Finance proceeds with long-term financial operation stability. Investors choose projects that provide enduring value because the presale program is completed at a rapid pace. The ongoing chance to acquire MUTM at $0.25 will become unavailable because experts anticipate market value increases. Investors find remarkable potential in the $12 price milestone competition between Ripple (XRP) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The road to $12 for XRP needs a minimum growth level of 438% while MUTM presents a massive 19,900% surge capacity which makes it an appealing high-reward investment opportunity. Mutuum Finance continues its DeFi market rise through an advanced lending system combined with a safe token system alongside its growing number of investors. Presently XRP Phase 3 presale offers investors a valuable chance to profit substantially because the prices remain at $0.02 per token. The time is now to invest in MUTM tokens while prices are lower than they will be after the initial market takeover.

While Bitcoin has shown signs of recovery, gaining 3.8% over the past two weeks and reclaiming the $85,000 price level, Ethereum has struggled to keep up. ETH remains below the $2,000 mark, a level it fell below last week, currently trading just above $1,900. The disparity in performance between Bitcoin and Ethereum has drawn attention from analysts, particularly regarding Ethereum’s declining strength against Bitcoin in the derivatives market. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Consolidates and Eyes Recovery—Is a Bounce Incoming? Ethereum’s Decline Against Bitcoin: Key Market Trends CryptoQuant analyst SunflowrQuant recently analyzed the ETH/BTC market trends, noting that Ethereum has weakened against Bitcoin over the past two years, reflecting a drop in investor confidence and reduced speculative interest in ETH derivatives. According to SunflowrQuant, during the 2021-2022 period, Ethereum outperformed Bitcoin, signaling strong market interest and increasing activity in Ethereum-based derivatives at the time. However, since then, the ETH/BTC ratio and open interest have both declined, suggesting that Ethereum has been losing ground against Bitcoin in terms of market dominance. By March 2025, the open interest ratio of ETH futures had fallen to 0.15, while the ETH/BTC price ratio dropped to 0.02. This indicates that the bearish sentiment around Ethereum continues to dominate the market, as traders and investors shift their focus toward Bitcoin. The declining open interest in Ethereum perpetual futures contracts further reinforces the idea that traders are showing less speculative interest in ETH compared to BTC. What This Means for ETH’s Future Despite ETH’s underperformance, SunflowrQuant suggests that its current weakness may also reflect broader market fear and uncertainty. The analyst points out that crypto markets are often driven by emotions, and when sentiment reaches an extreme low, a rapid recovery could follow. Related Reading: This Ethereum Monthly RSI Chart Just Crashed To New Lows To Break 2022 Records, What Happened Last Time? Such low-liquidity conditions may lead to unexpected price movements, creating opportunities for ETH to regain strength in the ETH/BTC ratio. Historically, market downturns have been followed by periods of strong recovery, and Ethereum’s fundamentals remain intact. The analyst wrote: Emotional fluctuations and market fear could lead investors to act more cautiously and strategically. We may be at the foundations of new beginnings for Ethereum; just like in previous cycles, after tough times, a strong rebound may occur, reaching new highs. If investor confidence returns, ETH could potentially reverse its trend, similar to how it performed against Bitcoin in 2021-2022. However, this will likely depend on broader market dynamics, including institutional adoption, ETH’s network upgrades, and Bitcoin’s price stability. SunflowrQuant concluded: Looking at the price fluctuations in Ethereum, now could be the perfect time to be part of this transformative process. We are at the bottom of potential new beginnings and opportunities for ETH.

XYZVerse, Pi Network, Sui, and Sei are among the latest contenders. Could these newcomers disrupt the hierarchy and climb into the ranks of the leading cryptocurrencies? This article examines their potential impact and prospects in the competitive crypto landscape. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it’s attracting both sports fans and crypto enthusiasts, creating a unique crossover that’s gaining serious traction. With a strong presale and an engaged community, some investors are already eyeing major potential gains. More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.003333 by Stage 12, with over 70% of the $15 million milestone already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a final presale target price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” Of course, in crypto, nothing is guaranteed, but the excitement is undeniable. Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. By bringing together traditional sports fans and the fast-moving crypto space, XYZVerse is building something different—something with entertainment value and real engagement. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Pi Network: Mobile Cryptocurrency Mining for Everyone Pi Network is a mobile-first cryptocurrency that allows users to mine Pi coins using a smartphone app. Launched in 2019 by Stanford graduates, it aims to make cryptocurrency accessible without the need for specialized hardware. Users earn Pi by checking in daily on the app and building trust circles by nominating 3-5 reliable contacts. This creates a web of verified members, forming a global trust graph that secures the network without massive computing power. Pi uses the Stellar Consensus Protocol, which is energy-efficient and doesn’t drain the mobile battery. The mining process rewards users for contributions like daily check-ins, expanding trusted circles, and running full nodes on computers. Since December 2021, Pi has been operating on its Mainnet blockchain in an “enclosed” period, requiring users to complete KYC verification to transfer mined Pi to the blockchain. The project plans to enter its “open network” phase, allowing full external connectivity. Pi’s approach to accessibility and energy efficiency may appeal to users in the current market cycle.

These features make applications more accessible and user-friendly within the Web3 ecosystem. The potential of Sui lies in its technical foundations and commitment to user accessibility. Whether the coin looks attractive in the current market cycle depends on various factors and individual perspectives. Sei: A Specialized Layer 1 Blockchain for Trading Efficiency Sei is the first sector-specific Layer 1 blockchain, specialized for trading activities. It aims to provide exchanges with an advantage by handling a high volume of orders per second. With a transaction finality time of 380 milliseconds, Sei focuses on speed and efficiency in transactions.

Google has just dropped a bombshell announcement: Google Assistant, your trusty virtual sidekick, is making way for the more advanced and powerful Gemini AI. This isn’t just a simple update; it’s a complete overhaul of how you interact with your Android devices. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and tech-savvy individuals who are always on the cutting edge, this news signals a significant leap forward in mobile AI technology, potentially impacting how we manage our digital lives and even interact with crypto applications in the future. Why is Google Replacing Google Assistant with Gemini? The move to sunset Google Assistant in favor of Google Gemini might seem sudden, but it’s a strategic evolution driven by Google’s ambition to deliver a more sophisticated and versatile AI experience. Google itself has highlighted that Gemini boasts more advanced capabilities than its predecessor. Think of it as upgrading from a standard web browser to a supercharged, AI-driven information hub.

What Does This Mean for Your Android Phone? Later this year, Google Gemini will become the default AI Assistant on most Android mobile devices. This means the familiar Google Assistant will gradually disappear from your phones and app stores. But don’t worry, this isn’t a downgrade; it’s an upgrade! Google is promising a smoother transition and enhanced functionality. Let’s look at what you can expect: Mobile Devices First: The initial focus is on upgrading Android phones to Gemini. Expanding to Other Devices: Tablets, cars, and connected devices like headphones and watches will also be upgraded to Gemini in the future. Home Devices Too: Even smart home devices like speakers, displays, and TVs are slated to receive a Gemini-powered experience. Gradual Rollout: Google will be upgrading users over the coming months, so the change might not be immediate for everyone. Assistant Will Still Work (For Now): Until the full transition, Google Assistant will continue to function on your devices. Exciting New Features Powered by Gemini Google isn’t just replacing an old assistant with a new one; they’re significantly enhancing the features and capabilities of your mobile virtual assistant . They’ve been actively working on improving the Google Gemini user experience, especially for those who heavily rely on Assistant functions.

Deep Research: Enabling more in-depth information retrieval and analysis. Navigating the Transition from Google Assistant to Gemini While the upgrade to Google Gemini is exciting, transitions can sometimes bring questions and adjustments. Here’s what to keep in mind as we move from Google Assistant to Gemini: Aspect Google Assistant Google Gemini Technology Older AI Model Advanced AI Model Capabilities Basic voice commands, limited contextual understanding Complex tasks, nuanced understanding, proactive assistance Availability Being phased out on mobile devices Becoming the primary Android Assistant User Experience Familiar, but potentially less powerful New, potentially more intuitive and feature-rich Embrace the Future of Mobile AI with Gemini The shift from Google Assistant to Google Gemini is a bold move by Google, signaling their commitment to pushing the boundaries of mobile AI. For Android users, especially those in the crypto and tech space who thrive on innovation, this upgrade promises a more intelligent, efficient, and seamless mobile experience. As virtual assistant technology continues to evolve, Gemini is poised to be a game-changer, offering a glimpse into the future of how we interact with our devices and the digital world around us.

According to new court filings, a judge is granting an expansion to 3AC’s claim against FTX, bringing its total up to a staggering $1.53 billion from just $120 million. The document says that FTX, which went bankrupt in 2022 under the leadership of chief executive Sam Bankman-Fried, liquidated $1.53 billion worth of 3AC’s assets on the platform just two weeks before 3AC went under itself. “Liquidators had learned that as of June 12th, 2022, 3AC had approximately $1.53 billion of assets on the FTX platform, and that between the close of business on June 12th, 2022, and the close of business on June 14th, 2022, nearly all of those assets were liquidated. The Liquidators’ analysis further showed that as of the close of business on June 12th, 2022, 3AC had a purported liability (called a ‘negative USD balance’) of approximately $1.3 billion which, in the Liquidators’ view, 3AC’s assets were liquidated to eliminate. In other words, the information obtained by the Liquidators in the year since they filed their Original POC led them to the new conclusion that just two weeks before the commencement of the 3AC Liquidation, the $1.53 billion of assets that 3AC had on the FTX platform were liquidated to satisfy $1.3 billion in liabilities to FTX.” 3AC was hit hard and subsequently failed to meet its margin calls after the Terra (LUNA) ecosystem collapsed in 2022, causing $40 billion to vanish from the digital assets industry. Around that time, 3AC was hit with a notice of default on a $665 million debt owed to the crypto hedge fund Voyager Digital. FTX also went bankrupt after the collapse of Terra. Bankman-Fried was later found guilty of defrauding investors and mishandling billions of dollars worth of customer funds. He was found guilty in 2023 and sentenced to decades behind bars.

41697582,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=140291,1742039429,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary BMAX ETF: Invest in Bitcoin Treasury via Corporate Bonds,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bmax-etf-bitcoin-corporate-bonds/,"Exciting news for investors seeking a novel approach to cryptocurrency exposure! Rex Shares, a prominent U.S. asset management firm, has just unveiled a groundbreaking financial instrument: the REX Bitcoin Corporate Treasury Convertible Bond ETF, aptly named BMAX. This innovative Bitcoin ETF isn’t your typical crypto fund. Instead of directly holding Bitcoin, BMAX offers a unique pathway to the digital asset world by investing in convertible bonds issued by companies that have embraced Bitcoin as a part of their corporate treasury strategy. Let’s dive deep into what makes this ETF a potentially game-changing addition to the investment landscape. What is the REX BMAX Bitcoin ETF and Why Should You Care About Bitcoin Treasury? At its core, the REX BMAX ETF ( Bitcoin ETF ) is designed to track the performance of convertible bonds issued by publicly traded companies that hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets. Think of it as a hybrid investment vehicle that blends the worlds of traditional fixed income with the burgeoning realm of cryptocurrency. But why focus on companies with Bitcoin Treasury ? The rationale is compelling. A growing number of forward-thinking corporations are recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value and a hedge against inflation. By allocating a portion of their treasury reserves to Bitcoin, these companies are signaling a belief in the long-term prospects of digital assets. Investing in bonds from these entities, through an ETF like BMAX, offers a diversified and potentially less volatile route to gain exposure to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Key Highlights of the BMAX ETF: Unique Exposure: BMAX provides investors with indirect exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency. Convertible Bonds Focus: The ETF invests in convertible bonds, which offer the potential for both fixed income returns and equity upside. Corporate Bitcoin Adoption: It targets companies that are actively incorporating Bitcoin into their corporate treasury strategies. Diversification: By holding a basket of bonds, BMAX aims to offer diversification compared to investing in individual company bonds or direct Bitcoin. Accessibility: ETFs are easily accessible through brokerage accounts, making it simple for both institutional and retail investors to participate. Decoding Convertible Bonds: The Backbone of BMAX ETF To truly understand the BMAX ETF, it’s crucial to grasp the concept of Convertible Bonds . These are not your run-of-the-mill bonds. They are a special type of debt security that offers a unique feature: the option to convert them into a predetermined number of shares of the issuing company’s common stock. This hybrid nature makes them particularly interesting, especially in the context of companies involved in or related to volatile assets like Bitcoin. Here’s a simplified breakdown of Convertible Bonds: Feature Description Fixed Income Component Like traditional bonds, convertible bonds pay a fixed interest rate (coupon) over a specified period. Conversion Option Bondholders have the right, but not the obligation, to convert their bonds into a set number of common shares of the issuing company. Conversion Ratio Determines how many shares you receive for each bond upon conversion. Conversion Price The effective price per share at which you would be buying the stock if you convert. Upside Potential If the company’s stock price rises above the conversion price, the value of the convertible bond can also increase significantly, reflecting the potential equity upside. Downside Protection The bond component provides a degree of downside protection compared to directly holding the company’s stock, as bonds are generally less volatile and have a claim on assets in case of bankruptcy (though still subject to credit risk). In the context of the BMAX ETF, these Convertible Bonds are issued by companies holding Bitcoin Treasury . This means the performance of these bonds can be influenced by both the financial health of the issuing company and, indirectly, by the price movements of Bitcoin. If the company’s stock price rises, potentially driven by positive sentiment around Bitcoin or the company’s Bitcoin strategy, the convertible bonds can become more valuable. Benefits of Investing in BMAX ETF: Why Choose Bitcoin-Backed Corporate Bonds? Why would an investor consider BMAX ETF over other crypto investment options, or even traditional bond ETFs? There are several compelling benefits to consider: Diversified Bitcoin Exposure: Instead of betting on a single company or holding Bitcoin directly, BMAX offers exposure to a basket of companies that are bullish on Bitcoin. This diversification can help mitigate company-specific risks. Potentially Lower Volatility than Direct Bitcoin: Convertible bonds are generally less volatile than cryptocurrencies themselves. By investing in BMAX, investors might experience a smoother ride compared to the rollercoaster of direct Bitcoin investment. Income Generation: Unlike directly holding Bitcoin, which doesn’t generate income, convertible bonds pay regular interest. BMAX ETF, therefore, provides a potential income stream through these coupon payments. Equity Upside Participation: The convertible nature of the bonds means investors can potentially benefit from the upside if the underlying companies perform well, possibly driven by their Bitcoin strategies or broader market trends. Access to Institutional-Grade Bitcoin Exposure: Investing in companies with Bitcoin Treasury strategies is often seen as a more institutional and mature way to engage with the crypto space. BMAX provides access to this segment of the market. Are There Challenges and Risks Associated with BMAX ETF? Like any investment, the BMAX ETF is not without its potential challenges and risks. It’s crucial to be aware of these before making any investment decisions: Credit Risk: The ETF invests in Corporate Bonds , which carry credit risk. This is the risk that the issuing companies may default on their debt obligations. The financial health of the companies in the ETF’s portfolio is paramount. Interest Rate Risk: Bond prices are inversely related to interest rates. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in the BMAX ETF could decline. Bitcoin Price Volatility: While convertible bonds are less volatile than Bitcoin, their performance can still be influenced by Bitcoin price fluctuations. Negative sentiment or sharp drops in Bitcoin price could impact the value of the ETF. Convertible Bond Complexity: Convertible bonds are more complex than plain vanilla bonds or stocks. Understanding their valuation and the factors that drive their price can be challenging. Concentration Risk: The universe of companies with significant Bitcoin Treasury holdings might be relatively small, potentially leading to concentration risk within the ETF’s portfolio. New ETF Risk: As a newly launched ETF, BMAX’s track record is limited. It’s important to monitor its performance and how it behaves under different market conditions. Examples of Companies with Bitcoin Treasury and Potential BMAX Holdings While the exact holdings of the BMAX ETF will evolve over time and are subject to Rex Shares’ investment strategy, it’s helpful to consider some prominent examples of companies that have adopted Bitcoin Treasury strategies. These companies might issue convertible bonds that could potentially be included in the BMAX ETF’s portfolio: MicroStrategy (MSTR): Perhaps the most well-known public company with a substantial Bitcoin Treasury . MicroStrategy holds billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin and has been a vocal advocate for the cryptocurrency. Tesla (TSLA): The electric vehicle giant, led by Elon Musk, has also invested in Bitcoin, although the size of their holdings has fluctuated. Block (SQ): Formerly known as Square, Block, under the leadership of Jack Dorsey, has been a strong proponent of Bitcoin and holds it on its balance sheet. Coinbase (COIN): While primarily a cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase also holds Bitcoin as part of its treasury and is deeply integrated into the crypto ecosystem. It’s important to note that inclusion in the BMAX ETF would depend on these companies issuing convertible bonds and meeting the ETF’s investment criteria. This list is illustrative and not exhaustive. Actionable Insights: Is BMAX ETF Right for Your Portfolio? So, is the BMAX ETF a suitable investment for you? Here are some actionable insights to consider: Assess Your Risk Tolerance: BMAX offers a potentially less volatile way to gain Bitcoin exposure compared to direct investment, but it’s still subject to market risks, including credit risk and Bitcoin price fluctuations. Ensure your risk tolerance aligns with the ETF’s risk profile. Consider Your Investment Goals: Are you seeking long-term capital appreciation, income generation, or diversification within your portfolio? BMAX can potentially contribute to these goals, but it’s essential to understand its specific characteristics. Diversification Strategy: Think of BMAX as a potential diversifier within a broader investment portfolio. It can complement existing stock, bond, and potentially other crypto holdings. Avoid over-allocating to any single investment, including BMAX. Due Diligence: Before investing, carefully review the BMAX ETF’s prospectus, understand its investment strategy, fees, and holdings. Stay informed about the companies in its portfolio and the broader market conditions. Long-Term Perspective: Investing in BMAX, like any crypto-related investment, should ideally be approached with a long-term perspective. Bitcoin and the companies involved in this space are still evolving, and patience can be key. Conclusion: BMAX ETF – A Novel Bridge Between Bitcoin and Traditional Finance The launch of the Rex Shares BMAX ETF marks an exciting evolution in the cryptocurrency investment landscape. By offering exposure to Bitcoin Treasury through Corporate Bonds , it carves out a unique niche, potentially appealing to investors seeking a blend of crypto exposure with the relative stability of fixed income. While it’s not without risks, the BMAX ETF presents an innovative approach to participate in the growth of Bitcoin adoption among corporations, offering a compelling option for those looking to navigate the intersection of traditional finance and the digital asset revolution. As the crypto market matures, instruments like BMAX ETF are likely to play an increasingly important role in bridging the gap between these two worlds.

The main reason for the rising probability of a Solana ETF is ahead of all other filed ETF applications along with XRP. On the other hand, the chain has been outperforming the other platforms in terms of DEX activity and volume, hinting towards the growing popularity of the chain compared to others. Despite the positive outcomes and the current rebound in the SOL price , here’s why the token is feared to trigger a pullback to $125. Drop in the Solana Market Data The future markets have a massive impact on the upcoming price action as the traders bet on the future price movements. Currently, the Open Interest (OI), which is the total number of open contracts that are yet to be closed, has dropped significantly. With this, the volume is also dropped consistently. This suggests that the spot traders have also become unsure of the upcoming price action as the OI remains lower. With this, the volatility remains lower, keeping the price consolidated within a narrow range. On the other hand, the traders seem to have become bearish on Solana as the short trades pile up to a large extent. The above chart shows that the short trade has been increased heavily compared to that of the long trades. This hints that future traders believe the SOL price may plunge in the coming days, with the major price slabs at $130 and later at $128. After rising above $135, the bearish influence over the token has increased. This suggests the price may continue to remain within a consolidated range between $130 and $136 for a while. Is Solana (SOL) Price Heading Back to $125? The weekly chart of Solana appears to be extremely bearish, as the price has dropped below the rising parallel channel and failed to reclaim levels. The buying pressure has risen consistently while the bulls have intervened a couple of times. As a result, the price has remained within the range, but the technicals suggest the price may face a bearish action soon. The weekly chart of Solana’s price suggests the token has stuck within a bearish range as the price is rising, but the weekly RSI is plunging. This hints towards a probable pullback that could be fast approaching. While the price has dropped below the support of the channel, if the token fails to reclaim the levels before the weekend, then the Solana price is feared to drop back to $125.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,TRADING|SOL|MARKET|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-15 11:50:35

The anonymous figure, referred to on social media as “ETH 50x Big Guy,” has taken out $31 million in LINK long positions with 10x leverage, according to blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain. The trader executed these leveraged bets on Hyperliquid and GMX, two major decentralized perpetual exchanges. In addition, on March 14, he accumulated approximately $12 million worth of LINK in spot purchases. However, on-chain data suggests that shortly after placing the trades, the whale began offloading LINK in small swaps back into stablecoins, signaling a potential profit-taking strategy. This comes just days after the same trader liquidated a massive $200 million Ethereum (ETH) position on March 12, an event that pushed Hyperliquid’s liquidity pool (HLP) into a $4 million loss. The ETH trade, which was executed using 50x leverage, netted the trader roughly $1.8 million in profits, contributing to his total earnings of nearly $17 million over the past month on Hyperliquid. Hyperliquid Adjusts Collateral Rules After ETH Trade Fallout The March 12 trade sent shockwaves through Hyperliquid, a rapidly growing perpetuals trading platform that has captured 70% of the market share in the sector, according to a January report by VanEck. While some in the crypto community speculated about a potential exploit, Hyperliquid defended the trader’s actions , stating they were a natural consequence of its trading mechanics in extreme conditions. To prevent similar situations in the future, Hyperliquid announced changes to its collateral rules on March 13, aimed at ensuring better risk management for high-leverage positions. Chainlink’s Price Struggles The LINK token, which serves as the backbone of Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network, has been on a wild ride over the past few months. Following Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. election, LINK surged by more than 150%, reaching nearly $30 in December. However, the token has since retraced significantly, dropping to under $14 as of March 14, per CoinGecko data. Despite the correction, Chainlink maintains a strong market presence , with a current market capitalization of around $8.7 billion.

In a recent interview with NBC News reporters, Vance said, “There will almost certainly be a high-level agreement that I think satisfies our national security concerns, allows there to be a distinct American TikTok enterprise.” On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order for his administration to find a way forward to “protect national security” without shutting down the social media app used by millions of US citizens. Trump then asked J.D. Vance to lead the efforts to broker TikTok’s sale to a US entity before the deadline in April. The executive order set a 75-day deadline to find a US buyer. This period ends on 5th April, and Vance is already in talks with potential buyers. Trump has previously mentioned that the administration is discussing the deal with four different groups. However, the Vice President did not identify these groups in his recent interview with NBC. Vance added that a deadline extension may also be on the table in case a deal is not reached in time. As of yet, ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company, hasn’t confirmed any negotiations. Furthermore, it hasn’t officially confirmed its plans to sell the app to a US entity. Vance said that paperwork might push TikTok deal past its deadline Vance signaled that clerical issues could possibly push the TikTok agreement past the 75-day period. He said, “Typically, some of these deals that are much smaller and involve much less capital take months to close.” He further added that the administration is trying to close the deal by April. The one factor that could possibly cause a delay is the hefty paperwork involved in the process. He said, “The deal itself will be very clear, but actually creating those thousands and thousands of pages of legal documents, that’s the one thing that I worry could slip.” Yet, Vance is hopeful that an extension would not be required. According to him, once the deal is in place, it will satisfy the US national security concerns. In that case, one could argue that “TikTok is operational, and it’s also operational in a way that’s protective of Americans’ data privacy and America’s national security.” While the four groups in talks haven’t been identified yet, rumors about potential buyers have been thrown around in recent months. Wyoming billionaire Reid Rasner claimed to be in talks with the White House and mentioned that he offered $47.45 billion for the app, which is close to its valuation of approximately $50 billion. According to a report by The Information, Orcale’s Larry Ellison is the leading contender for the deal. Unnamed sources said that ByteDance wants Trump to base the deal on a revived version of ‘Project Texas.’ This project was a failed effort by TikTok’s parent company to address allegations of spying and propaganda against the US government. ByteDance offered to store the data of US citizens on Oracle servers and even called Oracle to potentially review TikTok’s source code for a safety check. Previously while speaking to reporters at the White House in January, Trump mentioned that he would be open to Elon Musk or Ellison buying the app. While Ellison hasn’t publicly commented about it, Musk has already stated that he is not interested in TikTok.

41698019,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=140288,1742040024,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Pi Network Centralization: Is Your Crypto Investment Truly Safe?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/pi-network-centralization-risks-exposed/,"Is your Pi Network investment as secure and decentralized as you thought? Recent revelations are casting a long shadow over the project’s core principles, igniting a firestorm of debate within the crypto community. The dream of a truly decentralized blockchain for the masses might be facing a harsh reality check, and it’s crucial to understand what’s unfolding. Pi Network’s Centralization Concerns: The Shocking Revelation The crypto world thrives on the promise of decentralization – power to the people, away from central authorities. Pi Network, with its ambitious vision of making cryptocurrency mining accessible via smartphones, has garnered millions of users. However, a recent report by Watcher Guru has dropped a bombshell, revealing a potentially critical flaw in Pi Network’s structure: centralization of token supply. Data indicates that a staggering 82.8% of the total 100 billion PI tokens are under the control of the Pi Network core team. Let’s break down these alarming numbers: Core Team Wallets: Approximately 62.8 billion PI tokens are held in just six wallets, all linked to the core team. Development Fund: An additional 20 billion PI tokens are spread across 10,000 wallets, earmarked for development purposes. Circulating Supply (Potentially): This leaves a significantly smaller portion of tokens potentially distributed among the vast Pi Network user base. This concentration of tokens in the hands of the core team directly challenges the narrative of a decentralized blockchain project. It raises critical questions about the true nature of Pi Network and the security of users’ potential investments. Why Does Centralization Matter in Cryptocurrency? Centralization in the crypto space is often seen as a red flag. Why? Because it undermines the fundamental principles that make cryptocurrencies attractive alternatives to traditional financial systems. Here’s a quick rundown of why excessive centralization is a major concern: Single Point of Failure: When a significant portion of a network or its assets is controlled by a single entity, it creates a single point of failure. If the core team’s wallets are compromised, or if the team makes decisions against the community’s interest, the entire network could be at risk. Security Risks: Large, centralized holdings are tempting targets for hackers. The sheer volume of tokens in a few wallets increases the potential for catastrophic losses if security is breached. Lack of Transparency and Governance: Centralized control often leads to opaque governance. Decisions might be made behind closed doors, without community input, fueling distrust and skepticism. Contradiction to Decentralization Ethos: For many crypto enthusiasts, decentralization is not just a technical feature; it’s a core value. Projects claiming to be decentralized must genuinely embody this principle in their structure and operation. Pi Network vs. Truly Decentralized Blockchains: A Stark Contrast To understand the gravity of the centralization concerns, let’s compare Pi Network to established, genuinely decentralized blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum: Feature Pi Network Bitcoin Ethereum Token Distribution Highly Centralized (Core team controls 82.8%) Decentralized (Widely distributed through mining and market activity) Decentralized (Distributed through mining, staking, and market activity) Number of Nodes 43 (Reported) ~15,000+ ~7,000+ Active Validators 3 (Reported) Thousands of miners Thousands of validators (Proof-of-Stake) Governance Centralized (Core team decisions) Decentralized (Community-driven, consensus mechanisms) Decentralized (Community-driven, consensus mechanisms) The table paints a clear picture. While Bitcoin and Ethereum boast thousands of nodes and validators, ensuring network resilience and decentralization , Pi Network’s infrastructure appears significantly more centralized. The limited number of nodes and validators raises questions about network security and censorship resistance. Community Frustration and Transparency Concerns Beyond the token distribution data, community sentiment within the Pi Network ecosystem is also becoming increasingly critical. Frustration is mounting due to: Governance Transparency: Lack of clarity regarding decision-making processes within the core team is a major pain point. Pioneers (Pi Network users) are seeking more transparency and involvement in the project’s direction. Token Migration Delays: The much-anticipated Mainnet launch and subsequent token migration have faced repeated delays. This prolonged wait, coupled with limited communication, has fueled skepticism about the project’s progress and legitimacy. Limited Utility: Despite years of development, the practical utility of PI tokens remains limited. Concerns are growing about whether PI will ever become a widely accepted and usable cryptocurrency . Is Pi Network a Scam? Navigating the Uncertainty While the data on token centralization and community concerns are alarming, it’s crucial to avoid jumping to conclusions. Calling Pi Network a scam outright might be premature. However, the revelations demand a serious and critical evaluation of the project. Actionable Insights for Pi Network Users: Exercise Caution: Given the centralization risks and transparency issues, approach Pi Network with heightened caution. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t rely solely on project marketing. Seek out independent analysis and form your own informed opinion. Manage Expectations: The path forward for Pi Network is uncertain. Be realistic about the potential for financial returns and the risks involved. Engage in Constructive Dialogue: Participate in community discussions, raise your concerns, and demand greater transparency from the core team. The Road Ahead for Pi Network: Decentralization or Bust? Pi Network stands at a critical juncture. Addressing the centralization concerns and restoring community trust is paramount for its future success. The core team needs to demonstrate a clear commitment to decentralization through tangible actions, including: Token Distribution Strategy: Implementing a transparent plan to gradually decentralize token distribution and reduce the core team’s holdings. Enhanced Governance: Establishing a more open and community-inclusive governance model. Increased Transparency: Providing regular updates, clear communication, and greater visibility into project development and decision-making. Network Decentralization: Actively working to increase the number of nodes and validators to strengthen network security and resilience. The crypto community is watching closely. Whether Pi Network can pivot and address these critical issues will determine its long-term viability and its place in the evolving landscape of decentralized blockchain technology. In conclusion, the revelation of significant token centralization within Pi Network casts a shadow over its decentralized aspirations. Combined with community frustrations and transparency concerns, these findings warrant serious consideration. While the project’s future remains uncertain, one thing is clear: Pi Network must prioritize decentralization and transparency to regain trust and fulfill its initial promise. The crypto world demands it, and the Pioneers deserve it.

SOL surged 7% as a contentious SIMD-0228 drew to a close late Thursday in favor of those against it, keeping its current inflation schedule intact. The proposal drew the highest voting turnout in Solana’s governance history, as reported , with those against saying a passage could disrupt parts of its flourishing DeFi ecosystem and dispel chances of further institutional interest. XRP rose 5% following a strong week for closely-related Ripple Labs, which bagged a payments license in the UAE and, per sources , is said to be on track for a close of its long-running court case against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Meanwhile, memecoins caught a bid on Friday as pepecoin (PEPE), toshi (TOSHI), dogecoin (DOGE) and other memes rose as much as 40%, providing volatility for traders amid a mostly flat market. Base-based TOSHI jumped 38%, leading gains, with PEPE up as much as 12% before paring gains in European afternoon hours. Meanwhile, Base-based KEYCAT jumped more than 100% as developers announced a partnership with Acheron Trading as its official market maker — aiming to boost liquidity and expand the token’s presence on exchanges. The broader memecoin rally reflects a shift in trader behavior as bitcoin (BTC) trades sideways, pushing speculators toward higher-risk, higher-reward assets. BTC ended the week down 3%, faring slightly better than the past two weeks where extreme volatility saw it bounce between $75,000 and $95,000 — bringing it down as much as 20% from a Jan. peak above $108,000. As such, traders continue to eye macroeconomic factors and rate cut decision for cues on further positioning. “The recent cooling in inflation strengthens the case for potential rate cuts later this year,” Agne Linge, head of Growth at WeFi, told CoinDesk in a email. “However, escalating geopolitical and economic tensions particularly from the ongoing trade war add complexity to the Federal Reserve's policy trajectory.” Bitcoin has experienced intense whipsaw price action over the past two weeks, fluctuating between $79K and $85K amid heightened macroeconomic uncertainty. Its rapid on-off price dynamics reflect its increasing sensitivity to macroeconomic factors—suggesting that Bitcoin is behaving more like a risk-on asset than a traditional store of value. This volatility is likely to persist in the coming weeks as geopolitical tensions and macro-uncertainties continue to drive market sentiment,” Linge added. Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro chief market analyst, told CoinDesk in an email that a strong break above the $89,000 level should be watched by traders looking to turn bullish.“Only if the market breaks above its 200-day moving average will we be able to take it as a signal of a return to growth. For now, the market dynamics resemble no more than just a bumpy downtrend,” Kuptsikevich said. “Bears are regaining control of the market on bounces to the $83,500 area.”",Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|SOL|XRP|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-15 12:05:52

Since many investors expect more gains from XRP, this price rise has strengthened their belief in its long-term viability. Pepe Coin (PEPE), on the other hand, has suffered; its value keeps declining. PEPE, trading at $0.000009304 right now, dropped 40.80% last month and 53.32% year-to-date. One $0.20 DeFi token, Rexas Finance (RXS), is being hailed as the next major mover, ready to follow XRP's increasing trajectory as PEPE investors deal with growing uncertainty. Rexas Finance (RXS): A Revolutionary DeFi Token Bridging Digital and Real-World Assets Rexas Finance (RXS) effortlessly transforms DeFi by linking the real world with digital assets. Unlike meme currencies like PEPE, which largely depend on social media attention, RXS is based on solid concepts with practical uses. The technology lets users tokenize actual assets such as commodities, intellectual property, and real estate to enable a seamless transition between conventional and blockchain-based funding. Rexas Finance's capacity to empower users everywhere defines it in many ways. With just a few clicks, RXS lets an investor own a piece of a luxury asset or tokenize a complete home. This capacity to democratize asset ownership puts RXS in a class. It provides a workable answer to actual asset tokenization in a manner not currently possible by any other crypto project. Rexas Finance (RXS) Presale: A Phenomenal Success with Explosive Growth Rexas Finance (RXS) has had quite remarkable presale period performance. Currently, in stage 12, RXS costs $0.20, following a noteworthy increase of almost 6x from its first presale stage. This stratospheric climb has attracted notable investor attention, with the presale bringing in nearly $46.67 million. The last presale level is stage 12, and with more than 90.68% of the presale level full, the excitement around RXS's forthcoming release is intensifying. With a listing price of $0.25, the official launch date is June 19, 2025, which will delight early investors seeking large returns. The popularity of the presale emphasizes RXS's increasing long-term investing confidence. Unlike the erratic volatility of meme currencies like PEPE, RXS has a disciplined growth plan supported by actual use, which appeals to institutional and individual investors. RXS Positioned for a Major Rally Similar to XRP’s Explosive Growth According to market observers, Rexas Finance (RXS) might follow a similar path to Ripple (XRP), which experienced a significant price rise following post-regulatory events. As Ripple picks up momentum and rebuilds investor confidence, the market mood has changed, and money is pouring into essentially good projects. Thus, RXS has become a top candidate for the next significant movement. The token's strong market positioning and real-world asset tokenizing features help create the conditions for a notable price increase. Entering the open market with its listing price of $0.25 and rising investor excitement, RXS might see a significant increase, possibly repeating XRP's earlier success. Through a thorough assessment by Certik, one of the most credible blockchain security companies, Rexas Finance (RXS) has taken actions to strengthen investor confidence. This audit guarantees that RXS runs on a strong, safe infrastructure without weaknesses likely to endanger investor money. Adding to the buzz, Rexas Finance (RXS) has started a $1 million giveaway program for first-time attendees. Twenty lucky winners will each receive $50,000 worth of RXS. The giveaway has already received over 1.53 million entries. The great momentum and community involvement resulting from this project have piqued interest in the next one before it starts officially. Conclusion: RXS Poised to Outshine PEPE and Follow XRP’s Bullish Trend For those looking for exponential development, Rexas Finance (RXS) becomes the perfect substitute even if Ripple (XRP) keeps gathering pace and Pepe Coin (PEPE) suffers with diminishing investor confidence. Rexas Finance (RXS) offers a great chance for investors wishing to profit on the next major movement in the crypto sector as its final presale stage price is $0.20, and its launch price is $0.25. RXS is the lighthouse of invention as PEPE's problems get more severe, prepared to follow in XRP's footsteps and rule the DeFi market.

According to Fox Business senior correspondent Charles Gasparino, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently engaged in internal discussions to determine whether XRP should be classified as a commodity, a designation that could drastically alter its regulatory standing and market perception. This pivotal review draws a direct comparison to Ethereum, which, despite its initial coin offering (ICO) origins similar to XRP, was eventually deemed a commodity by the same regulatory body. Let’s delve into the nuances of this developing situation and explore what it could mean for XRP and the broader cryptocurrency market. Decoding the SEC’s XRP Commodity Status Consideration Gasparino’s report on X (formerly Twitter) has ignited fervent discussions within the crypto community. The core of the debate revolves around whether XRP, much like Ethereum, possesses characteristics that align more closely with a commodity rather than a security. This distinction is not merely semantic; it carries profound implications for how XRP is regulated, traded, and utilized. Here’s a breakdown of the key aspects under consideration: Ongoing Utility: The SEC is reportedly scrutinizing XRP’s current utility and how it functions within the digital asset ecosystem. A crucial factor in commodity classification is demonstrating practical applications beyond mere investment speculation. Trading Status: The accessibility and trading dynamics of XRP are also under the microscope. Commodities are generally freely traded and less restricted than securities, which are subject to stricter regulations. Comparison to Ethereum: The precedent set by Ethereum’s classification as a commodity is central to this discussion. The SEC is evaluating whether XRP shares enough similarities with ETH to warrant the same regulatory treatment. The Ethereum Commodity Precedent: A Guiding Light for XRP? To truly understand the significance of the SEC’s current deliberations, it’s essential to revisit the case of Ethereum. Ethereum, like XRP, began its journey with an ICO, a fundraising method that involves selling digital tokens to fund project development. This initial phase often raises securities law questions, as the tokens could be construed as investment contracts. However, despite its ICO origin, Ethereum managed to navigate the regulatory maze and ultimately achieve commodity status. Let’s examine the key parallels and distinctions: Feature Ethereum (ETH) XRP Initial Funding ICO (Initial Coin Offering) Similar to ICO, token distribution SEC Lawsuit (Regarding Security Status) None Subject to ongoing SEC lawsuit Current Classification Commodity Currently viewed by SEC as potentially a security (in ongoing lawsuit) Tradability Fully tradable commodity Trading status impacted by SEC lawsuit, but still widely traded The table highlights a critical point: Ethereum, despite its ICO roots, was not targeted with an SEC lawsuit and subsequently gained recognition as a commodity. This outcome provides a hopeful blueprint for XRP. The SEC’s current debate suggests a potential willingness to re-evaluate XRP’s classification in light of Ethereum’s established commodity status. The fact that the SEC now openly considers ETH a “fully tradable commodity” strengthens the argument for XRP to receive similar treatment. Why Does Crypto Regulation and Commodity Status Matter? The classification of a cryptocurrency as either a security or a commodity is not just a legal technicality; it has profound real-world implications. Crypto regulation is a constantly evolving landscape, and the SEC’s decisions play a crucial role in shaping it. Here’s why the commodity versus security distinction is so important: Regulatory Oversight: Securities are subject to stringent regulations, including registration requirements, disclosure obligations, and stricter enforcement actions by the SEC. Commodities generally face a less onerous regulatory burden, often overseen by agencies like the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Market Accessibility: If XRP is classified as a security, it could face limitations in terms of exchange listings and accessibility for retail investors, particularly in the U.S. Commodity status could pave the way for broader market access and integration into traditional financial systems. Innovation and Growth: Overly strict security regulations can stifle innovation and hinder the growth of the cryptocurrency industry. A commodity classification for XRP could foster a more innovation-friendly environment, encouraging development and adoption. Investor Confidence: Clarity in regulatory status boosts investor confidence. If the SEC deems XRP a commodity, it could inject significant positive sentiment into the XRP market and the crypto space as a whole, reducing uncertainty and encouraging investment. Navigating the XRP Security Status Debate: Challenges and Opportunities While the news of the SEC’s review is encouraging for XRP proponents, it’s crucial to acknowledge that the journey to potential commodity status may not be straightforward. The ongoing SEC lawsuit against Ripple Labs, the company closely associated with XRP, casts a long shadow. The lawsuit alleges that XRP is an unregistered security, a claim Ripple vehemently disputes. Despite these challenges, the current SEC deliberation suggests a possible shift in perspective. Here are some key considerations: Legal Precedent: The outcome of the SEC v. Ripple lawsuit will likely influence the SEC’s final decision on XRP’s broader classification. A favorable ruling for Ripple could significantly strengthen the case for commodity status. Evolving Regulatory Landscape: Regulatory bodies worldwide are grappling with how to classify and regulate cryptocurrencies. The SEC’s decision on XRP could set a precedent for other jurisdictions and influence global crypto regulation. Market Dynamics: Regardless of the regulatory outcome, market forces will continue to play a significant role in XRP’s trajectory. Adoption, utility, and broader market trends will all contribute to its long-term success. Conclusion: A Transformative Moment for XRP and Crypto? The SEC’s reported review of XRP commodity status marks a potentially transformative moment for XRP and the cryptocurrency industry at large. The comparison to Ethereum, a cryptocurrency that successfully transitioned from ICO origins to commodity status, offers a beacon of hope and a clear regulatory pathway. While uncertainties remain, particularly concerning the ongoing SEC lawsuit, the fact that the SEC is actively debating this classification signals a significant and positive development. Should XRP achieve commodity status, it could unlock new opportunities for growth, broader market adoption, and increased investor confidence, solidifying its position in the evolving world of digital assets. The coming weeks and months will be crucial in observing how this deliberation unfolds and the ultimate decision that shapes XRP’s future.

After a shaky start to 2025, there’s a glimmer of hope on the horizon for Bitcoin enthusiasts. Business news giant CNBC has recently reported some exciting predictions coming straight from Wall Street’s top financial institutions. They’re forecasting a significant Bitcoin rebound in the second quarter of the year. Let’s dive into what’s fueling this optimism and what it could mean for your crypto portfolio. Why a Q2 Rebound for Bitcoin? According to CNBC’s report, the initial months of 2025 haven’t been kind to Bitcoin. The primary culprit? A widespread “risk-off” sentiment among investors. This basically means that due to various global economic factors (which we’ll touch upon), investors have been pulling back from assets perceived as riskier, and Bitcoin, despite its growing adoption, still falls into this category for many. Think of it like this: Risk-Off Mode: Investors become cautious, preferring safer investments like government bonds or cash. Impact on Bitcoin: As investors reduce exposure to riskier assets, demand for Bitcoin decreases, leading to price dips. Early 2025 Blues: This risk-off sentiment has been prominent in the early part of 2025, contributing to Bitcoin’s sluggish performance. However, the tide may be turning. Wall Street analysts are suggesting that this risk-averse phase might be temporary, paving the way for a robust Q2 rebound . But what exactly is underpinning this optimistic outlook? Wall Street’s Bitcoin Forecast: What’s Driving the Optimism? Several factors are contributing to Wall Street’s positive Bitcoin forecast for Q2. While CNBC’s report doesn’t delve into specific details of each bank’s analysis, we can infer some common drivers based on general market trends and expert opinions: Easing of Risk-Off Sentiment: Market sentiment is rarely static. Factors that initially triggered risk aversion may subside or be priced in by Q2. This could include reduced inflation fears, stabilization of geopolitical tensions, or positive economic data releases. Institutional Investment Inflow: Despite short-term market fluctuations, long-term institutional adoption of Bitcoin continues to grow. Major financial players are increasingly recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value and a diversifier. A renewed appetite from institutional investors in Q2 could significantly boost Bitcoin’s price. Technological Developments & Adoption: The underlying technology of Bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem continues to evolve. Layer-2 solutions like the Lightning Network are improving transaction speeds and scalability. Increased real-world use cases and adoption could attract more investors. Potential for Regulatory Clarity: While regulation can be a double-edged sword, increased clarity from regulatory bodies in major economies could reduce uncertainty and attract institutional capital. Positive regulatory developments could act as a catalyst for a crypto rebound . Navigating the Potential Bitcoin Rebound: Actionable Insights So, what should you do with this information? While forecasts are not guarantees, and the crypto market remains volatile, understanding these potential trends can help you make informed decisions. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on market news and analysis from reputable sources like CNBC and other financial media outlets. Monitor macroeconomic indicators and regulatory developments that could impact the crypto market. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t solely rely on forecasts. Conduct thorough research on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies you’re interested in. Understand the technology, use cases, and potential risks. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): If you believe in the long-term potential of Bitcoin, consider using a dollar-cost averaging strategy. This involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the price. DCA can help mitigate the risk of investing a lump sum at the wrong time. Manage Risk: Remember that cryptocurrency investments are inherently risky. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversify your portfolio across different asset classes to manage overall risk. Prepare for Volatility: Even with a potential crypto rebound in Q2, expect continued volatility. The crypto market is known for its price swings. Be prepared for both upward and downward movements. Is a Strong Bitcoin Rebound Guaranteed? It’s crucial to remember that forecasts are just predictions, not certainties. While Wall Street banks are suggesting a positive outlook for Bitcoin in Q2, various factors could influence the actual outcome. Unexpected global events, shifts in investor sentiment, or unforeseen regulatory changes could all impact the market. The Wall Street Bitcoin prediction is based on current analysis, but the future remains inherently uncertain. However, the fact that major financial institutions are publicly anticipating a Bitcoin rebound is a significant indicator. It suggests a growing confidence in Bitcoin’s resilience and long-term potential, even amidst short-term market fluctuations. This institutional optimism can itself be a self-fulfilling prophecy, attracting more investors and driving positive price action. Conclusion: Riding the Wave of Potential Crypto Recovery The news of a potential Bitcoin rebound in Q2, as forecasted by Wall Street and reported by CNBC, offers a welcome dose of optimism for the crypto community. While the early months of 2025 may have presented challenges, the prospect of renewed investor confidence, institutional interest, and ongoing technological advancements paints a potentially bright picture for the coming quarter. By staying informed, conducting thorough research, and managing risk wisely, you can position yourself to potentially benefit from any positive shifts in the crypto market. Keep a close watch on market developments and be prepared to adapt to the ever-evolving landscape of digital assets.

Just when some were ready to declare the Bitcoin bull run done and dusted, a fascinating indicator is flashing green. It’s all about stablecoin supply , and what it’s telling us might just reignite your crypto optimism. Are we really still in the thick of a Bitcoin bull cycle? Let’s dive into the data and see what’s brewing in the crypto market! Is the Growing Stablecoin Supply a Green Light for Bitcoin Bull Cycle? According to recent insights from IntoTheBlock, the stablecoin supply is on a continuous upward trajectory. This isn’t just some random blip; historically, peaks in stablecoin supply have coincided with the peaks of market cycles. Think back to April 2022, when the stablecoin supply hit a whopping $187 billion just as the bear market began to bite. Fast forward to today, and we’re looking at a staggering $219 billion – and it’s still climbing! This surge in stablecoins suggests that we might not have reached the crescendo of this market cycle yet. But what does this really mean for the average crypto investor? Decoding the Stablecoin Supply Signal: What’s Really Happening? To truly grasp the significance of this stablecoin supply increase, let’s break down what stablecoins are and why their supply matters in the context of a Bitcoin bull cycle : What are Stablecoins? Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. Examples include USDT (Tether), USDC, and BUSD. They act as a bridge between the traditional financial world and the volatile crypto market. Why Stablecoin Supply Matters: A growing stablecoin supply often indicates increased capital entering the crypto ecosystem. Investors typically convert fiat currency into stablecoins to have funds readily available to buy other cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, when opportunities arise. Think of it as dry powder waiting to be deployed. Historical Context: As IntoTheBlock highlighted, history provides a crucial context. The peak stablecoin supply in April 2022 preceded a significant market downturn. The current expanding supply, exceeding that previous peak, hints that we might be in a different phase of the market cycle than some anticipate. Market Sentiment Indicator: The willingness to hold and increase stablecoin holdings can also reflect investor sentiment. A growing supply could mean investors are optimistic about future buying opportunities and are positioning themselves to capitalize on potential dips or breakouts in the crypto market . Benefits of Monitoring Stablecoin Supply in a Bitcoin Bull Cycle Keeping an eye on stablecoin supply offers several advantages for anyone navigating the dynamic Bitcoin bull cycle and the broader crypto market : Early Bullish Signals: A consistent rise in stablecoin supply can act as an early indicator of potential bullish momentum. It suggests an influx of capital ready to be deployed into cryptocurrencies, potentially driving prices up. Market Cycle Insights: By comparing current stablecoin supply to historical peaks and troughs, investors can gain a better understanding of where we might be in the overall market cycle . Are we early, mid, or late stage? Stablecoins can offer clues. Informed Investment Decisions: This data point, combined with other on-chain metrics and fundamental analysis, can contribute to more informed investment decisions. It helps to gauge overall market liquidity and investor readiness to buy. Risk Management: Conversely, a sudden stagnation or decline in stablecoin supply could signal waning investor interest or potential market corrections, prompting a more cautious approach to risk management. Challenges and Considerations While stablecoin supply is a valuable indicator, it’s crucial to acknowledge the nuances and potential challenges in interpreting this data: Not a Sole Indicator: Stablecoin supply should not be viewed in isolation. It’s most effective when used in conjunction with other metrics like trading volume, on-chain activity, and macroeconomic factors. Relying solely on one indicator can be misleading. External Factors: Global economic conditions, regulatory changes, and unforeseen black swan events can significantly impact the crypto market and stablecoin dynamics, sometimes overriding typical historical patterns. Different Stablecoin Types: The composition of the stablecoin supply matters. Growth might be concentrated in specific stablecoins, and understanding the reasons behind this concentration can provide deeper insights. For example, regulatory actions against certain stablecoins could shift demand to others. Market Manipulation: While less likely with aggregate supply, it’s important to be aware of the potential for market manipulation, though stablecoin supply itself is harder to directly manipulate compared to price. Examples of Stablecoin Supply Impact on Market Cycles Let’s look at historical examples to solidify our understanding of how stablecoin supply has played out in past market cycles : Period Stablecoin Supply Trend Market Cycle Phase Bitcoin Price Action Early 2021 (Pre-Peak Bull Run) Significant Increase Early to Mid Bull Cycle Rapid Bitcoin price appreciation April 2022 (Market Top) Peak Supply ($187 Billion) Market Cycle Peak Bitcoin price began to decline Late 2022 – Early 2023 (Bear Market) Relatively Stagnant/Slight Decline Bear Market Bitcoin price consolidation at lower levels Present (Ongoing Growth) Continued Increase ($219 Billion+) Potentially Mid-Cycle or Bullish Re-accumulation Bitcoin price showing signs of recovery and upward momentum These examples illustrate the correlation between stablecoin supply trends and different phases of the Bitcoin bull cycle and broader crypto market cycle . While not foolproof, the pattern is evident. Actionable Insights: How to Use Stablecoin Data So, how can you, as a crypto investor, leverage this information about stablecoin supply ? Regular Monitoring: Keep an eye on stablecoin supply charts from reputable sources like IntoTheBlock or Glassnode. Track the overall trend and any significant shifts. Combine with Other Indicators: Don’t rely on stablecoin data alone. Use it in conjunction with Bitcoin price charts, trading volume, on-chain analytics, and news sentiment to form a holistic view of the crypto market . Identify Potential Entry Points: A sustained increase in stablecoin supply, coupled with other bullish signals, might suggest favorable entry points for Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. Manage Risk: Conversely, be cautious if stablecoin supply plateaus or declines while other bearish indicators emerge. This could be a signal to reduce exposure or take profits. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of analyses from reputable crypto research firms and analysts who incorporate stablecoin data into their market cycle assessments. Conclusion: A Bold Signal for Crypto Optimists? The expanding stablecoin supply is indeed a compelling signal that the current Bitcoin bull cycle might have more room to run. While no single indicator is definitive, the historical correlation between stablecoin growth and market cycles is undeniable. For crypto investors, this data point serves as a potent reminder to remain vigilant, informed, and perhaps, cautiously optimistic. The crypto market is never predictable, but understanding the subtle cues within on-chain data like stablecoin supply can provide a valuable edge in navigating its exciting, and sometimes turbulent, waters.

The ones that actually make you money while keeping things fun. Nobody wants a bag full of meme coins that go nowhere. The real winners have utility, rewards, and long-term growth, that’s where Dawgz AI comes in. I've been in the game long enough to know which crypto coin to invest in and which ones are just hype. Dawgz AI? It’s different. I staked some ETH, kicked back, and watched the rewards roll in. If you’re serious about investment strategies, this one’s a no-brainer. Ready to find the best crypto to invest in now? Let’s go. The 3 Best Crypto to Invest In Some meme coins are all bark, no bite. They pop up, make noise, and disappear before you even have time to check cryptocurrency prices. Others stick around because they actively are traded between themselves with no real utility. But, a strong crypto token isn’t just a joke, it’s a smart investment that really brings some form of value. If you’re putting your money into meme coins, why settle for something that just exists? Dawgz AI isn’t here to be another name on a list. It’s here to work, with staking, AI-powered trading, and a strategy that makes sense. 💡Pro Tip: If a meme coin has no clear earning potential, it’s just a collectible. Dawgz AI isn’t a novelty, it’s an opportunity. Dawgz AI - The Ultimate Alpha Dog in Crypto Some meme coins are just for fun. Dawgz AI is here to make money while keeping the fun alive. It’s got staking, AI-powered trading, and real utility, a rare combo in the meme coin world. If you’re looking for the best crypto to invest in now, this is the one leading the pack. Why Dawgz AI Stands Out AI-powered trading - High-frequency bots work 24/7 for consistent returns. Staking rewards - ETH buyers earn passive income with a competitive APY. Presale momentum - Raised $2.6M, next goal $2.63M with a price increase ahead. Strong tokenomics – Total supply: 8.888B tokens Presale: 30% Staking rewards: 20% Liquidity: 10% locked. Claimable tokens - Holders can claim their $DAGZ after the presale ends. With Dawgz AI, you’re not just holding a meme coin, you’re making smart moves. If you’re asking what is the best crypto to invest in right now, here’s your answer. Pug AI (PUGAI) - The Underdog Trying to Keep Up Pug AI (PUGAI) is a meme coin that combines the charm of pugs with artificial intelligence themes. While it has garnered some attention, it's essential to examine its specifics: Price Performance: As of recent data, PUGAI's price is approximately $0.00000000004639, showing minimal movement in the past 24 hours. Market Activity: The 24-hour crypto exchange volume stands at $31, indicating low liquidity and trading interest. Supply Details: PUGAI has a total supply of 100 trillion tokens, with the circulating supply currently unavailable. Market Capitalization: Due to the lack of circulating supply data, the market cap is not determined, making it challenging to assess its market position. All-Time High: The token reached an all-time high of $0.0000000230 but has since declined by 99.79% . ​ Community and Social Presence: Pug AI maintains a presence on platforms like Twitter and Telegram, aiming to build a community around its meme concept. ​ While Pug AI offers a fun meme concept, it lacks the advanced features and robust tokenomics found in projects like Dawgz AI, which provides AI-powered trading and staking rewards. Kabosu Inu (KABOSU) - A Good Boy, But Not The Best Kabosu Inu (KABOSU) is a meme coin inspired by the Shiba Inu dog from the famous ""Doge"" meme. While it carries the charm of its namesake, let's dig into its specifics: Token Overview Market Capitalization: As of recent data, KABOSU's market cap is approximately $1.2 million.​ Total Supply: The token boasts a total supply of 100 trillion KABOSU coins.​ Circulating Supply: Currently, about 50 trillion tokens are in circulation, accounting for 50% of the total supply.​ Price Performance: KABOSU's price has seen fluctuations, with a current trading value of $0.000000012 per token.​ Community and Utility Community Engagement: Kabosu Inu has garnered a modest following on social media platforms, with active discussions on Telegram and Twitter.​ Use Cases: Primarily, KABOSU serves as a community-driven token with limited utility beyond trading and holding.​ Fun Fact: The original ""Doge"" meme features a Shiba Inu named Kabosu, making this token a nod to the internet's beloved canine celebrity.​ While Kabosu Inu offers nostalgic value, it lacks the advanced features and earning potentials found in Dawgz AI. Crypto Comparison Table Here’s a comparison table for the three meme coins: Dawgz AI, Pug AI (PUGAI), and Kabosu Inu (KABOSU). Feature Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) Pug AI (PUGAI) Kabosu Inu (KABOSU) Presale Momentum Over $2.6M raised, next target $2.63M None (already launched) None (already launched) Community Engagement Growing, strong social presence Small community Moderate community Liquidity Locked 10% locked No No Passive Income Potential High Low Low This will clearly show why Dawgz AI is the top choice. What is the Strongest Meme Coin? Not all meme coins are built to last. Some are fun for a moment and then vanish. Others have real staying power because they offer more than hype. So, which one has the strongest bite? Dawgz AI Holds the Lead Unlike most meme coins, Dawgz AI isn’t just about internet jokes, it’s a fully loaded digital asset. This isn’t some low-effort cash grab. It’s a strategically designed token with a hard cap of 8.888 billion $DAGZ, ensuring scarcity and long-term value . The presale has already pulled in $2.6 million, with the next milestone at $2.63 million. With 30% of tokens in presale and 20% reserved for staking, it’s structured to reward long-term holders, not just early buyers. Why Dawgz AI is Built Different Most meme coins rely only on hype, but Dawgz AI’s success isn’t based on promises, it’s about performance. The tokenomics are balanced, and unlike inflationary meme coins with unlimited supplies, this one has clear allocation for liquidity, staking, and long-term growth. If you’re asking, “What is the best crypto to invest in right now?” the answer is clear: Dawgz AI isn’t playing around, it’s here to dominate. Final Thoughts Picking the Best Crypto to Invest In isn’t about chasing every new meme coin that pops up. It’s about finding the ones that actually work for you. That’s why I went all in on Dawgz AI, it’s got real structure, solid rewards, and a smart pack of investors backing it. Here’s something I’ve learned: If a coin has no clear use case and just relies on hype, it’s probably not worth your time. Dawgz AI doesn’t just bark, it brings home the bag. If you want a meme coin with bite, this is the alpha you’ve been looking for. Frequently Asked Questions Which crypto is best to invest in now?

Previous attempts to test the Pectra upgrade on the Sepolia and Holesky testnets encountered several configuration issues. The Hoodi testnet will be deployed on March 17. Ethereum To Launch New Testnet The Ethereum Foundation has announced the launch of the Hoodi testnet following two problematic tests of the Pectra upgrade on the existing Sepolia and Holesky testnets. The new testnet will demonstrate the code update a final time before deployment. Pectra introduces several code changes to make Ethereum faster, more efficient, and more user-friendly for developers and users. The most significant improvement is the addition of smart contract functionality to addresses, allowing user wallets to be programmed with new features like paying transaction fees in other currencies besides ETH. Pectra will be tested on the Hoodi testnet on March 26, when it will be upgraded to the new version of Ethereum and evaluated for performance and stability. Tim Beiko, the coordinator of the Ethereum ecosystem’s core developers at the Ethereum Foundation, stated, “A new testnet, Hoodi, is going live Monday to wrap up Pectra testing. If you need to test validator exits, be on the lookout for it! Everything else can be tested on Sepolia & Holesky. Pectra will be scheduled 30+ days after Hoodi forks successfully, pending infra and client testing. Fusaka planning will run in parallel, with a deadline of March 24 to propose EIPs and a tentative date of April 10 for a scope freeze.” If the Hoodi test is successful, developers will launch the upgrade after 30 days, subject to further testing. If everything proceeds as planned, Ethereum users can expect the Pectra upgrade to launch on the mainnet by April or May. Complications On Sepolia and Holesky The Hoodi testnet was created after complications with testing Pectra on the Sepolia and Holesky testnets, with configuration errors preventing proper upgrade testing. Holesky went offline for multiple weeks due to the flawed tests. Test networks like Sepolia, Holesky, and Hoodi are identical to the Ethereum mainnet. However, they are free to use and do not support at real value. Upgrades like Pectra are implemented on Ethereum’s test networks before being deployed on the mainnet, as disruptions on the Ethereum mainnet could be catastrophic. The Pectra setback comes during a difficult time for Ethereum . The network is facing significant pressure due to declining ETH prices, leadership transitions at the Ethereum Foundation, and skepticism about its ability to maintain market dominance, as well as growing competition from newer chains like Solana. Key Highlights Pectra introduces account abstraction (EIP-7702), allowing users to pay transaction fees in currencies besides ETH. The upgrade will also introduce roll-out Staking Enhancements (EIP-7251), increasing the validator staking limit from 32 to 2048 ETH. Other major EIPs include EIP-7691, EIP-7623, EIP-2537, and EIP-7549. EIP-7691 proposes an update to improve scalability and reduce network congestion. EIP-7623 enhances privacy by allowing users to hide specific transaction details, while EIP-2537 optimizes contract execution, reducing gas costs and improving smart contract efficiency. Lastly, EIP-7549 improves interoperability between different Ethereum Layer2 networks. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Positioned for explosive growth in 2025, Lightchain AI offers a unique opportunity for those seeking high returns. As the market shifts, Lightchain AI is becoming a top contender for long-term success. Shiba Inu Burn Rate Increases- Will It Impact SHIB’s Price? ​Shiba Inu's (SHIB) burn rate has experienced significant surges recently, with increases of 3,200% and 5,440% reported over short periods. These burns aim to reduce SHIB's circulating supply, theoretically enhancing its value through increased scarcity. However, despite these substantial burns, SHIB's price has not shown a corresponding significant increase, suggesting that other market factors, such as overall investor sentiment and broader cryptocurrency market trends, play more influential roles in determining its price movements. Therefore, while the increased burn rate contributes to supply reduction, its direct impact on SHIB's price remains uncertain and likely limited without concurrent positive market dynamics.​ Why Investors Choose Lightchain AI for Bigger Gains Long-term investors are turning to Lightchain AI for bigger gains due to its scalability, secure data storage, cryptographic verification, and efficient workflow.

Fewer are calling it that today. A safe-haven asset maintains or increases in value in times of economic stress. It can be a government bond, a currency like the US dollar, a commodity like gold, or even a blue-chip stock. A spreading global tariff war set off by the United States, as well as troubling economic reports, have sent equity markets tumbling, and Bitcoin too — which wasn’t supposed to happen with a “risk off” asset. Bitcoin has suffered compared with gold, too. “While gold prices are up +10%, Bitcoin is down -10% since January 1st,” noted the Kobeissi Letter on March 3. “Crypto is no longer viewed as a safe haven play.” (Bitcoin dropped even further last week.) But some market observers are saying that this wasn’t really unexpected. Bitcoin (white) and gold (yellow) price chart from Dec. 1 to March 13. Source: Bitcoin Counter Flow Was Bitcoin ever a safe haven? “I have never thought of BTC as a ‘safe haven,’” Paul Schatz, founder and president of Heritage Capital, a financial advisory firm, told Cointelegraph. “The magnitude of the moves in BTC are just too great to be put in the haven category although I do believe investors can and should have an allocation to the asset class in general.” “Bitcoin is still a speculative instrument for me, not a safe haven,” Jochen Stanzl, Chief Market Analyst at CMC Markets (Germany), told Cointelegraph. “A safe haven investment like gold has an intrinsic value that will never be zero. Bitcoin can go down 80% in major corrections. I wouldn’t expect that from gold.” Crypto, including Bitcoin, “has never been a ‘safe haven play’ in my opinion,” Buvaneshwaran Venugopal, assistant professor in the department of finance at the University of Central Florida, told Cointelegraph. But things aren’t always as clear as they first appear, especially when it comes to cryptocurrencies. Related: Bitcoin dominance hits new highs, alts fade: Research One could argue that there are different kinds of safe havens: one for geopolitical events like wars, pandemics, and economic recessions, and another for strictly financial events like bank collapses or a weakening dollar, for instance. The perception of Bitcoin may be changing. Its inclusion in exchange-traded funds issued by major asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity in 2024 widened its ownership base, but it may also have changed its “narrative.” It is now more widely seen as a speculative or “risk on” asset like a technology stock. “Bitcoin, and crypto as a whole, have become highly correlated with risky assets and they often move inversely to safe-haven assets, like gold,” Adam Kobeissi, editor-in-chief of the Kobeissi Letter, told Cointelegraph. There’s a lot of uncertainty where BTC is heading, he continued, amid “more institutional involvement and leverage,” and there’s also been a “narrative shift from Bitcoin being viewed as ‘digital gold’ to a more speculative asset.” One might think that its acceptance by traditional finance giants like BlackRock and Fidelity would make Bitcoin’s future more secure, which would boost the safe haven narrative -- but that’s not necessarily the case, according to Venugopal: “Big companies piling into BTC does not mean it has become safer. In fact, it means BTC is becoming more like any other asset that institutional investors tend to invest in.” It will be more subject to the usual trading and draw-down strategies that institutional investors use, Venugopal continued. “If anything, BTC is now more correlated to risky assets in the market.” Bitcoin’s dual nature Few deny that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are still subject to big price swings, further propelled recently by growing retail adoption of crypto, particularly from the memecoin craze, “one of the largest crypto-onboarding events in history,” Kobeissi noted. But perhaps that is the wrong thing to focus on. “Safe havens are always longer-term assets, which means that short-term volatility is not a factor in that characteristic,” Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto is Macro Now newsletter, told Cointelegraph. The big question is whether BTC can hold its value longer-term against fiat currencies, and it’s been able to do that. “The numbers bear out its validity – on just about any four-year timeframe, BTC has outperformed gold and US equities,” said Acheson, adding: “BTC has always had two key narratives: it is a short-term risk asset, sensitive to liquidity expectations and overall sentiment. It is also a longer-term store of value. It can be both, as we are seeing.” Another possibility is that Bitcoin could be a safe haven against some happenings but not others. “I see Bitcoin as a hedge against issues in TradFi,” like the downturn that followed the collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank two years ago, and “US Treasury risks,” Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered told Cointelegraph. But for some geopolitical events, Bitcoin might still trade as a risk asset, he said. Related: Is altseason dead? Bitcoin ETFs rewrite crypto investment playbook Gold can serve as a hedge against geopolitical issues, like trade wars, while both Bitcoin and gold are hedges against inflation. “So both are useful hedges in a portfolio,” Kendrick added. Others, including Ark Investment’s Cathie Wood, agree that Bitcoin acted as a safe haven during the SVB and Signature bank runs in March 2023. When SVB collapsed on March 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price was around $20,200, according to CoinGecko. It stood close to $27,400 a week later, roughly 35% higher. BTC price fell on March 10 before bouncing back a week later. Source: CoinGecko Schatz doesn’t see Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. The events of 2022, when FTX and other crypto firms collapsed and the crypto winter began, “damages that thesis dramatically.” Maybe it’s a hedge against the US dollar and Treasury bonds? “That’s possible, but those scenarios are pretty dark to think about,” Schatz added. No time for over-reaction Kobeissi agreed that short-term fluctuations in asset classes “often have minimal relevance over a long-term time period.” Many of Bitcoin’s fundamentals remain positive despite the current drawdown: a pro-crypto US government, the announcement of a US Bitcoin Reserve, and a surge in crypto adoption. The big question for market players is: “What is the next major catalyst for the run to continue?” Kobeissi told Cointelegraph. “This is why markets are pulling back and consolidating: it’s a search for the next major catalyst.” “Ever since macro investors started seeing BTC as a high-volatility, liquidity-sensitive risk asset, it has behaved like one,” added Acheson. Moreover, “it is almost always short-term traders that set the last price, and if they’re rotating out of risk assets, we will see BTC weakness.” Markets are struggling in general. There’s “the specter of renewed inflation and an economic slowdown weighing heavy on expectations” that are also affecting Bitcoin’s price. Acheson further noted: “Given this outlook, and BTC’s dual nature of risk asset and long-term safe haven, I’m surprised it’s not falling further.” Venugopal, for his part, says Bitcoin hasn’t been a short-term hedge or safe haven since 2017. As for the long-term argument that Bitcoin is digital gold because of its 21 million BTC supply cap, that only works “if a large fraction of investors collectively expect Bitcoin to increase in value over time,” and “this may or may not be true.” Magazine: Crypto fans are obsessed with longevity and biohacking: Here’s why",,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-15 13:00:00

During a recent interview, Thielen noted that he had anticipated this scenario even before Bitcoin touched its latest peak of $109,000 on Trump’s inauguration day. His March 15 market report outlines concerns about Bitcoin’s current “High and Tight Flag” pattern, a technical formation that is generally bullish but, in this case, shows signs of weakness due to its fragmented structure. “Instead of forming one clean flag, Bitcoin’s chart has developed two weaker patterns, which suggests market indecision rather than a strong consolidation,” he explained. Institutional Demand Weakens as ETF Flows Decline Thielen also pointed to the spot Bitcoin ETF market as a key indicator of investor sentiment. Unlike previous price dips that sparked fresh buying, the current correction has seen little incentive for institutional players to step in. “This aligns with our assessment that the majority of ETF inflows came from arbitrage-driven hedge funds. With low funding rates persisting, there’s no strong motivation to deploy additional capital despite the price pullback,” he stated. Since Bitcoin dipped below $90,000 in early March, US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs have witnessed cumulative outflows of $1.66 billion, according to Farside data. As of now, Bitcoin is trading at $84,290, marking a 23% decline from its January peak. Will Bitcoin Hold Key Support Levels? While some traders remain cautious about Bitcoin’s near-term recovery, others are closely watching key support levels. Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, believes Bitcoin is likely to retest $78,000 and, if it fails to hold, could slide further to $75,000. On the other hand, Iliya Kalchev, an analyst at Nexo, maintains that the low $70,000 range could provide a foundation for a stronger recovery. For now, Thielen remains uncertain about Bitcoin’s next big move, advising traders to consider closing short positions while acknowledging that there is still no concrete evidence of an imminent rally. With macroeconomic concerns such as Trump’s proposed tariffs adding to the uncertainty, Bitcoin’s next direction remains a closely watched mystery.

Bitcoin Gets Outshined By Gold 2025 has started on a shaky note for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. BTC is down over 10% year-to-date (YTD), falling from approximately $94,000 on January 1 to around $84,000 at the time of writing. On the flip side, gold has surged nearly 13% in the same period. Related Reading: Bitcoin Needs Weekly Close Above This Level To Confirm Market Bottom, Analyst Says Market analyst Northstar shared the following chart on X yesterday, illustrating the BTC-to-gold ratio over the past 12 years. According to the chart, BTC is beginning to break below a critical support line that has held strong for more than a decade. If Bitcoin sustains price action below this support line for several weeks or months, it could signal the end of the current crypto bull run. BTC’s underperformance against gold is also evident in the contrasting capital flows into BTC and gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs). According to data from the World Gold Council, US-based spot gold ETFs have attracted inflows exceeding $6 billion YTD. Globally, spot gold ETFs have seen more than $23 billion in inflows. Meanwhile, data from SoSoValue indicates that US-based spot BTC ETFs have experienced nearly $1.5 billion in net outflows YTD. This sharp contrast in capital movement reflects a shift in investor strategy from risk-on to risk-off assets. Several factors may explain investors’ growing aversion to risk-on assets, including US President Donald Trump’s new trade tariffs, the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed) hawkish monetary policy, and the recent stock market rout. Is The Crypto Bull Run Over? BTC’s underperformance relative to gold casts doubt on the longevity of the current crypto bull market. The total crypto market cap has shed over $600 billion since the start of the year, now standing at approximately $2.8 trillion. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Bottom Around $70,000? Arthur Hayes Says Correction ‘Very Normal’ In A Bull Market Renowned gold advocate Peter Schiff argues that BTC has already been in a bear market for the past three years. In an X post, Schiff stated: One Bitcoin now buys 27.7 ounces of gold. At its peak in 2021, one Bitcoin bought 36.3 ounces of gold. That means that in terms of gold, which is real money, the price of Bitcoin has fallen by 24%. So Bitcoin has been in a stealth bear market for the past three and a half years. That said, positive macroeconomic developments could still turn the tide in BTC’s favor. For example, US inflation appears to be cooling, which may pressure the Fed to pivot toward quantitative easing and boost market liquidity – a potential boon for risk-on assets. Likewise, a breakdown in the US dollar index could reignite optimism for assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies. At press time, BTC trades at $84,902, up 3.8% in the past 24 hours.

Analysts closely monitor Ethereum’s (ETH) price prediction, which suggests a potential surge toward $6,000 if key resistance levels are breached. Meanwhile, XRP’s rally faces challenges, with its price dipping below $2.50, leaving traders uncertain about its next move. However, BlockDAG (BDAG) is stealing the spotlight, surpassing $202.8 million in presale funding and rolling out a groundbreaking hackathon series in partnership with HackerEarth. With expectations of attracting 10,000 developers and over 200 new projects, the excitement surrounding BlockDAG continues to grow. Ethereum Price Prediction: Can ETH Hit $6,000? Market analysts anticipate a potential ETH breakout toward $6,000, with resistance at $6,004 and strong support near $2,150. Accumulation zones around $1,890 indicate increased buying activity from long-term holders, which reinforces the bullish sentiment. If Ethereum can push past key resistance levels, a wave of new buying pressure could drive it toward $6K and beyond. However, short-term fluctuations remain, as traders closely track price action for confirmation of a breakout. XRP Faces Resistance After Rallying Past $3.00 XRP’s recent rally saw strong momentum, but its failure to sustain levels above $3.00 has raised concerns. The latest drop below $2.50 signals possible weakness in the uptrend, with traders looking at $2.20 as a crucial support level. For XRP to regain strength, it needs to hold above $2.50, which could lead to another leg up. However, bearish indicators suggest that further declines could occur if buying volume doesn’t increase. BlockDAG’s Hackathon Series Brings 10,000 Developers & $202.8M Presale Growth! BlockDAG is taking a bold step forward by launching a massive hackathon series, designed to drive real-world blockchain innovation. Developers will compete to create cutting-edge dApps, earning BDAG rewards, grants, and exclusive partnerships along the way. The project’s native coin BDAG is currently priced at $0.0248, and over 18.8 billion BDAG coins have been sold, with early supporters seeing a 2,380% surge. BlockDAG’s presale has now crossed $202.8 million, signaling strong market demand and growing excitement. Participants in the hackathon will gain early access to major updates, industry connections, and private networking events. The competition’s rewards extend beyond cash prizes, providing developers with direct access to BlockDAG’s core ecosystem and long-term growth opportunities. At the heart of this initiative is BlockDAG’s partnership with HackerEarth, a move designed to onboard 10,000–15,000 developers and launch 200+ projects. This collaboration aligns with BlockDAG’s mission to expand Web3 applications across DeFi, infrastructure, and governance sectors, fueling further adoption and network growth. With $6.5M in miner sales and 16,000 mining units sold, BlockDAG is strengthening its position as a leader in scalable, high-performance blockchain solutions. Analysts predict that BDAG’s price could soar past $1 in 2025, making it one of the most promising projects in the space. Key Points of Note As traders track the latest Ethereum price prediction, eyes are on ETH’s potential move toward $6,000, while XRP’s rally struggles to maintain momentum. While price speculation dominates headlines, BlockDAG’s presale and hackathon-driven developer expansion are reshaping market dynamics. With over $202.8M raised, 18.8 BDAG coins sold, and a rapidly growing developer ecosystem, BlockDAG is emerging as one of the most exciting blockchain projects heading into 2025. The question remains—is BDAG the best crypto to buy before its official launch?

The Wall Street giant, which has avoided Bitcoin and blockchain in its reports since at least 2017, admitted for the first time that crypto is now a force in finance on Friday. “The growth of electronic trading and the introduction of new products and technologies, including trading and distributed ledger technologies, such as cryptocurrencies, and AI technologies, has increased competition,” Goldman said in its 2024 letter. Goldman Sachs reacts to crypto’s growing dominance For years, Goldman Sachs treated crypto like it didn’t exist. From 2017 to 2023, there was no mention of Bitcoin, blockchain, or digital assets anywhere from the bank. But Bitcoin’s massive growth, which started January 2024 with the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, along with Trump’s pro-crypto policies, has changed the way Wall Street looks at the industry. Goldman Sachs’ exact words on Friday were: “We also compete on the basis of the types of financial products and client experiences that we and our competitors offer. In some circumstances, our competitors may offer financial products that we do not offer and that our clients may prefer, including cryptocurrencies and other digital assets that we cannot or may choose not to provide.” That statement alone proves Goldman Sachs knows it is losing business to crypto-friendly banks and investment firms. While it has dabbled in crypto trading, it has stayed cautious. In 2021, the bank launched a crypto trading desk, and in 2022, it introduced its Digital Asset Platform. It was also one of the few banks to experiment with Canton Network, a blockchain-based system designed to improve financial communication and record-keeping. Despite this, the bank still considers crypto risky. “Although the prevalence and scope of applications of distributed ledger technology, cryptocurrency, and similar technologies is growing, the technology is nascent and may be vulnerable to cyber attacks or have other inherent weaknesses,” Goldman Sachs said in its letter . Goldman Sachs also warned that it faces risks when facilitating client activities in crypto markets, investing in blockchain companies, or accepting crypto as collateral. Goldman Sachs posts massive revenue gains in 2024 Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs posted massive numbers in 2024, as its net revenue jumped by 16% year-over-year, reaching $53.5 billion. Earnings per share soared by 77% to $40.54. Return on equity (ROE) climbed by 500 basis points to 12.7%. The bank also improved its efficiency ratio by 11.5 percentage points, bringing it down to 63.1%, and total shareholder return surged by 52%, showing a strong year across the board. Goldman Sachs operates two major business units: Global Banking & Markets (GBM) and Asset & Wealth Management (AWM). GBM, which covers investment banking, fixed income, currencies, and equities, remains the bank’s financial backbone, and it helped clients navigate major M&A deals, secure financing for growth, and hedge against market volatility. The bank maintained its position as the top M&A advisor while expanding its fixed income and equities financing business, which grew at a 15% compounded annual rate since 2019. On the AWM side, Goldman Sachs reported record-breaking numbers as client assets surged to $1.6 trillion, which is the 28th straight quarter of fee-based net inflows. The bank also expanded into alternative investments, raising over $70 billion in private credit and private equity funds. To strengthen its private financing and alternative investment operations, Goldman Sachs launched the Capital Solutions Group in 2025, a unit that consolidates the bank’s financing, structuring, and risk management services, allowing it to take advantage of the growing private credit market. Goldman Sachs is also betting big on AI-driven automation to cut costs and boost efficiency. In 2024, it introduced a three-year strategy to optimize its operations. Employees now have access to AI-powered coding tools and GS AI, a natural-language financial assistant designed to streamline decision-making. This push for automation is part of the bank’s plan to reduce operational expenses while freeing up capital for future investments. Goldman Sachs expects AI-driven workflows to become fully integrated into daily operations by 2025. “We have put ourselves on the path to generating mid-teens returns through the cycle,” said Goldman Sachs CEO David M. Solomon in the shareholder letter. “Financial market participants continue to recognize the competitiveness of the U.S. economy and the opportunities for sustained growth. But as we have seen in recent weeks, the environment can shift quickly. Global growth has been hampered by inflation, an escalation in potential tariffs, and the toll of geopolitical tensions and prolonged conflicts across multiple regions.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

As a result, Bitcoin (BTC) jumped from $80,000 to $85,113 before marginally declining and moving to its current level. The flagship cryptocurrency is up over 1% in the past 24 hours, trading around $83,827. The crypto and traditional markets roared back to life on Friday, with the crypto market cap registering a near 2% increase and moving to $2.74 trillion, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes rose 1.7% and 2.3%. Markets Register Sharp Bounce Risk asset bears took a breather on Friday as the crypto market posted considerable gains after a period of muted price actions. BTC briefly climbed above $85,000 before retreating to its current level. The price action marked the return of risk appetite to the markets, with Paul Howard, Senior Director of Crypto Trading Firm Wincent, stating, “To see the market bouncing off these recent lows is most likely a combination of the macro news around risk assets (inflation/tariffs) and a sign that a more stable base for cryptocurrencies is coming into place given the drawdowns from the top just a month ago.” Howard pointed out that $2.6 billion in leveraged crypto derivatives positions were liquidated over the past seven days, leaving the markets on a healthier footing by flushing out excessive leverage. BTC’s bounce briefly took it past the 200-day SMA. However, it is struggling to consolidate above it as sellers look to drive the price back towards $80,000. The 200-day SMA is widely used to gauge long-term trends for an asset and often serves as a support for prices to bounce in a bull market. Data from Cryptoquant showed rising exchange reserves, indicating potential selling pressure. Coinglass data showed that as BTC climbed, over $43 million in short positions were wiped out. BlackRock Resumes BTC Buying Friday saw bullish sentiment return to the crypto market as BTC bounced past $85,000. The markets jumped seemingly out of nothing, indicating a recovery could be on the cards. BlackRock has also resumed buying BTC with the introduction of an IBIT Bitcoin ETF, further fueling positive sentiment. According to Arkham Intelligence, BlackRock received $25 million worth of BTC from Coinbase Prime. After weeks of outflows from IBIT and other Bitcoin ETFs, the fresh injection of BTC is a relief for the market. “BLACKROCK IS BUYING BITCOIN. BLACKROCK JUST RECEIVED $25M OF $BTC FROM COINBASE PRIME. THEY NOW HOLD $47.47B OF BITCOIN.” Most of the market’s recent decline was due to the so-called tariff war. However, tariff news does not seem to be impacting the markets much. This can be gauged from the fact that BTC has repeatedly tested the $80,000 level without breaking lower. Bitcoin Could Consolidate For A While: 10x Research 10x Research has not ruled out Bitcoin repeating its 2024 price action and spending most of the year consolidating after reaching all-time highs early on. According to Markus Thielen, a repeat of a movement similar to 2024 is “very possible.” BRC reached an all-time high of $73,679 in March 2024 before hitting a consolidation phase and trading in a range of $20,000 until Donald Trump’s election victory in November. According to Thielen, Bitcoin’s current chart resembles a “High and Tight Flag,” which despite being a bullish continuation pattern shows signs of weakness. “Two flags instead of a single, precise formation weakens this setup. As a result, the pattern currently suggests market indecision rather than a straightforward bullish consolidation.” He also pointed out that the Bitcoin ETF market lacks the “Buy The Dip” mentality, stating there was little incentive for investors to take advantage of Bitcoin’s recent price dip. “This aligns with our view that most ETF flows came from arbitrage-driven hedge funds. Given the persistently low funding rates, there’s little incentive or willingness to deploy additional capital despite the recent price correction.” Thielen is also unsure Bitcoin’s uptrend would resume in the short term and urged traders to close their short positions. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) moved past the 200-day SMA on Friday, indicating that bullish sentiment is returning. Additionally, the failure of the bears to capitalize on BTC’s fall below the 200-day SMA and $80,000 suggests that selling is drying up at lower levels. However, analysts believe BTC is not out of the woods yet, with one stating the flagship cryptocurrency needs a close above $89,000 to confirm a bottom. According to data from CoinGlass, a move past $89,000 could liquidate $1.6 billion in short positions. However, the analyst believes BTC could dip to the $69,000 and $74,000 range if such a scenario does not pan out. However, buyers have a difficult time ahead, with investors remaining jittery. BTC entered the weekend on a bearish note, dropping 3.53% on Friday and settling at $86,781, but not before falling to a low of $84,222. Sellers retained control on Saturday as BTC registered a marginal decline and settled at $86,267. Bearish sentiment intensified on Sunday as BTC plunged below the 200-day SMA and $80,000, falling to a low of $79,987 before reclaiming $80,000 and settling at $80,736. Buyers attempted a recovery on Monday as BTC surged to an intraday high of $84,075. However, it could not stay at this level and dropped to $78,620, a fall of nearly 3%. Source: TradingView BTC plunged to an intraday low of $76,642 on Tuesday as selling pressure intensified. It recovered from this level to register an increase of 5.50% to reclaim $80,000 and settle at $82,943. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as BTC rose almost 1% to $83,709. However, it was back in the red on Thursday, dropping over 3% to $81,136. Bullish sentiment returned on Friday as BTC rose nearly 4% to move past the 200-day SMA and reach an intraday high of $85,351 before settling at $84,002. The current session sees BTC marginally up as buyers look to move past and consolidate above $85,000. While sentiment has changed over the past few days, BTC must close above $89,000 to confirm a bottom and the return of bullish sentiment. The MACD has flipped to bullish, indicating BTC could see an uptrend. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Here’s What You Need to Know,https://coingape.com/trending/is-the-crypto-bitcoin-bull-run-over-heres-what-you-need-to-know/,"Since the beginning of the year, the crypto market has been facing massive downtrends. This left investors questioning the status of the crypto or Bitcoin bull run. Some anticipated it is over amid recent corrections, while others barely remained optimistic. Even after the market began to recover in the last few days, the concerns remain the same. Let’s discuss the recent trends and where BTC stands on the bull cycle. Is the Crypto & Bitcoin Bull Run Over? Crypto bull run is the term that describes massive gains in the price of digital assets over a long period. At the beginning of the year, the BTC’s price hit a high of $109.1k but currently stands at just $84.1k, leaving many devastated over its continuous consolidation. However, the key takeaways from the latest data reveal that the crypto/ Bitcoin bull run is far from over, and many new major breakouts are aligned in the future trajectory. According to the Colin Talks Crypto , BTC is in the midst of a short-term rally, the peak of which will likely form in mid to late March. This reveals that the rally is still in development and the current consolidation is temporary. More importantly, the Global M2 Money supply correlation is the best method to analyse the trajectory of this rally as Bitcoin price moves with the M2 data, which is a measure of liquidity. Based on the stats, there are two possible timelines, both bullish. Scenario 1 (70-day offset) predicts a strong move up around March 2,5, and Scenario 2 (107-day offset) suggests a significant blow-off around April 30 to early May. What Does This Mean for the Bitcoin Bull Run? Colin has concluded there are 2-3 more days until the top of this mini rally happens. More importantly, the 107-day offense fits the current situation, so the rally would form around April 30. It looks to me like BTC has at least three more days until the end of that mini rally. He added that M2 Global supply with a 107-day offset seems to fit best currently. Blast off date estimated around April 30. Overall, this means that the continuity of the historical pattern may bring short-term volatility, especially once this mini-rally peaks. However, the real acceleration of the crypto & Bitcoin bull run may not occur until April or early May, the same time when global liquidity is expected to rise. How’s the Crypto Market Performing Today? After a rough two-month stretch that saw the crypto market lose over $1 trillion, Bitcoin’s price recovery has set a more optimistic tone. With a nearly 9% surge from its month low, BTC currently trades at $84.1k. The rest of the market followed the same, reaching a global market cap of $2.76 trillion. This bounce happened as the broader financial market, including and stock, rebounded. More importantly, the regulatory clarity from the SEC, as they proposed to classify XRP as a payment asset rather than security, influenced investor sentiments. Interestingly, the famous crypto analyst Josh Mandel predicted that the BTC price would hit $440k , increasing investor confidence in the asset and the market. Conclusion: Bull Run Far From Over Although Bitcoin’s short-term uncertainty remains unchanged, the broader outlook is optimistically bullish. More importantly, analysts believe that BTC is in the mini rally, and the peak is 2-3 days away. However, the biggest breakout or Bitcoin bull run peak is due on April 30 to early May, making the current crypto market ideal for holding. Amid this bullish Bitcoin price prediction , one claims it could hit $440k soon. Investors must check liquidity trends, market sentiment, and macroeconomic development for better results.

As Solana (SOL) struggles with market volatility and network-related issues, Coldware (COLD) is emerging as a promising alternative, completing a significant 68% growth within just a few weeks, setting it up to be a major contender in the crypto world. Coldware's Rapid Growth Enter Coldware (COLD) , a blockchain project that has recently gained significant attention due to its innovative approach to scalability and security. Over the past few weeks, Coldware (COLD) has seen impressive growth, with the token completing a 68% increase in value. This surge has attracted the attention of both retail and institutional investors, who are looking for new opportunities in the blockchain space. Coldware's approach to solving the scalability issues that many blockchains face is one of the key reasons behind its rapid rise. By using advanced Layer 2 solutions, Coldware (COLD) offers faster and more efficient transaction processing, making it a compelling option for developers and users alike. Unlike Solana (SOL), which has faced performance setbacks, Coldware (COLD) is designed to ensure consistent performance even during times of high demand. Solana's Recent Struggles Solana (SOL) had earned its reputation as one of the fastest and most scalable blockchain solutions, known for its ability to handle thousands of transactions per second (TPS). However, despite its initial success, Solana (SOL) has faced a series of challenges, including network outages and high gas fees. These issues have contributed to a decline in confidence among investors, leaving many to question the blockchain's future. Solana's price has fluctuated significantly in recent months, and the network has struggled to maintain consistent performance. While some investors remain hopeful about Solana's ability to bounce back, others are seeking alternatives that promise greater stability and scalability. The Role of Coldware's Layer 2 Technology Coldware (COLD) is building its ecosystem with a focus on Layer 2 solutions, which aim to improve scalability without sacrificing decentralization. These solutions allow Coldware to process transactions off-chain, reducing congestion and lowering fees. As a result, Coldware (COLD) can handle a high volume of transactions while maintaining a high level of security and efficiency. The use of Layer 2 technology positions Coldware (COLD) as an attractive alternative to Solana (SOL), which has struggled with scalability issues. Investors are increasingly looking for blockchain projects that offer real-world applications and the ability to scale without compromising on performance. Coldware's rapid growth and technological advancements make it a strong contender in this space. Solana vs Coldware: The Shift in Market Sentiment As Solana (SOL) faces challenges, Coldware (COLD) is capitalizing on the shifting market sentiment. Investors are increasingly turning to projects that offer both scalability and security, and Coldware's 68% growth in just a few weeks demonstrates its potential for long-term success. With Solana's struggles and Coldware's promising performance, the market is beginning to take notice of the new player in town. Conclusion: Coldware’s Future Looks Bright While Solana (SOL) has been an influential blockchain project, its recent struggles have left the door open for other projects like Coldware (COLD) to step in and capture investor interest. With its Layer 2 technology and impressive growth rate, Coldware (COLD) is quickly becoming a dominant player in the crypto space. As Solana continues to face challenges, Coldware's ability to scale and perform consistently may position it as a better investment choice in the coming months.

Thielen noted that Bitcoin’s current technical chart is exhibiting a “bullish flag” formation, typically seen as a bullish continuation signal. However, he noted that the structure is showing signs of weakness, suggesting that the market remains in an uncertain state rather than a simple bullish consolidation. Thielen also noted that the U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) market has not shown a strong “buy on dips” sentiment. Observing the lack of new capital inflows, Thielen attributed this to the fact that most of the ETF funds originate from arbitrage-focused hedge funds. The persistently low funding rate has further discouraged investors from injecting new capital into the market during the recent price correction.

However, despite recent price surges, XRP has failed to surpass its ATH. XRP is selling at about $2.54 as of February 23, 2025, down somewhat from its recent high. Many investors have sought substitutes with better growth potential because of their continuous inability to exceed past highs. Many newly developed cryptocurrencies are becoming popular in this scene, possibly rivaling XRP because they offer more utility and creativity. Rexas Finance (RXS) and others like Tron (TRX), Hedera (HBAR), and Sui (SUI) are attracting increasing investor interest; some experts project notable price swings not too far off. Rexas Finance (RXS) Rexas Finance (RXS), a next-generation blockchain platform for tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs), DeFi, and AI-powered security, is among the most discussed developing initiatives. Unlike XRP, which mostly targets cross-border payments, Rexas Finance lets real estate, equities, and commodities be tokenized and exchanged on the blockchain, improving access to and efficiency of financial markets. RXS has shown extraordinary expansion since its September 2024 presale launch, rising 567% from $0.03 to $0.20 in Stage 12. With 453,393,744 tokens sold and $46,679,206 raised, the presale is over 90% sold, indicating great investor interest. An early listing on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko helps RXS stand out and builds investor confidence. Rexas Finance also turned down venture capital (VC) money, lowering the possibility of early investors dumping tokens on launch—a challenge common to many new enterprises. Beyond its asset-tokenizing powers, Rexas Finance is making waves in DeFi. Users can guarantee a fair and community-driven economy by staking RXS for passive income, engaging in multi-chain yield farming, and practicing distributed governance. Rexas Finance is sponsoring a $1 million RXS token giveaway, through which 20 winners will receive $50,000 in RXS each. This will increase adoption. Before its formal announcement on June 19, 2025, this project attracted enormous participation and raised demand for the token. With at least three tier-1 exchanges listing $0.25, RXS's exchange launch is the most expected event. Such listings have often set off sharp price hikes. Rising to $50, RXS offers a 250x increase from its existing price, so according to analysts, it is among the most profitable crypto investments of 2025. Tron (TRX) Tron (TRX) has endured substantial volatility, but recent market movements signal a bullish breakout. After testing important support at $0.22, TRX has recovered and aims for $0.269 as the next resistance level. A technical study indicates that TRX might have a five-wave impulse pattern and that its near-term price goals should be $0.30 and $0.317. Rising buying pressure, shown by the Relative Strength Index (RSI), suggests additional space for expansion. Tron might become a formidable substitute for XRP in blockchain payments if it keeps increasing momentum. Hedera (HBAR) With a market capitalization of $8.81 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $157.42 million, Hedera (HBAR) has exhibited great market resiliency. Unlike conventional blockchains, Hedera uses the speed, security, and efficiency-proven Hashgraph consensus process. HBAR trades at nearly $0.21; analysts project a breakout past important resistance levels. Among the altcoins, HBAR has performed well over the past year, at 85.78%. Given its solid foundations and increasing acceptance, HBAR is positioned as a major XRP challenger, particularly in corporate blockchain solutions. Sui (SUI) Rising as one of the most exciting blockchain systems, Sui (SUI) has become rather popular in cryptocurrency. It trades at $3.32 and has increased 1.94% during the past 24 hours, indicating great investor interest. Sui is shown to be a major rival in the blockchain scene, with a market value of approximately $10.27 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $589.46 million. Starting at just $0.3643 in October 2023 and rising to $5.35 on January 6, 2025, a 229.83% growth shows possible large gains from its price history. Analysts estimate that SUI may reach $11.45 by December 2025, appealing to individuals seeking high-growth prospects. Conclusion Although Ripple (XRP) is still a major participant in the crypto market, its inability to surpass its ATH has caused many investors to look for substitutes with more expansion possibilities. Among the interesting contenders upsetting the market are Rexas Finance (RXS), Tron (TRX), Hedera (HBAR), and Sui (SUI). Each of these initiatives presents different use cases and great scalability, establishing them as major rivals in the fight to challenge Ripple's hegemony in the market. Investors may find great possibilities in these developing projects while XRP faces difficulties.

Table of Contents Stablecoins get a rulebook Decoding the bill Warning from Warren What’s next for stablecoin giants Stablecoins get a rulebook For the first time in U.S. history, a stablecoin regulatory framework is on the verge of becoming law. On March 13, the Senate Banking Committee advanced the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act. The bill aims to set clear rules for stablecoin issuers at both the federal and state levels. The bill was introduced on Feb. 4 by Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN), who framed it as essential for keeping the U.S. competitive in the global financial arena. As other nations modernize their payment systems, Hagerty made it clear that the U.S. “cannot be left behind.” Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) also backed the bill. A committee approved it with an 18-6 bipartisan vote. It now moves to the full Senate for a floor vote. If approved, it will head to President Donald Trump ’s desk for signing—potentially becoming the first stablecoin-specific regulatory framework in the U.S. But what exactly does this bill entail, and what does it mean for the future of stablecoins in the U.S.? Let’s dive in. Decoding the bill The GENIUS Act introduces a structured approach to regulating U.S. stablecoins. It sets clear rules on: Who can issue them How they must be backed, and What safeguards are in place to protect consumers. Instead of a one-size-fits-all approach, the bill differentiates between smaller and larger stablecoin issuers based on market capitalization. Issuers with less than $10 billion in market cap fall under state-level oversight, granting them more operational flexibility while still adhering to financial laws. Once an issuer surpasses the $10 billion threshold, it transitions to direct supervision by the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the same regulators that oversee major banks. The tiered regulatory model ensures that the largest players, which have the potential to influence the broader financial system, face stricter scrutiny while allowing smaller issuers room to grow under state jurisdiction. Another critical aspect of the bill is its emphasis on transparency and reserve backing. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a fixed value, often pegged to the U.S. dollar, but for that to work, issuers need to prove they actually hold the reserves they claim. The GENIUS Act enforces monthly liquidity reports, compelling issuers to disclose financial details regularly. Additionally, all stablecoins must be backed one-to-one by U.S. dollars or highly liquid assets, ensuring that every token in circulation corresponds to a real, available asset. The provision is intended to eliminate the uncertainty that arose in past controversies where stablecoin issuers were suspected of lacking sufficient reserves, leading to market instability. Redemption rights and consumer protection have also received heightened attention under the bill. Stablecoin holders must have the ability to redeem their tokens for cash on demand, and issuers are legally bound to honor these requests without delay. To reinforce accountability, the Federal Reserve and the OCC hold the authority to suspend licenses or impose penalties on issuers failing to meet these obligations. These enforcement measures act as a safeguard against fund mismanagement and ensure that issuers remain responsive to consumer needs, particularly during market fluctuations. The legislation also brings anti-money laundering and know-your-customer compliance into sharper focus. Issuers will be required to follow the same financial crime prevention measures as traditional banks, ensuring that stablecoins are not easily used for illicit activities. Warning from Warren While the GENIUS Act provides a path forward, critics argue that it lacks essential safeguards. Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee attempted to introduce several amendments to tighten regulatory controls, but each was blocked along party lines. Senator Elizabeth Warren has been one of the bill’s most vocal opponents, warning that, in its current form, it could create significant risks for both the economy and national security. One of Warren’s primary concerns is the lack of consumer protections. She pointed out that stablecoin users may not receive the same fraud protection that applies to traditional financial products. Another major issue is the potential for stablecoins to be misused for illicit finance. Warren argues that the bill does not go far enough in preventing individuals convicted of financial crimes from owning or operating stablecoin companies. The bill, in its current form, could make it easier for foreign adversaries — Iran, North Korea, and Russia — to evade sanctions by using stablecoins instead of traditional financial channels, she says. Citing an industry report that labeled stablecoins as the “new kingpin of illicit crypto activity,” Warren warned that without stronger enforcement mechanisms, the bill could enable money laundering, terror financing, and even the sale of illicit goods online. Consumer advocacy groups like Public Citizen have also criticized the bill, calling it an incomplete and potentially dangerous piece of legislation. In a letter to the committee, Bartlett Naylor, a financial policy advocate at Public Citizen, cautioned that if the bill becomes law, it could increase price manipulations, stablecoin failures, and the use of cryptocurrencies for illicit finance. However, not everyone sees the bill as a threat. Some industry leaders believe that the GENIUS Act is a step in the right direction. Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, issuer of USDC ( USDC ) called it a “huge step towards providing regulatory clarity for stablecoins” and a way to modernize the U.S. dollar for a digital age. A massive move in Washington today. The GENUIS Act passed out of Senate Banking with a strong and bi-partisan 18-6 vote. This is a huge step towards providing regulatory clarity for stablecoins, and a huge step towards upgrading and making the dollar more competitive. — Jeremy Allaire – jda.eth / jdallaire.sol (@jerallaire) March 13, 2025 What’s next for stablecoin giants If the GENIUS Act passes through the House and reaches President Trump’s desk, stablecoin issuers will face a completely new regulatory environment in the U.S. One of the bill’s key provisions requires that foreign-issued stablecoins meet the same standards as U.S.-based counterparts, including compliance with reserve mandates, anti-money laundering regulations, and sanctions checks, which effectively levels the playing field for all issuers. For U.S.-based stablecoins like USDC and Ripple USD ( RLUSD ) —issued by Ripple ( XRP )—this won’t be a major change, as these companies already adhere to U.S. financial compliance standards. On the other hand, the situation is more complicated for Tether ( USDT ), the largest stablecoin issuer in the world. Tether, headquartered in El Salvador , has traditionally backed its stablecoin, USDT, with a mix of assets, including U.S. Treasury bills, corporate paper, and Bitcoin ( BTC ). However, a recent report from JPMorgan has raised concerns that a portion of Tether’s reserves, particularly its Bitcoin holdings, might not meet the stringent reserve requirements outlined in the bill. If the law passes, Tether may be forced to liquidate part of its Bitcoin reserves to comply, which could put pressure on its ability to maintain a stable peg to the U.S. dollar. Another important aspect of the bill is its enforcement provisions. It mandates that stablecoin issuers must have the capability to freeze, block, or burn tokens upon lawful orders from regulators. Legal experts like Jeremy Hogan have pointed out that this could force issuers to reconsider their technological infrastructure to meet these demands. I only had time tonight to skim-read the new proposed stablecoin bill, the humbly named ""Genius Act."" A couple of thoughts and a big QUESTION I need help with: 1. As many people in the comments have already mentioned, passage of this Act would be the death of USTD in the U.S..… https://t.co/VtWpbyZ7YG pic.twitter.com/v1XEMizD53 — Jeremy Hogan (@attorneyjeremy1) March 11, 2025 Overall, if the bill passes, U.S. based stablecoins could see greater adoption and deeper integration with traditional banking systems, while foreign competitors struggle to keep up with U.S. regulations. In response to increasing regulatory pressure, Tether has recently appointed Simon McWilliams as its new Chief Financial Officer. The appointment aims to improve transparency and work toward a full audit. Tether has long promised a full audit, but critics have only seen quarterly attestations through BDO. Whether these efforts will satisfy U.S. regulators remains uncertain. Whether this is a step toward stability and legitimacy or just another layer of government control will depend on how it’s implemented—and who ultimately benefits from the changes.

As one of the most well-known meme coins, it has generated both immense interest and skepticism in equal measure. Over the years, Dogecoin’s value has skyrocketed, only to drop back to earth just as quickly. Currently, DOGE is battling near its critical support levels, and investors are asking themselves whether this is the final bottom price or if further declines are in store. Meanwhile, Coldware (COLD) , a new and innovative cryptocurrency, is gearing up to introduce its Layer 2 Meme Maker to the market. With the meme coin space continuing to evolve, Coldware (COLD) is making strategic moves to offer more than just speculative value. Here’s a deeper look at the current state of Dogecoin and the promising future of Coldware (COLD). Is This the Final Bottom Price for Dogecoin? As of now, Dogecoin (DOGE) has been hovering around the $0.17 mark. The token has been consolidating, with a slight upward push from its recent lows. While many investors have been waiting for a clear trend reversal, DOGE's price action has been marked by significant volatility. DOGE saw a brief surge following announcements from figures like Elon Musk, but the overall sentiment has remained somewhat bearish. The long-term prospects for DOGE appear uncertain at this point. Despite the meme coin’s popularity, it lacks the technological developments seen in other cryptocurrencies, which leaves it vulnerable to market corrections. Experts are divided on whether this current price level is the final bottom or just another phase in DOGE's tumultuous history. DOGE still has a massive, loyal community, but that alone might not be enough to reverse its downward trajectory in the face of greater competition and market uncertainty. Coldware (COLD): A New Layer 2 Meme Maker Entering the Space As DOGE and other meme coins struggle to find solid ground, Coldware (COLD) is preparing to launch a Layer 2 Meme Maker that aims to revolutionize how meme coins function within the blockchain ecosystem. Positioned as a solution for scalability and speed, Coldware (COLD) has the potential to address many of the issues that have plagued meme coins like DOGE. Coldware’s (COLD) Layer 2 solution intends to offer a faster and more efficient way for meme coin creators to launch and scale their tokens. By using Layer 2 technologies, Coldware can help alleviate the high transaction fees and scalability issues that often hinder DOGE and other meme coins, making it an attractive proposition for both new and existing meme coin investors. Coldware’s Competitive Edge: Layer 2 Innovation Coldware (COLD) is positioning itself to fill the gaps left by older meme coins like DOGE. With its Layer 2 Meme Maker, Coldware intends to bring more utility to meme coins by offering solutions that enhance scalability, reduce transaction fees, and improve transaction speed. This is especially crucial in the era of DeFi (decentralized finance), where the ability to scale efficiently and cost-effectively is paramount. In addition, Coldware is tapping into the growing demand for RWA (Real World Asset) tokenization. As the world continues to move toward blockchain adoption, Coldware (COLD) could emerge as a leader in integrating real-world assets with the crypto ecosystem, providing tangible value to its users. The Future of Meme Coins: Will Dogecoin Stand the Test of Time? While DOGE remains a household name, its lack of technological innovation and utility in real-world applications means it may struggle to maintain its current position in the future. In contrast, Coldware (COLD) , with its Layer 2 Meme Maker and focus on RWA tokenization, is positioning itself to be a key player in the next phase of meme coin evolution. In conclusion, DOGE might be nearing its final bottom price, but its future remains uncertain unless it undergoes significant technological advancements. On the other hand, Coldware (COLD) presents a fresh opportunity in the meme coin space, offering the potential for long-term growth through Layer 2 solutions and real-world asset tokenization. For investors looking for the next big thing in meme coins, Coldware may just be the answer.

The deal, reportedly valued in the “nine-figure” range as the exact amount remain undisclosed, marks MoonPay’s strategic expansion into the stablecoin sector, strengthening its position in the growing digital payments ecosystem. What MoonPay’s new acquisition brings Stablecoins—cryptocurrencies pegged to traditional assets like the U.S. dollar—have gained substantial traction in recent years as a preferred medium for cross-border payments, remittances, and decentralized finance (DeFi) transactions. The acquisition of Iron underscores MoonPay’s strategy to enhancing its stablecoin infrastructure, which could provide new avenues for both retail and institutional crypto adoption. Iron specializes in API-based stablecoin solutions, enabling businesses to integrate stablecoin payments seamlessly. Its technology facilitates faster and more cost-effective transactions, which aligns with MoonPay’s mission to simplify crypto accessibility. Max von Wallenberg, CEO and Founder of IRON, said on the news of acquisition in a X post, “Moonpay team will be rocket fuel for Iron. Building scalable, enterprise-grade stablecoin infra for institutions is a multi-trillion $ opportunity and I can’t think of a better partner to to take things to the next level. From the moment we started engaging with the MoonPay team, it was very obvious that our visions are squarely aligned. Stablecoins are the future of payments, banking and global capital markets.” By integrating Iron’s capabilities, MoonPay aims to offer a more robust and scalable stablecoin payment solution, catering to an increasingly digital financial landscape. Since we rolled out the @iron stablecoin API the interest has been absolutely phenomenal! But once part of @MoonPay , we'll be able to scale exponentially faster. We've built a developer-first API experience to power apps, exchanges, institutions, DEXs, and PSPs around the world… https://t.co/HPlk42tj55 pic.twitter.com/oT0Ri12vYJ — Omid (@omidaladini) March 13, 2025 MoonPay’s Growing Influence Since its inception in 2019, MoonPay has positioned itself as a crucial player in crypto on-ramping and off-ramping services. The company provides an easy way for users to purchase and sell cryptocurrencies using traditional payment methods, including credit cards, bank transfers, and mobile wallets. With this acquisition, MoonPay is taking a step beyond its existing offerings by expanding into the back-end infrastructure of stablecoin payments. “This acquisition is a game-changer for us,” said MoonPay CEO Ivan Soto-Wright. “Stablecoins are revolutionizing global finance, and with Iron’s technology, we are now in a position to power a more efficient, accessible, and scalable stablecoin ecosystem.” With traditional financial institutions and fintech companies entering the stablecoin space , MoonPay’s acquisition of Iron signals a proactive approach to ensuring its infrastructure can support the next wave of adoption. The move also comes amid growing interest from corporations looking to integrate stablecoins into their payment systems, making MoonPay’s acquisition timely and strategic. The Competitive Landscape set to heat up further MoonPay’s expansion into stablecoin infrastructure pits it against other major players in the space, including Circle, which issues USDC, and PayPal, which launched its own stablecoin, PYUSD, in 2023. By acquiring Iron, MoonPay is not only strengthening its infrastructure but also positioning itself as a key enabler for businesses seeking stablecoin payment solutions. Iron’s advanced API technology allows businesses to integrate stablecoin functionalities without the complexities often associated with blockchain development. This could provide MoonPay with a competitive edge, enabling it to cater to enterprises looking for seamless digital payment solutions without overhauling their existing financial systems. Final Thoughts MoonPay’s acquisition of Iron is a bold step in reinforcing its influence in the digital payments space. By leveraging Iron’s API-driven stablecoin infrastructure, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on the increasing demand for stablecoin transactions in both retail and institutional markets. As the stablecoin ecosystem evolves, MoonPay’s latest move signals that fintech firms are betting big on blockchain-powered financial solutions. Whether this acquisition sets the stage for further expansion or fuels competition among crypto payment giants remains to be seen. One thing is clear: the future of digital payments is increasingly stablecoin-driven, and MoonPay intends to be at the forefront of this transformation.

Currently trading below the significant $85k mark, Bitcoin is poised to experience severe downfalls. Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone’s recent prediction has sparked caution, as he warned of Bitcoin’s possible crash to $10k. Amidst mixed predictions about Bitcoin’s future, McGlone’s warning has garnered significant attention, prompting investors and traders to exercise caution. Let’s explore the diverse perspectives of experts on the potential trends in Bitcoin’s price. Will Bitcoin Price Dip to $10K? Bloomberg Analyst Warns In a recent bearish analysis, Mike McGlone, a Bloomberg analyst, shared insights on the Bitcoin price’s potential downtrend. McGlone presented a gloomy picture of Bitcoin’s future trends, projecting its possible fall to a low of $10,000. Notably, the analyst suggested that the bearish trend has already started. He added that the risk markets are showing evidence of overheating while gold rises. McGlone further noted, Gold is up about the same amount in 2025 to March 13 — about 15% — that Bitcoin is down. But with Bitcoin at about $80,000, what stops those trajectories? About a 6% decline in the S&P 500 could suggest what matters. Is Bitcoin About to Burst? In another X thread, the Bloomberg analyst posited that Bitcoin’s creation in 2009 coincided with the stock market’s low point during the mortgage crisis. He added that Bitcoin has spearheaded “one of the greatest risk-asset rallies in history” since then. This implies that the analysts sees Bitcoin as a highly overvalued asset that is due for a significant correction. Additionally, McGlone highlighted the groundbreaking Bitcoin ETF launch and President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto approach . He suggested that the Bitcoin price has reached the pinnacle of a bubble reminiscent of the dot-com era. Reinforcing McGlone’s prediction, analysts like CryptoCove asserted that Bitcoin’s bearish trend will continue. CryptoCove predicted a decline in Bitcoin’s price to around $70-$75k. This forecast is supported by the presence of a rising wedge pattern on the BTC price chart, which the analyst believes to be a bear flag. Will Bitcoin Rebound? Experts Defy McGlone’s Forecast Commenting on McGlone’s predictions, Bitcoin maximalist Joe Buchner emphasized the potential implications of the Bitcoin price crash. He stated, If BTC dropped to 10k I think we’d be in a larger global issue than worrying about that. WWIII maybe would be in play and even then I think BTC would get flooded with $ for safety. However, many market experts defied McGlone’s BTC forecast, predicting a bullish future for Bitcoin. For instance, analyst Captain Faibik announced that Bitcoin is ready for a rebound targeting $108k. Source: Captain Faibik Similarly, analyst CryptoELITES shared a more optimistic prediction for Bitcoin price, projecting its rally to $190k and beyond. As of now, Bitcoin is valued at $84,074, up by 1.04% in a day. Despite the daily surge, the cryptocurrency has seen notable dips of 2.42% and 12.3% over the past week and month, respectively.

41701419,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=693602,1742044834,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41701419.jpeg,Trump: Bloomberg and WSJ articles about WLFI and Binance were politically motivated,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-bloomberg-wsj-articles-wlfi-binance/,"The Trump family has accused Bloomberg, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ), and other media outlets of pushing a political agenda to undermine crypto. In a statement posted on X Friday, the Trump-backed World Liberty Financial (WLFI) rejected claims made in recent reports, calling them unsubstantiated and aimed at damaging the industry. “The unsubstantiated articles in the WSJ, Bloomberg, and elsewhere seem to be politically motivated and demonstrate a troubling pattern of agenda-driven journalism set on damaging the crypto industry,” WLFI posted . “To set the facts straight: WLFI is a DeFi project with a tremendous mission to build and democratize a new financial system for the benefit of millions.” WLFI urged the public to ignore clickbait, saying that instead of relying on mainstream media, people should wait for direct updates from the project itself. The company emphasized its commitment to blockchain, highlighting partnerships with leading organizations. But WLFI wasn’t the only one pushing back against the reports—Binance CEO Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao also slammed WSJ and Bloomberg for their coverage. CZ denies WSJ’s claims about Trump and Binance US WSJ published an article claiming that Trump’s family was involved in financial discussions with Binance US and that CZ had been pushing for a presidential pardon after his legal troubles in the United States. The article further alleged that Binance had approached Trump allies last year in a bid to re-enter the US market after its regulatory battles. The report said that the deal could have been facilitated through WLFI, the Trump-backed DeFi project launched in September 2024. It also mentioned Steve Witkoff, a longtime Trump associate and his chief Middle East and Ukraine negotiator, as one of the key figures involved in the discussions. However, a Trump administration official dismissed these claims, saying that Witkoff was already divesting from his business interests and that WSJ failed to provide any evidence that the talks resulted in an actual deal. CZ immediately fired back, rejecting the report and calling it completely false. “Sorry to disappoint,” CZ wrote on X. “The WSJ article got the facts wrong. More than 20 people told me they were asked by WSJ (and another media) if they could confirm that I made some deal for a pardon. They probably asked hundreds of people to get 20 to reach out to me. They tried hard to make a story to report.” He denied ever having discussions about a Binance US deal and questioned the timing and motivation behind the report. “No felon would reject a pardon,” CZ said, emphasizing that he was the only person in US history to serve time for a single BSA charge. He suggested that the story was deliberately designed to attack Trump and crypto. “Feels like the article is motivated as an attack on the President and crypto, and the residual forces of the ‘war on crypto’ from the last administration are still at work,” CZ added. Bloomberg joins in, but CZ shuts it down Shortly after WSJ’s report, Bloomberg published a similar article, making vague claims about Trump, WLFI, and Binance. But CZ wasn’t backing down. “Bloomberg was the ‘another media’ in my earlier post,” he wrote. “They just published their baseless hit piece after WSJ, with statements like: ‘It’s not clear what stage the discussions have reached or whether they’ll result in any transactions or ventures.’” He pointed out that Bloomberg’s own article admitted that the details were unclear, yet they published it anyway. “‘The substance of the meeting with Zhao isn’t clear.’ They basically admitted that their whole article is purely imaginary. Is this what ‘news’ has become?” CZ also addressed the claims about WLFI, saying that he and Binance had no business relationship with the project or the people mentioned in the report. “Fact: I/Binance have no business deals with WLFI or the people mentioned in their article. We also did not buy any of the WLFI coins,” he wrote. He then reminded the public that Bloomberg has a history of false reports, citing a defamation lawsuit from July 2024. “Bloomberg has done this before. Back in July 2024, they had to issue a formal apology after I sued them for defamation,” CZ wrote. The lawsuit stemmed from a 2022 article in Bloomberg Businessweek’s Chinese edition, which falsely claimed that CZ was running a Ponzi scheme. “In our 250th issue (July 6, 2022), we made the egregious mistake of publishing a cover page with a headline that was false and baseless,” Bloomberg wrote in its apology. “We were wrong to write ‘Changpeng Zhao’s Ponzi Scheme.’ We retract and withdraw this offensive statement without reservation and apologize unreservedly for any harm or distress caused to Mr. Zhao and Binance.” WLFI sees $124M in unrealized losses but continues investing Meanwhile, WLFI’s on-chain data shows that its portfolio is deep in the red. According to Lookonchain, the project has an unrealized loss of $124 million across nine tokens. Despite the losses, WLFI continues to invest heavily, purchasing 541,783 SEI tokens on Thursday using $100,000 in USDC. The nine tokens in the WLFI portfolio are: Ethereum (ETH) Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) Tron (TRX) Chainlink (LINK) Aave (AAVE) Ethena (ENA) Movement (MOVE) Ondo Finance (ONDO) Sei (SEI) The biggest losses came from ETH, which is down $93.6 million. On March 6, WLFI tripled its ETH holdings within a week, now holding $11.2 million more than before. But ETH’s price dropped 13%, adding $1.92 million to WLFI’s losses. Other losses came from wBTC, AAVE, LINK, and ENA, each wiping out over $3 million from WLFI’s balance sheet. LINK took the biggest hit, dropping 18% from $17.6 on March 7. Last week, WLFI added $10 million in Wrapped Bitcoin and $1.5 million in Movement Network (MOVE) tokens to its treasury. But MOVE has since plummeted 10.5%, now trading at $0.47. In February, WLFI moved its entire crypto treasury to Coinbase Prime for treasury management. “To be clear, we are not selling tokens,” WLFI posted on X. “We are simply reallocating assets for ordinary business purposes.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

This plunge can be attributed to a broader market decline across most cryptocurrencies, especially bitcoin (BTC). Despite this negative trend, most gaming projects have not relented in their development. The crypto analytics platform Santiment has outlined the top gaming projects by development, and this list is led by MultiversX (EGLD), Decentraland (MANA), and Skale Network (SKL). Top Gaming Projects By Dev. Activity MultiversX has recorded the highest development activity in the last 30 days. The project is a scalable distributed blockchain network for next-gen applications. Called the internet-scale blockchain, MultiversX has an ecosystem that spans several sectors, including decentralized finance (DeFi) and wallets. However, its gaming products have been brought to light in this case. Since July 2024, the gaming protocol has consistently led development activity in the sector. Its native token, EGLD, is the eighth-largest gaming asset, with a market cap of more than $496 million. Following MultiversX is Decentraland, a decentralized social virtual world where users can create memories, connect with new friends, and explore events. Decentraland’s MANA is the fifth-largest gaming asset by market cap. Like MultiversX, the project has maintained its position as the second leader in development activity since July 2024. Skale Network took the third spot; however, unlike MultiversX and Decentraland, which have been leaders in the past seven months, Skale’s activity recently witnessed a significant spike. The zero gas fee blockchain has mostly taken fourth place behind Immutable X (IMX) or Nine Chronicles (WNCG). Skale’s token SKL is the 18th-largest gaming asset by market cap. Saito And Enjin See Notable Dev. Activity Immutable X is the fourth leading project in development activity. Its activity did not significantly increase in the past 30 days, hence the overtaking by Skale Network. Regardless, IMX has the largest market cap in the gaming sector—above $932.8 million. The fifth project with the highest development activity is Saito (SAITO), a blockchain that also operates web3 applications directly in browsers. Saito is followed by The Root Network (ROOT), which is a hub for the open metaverse and a foundation for connected games. Both Saito and The Root network saw no significant spikes in the development activities. Enjin (ENJ), which offers a suite of integrated gaming products, took seventh place. Development activity in The Sandbox Game (SAND) placed the project in eighth place, while the Ethereum-based decentralized game console Treasure (MAGIC) came ninth. The decentralized cloud computing platform Cere Network also recorded notable development activity in the last 30 days.

She discussed her approach with CoinDesk in late February. You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions. 'Right the ship' The narrative SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce spoke with CoinDesk on Feb. 28, 2025, hours before U.S. President Donald Trump announced his White House crypto summit. Why it matters The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is one of the key regulators overseeing the crypto sector in the country, and has been the source of much ire. Peirce, who has served as a commissioner since 2018, is now looking to change the regulator's approach to the entire industry. As part of this, the SEC is hosting an event on crypto policy on March 21. Breaking it down Just to get right into it, obviously, it's been, I think, an eventful five weeks now, give or take, since President Donald Trump took the oath of office and resumed his presidency. The big thing in your world is the new crypto task force that you're heading up, as far as the crypto industry is concerned. And just to begin with, I was hoping you could maybe walk through what you've seen and done and heard so far, and then where you expect this to go. Yeah, let me start by giving you my standard disclaimer, which is that my views are my own views as a commissioner, not necessarily those of the SEC or my fellow commissioners. So I think it has been an exciting five weeks, and I think it was great that Chairman [Mark] Uyeda kicked off the task force , and decided to give us the ability to think about a lot of these issues in a holistic way. And so that's exactly what we're trying to do. I think we have been able to get a lot done already, which I'm happy about. It's a great team, a lot of really smart people who are working very hard. And so I think the goal is to try to think about what we can just carve out and say to people, ""this isn't in our jurisdiction."" Congress, if you want to put it in our jurisdiction, that's fine, but it's not there. And then with the stuff that's in our jurisdiction, what can we do in the short term to provide some clarity or a path forward for people so that they're not feeling that they can't do anything out of fear that it might be within our space. So let's provide some clear roads forward. Those might be temporary, just bridging the gap until there's legislation or regulation, and then trying to grapple with some of those longer term issues around tokenization of securities, around what does it look like for a broker dealer or a trading platform that's trying to have securities alongside non-securities. Some of those more difficult issues will take some time to grapple with, and we're trying to do all of this in a way that involves the public. We want people to be able to come in and talk to us. We want to get their suggestions for how to move forward and and and really get the best ideas and put those in place Can you speak a bit to what you're hearing, what kind of feedback you might have gotten already? We've talked to people, and some people have started to respond. I haven't been able to get through a lot of responses yet, but I think people are engaging seriously with what we've asked — the big list of questions was about 50 questions . What we've asked people is just respond to what [you can]. You can respond to everything if you want, but you definitely shouldn't feel you have to respond to everything. And so I think we're going to get some really thoughtful, very targeted responses. Some people had already, not surprising, right? They'd already been thinking about how to move forward. So we've already gotten some comprehensive documents that sort of suggest how to move forward in general. And some of those are [responses] people have put out publicly. They haven't prepared them specifically for us, but we're looking at those kinds of things too, and we're trying to figure out, how do we find the best ideas and and the most workable ideas and move forward with those. Are there any areas in particular that Congress, in your view, you know, must address? Is it memecoins, is it something else, anything that the SEC, or even the SEC working with the CFTC, can't, on their own, create a rule, or guidance for? Well, I think they're looking at stablecoin legislation, which I think is an area that definitely Congress has a role to play, and Congress always has a role to play, right? But I think that the market structure bills and the bills that are trying to put some clarity around what should be in our jurisdiction, what might be in the CFTC's jurisdiction instead, could be helpful. So a lot of what is exciting about this technology is it allows for decentralization, and I think that's what draws a lot of people to it. But as with most things, you see that people do sort of gravitate towards centralized entities. And so that would be something that I think we all need to pay attention to, because when you have centralized entities, you have the kinds of concerns that led people to want to decentralize. You have risk of loss, risk of bad conduct by that centralized party, risk that the centralized party will treat some customers differently than others, those kinds of things. And so if you have trading platforms or other centralized intermediaries that are interacting with things that are not securities, then there is not necessarily a regulatory framework for those entities. If that's the case, then Congress may decide that that's something that they want to come in and write a framework for. And it seems that they do, because the bills that are out there do that. So I expect that we'll see a lot more activity on that front this year in Congress. Former CFTC Chair Timothy Massad said in congressional testimony , I want to say it was two or three days ago that he does not think Congress should get into market structure questions specifically. In your view, do you agree with that? I didn't see Chairman Massad's commentary … I unfortunately haven't had a chance to watch that yet, so I didn't see his commentary. But again, I think that it's good to have a conversation around where we need legislation and what we can do with our existing rules. He' was chairman of the CFTC, so he has a good sense of what authority they already have. Do you have maybe a specific timeline in mind for when the SEC could, through the work in the task force, start issuing more concrete guidance? I saw the staff statement yesterday, but anything more formal? Well, fast is my goal. But as I said in the first statement I put out , people need to be patient too, because we want to get this. We want it. We want to do this well also. So I think we'll just put stuff out piecemeal as it's ready to go out, which is why you saw the memecoin statement go out . And I should emphasize that the task force is a great group of people. We've got really smart people there, but we are working with people across the SEC. And so you'll see pieces coming out from different parts of the SEC. And you saw yesterday that the Division of Corporation Finance put out that statement on meme coins. So switching tack just a little bit for a minute here, yesterday, we also saw the SEC file jointly with Coinbase to withdraw the ongoing case alleging just, I think it was a pure registrations violation claim. I know you probably can't speak to any specific case, but could you speak a little bit to kind of the Division of Enforcement more broadly, and what we might expect, especially after the last week? Yeah, I mean, I don't know that I can speak to what you might expect, except to say that. And I think yesterday's action really exemplifies this. We don't want to use our enforcement division to write regulatory policy, and so we're really trying to get back to using our enforcement division for its intended purpose, and letting the regulatory divisions do the hard work of figuring out how to craft rules, guidance, interpretations, and then enforcement has a rule after that, of course, to enforce the rules that are on the books. But this has just been an area where we've kind of gone about it backwards, and we're trying to right the ship here. In kind of the same vein, obviously the SEC filed to pause some of the cases against some of the companies that they've been litigating against. Some of those cases included fraud or related allegations. Do you expect these pauses to just kind of focus on just the pure registration/securities aspect of it, and then [they] might resume from there, or just any thoughts you might have on [that]? We'll assess every case on its facts and circumstances and figure out how to move forward. It's always the goal to make sure that the policy is not being driven by the enforcement, but enforcement follows where policy is. There is certainly a role for enforcement, and there is a role for enforcement in some things related to crypto and we always have to ask the question, is there a securities violation here? But if people are committing fraud and they're thinking that this is a free pass to commit fraud, that's just not the case. If we find a fraud and we don't have authority to go after it, that's something that we will look to find someone else who may have authority in that area, and send it their way. So I think this is really about using our resources most effectively, and that means that we can really save our enforcement resources for where there is bad conduct, as long as it's within our jurisdiction. So I should probably phrase this carefully, because again, I know you probably can't speak to any specific cases, but a big one this week was against the Tron Foundation , and that case did have quite a few allegations of fraud and market manipulation. Is it possible that that's something that you're saying, maybe, the DOJ or another body might have kind of that greater authority, or the more relevant authority that you're speaking of? I can't speak about individual cases, and we really do have to look at each case on its facts and circumstances. And there, there are a lot of cases that we have to look at. And so that's what we're doing. Switching gears again. So Paul Atkins has been nominated to be the chair. Have you had a chance to speak with him about the last couple weeks? Well, Chairman Atkins is focused, I think, on getting his hearing before the Senate and then getting confirmed. I think he'll have plenty of time to engage with us, with the task force, with me, on these issues and others, but I'm trying to let him get through this part of the process. I know, having been through it myself, I know that it takes a lot of preparation, and there are a lot of other demands on his time right now. Do you have any kind of expectation, just directionally speaking, what he might do with regard to crypto and some of these other issues that you're now looking into or leading the charge on? Well, I did work with Commissioner Atkins. I worked for him for four years, so I do know how he thinks about issues, and he definitely is someone who likes the law to be clear and then enforce. The goal is to get the law clear and then enforce it after it's clear. So I suspect that some of the approaches that we're taking will resonate with him and also as someone who is committed to due process, to thinking about notice and comment rulemaking, where that's appropriate, to getting input from the people who will be affected. I think, again, some of the procedural decisions we've made about trying to get a lot of input from the outside, I suspect that's something that will resonate with him. Then we'll see when it comes down to what the individual, what does a good disclosure regime look like in this space. … Can we have some sort of safe harbor type of framework? Those are things that we'll certainly talk with him about when he gets here. I want to come back to the safe harbor aspect in a bit. But just one more question about Chairman Atkins. Before he was nominated, this was, I think, in February 2023, he gave an interview where he suggested that the Ripple case would be a good candidate to go up to the Supreme Court, because it could give a follow up on the Howey case. Just in your view, does that make sense? Is that something you would look forward to? Well, again, I'm not going to speak about any particular case. The Howey Test has been around for a long time. It's a Supreme Court case, and it is designed to interpret investment contracts, which is one element of the definition of security, and it has been applied in a lot of really different and very interesting fact patterns. By its nature, it's going to pull in a lot of different types of things. So Howey, of course, everyone knows was about orange groves. Now it's been applied very, very broadly in the crypto world. I think that Howey has been interpreted, maybe too broadly, and in instances, I think there are some areas of ambiguity that that the Supreme Court could address, but that I will say that is definitely above my pay grade. So if they decide to take that case, I will certainly watch that case, meaning a case related to Howey, regardless of who the parties are, I will definitely watch it closely if the Supreme Court decides to reconsider the Howey Test. On the safe harbor front, I forget when exactly it was that you first introduced the idea of a safe harbor for the industry, A long time ago, yeah. Where are you now on that? I still think we should do some kind of safe harbor. I think it would have been helpful if we had done that before. Because the sad thing about this, the way that we've done things, is that it's actually disincentivized, if that's a word, it's discouraged people from making disclosures. And so I just want to get to a place where we actually encourage disclosure and we reward good disclosure, and I think that's what a regime like the safe harbor regime could do. I'm not wedded to it. I think if people have better ideas, please send them in, tell us what they are. But my goal is to get to a world where people actually want to make disclosures, and they're not fearing that if they make these disclosures, it's going to make them a target of SEC enforcement actions. Now, of course, if you make disclosures and you lie, I mean, yes, then that's fair enforcement game. Do you have any kind of plans right now to either reintroduce this as a formal proposal, or just trying to get momentum back on this front? Well, I think, as you saw from the questions that we put out, it's definitely something we're thinking about and want feedback on. I heard from a lot of people at the time that I put it out that they thought it would be helpful to have something like this. People didn't love every aspect of it. I think you saw some people iterating on it. And so again, what the details are is up for debate, but it's something that that we certainly want people to provide their thoughts on I want to get your reaction to something that was posted online recently. Cameron Winklevoss, the co-founder of crypto exchange Gemini, posted a letter saying it was from the SEC, saying that they were going to close the investigation into that platform. But in that same post, he demanded restitution for the legal fees that they incurred, and asked for the litigators and investigators working on the case to be, I forget if it was fired or just publicly named and shamed, but I'm just curious if you have any kind of reaction to that kind of a public call. Well, for one thing, I certainly understand. I've been very frustrated about how we've approached crypto here at the SEC over the past several years, and it has real world consequences. I get that, and it's frustrating for me sitting here. I know it's unbelievably more frustrating for people who are actually bearing the costs directly, and I've had conversations with some of those people, and it's very difficult. But I think one thing that's really important to underscore is that decisions about how to proceed, whether we're going to use our enforcement tool, whether we're going to use our rule-writing tool, are made at the commission level, and so the buck does stop at the commission. When we make bad decisions, the blame lies on us. It doesn't lie on the staff who are directed to … They report to the chairman. They are supposed to follow the policy direction that they're getting from the Commission. They're supposed to execute that as effectively as they can. We have a very good, hard working, dedicated staff at the Commission, and they seek to try to carry out the directives that they're getting. And so I really think it's so important for people to to understand that responsibility for decision-making, when, when the decisions are bad, when the policy direction is wrong, the blame has to lie at the commission and, and unfortunately, I think that over the past several years, we have taken an approach that has not helped the American public. It has not helped the industry to grow into being able to serve the American public as it hopes to, and it is, frankly, not serving the staff of the commission either, because it has been asking enforcement lawyers to be playing a role in writing policy. And it has been saying to policy folks, people who write rules and do interpretations and provide guidance, it said to them, you can't do that because we're just going to let enforcement do that. And that has led to a lot of really bad consequences. And I'm hoping we can right that ship. Just to close out in the last few minutes, is there anything we haven't discussed that you think people either in the crypto industry, or just the general public looking at crypto — is there anything they should keep in mind or think about over the next couple of weeks and months? I just hope people will go to our crypto web page — it's on the SEC website, you'll see a link to the crypto web page. Send us a message, come meet with us. We'd love to talk to you. We'd love to hear from you, and so just stay tuned. Awesome. Thank you very much, Commissioner, pleasure as always, Thank you so much for having me.

In its early days, Binance Coin was a small and relatively unknown token in the crypto space. When it first launched in 2017, the price of Binance Coin was only a mere $0.10. Fast forward to today, and Binance Coin has skyrocketed to over $300, providing early investors with massive returns that most people could only dream of. Those who believed in Binance Coin’s potential from the start now reap the rewards of their foresight. For those who missed the initial days of Binance Coin, the story is bittersweet. The opportunity to invest at such a low price has passed, and many are left looking for the next big thing in crypto. This is where Arctic Pablo Coin (APC ) comes into play. Just like BNB in its early days, APC is currently in its presale phase and represents a unique opportunity for investors to get in on the ground floor before the coin explodes in value. With its ongoing success, high ROI potential, and strong deflationary mechanisms, Arctic Pablo Coin is shaping up to be the next big thing, and this might be your second chance to secure those early gains that so many missed with Binance Coin. Binance Coin: The Missed Opportunity When Binance Coin was first introduced in 2017, few could have predicted the massive growth it would experience. At launch, the price of BNB was just $0.10, and early investors saw it as an interesting but speculative asset. Fast forward to today, and Binance Coin has become one of the most valuable and widely used cryptocurrencies in the world. With its use as the native token on the Binance exchange, BNB has grown to a staggering price of over $300, making it a dream investment for anyone who managed to get in early. However, for those who missed the initial ICO of Binance Coin, the regret can be significant. The price surge has been astronomical, leaving many wishing they had taken the plunge when it was still relatively inexpensive. While Binance Coin has proven to be one of the top crypto coins in terms of both utility and price appreciation, those who weren’t early investors may feel they missed the boat. But don’t worry—there is another chance to get in early with a promising meme coin that could see similar growth. Arctic Pablo Coin: A Second Chance at Huge Gains Arctic Pablo Coin is currently in its presale phase, offering an exciting opportunity for investors who missed out on Binance Coin’s early days. One of the most attractive features of Arctic Pablo Coin is its token burn mechanism. Every week, unsold tokens are permanently eliminated, creating a deflationary environment that boosts scarcity and value. The remaining tokens after the presale will also be burned, ensuring that the total supply remains limited, which in turn supports long-term value. This deflationary strategy mirrors the early days of Binance Coin, where scarcity played a key role in its explosive rise. The presale for Arctic Pablo Coin is already proving to be a huge success. In the 14th stage, known as “Frosty Falls,” the project has already raised over $1.88 million. At a price of just $0.000074 per token, Arctic Pablo Coin offers a low entry point, similar to Binance Coin in its early stages. With a current ROI of 10,694.59% from Stage 14 to the projected listing price of $0.008, investors have the chance to make significant gains before the coin hits major exchanges. The presale success shows that Arctic Pablo Coin is already capturing the attention of the crypto community, and now is the time to get involved. Why Arctic Pablo Coin Is Different From Binance Coin Unlike Binance Coin, which is tied to the success of the Binance exchange, Arctic Pablo Coin offers unique features that make it stand out in the meme coin space. Its community-driven approach and meme coin presale create a perfect storm of excitement and potential growth. But what truly sets Arctic Pablo Coin apart is its deflationary approach with token burns and rewards. By eliminating unsold tokens and fostering a scarce supply, Arctic Pablo Coin is positioning itself for massive long-term growth, which could replicate the early success seen by Binance Coin. Additionally, the presale structure of Arctic Pablo Coin rewards early investors with exceptional ROI opportunities. With each stage, the price of the coin increases, but the opportunity to stake and earn rewards makes this presale particularly exciting. If you missed the chance to invest in Binance Coin during its early days, this could be your second chance to make a major return on your investment. The Current Success of Arctic Pablo Coin Presale Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale is already seeing remarkable success, and it’s still not too late to get in. With over $1.88 million raised, the ongoing presale is showing no signs of slowing down. The price of $0.000074 per token is an incredible entry point for anyone looking to take advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. As the coin moves closer to its listing price of $0.008, early investors stand to see massive returns—up to 10,694.59% ROI. The unique token burn mechanism, combined with the exciting presale structure, makes Arctic Pablo Coin a top contender for the next big thing in crypto. Investors who missed the low entry point of Binance Coin can now take advantage of the same type of opportunity with Arctic Pablo Coin. But the window is closing fast—this is the time to act before the price rises even higher. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out on Arctic Pablo Coin Based on the latest research, the top crypto coins to buy right now are Arctic Pablo Coin, Binance Coin, and others that have already established themselves in the market. However, Arctic Pablo Coin offers an exciting opportunity for those who missed out on Binance Coin’s early days. With its presale success, deflationary token burns, and the potential for massive returns, Arctic Pablo Coin is poised to be the next big meme coin success story. Don’t let another chance slip by—invest in Arctic Pablo Coin now and be part of its journey to the top!

The recent mainnet migration has sparked optimism about a potential exchange listing by either Binance or Coinbase. If this happens, these four Pi Network rivals trading under $1 can ensure that you turn $300 to $3,000 before the end of the month. Pi Network Rivals Under $1 to Buy to Turn $300 to $3,000 The best Pi Network rivals to buy for solid returns before the end of the month have solid fundamentals and a bullish technical outlook. These tokens include Cardano (ADA), Stellar (XLM), Hedera (HBAR), and PEPE (PEPE). Cardano (ADA) Cardano is one of the top Pi Network rivals to buy for massive gains. This token has several bullish catalysts including the upcoming listing of Cardano futures on Coinbase on March 31. This launch will drive institutional interest in Cardano, and as investors anticipate this launch, Cardano price seems poised for a 10x gain before the end of the month. ADA price has formed a triple-bottom pattern on its daily chart, which hints at a bullish breakout. The price has also tested resistance at the middle Bollinger band and is now aiming for the upper band, indicating that buying pressure is gaining strength. A continuation of these bullish trends could lead to Cardano price hitting $1.33 before month’s end. ADA/USDT: 1-day Chart Stellar (XLM) Stellar is also among the promising Pi Network rivals to buy for massive gains. XLM tends to mimic XRP’s price movement. Therefore, if there is a positive development in the case between the SEC and Ripple before month’s end, XLM price could surge 10x. The technical outlook is also bullish. Stellar price is moving within an ascending parallel channel, which proves that XLM price could continue with the upward momentum. The RSI is slowly rising and stood at a neutral level of 49. If it flips over to the bullish side, it could stir massive gains for Stellar. XLM/USDT: 1-hour Chart Hedera (HBAR) Hedera is also one of the best Pi Network rivals to invest in. The hype around a HBAR ETF has been driving market interest towards Hedera. If another asset manager BlackRock files for a Hedera ETF, it could drive the prices higher. Coinglass data shows there has been a significant surge in Hedera open interest in the last four days. During this time, OI has surged from $134M to $166M, indicating that investors are opening new positions, which is bullish for the price. HBAR Open Interest PEPE (PEPE) PEPE coin recently saw a massive price gain driven by activity from large addresses. A buying spree from PEPE whales triggered a surge in demand that pushed the price of PEPE higher earlier this week, as the altcoin led the meme coin recovery. If the broader market sentiment shifts and crypto prices start to recover, PEPE is one of the top Pi Network rivals that could see a massive surge in price and deliver significant gains. Final Thoughts on Pi Network Rivals There are many Pi Network rivals that traders can buy today for massive price gains. Cardano, Stellar Hedera and PEPE are the top four Pi Coin rivals that have a bullish technical outlook and could help a trader turn $300 to $3,000 by the end of the month.

The Crown Prosecution Services authorized Merseyside Police to charge NCA officer Paul Chowles with 11 counts of concealing, disguising, or converting criminal property, three counts of acquiring, using or possessing converting criminal property and a single count of theft. The 50 BTC was priced at £60,000 ($77,658) back in 2017 and is worth £3.26 million ($4.2 million) at time of writing. Chowles, 42, is set to appear at Liverpool Magistrates’ Court on April 25th. The officer’s charges materialized less than a year after new UK legislation granted additional crypto-related powers to the NCA and police. The expanded powers enable UK authorities to seize crypto from “sophisticated criminals” who remain anonymous or are based overseas. The police are also empowered to seize physical items related to crypto investigations, like flash drives and written passwords. Additionally, UK police are now allowed to destroy a crypto asset “if returning it to circulation is not conducive to the public good,” and victims of crypto crime will be empowered to apply for the return of digital assets stolen from them. Chief Crown Prosecutor Adrian Foster argued last year that the expanded powers were necessary in an era when criminals are leveraging crypto technology. “Crypto assets are often used by criminal gangs to launder their criminal profits internationally at the touch of a button. It is vital that investigators and prosecutors have the capability and agility to keep pace with this changing nature of crime, [and] these new measures will greatly assist our ability to restrain, freeze, or eliminate crypto assets from illegal enterprise.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

According to authorities, the developer, Rotislav Pandev admitted to coding and consulting for the cybercriminal group, which paid him in digital assets. According to authorities , the LockBit developer was first apprehended in Israel in August in connection to a provisional arrest request made by the United States. The 51-year-old was then extradited to the US and had his first appearance in court, appearing before US Magistrate Judge Andre M. Espinosa. The judge ruled that Pandev be detained until his trial. LockBit ransomware developer faces charges in the US According to a previous complaint consisting of documents filed in this case and others in related cases, Pandev was a developer for the LockBit ransomware group from its inception in 2019 to around February 2024. During the period, Pandev and other members of the gang grew the group to become ruthless in the ransomware world, with some even noting that it was the most active and destructive ransomware group at the time. In the complaint, the LockBit group was said to have attacked nothing less than 2,500 victims across 120 countries globally. Their victims ranged from individuals to small businesses, multinationals, hospitals, governments, and even law enforcement agencies. The filing mentioned that the group had about 1,800 of its victims living in the United States at the time it carried out its activities. LockBit members allegedly cashed out $500 million from numerous ransom payments from victims, causing billions of dollars in other losses, including lost revenue and costs from incident response and recovery. Authorities mentioned that the LockBit group was composed of developers like Pandev who designed the group’s malware codes and maintained the infrastructure that the group operated on. The group had members known as affiliates, who would usually deploy their malware and extort payments from their victims. After the payment, the group members will then split the loot, giving each person their share. In the complaint, authorities mentioned that after Pandev’s arrest in Israel, law enforcement discovered on his computer an administrative credential that was hosted on the dark web and stored codes for multiple versions of the LockBit builder. This allowed the different affiliates to build custom malware for particular victims. They also discovered the StealBit tool that helped the group extract the stolen data through their attacks. United States authorities vow to apprehend all LockBit members In the interviews that Pandev granted after his arrest in Israel, he told authorities that he performed several activities for the LockBit group, including coding, development, and consulting work. He also confessed to having received payments consistent with the ones flagged by authorities in the United States. He mentioned that one key project he worked on was to develop a code to disable antivirus software and infect computers connected to a network. Pandev also mentioned that he created malware to enable the printing of the LockBit ransom note to all the printers connected to a victim network. He also mentioned that he wrote other malware codes and provided technical guidance to the LockBit group. The apprehension of Pandev is coming after the disruption of LockBit ransomware in February 2024 by authorities in the United Kingdom. The joint operation was carried out by several authorities, including the Justice Department , FBI, and other international law enforcement agencies. Aside from Pandev, authorities have also charged seven other members of the group. The primary creator, developer, and administrator of the group Dmitry Yuryevich Khoroshev had his indictment unsealed in May. The indictment noted that he started developing LockBit in September 2019 and continued to act as its administrator till 2024. Khoroshev also recruited other members into the role but spoke for the group under his “LockBitSupp” alias. The United States Transnational Organized Crime (TOC) Rewards Program has announced a reward of $10 million for any information leading to his arrest. “Rostislav Panev’s extradition to the District of New Jersey makes it clear: if you are a member of the LockBit ransomware conspiracy, the United States will find you and bring you to justice,” said United States Attorney John Giordano. He also added that even though criminals are now using sophisticated means to commit crimes, his office, in collaboration with other law enforcement, will deploy all measures to apprehend and prosecute the criminals.

Cosmos ( ATOM ) jumped to a high of $4.45 on Saturday, its highest level since March 4 and 32% above its lowest level this year. The rebound happened as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other altcoins bounced back. Bitcoin rose to $84,000, while Ethereum ( ETH ), Ripple ( XRP ), and Cardano ( ADA ) rose by over 1.45% on Saturday. Cosmos price also jumped as investors bought the dip after it crashed to a crucial support level. According to CoinMarketCap, its 24-hour volume rose to over $153 million. Similarly, the futures open interest rose to $93 million, its highest level since February 2021. Open interest is a figure that looks at the volume of unfilled put and call option orders in the futures ecosystem. In most cases, cryptocurrencies start bouncing back when the open interest is rising. Cosmos open interest | Source: CoinGlass For starters, Cosmos pioneered the concept of the Internet of Blockchains, which is made up of interconnected and independent blockchains that work seamlessly together. Some key players in the ecosystem are networks like Osmosis, Celestia, THORChain, and Cronos.

The daily chart shows that the token dropped to a low of $3.4123 this week. This was an important level since it coincided with the lowest swing in September last year — a sign that it has formed a big double-bottom pattern whose neckline is at the December high of $12.2. Cosmos price also formed a falling wedge chart pattern, which is made up of two descending and converging trendlines. A bullish breakout usually happens when the two lines are nearing their convergence. There are signs that the token is forming a bullish divergence pattern. The Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO) has risen gradually after bottoming at minus 9.95 earlier this month. Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has moved slightly above the descending trendline that connects the highest swings since December 13 last year. Therefore, the combination of a falling wedge and a double-bottom pattern is a sign that the coin will bounce back, possibly to the resistance level at $5.8783, the lowest swing on Dec. 20 last year. This target is about 32% above the current level. A drop below this month’s low of $3.4 will invalidate the bullish view.

The cumulative stablecoin supply has surpassed $219 billion, suggesting that the current cycle is still far from its top. Source: IntoTheBlock Historically, stablecoin supply peaks have aligned with crypto cycle tops, according to a March 14 X post by crypto intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, which wrote: “In April 2022, supply hit $187B—just as the bear market started. Now it’s at $219B and still rising, suggesting we’re likely still mid-cycle.” Increasing stablecoin inflows to crypto exchanges can signal incoming buying pressure and growing investor appetite, as stablecoins are the main investor on-ramp from fiat to the crypto world. Still, Ether ( ETH ) price is down over 52% over the past three months, after it peaked above $4,100 on Dec. 16, 2024, and analysts are eying another decline below $1,900, a “robust” demand zone that may bring more investment into the world’s largest cryptocurrency.

Zlatareva told Cointelegraph: “Bitcoin’s movement below key technical levels, mirroring the S&P 500’s trajectory, highlights the market’s cautious tone as traders await key economic data for direction, including U.S. retail sales and the FOMC meeting.” “All eyes are set on next Wednesday's FOMC meeting, anticipating insights into U.S. monetary policy and potential interest rate adjustments, especially given the recent declines in U.S. PPI and initial jobless claims figures, which point towards a slowing economy,” she added.

Leading projects such as MANTRA have expanded into new markets, while emerging startups like Fraction and Adda Labs—founded by a former JP Morgan executive—are making their mark. Aiming to bring real-world assets on-chain, both established and emerging projects are shaping the Web3 landscape. In line with this trend, a recent report by Brickken predicts that the market capitalization of tokenized assets could reach between $30 trillion and $50 trillion by 2030. It Key Assets Gaining Traction in the RWA Market Blockchain technology is the foundation of tokenization. Its decentralized, secure, and immutable ledger system enhances transparency and reduces fraud. While any asset can theoretically be tokenized, the report highlights five major categories currently gaining traction: Debt – Tokenized bonds improve efficiency, accessibility, and liquidity. Equity – Shares of companies can be tokenized to attract a broader investor base. Asset-Backed Securities (ABS) – Loans and receivables are tokenized to enhance transparency and reduce costs. Funds – Investment funds issue tokens to represent shares, reducing administrative costs. Real Estate – Tokenization enhances liquidity, allowing fractional ownership and faster transactions. As of December 2024, over $50 billion worth of tokenized assets exist across these categories, with continued growth expected in 2025. Technology Driving Tokenization Blockchain & Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is providing an immutable record of transactions. Smart Contracts are enabling automated execution of transactions and compliance requirements. Oracles are bringing off-chain data onto the blockchain for real-time updates. Cross Chain Interoperability is allowing tokenized assets to move across multiple blockchains, increasing market liquidity. Privacy-Preserving Technologies, the zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) ensure compliance with data protection laws. The Key Trends of Tokenization for 2025 and Beyond According to the report, the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA) is set to gain significant momentum in 2025 as institutions increasingly adopt blockchain-based financial products. Major players like BlackRock, JPMorgan, and HSBC are expanding their tokenized offerings, particularly in bonds, private credit, and money market funds. Further, tokenization is expected to enhance liquidity, reduce costs, and improve market efficiency, making traditionally illiquid assets like real estate, private equity, and commodities more accessible to investors. The adoption of tokenized money market funds, such as BlackRock’s BUIDL and Franklin Templeton’s BENJI, is accelerating as investors seek blockchain-based yield-generating products. Regulatory frameworks are also evolving, with clearer guidelines from financial authorities in the US, Europe, and Asia, which will drive institutional confidence in tokenized securities. The report argued that advances in cross chain interoperability, such as Chainlink’s CCIP, will enable seamless asset transfers across blockchains, improving liquidity. AI integration will further optimize tokenized asset management through predictive analytics and automated compliance. With these advancements, the market will transition from pilot projects to large-scale adoption, and tokenized assets are projected to exceed $30 trillion by 2030. Future Growth Expected Tokenization is revolutionizing financial markets by enhancing liquidity, efficiency, and accessibility. The report concludes that the next five years will be critical in determining how blockchain technology integrates into mainstream finance. Institutions that embrace tokenization early are predicted to gain a competitive edge in the evolving digital asset ecosystem.

(Ripple Price Analysis),https://cryptopotato.com/calm-before-the-storm-for-xrp-ripple-price-analysis/,"Ripple’s native token has been trading within an expanding wedge pattern, recently finding support at the lower boundary. Until a decisive breakout occurs, further consolidation is expected within its current range, defined by the 100-day moving average and the $2 support level. XRP Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart XRP has remained within an expanding wedge pattern over recent months, with the $2 support level acting as a strong defense line for buyers. This crucial price region aligns with the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level, reinforcing its significance. Meanwhile, Ripple faces significant resistance at the 100-day moving average of $2.5, which is likely filled with supply. As a result, the price remains confined within a tight range near the wedge’s lower boundary, suggesting continued consolidation in the short term. However, from a broader perspective, if XRP maintains support at this key level, an eventual breakout to the upside could trigger a fresh rally. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, XRP has struggled to surpass the critical $2.8 resistance, leading to repeated rejections. Recently, the price dipped into a sell-side liquidity zone below a prior market low, which triggered a sharp bullish rebound. Additionally, Ripple has formed a bullish flag pattern and has found support at its lower boundary. This price action suggests ongoing liquidity hunts and market cooling, potentially allowing smart money to accumulate. If a rebound materializes at this crucial level, a retest of the $2.8 resistance will likely follow. The post Calm Before the Storm for XRP?

You might think so if you’re only looking at social media and trader sentiment. But what if there’s a bigger picture that most are missing? Ari Paul, the founder of BlockTower Capital, a prominent crypto investment firm, recently highlighted a fascinating and potentially lucrative divergence in the crypto space: a sharp disconnect between market sentiment and underlying fundamentals. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Paul pointed out that while many traders and analysts are leaning bearish, those deeply involved in building the future of crypto – the developers and long-term industry professionals – remain bullish. Is this disconnect a cause for concern, or a hidden buying opportunity? Decoding the Crypto Sentiment Disconnect What exactly does this crypto sentiment disconnect mean? Essentially, it’s a tale of two crypto worlds right now: The Trader’s View (Bearish Sentiment): Short-term traders and market analysts are often swayed by price charts, immediate market movements, and social media buzz. If prices are down or stagnant, the sentiment tends to be negative. This can be amplified by fear of broader economic downturns or regulatory uncertainties. The Builder’s View (Bullish Fundamentals): On the other hand, developers, project founders, and long-term investors are focused on the technology’s progress, adoption rates, and real-world applications being built. They see beyond the daily price fluctuations and recognize the growing strength of the underlying market fundamentals . Paul’s observation suggests that the current bearish sentiment might be overlooking significant positive developments happening beneath the surface. It’s like focusing on the waves crashing on the shore while ignoring the powerful currents moving beneath the ocean. Why Market Fundamentals are Screaming ‘Opportunity’ So, what are these market fundamentals that are painting a more optimistic picture? Here are a few key areas to consider: Technological Advancements: Despite market volatility, innovation in the crypto space continues at a rapid pace. We’re seeing advancements in layer-2 scaling solutions, improved blockchain interoperability, and the development of more user-friendly and efficient decentralized applications (dApps). Increasing Adoption: Institutional interest in crypto is still growing. Major financial players are exploring and adopting blockchain technology and digital assets. Furthermore, real-world use cases for crypto, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to NFTs and beyond, are becoming more tangible and widespread. Developer Activity: A crucial indicator of long-term health is developer activity. The number of developers actively building and contributing to crypto projects remains robust. This suggests a strong belief in the future potential of the technology and a commitment to its growth. Venture Capital Investment: Smart money continues to flow into the crypto space. Despite market fluctuations, venture capital firms are still actively investing in promising crypto projects, especially those focused on long-term value creation. Is Now the Time for a Buying Opportunity? Ari Paul’s perspective leans towards the idea that the current market conditions present a compelling buying opportunity , particularly for those with a 12-month or longer investment horizon. He suggests that the disconnect between negative sentiment and positive fundamentals creates an environment where assets might be undervalued. However, he also wisely acknowledges the uncertainty of short-term market movements. While he sees long-term potential, he’s not definitively calling the short-term bottom. This nuanced view is crucial – it’s about recognizing value while understanding market volatility. Key Takeaways on Buying Opportunity: Perspective Actionable Insight Long-Term Investor Consider accumulating positions in fundamentally strong crypto assets during market dips. Focus on projects with solid technology, growing adoption, and active development teams. Venture Capital (VC) Firms Explore investment opportunities in early-stage crypto projects. Prioritize projects focused on sustainable value creation and real-world problem-solving, rather than just short-term hype. Short-Term Trader Exercise caution and recognize the potential for continued volatility. While there might be short-term trading opportunities, the overall sentiment could still be influenced by macro-economic factors and broader market trends. The Allure of Venture Capital in the Crypto Winter Paul specifically highlights the potential of venture capital investments in the current climate. Why is this particularly appealing now? Focus on Building, Not Hype: Bear markets often filter out projects driven by hype and short-term gains. What remains are projects with genuine substance and a focus on building valuable technology. This creates a fertile ground for VC investments in projects with real long-term potential. Favorable Valuations: Market downturns can lead to more reasonable valuations for early-stage projects. This means VC firms can potentially acquire larger stakes in promising companies at more attractive prices compared to bull market peaks. Long-Term Growth Potential: Venture capital is inherently a long-term game. VC investors are looking beyond the immediate market noise and focusing on the disruptive potential of blockchain technology over the coming years. A bear market can be an excellent time to plant the seeds for future growth. Looking at the Long-Term Crypto Vision Ultimately, Ari Paul’s message resonates with a long-term crypto vision. It’s a reminder that the crypto space is not just about short-term price swings and trading frenzies. It’s about building a new technological infrastructure, fostering innovation, and creating real-world value. The current disconnect between sentiment and fundamentals can be seen as a sign of market immaturity, but also as a massive opportunity. For those who can look beyond the noise and recognize the underlying strength of the crypto ecosystem, the present moment might be remembered as a time of significant accumulation and strategic positioning for the next wave of growth. In conclusion, while bearish sentiment might dominate crypto headlines, it’s crucial to consider the deeper currents of fundamental growth. BlockTower Capital’s founder’s insights suggest that smart money is paying attention to the long-term potential, seeing the current market as less of a crisis and more of a strategic buying window. Whether you’re a long-term investor, a venture capitalist, or simply someone curious about the future of finance and technology, understanding this sentiment disconnect is key to navigating the crypto landscape effectively.

On March 14, the anonymous whale—referred to as “ETH 50x Big Guy” on social media—placed long positions in LINK worth approximately $31 million with 10x leverage across Hyperliquid and GMX, according to Lookonchain , a Web3 analytics service. In addition to his leveraged bets, the trader also accumulated around $12 million worth of LINK in spot holdings. However, in the hours that followed, he gradually reduced his LINK exposure, swapping portions of his holdings back into stablecoins, on-chain data shows. Hyperliquid’s Liquidity Pool Tested Again The latest move comes just two days after the same trader intentionally liquidated a $200 million ETH long position on Hyperliquid, causing its liquidity pool (HLP) to suffer a $4 million loss. The event sparked debate over the risks associated with highly leveraged trading, with Hyperliquid confirming that the incident was not an exploit but rather a natural outcome of the platform’s mechanics under extreme conditions. The trader walked away with $1.8 million in profits from the trade, contributing to his total earnings of nearly $17 million on Hyperliquid in the past month, according to Lookonchain. Following the ETH liquidation event, Hyperliquid responded on March 13 by tightening collateral requirements for traders with open positions, aiming to prevent similar high-risk scenarios in the future. This whale is long $LINK on #Hyperliquid and #GMX , with a position size of ~$31M. He also spent 12.1M $USDC to buy 863,174 $LINK at $14. https://t.co/SncLPnog4v https://t.co/3fXA7ctoOh pic.twitter.com/kx7WWCiJ4R — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) March 14, 2025 Despite its challenges, Hyperliquid has quickly risen to dominate the perpetuals trading market. According to a January report by asset manager VanEck, the exchange has captured 70% of market share, surpassing competitors GMX and dYdX. The trader’s latest bet comes amid volatile price movements for Chainlink’s LINK token. LINK rallied over 150% following Donald Trump’s U.S. election victory, but has since fallen from its December peak of nearly $30 to under $14 as of March 14, according to CoinGecko data. Despite its price decline, Chainlink remains the leading decentralized oracle network, with a market capitalization of approximately $8.7 billion. Hyperliquid Tightens Trading Rules After Brutal $4M Loss Hyperliquid has tightened trading rules after its liquidity pool took a $4 million hit during the whale liquidation event. While the news initially sparked a 15% crash, the hours since have seen the HYPE price surge 16% to a $14 peak—the first relief from its month-long free fall. Hyperliquid remains the leading perpetual futures exchange, yet retail liquidity has thinned under heavy market FUD. Starting March 15, the platform will require traders to maintain a 20% minimum collateral margin on certain open positions to prevent similar incidents. Prominent DeFi commentator Aylo defended the event as a valuable stress test, arguing that the 1% hit to HLP was a “very reasonable price” to expose and address protocol vulnerabilities.

41704588,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=140315,1742050251,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revealed: David Sacks’ Shocking $200M Crypto Investments Sell-Off Before Crypto Czar Role,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/david-sacks-crypto-investments-sold/,"The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with revelations surrounding David Sacks, the former Trump administration’s Crypto Czar. A recent CNBC report has unveiled a significant financial move made by Sacks just before stepping into his influential role: a massive sell-off of crypto investments totaling $200 million. This has ignited discussions about potential conflicts of interest and the ethical considerations of officials involved in the rapidly evolving digital asset space. Who is David Sacks and Why Does This Crypto Sell-Off Matter? For those unfamiliar, David Sacks is a prominent figure known for his roles in tech and, more recently, in the political sphere. His appointment as the Trump administration’s Crypto Czar signaled a potential shift in the government’s approach to crypto regulation . However, this recent disclosure of his pre-office financial activities raises pertinent questions. Why is this news significant? Because it brings to light the financial entanglements of a key figure tasked with shaping crypto policy. A $200 million divestment, especially in a volatile market like crypto, is not a trivial matter. It prompts us to delve deeper into the timeline, the nature of these investments, and the possible implications for his role. Decoding the $200 Million Crypto Investments: What Did Sacks Sell? The report indicates that Sacks’ divestment wasn’t just personal; it extended to his venture capital firm, Craft Ventures crypto . Here’s a breakdown of what we know: Massive Scale: A total of $200 million in cryptocurrencies and crypto-related investments were sold. This is a substantial amount, highlighting Sacks’ significant involvement in the crypto market prior to his government role. Personal Gains: At least $85 million of the proceeds flowed directly to David Sacks personally. This underscores the direct financial benefit he derived from these crypto holdings. Dual Channels: The sales were conducted both personally by Sacks and through Craft Ventures, indicating a widespread divestment strategy. Pre-Office Timing: All these sales occurred before Sacks officially assumed his position as Crypto Czar, suggesting a preemptive measure before entering public service. While the exact cryptocurrencies or crypto-related assets sold haven’t been itemized in the report, the sheer volume points to a diverse portfolio likely encompassing major cryptocurrencies and potentially investments in crypto startups or funds. Why the Pre-Office Crypto Sell-Off? Speculations and Scenarios The crucial question is: why sell off such a substantial amount of David Sacks crypto holdings before taking office? Several theories emerge: Conflict of Interest Avoidance: Perhaps the most straightforward explanation is to preemptively avoid any potential conflicts of interest. Holding significant crypto assets while being a key figure in shaping crypto policy could raise ethical concerns and accusations of bias. Divesting could be seen as a proactive step to maintain impartiality. Anticipation of Regulation: Was Sacks anticipating stricter crypto regulation under the Trump administration, or perhaps future administrations? Selling off before potential regulatory changes could be a strategic financial move, especially if regulations were expected to negatively impact crypto asset values. Public Perception Management: Entering a public role with substantial crypto holdings could attract unwanted scrutiny and negative public perception. Divestment could be a calculated move to present a cleaner image and avoid controversies related to personal crypto wealth. Market Timing: While less likely given the context, it’s also possible that Sacks simply believed it was a favorable time to sell in the crypto market, independent of his political appointment. However, the timing strongly suggests a connection to his new role. Craft Ventures Still in Crypto: A Contradiction? Interestingly, while Sacks personally and through Craft Ventures sold off $200 million worth of crypto before his government role, reports indicate that Craft Ventures crypto is still actively investing in crypto-based funds. This raises further questions: Aspect David Sacks Craft Ventures Pre-Office Crypto Holdings Sold off significant personal holdings Sold off holdings through the firm Current Crypto Involvement Likely reduced due to divestment Still actively investing in crypto funds This apparent contradiction could be explained by several factors: Separation of Personal and Firm Finances: Sacks’ personal financial decisions might be distinct from Craft Ventures’ investment strategies. The firm’s continued investment could reflect its long-term belief in crypto, irrespective of Sacks’ individual circumstances. Diversification Strategy: Venture capital firms often diversify their investments. While Sacks might have divested for personal reasons, Craft Ventures could still see crypto as a promising sector for portfolio diversification. Limited Scope of Divestment: The $200 million sell-off, while substantial, might not represent the entirety of Craft Ventures’ crypto-related assets. The firm might have strategically reduced exposure while maintaining investments in promising crypto funds. The Broader Implications: Political Crypto and Public Trust This news surrounding David Sacks’ political crypto dealings has broader implications for the intersection of politics and the cryptocurrency industry. It highlights the increasing scrutiny on officials with crypto ties and the need for transparency and ethical considerations. Here’s why this matters in the bigger picture: Transparency and Disclosure: The incident underscores the importance of transparent financial disclosures for public officials, especially those involved in sectors as dynamic and potentially controversial as cryptocurrency. Ethical Standards: Clear ethical guidelines are needed for officials dealing with emerging technologies like crypto to prevent conflicts of interest and maintain public trust. Regulatory Scrutiny: This case could further fuel the debate around stricter regulation of the crypto industry, particularly concerning the financial activities of individuals in positions of power and influence. Public Perception of Crypto: News like this can shape public perception of cryptocurrency, potentially reinforcing narratives of wealth and political maneuvering within the crypto space. Conclusion: Navigating the Murky Waters of Crypto and Politics David Sacks’ $200 million crypto sell-off before becoming Crypto Czar is a revealing episode that demands attention. It opens a window into the complex interplay between personal finance, political appointments, and the burgeoning cryptocurrency industry. While the motivations behind the sell-off remain speculative, the event serves as a crucial reminder of the ethical tightrope walk for individuals operating at the intersection of crypto and public service. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve and its influence expands, expect even greater scrutiny on the financial dealings of those who shape its future within the political arena.

As we look ahead to the next 100 days, three key players are in the spotlight—XRP, Solana (SOL), and the rising star Lightchain AI. While XRP and Solana have already cemented their positions as industry leaders, Lightchain AI is gaining traction as a newcomer blending blockchain technology with artificial intelligence. Lightchain AI is gaining significant attention after securing $17.7 million during its presale at only $0.007 per token . Setting itself apart from typical blockchain projects, its AI-powered advancements are making waves in the industry. Investors are watching closely to see if it can surpass major competitors like XRP and Solana in the near future. XRP – Dependable, but with Limited Upside XRP, Ripple Labs’ native cryptocurrency, is built to enable fast and low-cost international payments. Its technology, the XRP Ledger, boasts the ability to process up to 1,500 transactions per second, ensuring both scalability and efficiency. While Ripple’s partnerships with financial institutions highlight XRP's utility, the token’s market performance has been underwhelming. As of early 2025, XRP is priced at approximately $2.50, still below its peak of $3.40. Predictions for 2025 range widely, with some analysts expecting prices between $5 and $7, while others remain more reserved. Regulatory hurdles and competition within the crypto market contribute to this cautious sentiment, indicating that although XRP is a dependable asset, its near-term growth may be constrained. Solana – High Performance with Reliability Challenges Solana is a blockchain platform built for high-speed, scalable support of decentralized applications (dApps) and crypto-assets. It combines a unique Proof of History (PoH) mechanism with Proof of Stake (PoS) to deliver fast transaction speeds, making it a strong rival to platforms like Ethereum. However, the network has faced reliability issues, including a 17-hour outage in September 2021 that raised questions about its stability. Solana's native token, SOL, has also experienced extreme price swings, such as a 40% drop in November 2022 after the collapse of the FTX exchange, underscoring its vulnerability to market instability. Despite these setbacks, Solana continues to draw interest from developers and investors, signaling confidence in its long-term role within the blockchain space. Lightchain AI- Disruptive Force in Blockchain Technology While established names like XRP and Solana lead the blockchain space, Lightchain AI is emerging as a game-changer. By integrating artificial intelligence into its blockchain ecosystem, Lightchain AI is redefining what’s possible in decentralized networks. The project’s roadmap is ambitious and clear, with a Testnet Rollout in January 2025 and a Mainnet Launch by March. These milestones could mark a transformative period for the platform. Built for scalability and efficiency, Lightchain AI offers ultra-fast transactions, strong security, and a framework ready for the demands of a rapidly evolving digital economy. Investor confidence is already strong, with its presale success raising $17.7 million, reflecting belief in its long-term potential. As the blockchain landscape evolves, Lightchain AI’s innovative fusion of AI and blockchain positions it as a standout investment opportunity. While XRP and Solana remain key players, Lightchain AI’s unique approach may set it apart. For those eyeing a high-growth opportunity, Lightchain AI is one to watch in the months ahead.

The system is designed for gatekeepers, not explorers. But what if we could tear down those walls? What if science could be set free ? Over the past few years, we’ve watched decentralized science (DeSci) morph from a radical experiment into one of crypto’s most electrifying frontiers. Once dismissed as a niche idea, DeSci is now a billion-dollar movement. As of early 2025, the top DeSci tokens collectively boast a market capitalization of around $1 billion. Momentum is undeniable: Half of the top 10 projects in the space launched just last year, according to Messari. What started as a whisper is now a roar, echoing across the halls of academia, biotech labs and decentralized autonomous organizations alike. Raw energy isn’t enough. DeSci still faces formidable challenges: scalability, quality control, reproducibility and real-world adoption. It’s a vision in motion, not a finished revolution. And that’s where artificial intelligence steps in — not just as a tool but as the missing puzzle that could propel DeSci from a bold experiment to an unstoppable force. AI is already reshaping the traditional science (TradSci) landscape: sifts through massive data sets, spots hidden patterns, cracks problems that once took decades to solve, ventures into longevity research, and accelerates drug development, materials science and computational biology. Yet, for all its promise, access to AI remains tightly controlled and monopolized by a handful of corporations, elite universities and government-backed institutions. AI’s vast potential is shackled by centralization. What if these two forces — the decentralized infrastructure of DeSci and the power of AI — merged into one system? A system where science is decentralized, intelligent, autonomous and radically open? Let’s call it DeScAI. Science, but unstoppable Imagine a world where every experiment, every data set and every discovery isn’t buried in paywalled journals or trapped in proprietary vaults but flows seamlessly across a decentralized, living network. This is the vision of DeScAI, where blockchain and AI unite to build an open, intelligent and self-sustaining ecosystem. Knowledge isn’t just stored — it breathes, evolves and connects. AI curators scour vast data sets, linking research across disciplines, uncovering hidden insights and transforming isolated findings into a shared intellectual bloodstream. Recent: DeFi can help us choose the best robots for the job For too long, independent researchers have struggled to access the AI tools they need for research and massive data analysis. DeScAI could rewrite this equation by turning the world into a vast, decentralized supercomputer. Every idle processor, every surplus server and every untapped resource can contribute to a global grid where computing power is not a commodity but a shared asset. Need to map the human brain or train a biodiversity model? There is no need to beg a tech giant — just tap into the collective machine. Smart incentives ensure fairness; AI optimizes distribution; and science advances at a speed never seen before. What about funding? Today’s grant system is a labyrinth of delays, favoritism and opaque decision-making. DeScAI could replace this outdated model with a marketplace of ideas where anyone — researchers, enthusiasts even curious citizens — can directly support groundbreaking projects. No elite panels, no endless bureaucracy. AI-assisted platforms analyze proposals, suggest collaborations, and help communities vote with their resources. If an idea has merit, it gets the backing it deserves — whether from one person or 10,000. Peer review, once the bedrock of scientific integrity, has become a bottleneck. Papers languish in submission queues for months, sometimes years, subjected to a process that is as unpredictable as it is biased. DeScAI can potentially turn peer review into a dynamic, real-time process. Research is uploaded to an immutable ledger, where AI immediately verifies data integrity and flags potential conflicts of interest. Expert reviewers — who are no longer anonymous gatekeepers but active, rewarded participants — provide transparent, constructive and traceable feedback. Reputations are built on contributions, not credentials. Science becomes an ongoing conversation, not a waiting game. Perhaps the most revolutionary aspect of DeScAI is its ability to turn isolated curiosity into collective intelligence. What if an AI could help a marine biologist in Argentina and a quantum physicist in Germany stumble upon a connection neither would have made alone? What if an engineer working on renewable energy models could instantly access simulations run by climate scientists in a different hemisphere? DeScAI makes these moments of serendipity not just possible but inevitable. What about the raw material of modern science — data? Today, data is hoarded, exploited and sold without the consent of those who generate it. DeScAI shifts power back to the people. Data contributors retain ownership and are compensated when their information is used to train AI or develop new models. Blockchain solutions ensure privacy; smart contracts enforce fairness; and the age of data colonialism ends. Science should be borderless, but for too long, geography, institutions and economics have dictated who gets to participate. DeScAI erases those barriers. A young coder in Nairobi can collaborate with a neuroscientist in Seoul, not because an institution promotes it but because the infrastructure allows it. AI-driven translation tools dissolve language barriers, decentralized data sharing enables seamless collaboration, and research teams form organically around ideas, not affiliations. The resistance will be fierce Academic publishers, government agencies and corporate research labs have built their influence on exclusivity. They will not willingly embrace an open system where knowledge flows freely, research is verifiable in real-time and funding no longer depends on institutional decisions. Some projects in this space will stumble, giving critics ammunition to dismiss the movement as they may argue that decentralized oversight cannot maintain the same level of quality control, and it is unrealistic to expect cohesive governance from a patchwork of tokenholders and autonomous agents. Yet the success of DeScAI does not hinge on dismantling the existing research order outright — it hinges on demonstrating superior efficiency, fairness and innovation. Ultimately, it offers a parallel ecosystem that anyone can join, building trust through open ledgers, cryptographic proofs and AI-verified methodologies. The direction is clear: Just as DeFi forced the banking sector to acknowledge new economic models, DeScAI will force research institutions to do the same. This is not a slow evolution — it is a shift in scientific power. The old system, built on secrecy and hierarchy, collides with an emerging model of openness and decentralization. The question for those still embedded in traditional academia is whether they will adapt or be left behind as knowledge production moves into a future they can no longer control.

41704836,https://thecoinrise.com/top-5-cryptos-worth-watching-blockdag-bitcoin-chainlink-cardano-avalanche/,1742050826,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/41704836.jpeg,"Top 5 Cryptos Worth Watching: BlockDAG, Bitcoin, Chainlink, Cardano & Avalanche",https://thecoinrise.com/top-5-cryptos-worth-watching-blockdag-bitcoin-chainlink-cardano-avalanche/,"Crypto traders are always on the lookout for high-potential assets that offer strong returns and stability. Diversifying a portfolio with cryptos that showcase unique strengths is a strategy many experienced traders adopt. However, keeping up with market movements and technological advancements can be overwhelming. This list features five standout projects making waves in the crypto space—BlockDAG (BDAG), Bitcoin (BTC), Chainlink (LINK), Cardano (ADA), and Avalanche (AVAX). Each of these cryptocurrencies excels in different areas, from real-world adoption to innovative consensus models and strong community backing. Understanding their potential, limitations and long-term outlook is key for traders aiming to make informed decisions. Let’s explore why these cryptos deserve attention. BlockDAG: A Top Contender with a High-Growth Presale BlockDAG (BDAG) has quickly gained traction in the crypto space, with its scalable DAG-chain system designed to process multiple transactions simultaneously, eliminating bottlenecks. At $0.0248 per coin, its presale has skyrocketed past $202.8 million, with 18.8 billion coins sold and early holders enjoying an impressive 2,380% ROI. One of BDAG’s most anticipated milestones is its 2025 mainnet launch, confirmed in a recent AMA session. This, combined with strong trading enthusiasm, cements its status as one of the best-performing crypto coins. BlockDAG’s focus on scalability and efficiency makes it particularly attractive to traders looking for future-ready blockchain solutions. By prioritizing real-world adoption and fostering a strong community, BDAG is setting the stage for long-term success. As the presale continues to gain momentum, crypto enthusiasts are taking notice of its potential to redefine blockchain scalability. Bitcoin (BTC): The Market’s Benchmark Asset Bitcoin (BTC), currently trading around $92,432, remains the most recognized digital currency, often setting the tone for the entire crypto market. When BTC surges, the broader market typically follows, presenting opportunities for traders. However, when BTC declines, its influence can trigger broader corrections, making it a crucial asset to watch. Despite market fluctuations, Bitcoin’s decade-long dominance and widespread adoption make it one of the best-performing crypto assets. Its scarcity and decentralized nature continue to solidify its status as a long-term store of value, often compared to digital gold. Traders and institutional investors alike trust BTC’s stability, reinforcing its role as the backbone of the crypto ecosystem. Chainlink (LINK): Powering Blockchain with Real-World Data Chainlink (LINK), currently trading at $17.21, has carved out a critical role in blockchain technology by bridging real-world data with decentralized networks through its decentralized oracle system. This unique function has attracted major institutional interest, including a notable partnership with Swift, signaling Chainlink’s potential to connect traditional finance with blockchain technology. Despite its success, some critics point to transparency concerns, particularly regarding the concentration of LINK holdings among developers. However, its strong community support and real-world utility make it one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies. As real-time data integration becomes increasingly vital, Chainlink’s role in expanding blockchain adoption across industries could be a game-changer for decentralized ecosystems. Cardano (ADA): A Research-Driven Blockchain for Builders Cardano (ADA), currently trading at $0.9391, is known for its scientific, peer-reviewed approach to blockchain development. Designed to host decentralized applications (dApps) and NFTs, Cardano emphasizes security, scalability, and low fees, making it an attractive choice for developers and long-term traders. A key advantage is its meticulously researched upgrade process, ensuring a strong and reliable foundation. However, some critics argue that Cardano’s development speed lags behind competitors, impacting its mainstream adoption. Despite this, ADA remains one of the best-performing crypto assets, appealing to those who prioritize stability, innovation, and academic rigor. As blockchain adoption grows, Cardano’s methodical approach may prove invaluable in shaping the industry’s future. Avalanche (AVAX): A Deflationary Blockchain Powerhouse Avalanche (AVAX), currently trading at $22.25, has established itself as a high-speed blockchain platform supporting DeFi applications and NFTs. One of its standout features is EVM compatibility, enabling projects to transition from Ethereum with ease. Additionally, its deflationary model, which burns transaction fees, attracts traders seeking assets with built-in scarcity mechanisms. Speed is a major strength, as Avalanche processes transactions rapidly, offering a seamless user experience. However, AVAX faces stiff competition from well-established networks, making market positioning crucial. Despite this, Avalanche remains one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies, especially for traders who value cross-chain functionality and efficient transactions. Enthusiasts remain bullish on its future developments and growing ecosystem. Choosing the Right Crypto: What Sets Them Apart? Each crypto on this list holds a distinct advantage. Bitcoin (BTC) remains the go-to for those seeking a time-tested store of value, while Chainlink (LINK) attracts developers needing real-time data solutions. Cardano (ADA) wins over traders who value a research-backed approach, and Avalanche (AVAX) impresses with fast, low-cost transactions. However, BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out as the most well-rounded option. With scalability, strong community backing, and a clear 2025 mainnet launch, BDAG offers a compelling mix of innovation and growth potential. Its $202.8 million presale success and 2,380% ROI for early adopters signal strong momentum. For those looking to secure early entry, now is the time to act.

Yet quietly, beneath the surface, BitLemons ($BLEM) is making strides with a compelling business model that’s catching the attention of smart investors. With a functional crypto casino already generating revenue, strategic partnerships in the works, and a million-dollar giveaway attracting investors, BitLemons might be the best-kept secret in crypto. Could BitLemons ($BLEM) Become Crypto’s Next Big Thing? BitLemons is not your typical token—it’s directly tied to a fully operational crypto casino disrupting the colossal $450 billion traditional gambling market. What sets BLEM apart is its clever “GambleFI” model, uniquely designed to maximize profits and reward token holders. BitLemons already hosts over 8000 games from top-tier providers like Evolution and Pragmatic Play, plus exclusive games that cut out third-party fees, maximizing margins. With Stage 1 completely sold out, Stage 2 at 97.36%, and just 862,740 BLEM remaining at a tantalizing $0.02 per token before the price hikes to $0.03, savvy investors are snapping the remaining tokens. The imminent transition to Stage 3 is just days away, meaning early adopters are perfectly positioned to reap substantial rewards. Excitement around BitLemons is surging, partly fueled by rumors of strategic celebrity partnerships. Imagine a viral tweet or endorsement from a major sports icon sparking a frenzy—this isn’t just speculation; conversations with top-tier influencers are happening right now. Coupled with a robust community growing rapidly, BitLemons is building more than a casino—an empire. TRUMP: Game Changer or Regulatory Risk? TRUMP exploded onto the scene with a jaw-dropping market cap exceeding $27 billion within its first 24 hours, propelled mainly by speculative hype around former President Donald Trump. Yet, the euphoria quickly gave way to severe criticism. Crypto leaders warn that the coin’s ties to Trump himself pose conflicts of interest, drawing regulatory eyes and investor skepticism. Whales have seized on volatility: recently, one prominent whale purchased nearly 778,000 TRUMP tokens for over $11 million, sparking significant short-term price spikes. But beneath the flashy trades lies the risk of regulatory crackdowns and potential losses for retail investors. While $TRUMP offers high volatility and speculative opportunities, investors should watch key psychological levels and political news developments carefully. DOGE: Whales Dive Back In, But Is It Enough? Due to increased whale activity, Dogecoin, the meme coin heavyweight, remains an intriguing pick. Recent transactions show whales dramatically stepping up, fueling speculation of an imminent rally. Large transactions surged by over 41% within 24 hours, signaling renewed confidence or speculative interest. However, despite DOGE’s recent highs around $0.48 and subsequent pullback to levels around $0.16, caution prevails. Whales seem ready for another run, but investors should monitor broader market sentiment closely.

33767162,[object Object],1742050843,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Reserve War: Congressman Fights Trump’s Crypto Plans,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-reserve-war-congressman-fights-trumps-crypto-plans/,"A Democrat lawmaker has opposed US President Donald Trump’s plan to increase the government’s Bitcoin holdings by creating a strategic reserve. House Rep. Gerald E. Connolly of Virginia urged the US Department of the Treasury to halt the proposed Bitcoin reserve , suggesting that Trump has a conflict of interest in pushing for it. Lawmaker: Stop BTC Reserve Connolly wrote a letter to US Department of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urging the Secretary to “cease all attempts” that push for the establishment of a strategic Bitcoin reserve, claiming that it will only enrich Trump and his allies. “The creation of a strategic cryptocurrency reserve is poised to enrich the President and his closest allies at the expense of American taxpayers,” Connolly said. “I urge you to cease all plans to create a strategic cryptocurrency reserve.” The Virginia lawmaker criticized the cryptocurrency proposal because only Trump and his donors will benefit from it. Rep. Connolly urges U.S. Treasury to scrap plans for strategic crypto reserve Virginia Rep. Gerry Connolly sent a letter to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on March 13, urging the department to halt plans for establishing a strategic crypto reserve. According to a press… — CoinNess Global (@CoinnessGL) March 14, 2025 Major Crypto Holders Connolly said that Trump, his family, and his closest allies are owners of cryptocurrencies, citing that the President’s family owned The Trump Organization, which maintains “significant ownership in World Liberty Financial.” The lawmaker described it as a cryptocurrency venture that “aspires to be a sort of digital asset bank, where customers will be encouraged to borrow, lend and invest in digital coins” with even the President claiming World Liberty Financial as “the future of finance.” He added that the President’s sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., have advocated several cryptocurrencies, pointing out the connection between the Trump family and cryptocurrencies. The Democrat legislator mentioned that the American President even introduced a new meme coin in January called TRUMP , saying, “Entities related to President Trump have reportedly made as much as $100 million in trading fees alone for this venture, which has been called his “most lucrative get-rich scheme yet.” He noted that a crypto strategic reserve has “no discernible benefit to the American people.” Unsound Fiscal Policy? Connolly argued that the Bitcoin reserve is an “unsound fiscal policy” because the selection of winning currencies will be done through social media, adding that it will only waste “taxpayer dollars on a plan that one federal reserve official described as ‘the dumbest idea’ ever.” “The United States has historically, through acts of Congress, created reserves of certain commodities of strategic value, such as petroleum, particularly during times of economic crisis. However, no strategic need has arisen that would necessitate investment in the volatile and speculative cryptocurrency market,” the lawmaker said. He described the Bitcoin reserve as “nothing more than a highly speculative taxpayer-backed hedge,” saying that if crypto crashes, “the State will deploy this fund to rescue it.” Featured image from The Independent, chart from TradingView",Bitcoin|bitcoin|btc|Cryptocurrency|Donald Trump|Strategic Reserve,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|RUNE|FDUSD,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-03-15 15:00:43

Zhang stated that the momentum of memecoins has decreased due to their lack of solid foundations. Zhang explained that community-driven discourse initially provided a more accessible entry point for investors, but the sustainability of these assets remains questionable. “From the end of the first quarter, people’s interest in venture-backed tokens began to wane, while the popularity of memecoins increased, leading to the so-called memecoin craze,” he said. Platforms like Pump.fun and similar initiatives have reshaped early-stage altcoin investing by making it more accessible, transparent, and community-focused. These platforms focus primarily on memecoins, experimental tokens, and community-driven projects, allowing nearly anyone to launch and trade new crypto assets. Related News: Head of Research Company Talks About Bitcoin's Performance in the Coming Days: Bearish or Bullish? But Zhang noted that this trend has started to reverse in recent months. Despite the easy accessibility of memecoins, their short-lived popularity has led investors to refocus on altcoins backed by venture capital. “According to CoinMarketCap data, this trend is now slowing down. The ratio of memecoin market cap to non-memecoin altcoin market cap is decreasing, indicating that funds are gradually flowing back into non-memecoin coins,” he said. He noted that fundamental value is important in sustaining any asset. “For any asset to have enduring or increasing value, it requires one or more core services, businesses, products, technologies or new innovations that will drive price increases. Without fundamentals, value cannot be maintained,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

According to data from Token Terminal, XRP’s FDV has now surpassed $240 billion, taking it above ETH’s $231 billion. This metric measures the value of a project’s total token supply, including the tokens not yet in circulation. While it is not a significant metric, it can show a crypto project’s potential value when all the tokens are circulated. Ripple XRP FDV is now higher than that of Ethereum. Source: Token Terminal The rise in XRP’s FDV above ETH is unsurprising, given that Ripple has a far higher supply than ETH. Per CoinMarketCap data, Ripple has a maximum token supply of 100 billion. However, Ethereum does not have a maximum supply as the network issues tokens as staking rewards, but its current total supply is 120.61 million ETH. Despite XRP’s higher FDV, ETH’s market cap is still almost twice that of XRP. CoinMarketCap data shows that ETH has a market cap of $232.93 billion, far ahead of XRP’s $141 billion. XRP’s higher FDV is a sign of positive momentum While the FDV is not the top metric for determining a project’s value, it shows the contrast between XRP and Ethereum’s performance in recent months. Ripple has been on a rollercoaster, gaining 300% after Donald Trump’s win to reach its peak price in January. Although XRP is down from its peak to around $2.428, it continues to perform well even during a generally rough season for the crypto industry. It is the only major cap token that has seen gains on a year-to-date basis, with a 5% increase in its value since the start of the year. By contrast, Bitcoin is down 10.64%, ETH has fallen 42%, Solana dropped 30%, BNB fell 15%, and ADA declined 18%, while DOGE and TRX shed 45% and 12%, respectively. Bollinger Bands creator John Bollinger observed XRP performance. He said: “Of all the major crypto vehicles Ripple resisted the recent singing of the Siren’s song best. Will it become the new leader?” Meanwhile, Ripple’s positive momentum looks set to continue. Besides being included among the cryptos to form the United States crypto strategic reserve, Ripple has been enjoying regulatory approval. Dubai Financial Services Authority recently approved the company’s application to provide crypto payments and services, and several institutions have applied to launch an XRP exchange-traded fund. There are reports that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could soon drop the long-running enforcement action against Ripple. According to the reports, the SEC is discussing considering XRP a commodity. The SEC has already dropped several enforcement actions against other crypto companies, including Uniswap and Coinbase, and doing the same for XRP could cause a massive surge in the token value. Ethereum continues to struggle as its price remains stuck below $2k Meanwhile, it has been the opposite tale for ETH, which has been struggling for months. While there is no clear reason behind ETH price challenges, the leadership crisis within the Ethereum ecosystem and the theft of over $1.4 billion in ETH from Bybit have all contributed to its decline. However, there have also been massive selloffs, with CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju , noting that there has been record active selling over the past three months. The token is now stuck below $2,000, a level it has not reached since November 2023. It is down 42.49% year to date, and not even the recent gains have had much impact on lifting its price. With its poor performance, community sentiment around ETH has also reached its lowest level in almost a year with the crowd becoming extremely bearish since the token fell below $2k.

Specifically, as of March 12, 2025, the number of XRP addresses reached a record 6,870,945, according to data from cryptocurrency analytics platform Glassnode , as shared by Ali Martinez on March 14. Since early February, XRP addresses have grown steadily, with the sharpest increase occurring between late last month and early March, coinciding with the asset’s heightened price volatility. XRP number of addresses. Source: Glassnode/ Ali_charts Despite network expansion, XRP’s price has fluctuated, aligning with market sentiment, and maintained support above the crucial $2 level. The increase in new addresses aligns with XRP’s recent attempts to reclaim the $3 mark, suggesting growing investor engagement, a potential bullish signal. AI predicts XRP price for end of 2025 To assess XRP’s price trajectory in line with the new onchain milestone, Finbold consulted OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4o . The AI model predicted that XRP could trade between $3.50 and $5 by year-end, with a potential breakout above $6 under favorable conditions. ChatGPT noted that rising active addresses historically correlate with price growth. A strong crypto market rally, particularly in Bitcoin ( BTC ), or a favorable outcome in Ripple’s and Securities Exchnage Commission’s ( SEC ) case could further boost XRP’s price. The AI platform noted that key resistance at $3 and $3.80 must be overcome for sustained gains. However, regulatory setbacks or a broader market downturn could cap prices between $2.50 and $3. XRP AI price prediction. Source: ChatGPT On the other hand, Finbold’s in-house AI tool, which leverages several models, projected an average price of $2.25 for XRP by the end of 2025. For instance, Claude 3.5 Sonnet forecasted a surge to $3.85 by December 31, 2025, citing bullish momentum, technical indicators, and expected interest rate cuts boosting institutional adoption. Conversely, Gemini 1.5 Flash 002 presented a bearish scenario, predicting a decline to $0.65 due to economic uncertainty and market volatility. Finbold AI XRP price prediction. Source: Finbold XRP technical outlook When looking at the technical aspect in the short term, Martinez cautioned that XRP may undergo a price correction, potentially presenting a buying opportunity. On March 15, he noted that XRP’s TD Sequential indicator flashed a sell signal on the four-hour chart, suggesting a temporary pullback before a potential rebound. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/Ali_charts Based on this outlook, XRP’s key support levels to watch are $2.30 and $2.20, where buyers may step in. Despite this, XRP remains in an uptrend, with traders eyeing a buy-the-dip opportunity. Adding to potential volatility, Ripple is set to release $465 million worth of XRP in March from its reserve, a transaction that could introduce news price swings. Elsewhere, pseudonymous crypto analyst Egrag Crypto outlined three potential scenarios for XRP. The expert noted that if the token closes above $2.83, it could signal bullish strength, potentially pushing toward $4.20. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Holding above key resistance levels at $2.40, $2.97, and $3.07 could further reinforce an uptrend. However, the analyst noted that a drop below these levels might trigger a decline toward the Fib 0.786 level, possibly forming a bear trap, especially if Bitcoin retests $70,000. Egrag Crypto sees a deeper drop as a generational buying opportunity rather than a bear market signal. Overall, XRP is following a short-term bullish trajectory, aligning with the broader cryptocurrency market recovery. At the time of reporting, the token was trading at $2.43, up over 4% in the last 24 hours and nearly 3% for the week. In the long term, XRP’s potential hinges on key fundamentals, including a possible resolution of Ripple’s SEC case. Reports suggest the regulator might seek to conclude the matter soon, especially given the current crypto-friendly regulatory environment.

However, not all crypto tokens are worth holding, and investors should focus on the best one to benefit from amid these changing market sentiments. As a result, investors must consider some poor performance and controversy-filled altcoins to sell before March ends. Top 5 Altcoins to Sell Before March Ends The unpredictability of the market isn’t new to investors. At the beginning of the year, Bitcoin’s price reached the ATH of $109.1k, but the same is struggling today at $84k. Its impacts on the rest of the crypto tokens are far more noticeable, with a few with weeks-long downtrends and others with sharp crashes. This blog lists the top 5 altcoins to sell for these reasons, but investors must do their own research before jumping to conclusions. 1. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu became popular during the 2021 bull run, riding the meme coins wave alongside Dogecoin. However, from the last four years, the trajectory has not been entirely bullish. It trades at $0.00001279 and is 85% away from its peak of $0.00008845, revealing its long-term downtrend. In addition, this also shows that the investors’ interest is waning despite its earlier popularity, making it among the top cryptos to sell this month. 2. Hamster Coin (HMSTR) HMSTR token is the native token of the telegram mini-game Hamster Kombat, but that popularity could not help it gain significant bullish momentum. Since its launch in 2024, this token has been continuously struggling, currently trading at $0.002141 with a nearly 80% decline from its prime. The long-term bearish trajectory makes it among the altcoins that are suggested to sell. 3. Official Trump Coin (TRUMP) U.S. President Donald Trump launched TRUMP as his official meme coin. It gained a big rally right after launch, but that was not sustained, and it currently trades at $12.03, 84% from its prime. More importantly, investors are concerned about insider trading. On the other hand, the idea of a U.S. President launching a volatile asset is not acceptable to everyone. More importantly, as David Sacks has sold his crypto holding , pressure might build on Trump to abandon its project, making it risky and putting it on the list of altcoins to sell. 4. FTX Coin (FTT) FTT has struggled to recover after the FTX exchange’s collapse. But things did not turn in its favor even with the FTX’s redistribution plan. Even years after the incident, the crypto community has not forgotten the event, and the exchange’s reputation is ruined. As a result, it is at 100% loss from its top, currently trading at $0.00006299. With further token distribution, more volatility will likely hit this crypto, so investors must consider selling. 5. Hyperliquid (HYPE) HYPE has been trending in the market due to its high demand. However, that all changed with the Ethereum whale liquidity incident, which left the platform with a $4M loss and exposed its vulnerabilities. With more whales leveraging the platform, the selling pressure on the token is high. It currently trades at $14.65, with a 40% decline over the month amid the crypto market crash and its controversies. Bottom Line Bitcoin is the biggest crypto of the market, but the remaining digital assets (altcoins) also have high-reward potential. Experts believe a diversified portfolio is the best trading approach, but not all are worth holding, especially in the ongoing volatile market. As a result, investors must consider Hamster Kombat, Shiba Inu, the Official Trump Coin, Terra Classic, Hyperliquid, and a few altcoins to sell before March ends. At the same time, they can consider Bitcoin, XRP, Solana, and a few other cryptos to buy.

However, US stock investors woke up to a surprising weekend, with over $1.3 trillion added to the market within a single day. Analysts speculate this could be an indication of funds flowing back into the crypto space soon as well. Despite the market fluctuations, some projects have seen a steady flow of funds, as well as rising interest in recent days. Naturally, these projects remain top contenders for the best crypto spot right now. Below is a list of such projects that could be worth checking out for gains in the future. Best Crypto to Buy Now As Indicators Show Potential Price Recovery BTC Bull Bitcoin has historically been the market’s driving force as a frontrunner crypto, dictating sentiment and influencing the direction of countless altcoins. BTC Bull embraces this connection, creating a meme coin that thrives alongside BTC’s price action. But it’s not just another BTC-inspired token—this one comes with a structure designed to reward long-term holders as Bitcoin continues its climb. With over $3.6 million raised, BTC Bull has been attracting investors who see the potential in a token that moves in sync with the biggest crypto asset. As Bitcoin edges closer to another breakout, historical trends suggest that tokens tied to BTC’s movement could see amplified gains. BTC Bull enhances this with built-in token burns and reward mechanisms that trigger at key price milestones, ensuring scarcity while keeping the community engaged. The project was featured on various crypto publication websites and YouTube channels like 99Bitcoins and Cilinix Crypto . ClayBro , a popular crypto YouTuber, also praised its potential and dubbed it one worth watching out for. Bitcoin’s influence over the market has never been in question, and BTC Bull offers an interactive way to participate in BTC’s long-term trajectory without just holding BTC itself. Whether as a speculative bet or a longer-term play on Bitcoin’s growth, BTC Bull aligns with Bitcoin’s future without being weighed down by its high entry cost. MIND of Pepe Crypto moves fast, and so does information. In a space where a single tweet can send prices soaring or crashing, MIND of Pepe is turning social sentiment into something actionable. This isn’t just another meme coin riding on a viral image—it’s powered by AI, scanning social media trends, engagement levels, and investor sentiment in real-time. The concept is simple but powerful: traders and investors often make decisions based on social sentiment, but by the time they react, it’s usually too late. MIND of Pepe aims to close this gap, offering a built-in intelligence layer that tracks discussions, monitors hype cycles, and provides insights that could be crucial for catching market shifts before they happen. While meme tokens generally rely on speculation, this project adds a utility layer that gives it staying power. Investors looking for a token that isn’t just about the hype but also has real-time, AI-driven value in the trading space might find MIND of Pepe to be one of the more intriguing plays right now. With social sentiment playing an ever-growing role in crypto movements, this project is tapping into a unique niche that bridges speculation and data-driven decision-making—a combination that could make it one of the most talked-about meme tokens in the near future. Solaxy High transaction fees and slow processing times have been a headache for crypto users for years. While individual blockchains work on scaling solutions, Solaxy takes a multi-chain approach, enhancing both Ethereum and Solana with its Layer 2 technology that reduces congestion and lowers costs. This approach is gaining traction fast because it means users don’t have to choose between ecosystems—Solaxy bridges them, allowing for seamless asset transfers while making transactions faster and cheaper. As more investors look for efficient ways to interact with multiple blockchains, solutions like Solaxy become even more valuable. But speed isn’t its only advantage. Staking is another key feature, giving holders the opportunity to earn rewards while supporting the network. Instead of just holding tokens and waiting for price movements, investors can put their assets to work while benefiting from a growing Layer 2 ecosystem. yesss getting in on this early — Johurul (@Johurul62) March 14, 2025 The social media presence of the project is just as vibrant and active as its website design—something that many investors have been visibly appreciative of. Scalability is one of the most important factors for blockchain adoption, and projects that solve these issues tend to see long-term success. With multi-chain support, staking incentives, and a focus on improving transaction efficiency, Solaxy is shaping up to be one of the more promising Layer 2 solutions on the market right now. Best Wallet For years, crypto wallets have done one thing—store assets. But as the market grows, investors need more than just a place to hold tokens; they need a tool that enhances trading, security, and accessibility. Best Wallet delivers exactly that, making it an all-in-one ecosystem rather than just another wallet. With support for over 60 blockchains, Best Wallet allows users to manage assets seamlessly across multiple networks. But what really sets it apart is access to a decentralized exchange (DEX), staking options, and presale aggregator, making it a hub for traders and investors alike. Instead of switching between multiple apps to trade, stake, or track holdings, everything can be done within one streamlined interface. Security is a non-negotiable priority in crypto, and Best Wallet addresses this with private key ownership, encrypted transactions, and audited smart contracts, ensuring that users remain in full control of their funds. The presale has been a massive success, raising over $11 million, which signals strong confidence in its potential. As crypto adoption increases, the demand for wallets that offer both security and functionality will only grow. Best Wallet is one of the few that truly integrates all essential features into a single platform, making it an investment worth considering. Movement Some projects focus on trading, while others prioritize staking or governance. Movement, however, is designed to integrate multiple aspects of the crypto space into one evolving ecosystem, making it more than just a single-purpose token. What makes Movement interesting is its modular approach—rather than sticking to a fixed set of features, it aims to expand and integrate new utilities over time, adapting to shifts in market demand. Whether it's staking, cross-chain transfers, or DeFi applications, the project is structured to evolve based on user needs rather than remaining static like many other tokens. With the crypto market constantly changing, investors are often looking for projects that don’t lock themselves into a single niche. Movement positions itself as a token that can adjust and grow alongside the industry, ensuring its relevance even as trends shift. The MOVE token is currently priced at around $0.455, with huge room for growth throughout the bull run. Many early-stage projects promise innovation but fail to follow through, yet Movement is actively building a framework that allows it to pivot and integrate new technologies. As interest grows, the project could develop into a multi-use crypto asset, appealing to both long-term holders and active traders. With its adaptable nature, Movement may not just be a crypto investment—it could be an ongoing opportunity in a rapidly evolving industry. Meme Index Meme coins are known for their unpredictability—prices can skyrocket overnight or crash just as fast. But what if there was a way to invest in meme tokens without constantly guessing which one will take off next? That’s exactly what Meme Index offers—a way to gain diversified exposure to the meme coin market through a structured index fund model. Instead of betting on a single meme token, investors can allocate funds into four different index categories, each tailored to different risk levels. This allows for balanced exposure rather than the all-or-nothing approach that often defines meme coin investing. The idea of applying traditional investment strategies to a high-volatility sector is what makes Meme Index different. While other projects rely on community hype alone, this one introduces a systematic approach that gives investors a way to navigate the space with more control and strategic risk management. As meme coins continue gaining popularity, projects that offer structured, diversified investment options could attract more users looking for exposure without excessive risk. Meme Index is setting itself up as one of the few projects offering a long-term framework for navigating the meme coin sector, making it an interesting choice for investors looking beyond short-term hype. Conclusion Often, investors end up losing out on major profits simply by not parking funds into projects with potential at the right time. The market correction that happened recently could be one of the best phases to accumulate tokens—good examples of which are already mentioned above. As long as the investor is careful about the amount they invest and diversifies strategically, it could be an excellent way to make good returns in the coming weeks or months.

He argues that the distinction between Bitcoin and altcoins is artificial, pointing to Bitcoin forks like Bitcoin Cash. Jesse Myers boldly asserted that the altcoin season is “permanently cancelled.” Crypto Lawyer, Bill Morgan, is now fighting claims from Bitcoin Advocate Jesse Myer that “altseason” has been cancelled. The debate ignited when Myer shared a chart on X illustrating the rapid growth of altcoins since 2021. He argued that the sheer volume of tokens – over 36 million – had diluted their collective market strength, leaving Bitcoin as the dominant cryptocurrency. What’s Myer’s Argument for Bitcoin Dominance? “With 36,000,000+ altcoins, altseason has been permanently cancelled,” Myers wrote. He further argued that Bitcoin’s digital scarcity, network effects, and a so-called “Crypto Catch-22” mean it will remain unchallenged in the long run. Myers explains Crypto Catch-22 as a paradox that many altcoins face.

The recent market movements contradict common predictions during periods of extreme fear or greed. Data analysis from Santiment reveals that social media reached peak negativity when Bitcoin ( BTC ) dipped to $78,000 earlier in the week. There was also online chatter about further declines. This pattern mirrors late February’s market behavior when a temporary price surge in early March followed retail traders’ bearish outlook. https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1900700480034271434 “Bitcoin’s rally back to $84.5K Friday shows what happens when the Monday crowd claims it’s time to sell,” Santiment noted. “Predictably, FUD hit its peak as $BTC was down to $78K, with predictions pouring in for lower prices all across social media.” The research highlights Bitcoin’s recent stability within a defined range, having neither fallen below $70,000 nor broken above $100,000 over the past month. This stability creates clear sentiment markers: predictions below $70,000 means excessive fear, while forecasts above $100,000 signal overexuberance.

They noted that clusters of bearish predictions ($10K-$69K) often follow upward reversals, while groupings of bullish forecasts ($100K-$159K) usually signal downturns. Technical analysis supports this sentiment-based approach. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital pointed out that “the signs for a weakening resistance were there.” He noted that the recent price movement is filling the CME gap between $82,245 and approximately $87,000. He suggests that a daily close above resistance could catalyze further upward momentum. #BTC This recent move from Bitcoin means that price is increasingly filling the CME Gap located between $82245 and ~$87000 $BTC #Crypto #Bitcoin https://t.co/qpHzlYaNkL pic.twitter.com/xq3cBVHqOF — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) March 14, 2025 The current market structure also presents potentially bullish technical signals.

Analysts and traders have closely monitored the asset’s price action. According to prominent chartist, Ali, recent developments indicate that ADA is gearing up for a notable 15% move. The Technical Setup ADA has been trading within a symmetrical triangle pattern, a formation that typically precedes a breakout in either direction. This pattern is characterized by converging trendlines, signaling decreasing volatility as the asset prepares for a bullish move. ADA is attempting to break through the upper limit of the triangle, a key resistance level that must be overcome for further growth. If bulls push the price above this zone with strong volume confirmation, the breakout could trigger a rapid 15% rally. On the flip side, a failure to break above resistance could lead to a retest of lower support levels before another attempt at an upward push. #Cardano $ADA is about to break free! Busting out of this triangle will trigger a 15% price move. pic.twitter.com/HrKEdaA96Q — Ali (@ali_charts) March 14, 2025 Market Sentiment and Fundamental Catalysts Beyond technical factors, Cardano’s fundamentals are also contributing to a potential price surge. The network has witnessed increased development activity, with upgrades and new projects reinforcing its long-term value proposition. One of the key drivers behind ADA’s bullish sentiment is the growing adoption of Cardano-based decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. The network’s scalability and efficiency improvements, including Hydra layer-2 solutions, have enhanced its competitiveness in the blockchain space. Furthermore, Cardano’s ecosystem continues to expand, with rising total value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols. This reflects growing investor confidence and the increased utility of the ADA token. As the network attracts more users, the demand for ADA rises, creating upward pressure that could propel the anticipated breakout. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Broader Market Conditions and ADA’s Correlation Cardano’s price is also subject to the fluctuations of the overall cryptocurrency market, making it vulnerable to broader market trends and sentiment. Bitcoin’s price movements continue to exert significant influence, as altcoins like ADA tend to mirror Bitcoin’s trends during periods of strong upward or downward momentum. If Bitcoin sustains its upward trajectory, ADA’s breakout chances increase significantly. Macroeconomic factors like Federal policies, inflation, and risk appetite impact crypto markets. A positive economic backdrop could further fuel ADA’s potential 15% rally. A Defining Moment for Cardano (ADA) Cardano has reached a critical juncture, as technical and fundamental signals converge to suggest a potential price breakout . If ADA successfully breaches the upper boundary of the symmetrical triangle with robust volume, a 15% rally could materialize in the short term. However, traders should remain cautious of potential fakeouts and monitor Bitcoin’s performance for confirmation. Cardano’s bullish outlook is supported by growing adoption, ongoing upgrades, and improving market sentiment. As the crypto market watches closely, ADA could be on the brink of a key price movement that reaffirms its strength in the ever-evolving blockchain landscape.

Since the beginning of February 2024, TRX has been moving within a parallel channel pattern between $0.22 and $0.25. TRX Current Price Momentum However, TRX is currently trading near $0.223 and has remained stable over the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume dropped by 15%, indicating that traders and investors are more hesitant to participate compared to the previous day. Traders Over-Leveraged Positions Data from the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass revealed that traders are currently over-leveraged at $0.2167 on the lower side, believing that the asset price won’t fall below this level. They currently hold $4.30 million worth of long positions. Meanwhile, $0.2257 is another over-leveraged level, where traders betting on the bearish side hold $2 million worth of short positions, believing that the price won’t exceed the $0.2257 level.

Tron (TRX) Price Action and Upcoming Levels Amid the recent market uncertainty, the asset has reached the lower level of the channel pattern and appears to be consolidating. According to expert technical analysis, TRX is poised for an upside rally, but the rally will begin only once the asset breaks out of consolidation. Based on recent price action and historical momentum, if the asset breaks out of consolidation and closes a daily candle above the $0.225 level, there is a strong possibility it could surge by 11% to reach $0.25 in the coming days.

With the current price sitting at approximately $1,939, experts say another fall below $1,900 can trigger a significant market reaction. Robust Demand Zone Below $1,900 On-chain metrics show that one of the main support zones is between $1,848 and $1,905, where roughly 4.3 million ETH have been purchased previously, according to IntoTheBlock senior research analyst Juan Pellicer. “Traditionally, this region has provided excellent support. If ETH dips below this level, capitulation danger is greater due to tighter demand below this region,” Capitulation is panic selling in bulk, which can be a precipitous price drop prior to a potential recovery in the market. Whale Accumulation Could Be Preventing Further Declines There are risks to the downside, but analysts believe that growing whale accumulation could prevent Ether from going much lower. According to Nicolai Sondergaard, an Nansen analyst, large investors have been collectively adding to their holdings. “It does seem likely that if ETH is unable to hold the $1,900 level, we’d see further downside,” Sondergaard said. “However, whales have been accumulating, and WLFI also holds substantial ETH, making further declines less certain.” Glassnode market information substantiates this perception, as the number of Ethereum whale accounts with 1,000 ETH or more ($1.92 million) increased over 4% in 2025. Such accounts moved up from 4,652 on Jan. 1 to over 4,843 on March 14. Market Uncertainty and Institutional Positions Up-to-date options data shows institutional participants are preparing for volatility in both directions, as well as uncertainty regarding the direction of ETH’s price. The analysts are still divided on whether Ether will see a steep rebound or additional corrections.

As Cardano eyes $10 in 2025, insiders predict SUI and Rexas Finance could hit double digits much sooner amid market shifts. Table of Contents Cardano’s slow and steady ascent Sui: The next-generation blockchain Rexas Finance: A hidden gem at $0.20 Final thoughts As the cryptocurrency market shifts in anticipation of the next bull run, one burning question is whether established projects like Cardano (ADA) will finally breach the elusive two-digit price barrier in 2025. While investor sentiment toward Cardano is highly optimistic, particularly because of its solid progress and impressive blockchain infrastructure, many market insiders seem to think otherwise. These insiders believe that two other projects: SUI and an Ethreum-based token currently valued at just $0.20, Rexas Finance (RXS) may reach this goal much sooner. What is more intriguing is that some experts claim these tokens may reach double-digit value months before Cardano makes even a single significant move upward. You might also like: Rexas Finance price prediction: Can RXS deliver on its presale hype? Cardano’s slow and steady ascent Cardano trades at $0.71 as of this writing. It has a market cap of $25.2 billion. ADA’s remarkable market capitalization results from its consistent growth and great community support; nevertheless, that success suggests a limited window for rapid percentage increases. For Cardano, reaching a two-digit price could be a reasonable long-term target. Still, considering its present value and ecosystem maturity, the expansion rate will probably be slower than that of more recent initiatives. Sui: The next-generation blockchain Sui (SUI), on the other hand, offers a next-generation blockchain platform meant to solve the scalability and efficiency problems afflicting previous networks. Its creative design allows it to manage thousands of transactions per second while maintaining cheap fees — a crucial component for enabling decentralized apps and DeFi systems in a rapidly expanding market under development. Early signs suggest that SUI’s technology is strong and appealing to developers and institutional investors seeking scalable solutions. The market’s general attitude toward SUI is growingly favorable, and many analysts think that its technological features will enable it to increase in value significantly. If SUI can keep developing creative ideas and growing its ecosystem, the token will likely have a two-digit value before Cardano does. In this situation, SUI’s explosive expansion could give investors an early access point into the next significant bull run and possible returns well above those of more established blockchains. Rexas Finance: A hidden gem at $0.20 Rexas Finance, a rising coin rapidly attracting interest for its unique blockchain development approach, presents the most interesting prospect. At $0.20 during its last presale, Rexas Finance provides one of the lowest starting points. Built on the Ethereum network, RXS is meant to democratize blockchain technology through its extensive ecosystem. Using an easy Token Builder, Rexas Finance lets users design bespoke tokens without any advanced technical knowledge needed. While the QuickMint Bot speeds token distribution to guarantee that innovations hit the market quickly, its integrated Launchpad simplifies the funding process for new ventures. These instruments are used together to reduce the obstacles to blockchain acceptance, creating an atmosphere where utility and creativity can flourish. Rexas Finance stands out by emphasizing Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization. RXS closes the distance between conventional banking and distributed technology by turning real estate, goods, and financial instruments into digital tokens. This capacity to open access to a multi-trillion-dollar industry gives Rexas Finance great real-world value — a quality distinguishing it from many speculative tokens. In its last presale stage, which is already 90.73% filled, RXS has already raised over $46.7 million and sold over 453.6 million tokens, proving tremendous market demand and excellent investor confidence. Furthermore, Rexas Finance is already shown on important tracking systems such as CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, which improves its profile and facilitates investors’ tracking of its performance. With an official launch set for June 19, 2025, at a listing price of $0.25, investing in RXS at $0.20 offers a rare opportunity to get in early before the token experiences general market adoption. Final thoughts The crypto market is set for a transforming bull run in 2025. Cardano is still a robust, well-known asset with consistent increases, but its maturity could limit its capacity to provide explosive, percentage-based profits. On the other hand, newly started initiatives like SUI and Rexas Finance offer early investors the chance to earn exponential profits. The decision is obvious for people ready to accept a measured risk in search of greater benefits. By reaching major benchmarks far before ADA’s expected breakthrough, Rexas Finance — with its ultra-low entry fee, creative ecosystem, and pioneering focus on real-world asset tokenization — is poised to outperform Cardano. SUI and RXS are the tokens to keep an eye on as investors hoping to get a front-row view of the next wave of the crypto race.

However, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation became a global issue. Once-stable economies with historically low inflation were suddenly grappling with soaring costs, prompting investors to rethink how to preserve their wealth. While gold and real estate have long been hailed as safe-haven assets, Bitcoin’s supporters argue that its fixed supply and decentralized nature make it the ultimate shield against inflation. But does the theory hold up? The answer may depend largely on where one lives. Bitcoin advocates emphasize its strict supply limit of 21 million coins as a key advantage in combating inflationary monetary policies. Unlike fiat currencies, which central banks can print in unlimited quantities, Bitcoin’s supply is predetermined by an algorithm, preventing any form of artificial expansion. This scarcity, they argue, makes Bitcoin akin to “digital gold” and a more reliable store of value than traditional government-issued money. Several companies and even sovereign nations have embraced the idea, adding Bitcoin to their treasuries to hedge against fiat currency risk and inflation . The most notable example is El Salvador, which made global headlines in 2021 by becoming the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. The government has since been steadily accumulating Bitcoin, making it a key component of its economic strategy. Companies like Strategy in the US and Metaplanet in Japan have followed suit, and now the United States is in the process of establishing its own Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . A Bitcoin investment strategy has paid off so far So far, the corporate and government Bitcoin investment strategy has paid off as BTC outperformed the S&P 500 and gold futures since the early 2020s before inflation surged in the United States. More recently, however, that strong performance has shown signs of moderation. Bitcoin remains a strong performer over the past 12 months, and while BTC’s gains outpace consumer inflation, economists caution that past performance is no guarantee of future results. Indeed, some studies suggest a correlation between cryptocurrency returns and changes in inflation expectations is far from consistent over time. Returns over the past 12 months. Source: Truflation. Bitcoin's role as an inflation hedge remains uncertain Unlike traditional inflation hedges such as gold, Bitcoin is still a relatively new asset. Its role as a hedge remains uncertain, especially considering that widespread adoption has only gained traction in recent years. Despite high inflation in recent years, Bitcoin’s price has fluctuated wildly, often correlating more with risk assets like tech stocks than with traditional inflation hedges like gold. A recent study published in the Journal of Economics and Business found that Bitcoin’s ability to hedge inflation has weakened over time, particularly as institutional adoption grew. In 2022, when US inflation hit a 40-year high, Bitcoin lost more than 60% of its value, while gold, a traditional inflation hedge, remained relatively stable. For this reason, some analysts say that Bitcoin’s price may be driven more by investor sentiment and liquidity conditions than by macroeconomic fundamentals like inflation. When the risk appetite is strong, Bitcoin rallies. But when markets are fearful, Bitcoin often crashes alongside stocks. In a Journal of Economics and Business study, authors Harold Rodriguez and Jefferson Colombo said, “Based on monthly data between August 2010 and January 2023, the results indicate that Bitcoin returns increase significantly after a positive inflationary shock, corroborating empirical evidence that Bitcoin can act as an inflation hedge.” However, they noted that Bitcoin’s inflationary hedging property was stronger in the early days when institutional adoption of BTC was not as prevalent. Both researchers agreed that “Bitcoin’s inflation-hedging property is context-specific and likely diminishes as it achieves broader adoption and becomes more integrated into mainstream financial markets.” US inflation index since 2020. Source. Truflation “So far, it has acted as an inflation hedge—but it’s not a black-and-white case. It’s more of a cyclical (phenomenon),” Robert Walden, head of trading at Abra, told Cointelegraph. Walden said, “For Bitcoin to be a true inflation hedge, it would need to consistently outpace inflation year after year with its returns. However, due to its parabolic nature, its performance tends to be highly asymmetric over time.” Bitcoin’s movement right now, Walden said, is more about market positioning than inflation hedging—it’s about capital flows and interest rates."" Argentina and Turkey seek financial refuge in crypto In economies suffering from runaway inflation and strict capital controls, Bitcoin has proven to be a valuable tool for preserving wealth. Argentina and Turkey, two countries with persistent inflation throughout recent decades, illustrate this dynamic well. Argentina has long grappled with recurring financial crises and soaring inflation. While inflation has shown signs of improvement very recently, locals have historically turned to cryptocurrency as a way to bypass financial restrictions and protect their wealth from currency depreciation. A recent Coinbase survey found that 87% of Argentinians believe crypto and blockchain technology can enhance their financial independence, while nearly three in four respondents see crypto as a solution to challenges like inflation and high transaction costs. Related: Argentina overtakes Brazil in crypto inflows — Chainalysis With a population of 45 million, Argentina has become a hotbed for crypto adoption, with Coinbase reporting that as many as five million Argentinians use digital assets daily. “Economic freedom is a cornerstone of prosperity, and we are proud to bring secure, transparent, and reliable crypto services to Argentina,” said Fabio Plein, Director for the Americas at Coinbase. “For many Argentinians, crypto isn’t just an investment, it’s a necessity for regaining control over their financial futures.” “People in Argentina don’t trust the peso. They are always looking for ways to store value outside of the local currency,” Julián Colombo, a senior director at Bitso, a major Latin American cryptocurrency exchange, told Cointelegraph. “Bitcoin and stablecoins allow them to bypass capital controls and protect their savings from devaluation.” Argentina inflation index. Source. Truflation. Beyond individual investors, businesses in Argentina are also using Bitcoin and stablecoins to protect revenue and conduct international transactions. Some workers even opt to receive part of their salaries in cryptocurrency to safeguard their earnings from inflation. According to economist and crypto analyst Natalia Motyl, “Currency restrictions and capital controls imposed in recent years have made access to US dollars increasingly difficult amid high inflation and a crisis of confidence in the Argentine peso. In this environment, cryptocurrencies have emerged as a viable alternative for preserving the value of money, allowing individuals and businesses to bypass the limitations of the traditional financial system.” While Bitcoin's effectiveness as an inflation hedge is still up for debate, stablecoins have become a more practical solution in high-inflation economies, particularly those pegged to the US dollar. Relative to its economic size, Turkey has emerged as a hotspot for stablecoin transactions. In the year leading up to March 2024, purchases alone accounted for 4.3% of GDP. This digital currency boom, fueled by years of double-digit inflation—peaking at 85% in 2022—and a more than 80% plunge in the lira against the dollar over the past five years, gained momentum during the pandemic. Turkey’s Bitcoin adoption proves citizens drive adoption, not governments Although Turkey allows its citizens to buy, hold, and trade crypto, the use of digital currencies for payments has been banned since 2021 when the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey prohibited “any direct or indirect usage of crypto assets in payment services and electronic money issuance.” Nevertheless, crypto adoption in Turkey is still evident , with an increasing number of Turkish banks offering crypto services and shops and ATMs providing crypto exchange options. High inflation rates backed the erosion of the Turkish lira’s value, which lost nearly 60% of its purchasing power as inflation soared to 85.5% between 2021 and 2023. This led many Turkish citizens to turn to Bitcoin as a store of value and a medium of exchange. While some argue that Bitcoin’s scarcity bodes well for long-term appreciation, potentially outpacing consumer inflation, its high volatility and recurring correlation with tech-heavy, risk-associated indexes like the Nasdaq in recent times suggest that its performance as a pure inflation hedge remains mixed. However, in inflation-ridden nations like Argentina and Turkey, where local currencies have collapsed in value, the “digital gold” has undeniably served as a crucial avenue of escape from local currencies, preserving purchasing power in ways traditional fiat cannot. Although Bitcoin is still a nascent asset, and its effectiveness as a hedge requires further study, one thing remains clear—so far, it has significantly outperformed consumer inflation. For Bitcoin enthusiasts, that alone is reason enough to celebrate. This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

This Data Suggests Otherwise, Analytics Firm Says",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-peak-data-suggests-analytics-firm-says/,"An analytics firm has explained how the data related to the stablecoins could hint at whether the Bitcoin market top is in or not. Stablecoins Have Seen Their Market Cap Touch New Highs Recently In a new post on X, the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has discussed about the trend in the combined stablecoin market cap. “Stablecoins” refer to cryptocurrencies that are pegged to a fiat currency (with USD being the most popular choice). Generally, investors make use of these assets when they want to avoid the volatility associated with other coins like Bitcoin. Traders who invest into stablecoins, however, usually do so because they plan to venture (back) into the volatile side of the sector. Related Reading: Dogecoin Can Still Go Parabolic If This Support Holds, Analyst Says As such, the supply of these fiat-tied tokens is often considered as the available ‘dry powder’ for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Given this placement of the stables in the sector, their market cap can be worth keeping an eye on. Here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the stablecoin market cap over the past few years: As displayed in the above graph, the market cap of the stablecoins has been riding an uptrend recently and exploring new all-time highs (ATHs). Following the latest continuation to the increase, the metric has hit a whopping $219 billion. To put things into perspective, the market cap of Ethereum (ETH), the second largest asset in the sector, is just under $233 billion. Thus, the stables are less than $14 billion away. IntoTheBlock has pointed out an interesting pattern related to this indicator. In the chart, it’s visible that the metric’s top last cycle was when it hit $187 billion in April 2022. Evidently, this peak in the market cap of the stables coincided with the start of the bear market. “Historically, stablecoin supply peaks align with cycle highs,” notes the analytics firm. So far in the current cycle, the indicator has continued to rise, despite the decline in the asset’s price. If the previous trend is anything to go by, this could be an indication that Bitcoin and other coins are yet to enter a bear market. That said, the latest market conditions haven’t exactly been entirely bullish. The most positive scenario occurs whenever both BTC and the stablecoins enjoy an increase in their market caps. In such a period, a net amount of fresh capital inflows are entering into the sector. Related Reading: Bitcoin & Altcoin Volume Fades—Investor Exhaustion Setting In? At present, though, the stablecoins have been rising while Bitcoin and others have been falling. This could potentially imply a rotation of capital has been occurring, rather than fresh inflows. During the mid-2021 correction, a similar pattern emerged, but the market was able to find its footing and the second half of the rally took place. It now remains to be seen whether something similar would happen for Bitcoin this time as well, or if the market will go the way it did in 2022. Bitcoin Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $84,700, down over 4% in the last seven days.

Coinbase says the response is far from sufficient as it pledges to heighten its quest for additional information. Coinbase Takes Swipes At FDIC’s Response To FOIA Request Following a FOIA request filed by US-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, the FDIC has released a raft of documents. However, Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal disclosed that the documents released by the FDIC contain too little information. Grewal took to X (formerly Twitter) to criticize the FDIC for dragging its feet to release necessary information. According to the FOIA filing, Coinbase is seeking information into the FDIC’s role in Operation Choke Point 2.0 and the “debanking of crypto companies.” Grewal notes that the FDIC is withholding information , particularly regarding its conduct of due diligence to ensure that Operation Chokepoint 2.0 documents remain preserved. Coinbase has filed a similar The executive disclosed that the latest batch of documents contained several redactions that revealed “much too little, much too late.” “They removed a few redactions, produced a few more documents, and promised another “renewed search” for other documents,” said Grewal. The US SEC Has To File Its Own Response To FOIA Requests Coinbase has extended its crusade against regulators by filing a FOIA request against the SEC . According to the filing, Coinbase is seeking clarification over the cost of the SEC’s enforcement actions against cryptocurrency companies. “The previous SEC spent four years attacking a lawful industry, and American taxpayers were left holding the bill,” read a statement. “How much did you end up paying? We intend to find out.” Pundits say the SEC’s enforcement actions against heavy hitters in the industry could cost millions of dollars. Furthermore, a reliance on third-party contractors by the SEC in the cases are expected to drive up the bill. Coinbase’s request comes on the heels of high-profile case dismissals against cryptocurrency service providers. The SEC’s dismissal of Kraken’s case and the lawsuit against Coinbase are considered a monumental waste of public resources by the securities watchdog.

In a new post, pseudonymous crypto trader Altcoin Sherpa tells his 243,900 followers on the social media platform X that alts may give up gains after bouncing based on historical precedence. He also says Bitcoin ( BTC ) may soon flip $84,000 into support and that the flagship crypto asset could maintain bullish momentum by breaking through the $89,000 level. “BTC looks like $84,000 is the first test that is going to break (to the upside) and we’re ok in that department. $89,000 would be my next level of interest overall. Alts looking like they’ll give a temporary bounce but not sure how strong (yet). Be on guard.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X Looking at his chart, the analyst suggests that if Bitcoin can regain $98,703 as support, the flagship crypto asset may print new all-time highs. However, he warns if $78,167 breaks down as support, Bitcoin may plummet into the $60,000 range. Bitcoin is trading for $84,154 at time of writing, up 4.6% in the last 24 hours. The analyst also warns that altcoins like the dogwifhat ( WIF ) memecoin may struggle for a long time to ever regain higher price targets if Bitcoin turns bearish. “It’s a lot more concerning for sh**coins this go around because BTC might actually be dead for a bit. In the previous drawdown, we had a lot more hope because we assumed BTC still had more upside. If BTC dies to $50,000 or w/e (whatever), these aren’t coming back for a very long time. See WIF.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X WIF is trading for $0.50 at time of writing, up 9.7% in the last 24 hours. He adds that altcoins may bounce even as they continue to print a bearish lower-high price structure. “As much as everything is dead and we’re truly in a bear market for altcoins, it’s important to remember that a bounce will come and alts can still do a few x from current levels. Markets don’t move in a straight line down. Bounce coming within the next one to two months in my opinion.” He shares the two-day chart of Ethereum ( ETH ) to illustrate the historical precedence of an altcoin bouncing amid a larger downtrend.

This development has caught the attention of traders and analysts, sparking discussions about whether BTC is entering a new bullish phase or preparing for a deeper correction. With Bitcoin’s price action heavily influencing the broader crypto market, understanding this trend shift is crucial for investors looking to position themselves accordingly. The SuperTrend indicator is a widely used tool in technical analysis that helps traders identify the prevailing market trend. It is based on the Average True Range (ATR) and adjusts dynamically to price movements. When the indicator flips from bearish to bullish, it signals a potential uptrend, suggesting an optimal time to enter long positions. Conversely, a reversal from bullish to bearish suggests increasing selling pressure and the likelihood of further downside. #Bitcoin $BTC is undergoing a trend shift on the 3-day chart, according to the SuperTrend indicator! pic.twitter.com/Fhrwo2FuUI — Ali (@ali_charts) March 14, 2025 On Bitcoin’s 3-day chart, the SuperTrend indicator has recently flipped, signaling a potential shift in momentum. This transition suggests that BTC may be at a turning point, with either a continuation of its upward trajectory or a reversal that could lead to lower price levels. Historically, such shifts have preceded significant price movements, making this a major development for traders and long-term investors. Technical Confirmation and Key Price Levels A trend reversal is only confirmed when other technical indicators support the signal generated by the SuperTrend. Bitcoin’s recent price action suggests growing bullish momentum, with BTC breaking above key resistance levels and forming higher highs. Bitcoin’s bullish trajectory relies on consistent trading above its freshly formed support levels. Momentum indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) are also crucial in assessing the strength of this trend shift. A climbing RSI suggests growing buying momentum, and a MACD crossover can provide additional confirmation of a developing trend. If these indicators align with the SuperTrend’s bullish signal, the likelihood of a sustained rally increases. Market Sentiment and Broader Influences Beyond technical indicators, Bitcoin’s trend shift is influenced by broader market conditions and investor sentiment. On-chain data suggests that long-term holders are accumulating BTC, reducing selling pressure and adding confidence to the market. Additionally, institutional interest in Bitcoin remains strong, with spot Bitcoin ETFs continuing to attract inflows. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Macroeconomic factors also play a role in Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Developments such as Federal Reserve policy decisions, inflation trends, and overall risk sentiment in global financial markets can impact BTC’s momentum. If economic conditions favor risk assets, Bitcoin could benefit from increased demand as a hedge against traditional financial uncertainties. The Road Ahead for Bitcoin The trend reversal on Bitcoin’s 3-day chart signals a critical inflection point, poised to catapult the market into a new phase. If the SuperTrend indicator’s signal proves accurate, BTC could be on the verge of a strong uptrend, leading to a renewed push toward previous all-time highs. However, traders should remain cautious, as market conditions can shift rapidly, and false breakouts are possible. Over the coming days, it’s crucial to watch Bitcoin’s ability to maintain key support levels and extend its bullish momentum. Given the crypto market’s inherent volatility, a confirmed trend reversal could unlock substantial price swings, ultimately defining Bitcoin’s trajectory for the near and medium-term. Whether this marks the beginning of a crucial rally or a temporary bullish phase, the market’s response to this signal will be important in determining Bitcoin’s next move.

However, Dragonfly’s latest report highlighted the unintended consequences of geoblocking policies, particularly in the United States, where restrictive regulations have led to missed financial opportunities, reduced participation, as well as significant economic implications for both users and governments. Geoblocking Airdrops Cost US Billions Venture capital firm Dragonfly’s study examined 12 airdrops conducted between 2019 and 2023, with a specific focus on the effects of geoblocking on US users. The findings revealed that between 920,000 and 5.2 million US cryptocurrency users were unable to participate due to these restrictions, which represented an estimated 5-10% of all local investors. Despite the US maintaining a significant share of global crypto activity and accounting for 22-24% of all active blockchain addresses, these policies excluded a substantial portion of the potential user base from accessing newly distributed tokens. The report quantified the financial impact of this exclusion. The analyzed 11 geo-blocked airdrops collectively generated approximately $7.16 billion in total value, as 1.9 million worldwide claimers received an average median value of $4,600 per eligible address. For US users, however, the estimated lost revenue ranged between $1.84 billion and $2.64 billion from 2020 to 2024. When applying this percentage of lost participation to a broader dataset from CoinGecko, the estimated revenue forfeited by US persons rises significantly, reaching a range of $3.49 billion to $5.02 billion over the same period. Tether’s Offshore Status Costs US Beyond individual financial losses, the report also highlighted significant implications for tax revenue. The inability of US users to access these airdrops was observed to have resulted in an estimated loss of $418 million to $1.1 billion in federal tax revenue and $107 million to $284 million in state tax revenue. In total, missed tax collections from geo-blocked airdrops range from $525 million to $1.38 billion, a figure that does not include additional taxes that could have been levied on capital gains upon the eventual sale of the tokens. Additionally, the report noted that corporate tax revenue losses are exacerbated by the offshore migration of crypto businesses. As an example, Dragonfly pointed to stablecoin issuer Tether, which reported $6.2 billion in profits in 2024 while being incorporated offshore. If fully taxed under US jurisdiction, Tether alone could have contributed an estimated $1.3 billion in federal corporate taxes and $316 million in state taxes.

According to reports, Congress received a bill that will allow employees to take their salaries and other remunerations in Bitcoin and other digital assets. The bill was authored and submitted by prominent politician Luiz Philippe of Orleans-Braganza. In the bill, he asked that the National Congress look into the idea of regulating the payment of salaries in digital assets. “Regulation of the payment of salaries, remunerations and labor benefits with the use of virtual assets,” an excerpt of the bill reads. According to the usual mode of passing bills in Brazil, it will first undergo analysis within the Chamber of Deputies. If it is approved, with the majority in the Plenary, it will be sent to the Federal Senate for evaluation. According to Brazilian legislation, Law No. 14,478/2022, addresses Bitcoin and other digital assets as ‘virtual assets’, meaning that the new proposal will use the same terminology to regulate labor activities. In the bill, Philippe mentioned that companies should provide detailed payment statements and offer financial education to workers who want to collect their salaries in digital assets. He added that they need to cover concepts like market volatility and transaction security. The project also ensures that labor and social security charges are calculated based on the total value of remuneration expressed in reais. Brazilian National Congress to consider another pro-crypto law According to local media Livecoins , the bill was submitted by Philippe to the National Congress on March 14, asking the lawmakers to effect a rule change. According to his proposal, workers should be able to collect at least 50% of their wages and other entitlements in Bitcoin and other digital assets if they choose. A snapshot of a part of the bill submitted to the Brazilian Congress by Luiz Philippe. Source: Livecoins. Notably, the bill does not enforce Bitcoin acceptance but rather provides legal backing for residents working in the country who prefer exposure to the ever-rising technology. According to the bill, the payments in digital assets should happen after an agreement between the worker and the employer. This means that both parties can decide to terminate the use of the payment method at will. An interesting part of the bill mentioned that 50% of the bill should remain in Brazilian real to sustain the utility of the country’s currency. However, according to the law being overseen by the Brazilian Central Bank, the bill will not apply to freelancers, expatriates, or self-employed workers. This might be mainly down to the fact that they are allowed to choose how they get paid for their services, with most of them often taking crypto. Philippe backs the bill to enhance digital asset competitiveness According to Philippe, the bill will help Brazil enhance its status as a global digital asset hub as countries across the globe continue to push for the adoption of the technology. He mentioned that another upside is that it will attract foreign investments in the country, giving employees the freedom to decide on what options they want to receive their labor rights. Meanwhile, the proposal represents a broader friendly move toward digital assets in Brazil . The South American country prides itself for its clear regulatory framework that has provided a safe and secure environment for individuals and firms in the crypto space. For instance, popular crypto exchange Binance announced an expansion in Brazil earlier this year, becoming the first exchange to receive a broker license. Notably, Brazil is not the first country to consider this approach, with an Argentina lawmaker introducing the same proposal back in 2021. According to the author of the bill, Jose Luis Ramon, the initiative would help employees preserve their purchasing power while increasing their financial independence. “I presented a bill so that workers have the option of receiving their full or partial salary in Bitcoin or other crypto. The idea is that they can strengthen their autonomy and conserve the purchasing power of their remuneration,” he said at the time. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

French prosecutors accused Durov of running a platform that allegedly enables illegal activities, according to charges announced on Aug. 28, 2024. Durov being granted approval to leave France was applauded by Telegram and TON users as a win for freedom of speech, while the debate between online security and freedom of expression continues to foment.

Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) in Recovery as US CPI and PPI triggers $99B Surge Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) experienced modest gains this week, as bullish catalysts counteracted concerns stemming from trade tensions between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. The publication of favorable CPI and PPI data, indicating easing inflation, has bolstered investor confidence. Total Crypto market Capitalization. March 15 | Source: TradingView Following the latest US inflation reports, The global cryptocurrency market capitalization surged by $99.7 billion over the past week, reaching $2.71 trillion at press time on March 15. This positive sentiment has led to increased capital inflows into the cryptocurrency market, contributing to the recent surge in market capitalization. 3 Market Catalysts to Watch in the Week Ahead Several key developments are on the horizon that could significantly impact prices of top cryptocurrency assets like BTC, ETH and XRP in the coming week: Bitcoin Price Forecast: BTC could advance towards $90,000 if Microstrategy Buys again Bitcoin price forecast charts shows BTC trading at $84,312, up 0.39% on the day, as it attempts to reclaim key resistance levels amid speculation that MicroStrategy (now Strategy) may resume BTC acquisitions. The recent price action shows BTC attempting to break above the 50-day moving average, which has acted as dynamic resistance throughout the downtrend. The Bollinger Bands are tightening, indicating decreasing volatility, which often precedes a breakout. BTC is currently trading near the lower band, suggesting limited downside risk, while the upper band at $93,302 marks the next key resistance. Bitcoin price forecast | BTC A successful breakout could open the path toward $90,000 and beyond, particularly if MicroStrategy’s anticipated purchases materialize. However, the RSI remains below the 50 neutral level at 44.15, signalling weak bullish momentum. A failure to reclaim the 50-day moving average could see BTC retest support at $78,326. If macroeconomic conditions weaken or institutional demand slows, a further decline toward $75,000 remains in play. Ripple (XRP) Price Forecast: Altcoin ETFs progress could spark $3 breakout XRP price surged to $2.5 on Saturday, marking a 30% gain over the past four days, fueled by improving macroeconomic sentiment and renewed optimism surrounding SEC settlement talks. Reports suggest the SEC may consider categorizing XRP as a commodity, further boosting confidence among investors. The current Ripple price dynamics remains bullish after reclaiming key technical levels. The recent rally was supported by strong volume inflows, reinforcing the sustainability of the uptrend. The Parabolic SAR dots flipping below price action signalled a trend reversal earlier this week, aligning with the “Buy” signals on the chart. Additionally, the 200-day moving average (blue line) continues to act as dynamic support, preventing deeper corrections. Ripple (XRP) Price Forecast On the oscillator front, the SAR Oscillator has shifted aggressively into the green zone, confirming increasing bullish momentum. The oscillator reading of 75.43 suggests XRP is nearing overbought conditions but has room for further upside. A continued breakout could drive price action toward the psychological $3 level, especially if ETF-related optimism persists. However, failure to consolidate above $2.50 may trigger short-term retracements toward $2.20, where buyers could re-enter the market. If broader crypto sentiment weakens, a retest of the 200-day moving average near $1.87 remains a possibility. For now, XRP remains positioned for further gains, with ETF speculation and regulatory clarity acting as potential catalysts for an extended rally. Fed Rate Pause Could Boost Ethereum Demand Among the top crypto assets, Ethereum has struggled for traction in recent weeks, facing bearish headwinds from delayed network upgrades and controversy surrounding the Ethereum Foundation’s leadership shuffle. However, improvements in the broader macroeconomic landscape could trigger higher demand for ETH. The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy stance has shifted dovish this week, despite controversy surrounding US trade war with Canada and Mexico. Following the US CPI and PPI reports, analyst Miles Deutscher, markets are now pricing in three rate cuts by the Federal Reserve for 2025. Odds on Three US Fed Rate Cuts in 2025 | Source: Polymarket Polymarket predictions data also supports this stance, with bettors currently pricing in leading odds of 23% chance of three rate cuts this year. With the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting scheduled for March 19, traders are closely monitoring signals that could further validate expectations of monetary easing, the current Polymarket predictions data indicates that most crypto investors now anticipate a rate pause. In this case, a more dovish Fed policy tends to increase liquidity in financial markets, which historically benefits risk assets like cryptocurrencies. If confirmed, Ethereum could see increased institutional and retail demand, as lower interest rates typically drive capital inflows into ETH as well high-yield DeFi protocols hosted on the Ethereum smart contract network ETH Price Forecast: Looming resistance as $2,330 Ethereum price forecast chart is showing signs of potential recovery, but resistance near $2,330 could cap its upside in the near term. At press time on March 15, the daily chart reveals that ETH has been struggling to gain traction above the mid-range of the Donchian Channel, currently at $2,297, with the upper bound at $2,839. The ongoing downtrend suggests that a retest of the lower boundary at $1,754 remains a possibility if bullish momentum fails to strengthen. Ethereum Price Forecast | ETH The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 35.57 indicates that ETH remains in oversold territory but has yet to confirm a strong reversal. Historically, RSI levels below 40 suggest bearish control, but a sustained move above 40 could shift momentum in favor of the bulls. Meanwhile, the MACD remains negative, with the MACD line at -7.25 and the signal line further declining, reinforcing the bearish outlook. However, a bullish crossover could provide an early signal of trend reversal. If ETH clears the immediate resistance at $2,297, a push toward $2,330 could trigger further upside toward $2,839. However, failure to sustain gains above $2,000 may expose ETH to deeper corrections, with $1,754 acting as critical support in the event of renewed selling pressure.

The memecoin in question became popular after Binance founder Zhao shared a photo with a local United Arab Emirates outfit, and Zhao seems to be supporting the trend with his posts.

Some have speculated that the blockchain network sent the tokens to add liquidity to the exchange, especially since Binance accounts for most of LINK’s trading volume. However, the unlocking event has yet to cause any drastic change to LINK’s trading price, with the token currently changing hands at $14.03 . Chainlink has unlocked more than 170 million tokens since August 2022 Chainlink sent 14.875 million LINK, roughly worth $212.9 million, to Binance while the remaining 4.125 million LINK were transferred to a multi-sig wallet, with the address 0xD50. Notably, this is not the first time Chainlink has unlocked its tokens. Since August 2022, Chainlink has released 176 million LINK, valued at over $2.43 billion at current prices. Out of the 176 million, 151.3 million have been transferred to Binance at an average price of $11.41. Normally, after almost every unlocking event, LINK has been known to drop before surging in a day or two. This time, LINK’s price remains relatively stable, and the impact of the unlocking event has yet to be clearly seen. A t the time of the unlock, Chainlink had about 467.63 million LINK.

Kaspersky says that from 2023 to 2024, at least 2.3 million bank cards were exposed via infostealer malware and posted on the dark web. Over the same period, infostealer malware infected 26 million devices running Windows. The cybersecurity firm says bank card information is stolen in every 14th infection by this type of malware. According to Kaspersky expert Sergey Shcherbel, the actual number of devices infected by infostealers is most likely higher. “Cybercriminals often leak stolen data in the form of log files months or even years after the initial infection, and compromised credentials and other information continue to surface on the dark web over time. Therefore, the more time passes, the more infections from previous years we observe.” The cybersecurity firm says the infostealer malware known as Redline was the most prevalent of the data-thieving malware, accounting for 34% of the total infections in 2024. Risepro, which primarily focuses on stealing banking card details and passwords, is another fast-spreading infostealer. “The most significant surge in 2024 was in infections caused by Risepro, whose share of total infections increased from 1.4% in 2023 to almost 23% in 2024.” According to Kaspersky, the Risepro infostealer, which is also targeting cryptocurrency wallet data, is spreading through software cracks, game mods and key generators. Kaspersky advises individuals and organizations monitor bank notifications, enable two-factor authentication and run full security scans on all devices to remain vigilant against these types of malware threats.

This warning suggests a short-term correction may be imminent, presenting traders with potential buying opportunities. As technical signals play a crucial role in cryptocurrency markets, grasping the implications of this alert is vital for both short-term traders and long-term XRP investors. The TD Sequential indicator, developed by Tom DeMark, is a widely used tool in technical analysis that helps identify trend exhaustion points and potential reversals. It consists of two key phases: the setup phase, which tracks nine consecutive price bars in the same direction, and the countdown phase, which extends for 13 bars to confirm a potential trend reversal. $XRP sell alert! TD Sequential flashes a warning on the 4-hour chart. Opportunity to buy the dip incoming! pic.twitter.com/NIrZaWL6Sr — Ali (@ali_charts) March 15, 2025 The TD Sequential indicator has triggered a sell signal on XRP’s 4-hour chart, hinting that the recent upward momentum is waning. This warning suggests a short-term correction is imminent, as traders start to lock in profits. Given the indicator’s historical accuracy in identifying local tops and bottoms, this signal warrants close attention. Key Support and Resistance Levels As XRP faces potential downward pressure, pinpointing key support and resistance levels is crucial. If the sell signal sparks a decline, XRP may test nearby support zones, where buyers can step in and stabilize the price. Traders will closely watch these levels to determine whether the correction is a brief pullback or the beginning of a more substantial downturn. Resistance levels will also be crucial in assessing the vigor of any potential recovery. If XRP successfully holds above key technical levels despite the sell alert, it may signal underlying market strength. Conversely, failure to maintain support could exacerbate selling pressure, potentially prolonging the correction. Market Sentiment and Buying the Dip Opportunity Despite TD Sequential’s warning, a price correction could present a strategic buying opportunity for investors looking to accumulate XRP at lower levels. Historically, dips following such sell signals have often been short-lived, particularly if underlying fundamentals remain strong. Market sentiment will dictate the depth of XRP’s potential correction. A bullish crypto market could limit XRP’s decline, leading to a swift rebound, while bearish sentiment may extend the correction before support is found. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Broader Market Factors Impacting XRP Beyond technical indicators, several macro factors could influence XRP’s price action in the coming days. Developments in the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC, adoption trends within the XRP Ledger ecosystem, and overall liquidity conditions in the crypto market could all contribute to XRP’s next move. Additionally, Bitcoin’s performance remains a key driver for altcoins, including XRP. If BTC maintains bullish momentum, it could provide underlying support for the market, limiting the extent of XRP’s decline. On the other hand, if Bitcoin faces increased selling pressure, XRP’s correction could be more pronounced. Caution and Opportunity Amidst the Sell Signal The TD Sequential’s sell signal on the 4-hour chart suggests XRP may be poised for a short-term correction . This could prompt a round of profit-taking, but it also creates a potential buying opportunity for investors seeking to capitalize on a dip. To anticipate XRP’s next move, it’s crucial to watch key support levels, market sentiment, and the overall crypto market trend. As traders react to this signal, volatility is expected in the short term. Whether this sell alert marks a brief correction before further gains or a more extended retracement remains to be seen. Meanwhile, traders closely watching XRP’s price action should be prepared for a volatile ride, as the upcoming sessions hold potential for both profit-taking opportunities and downside risks.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Pepe eyes a $50B market cap by 2025, but Remittix emerges as a real-world challenger in the crypto space. Table of Contents PEPE’s path to $50 billion market cap Will PEPE remain dominant or suffer competition? Remittix: The stealth coin that could bring down PEPE Remittix could be better than PEPE in 2025 Invest in the blockchain payment future of Remittix Memecoins have never failed to surprise the crypto community, and Pepe (PEPE) is no exception. With growing investor interest, some analysts are already predicting that PEPE can reach a $50 billion market capitalization by 2025. But questions still remain if Pepe will continue to expand in the long term or if another coin will usurp its position. As PEPE continues to rise in popularity, there is another cryptocurrency project Remittix (RTX ) that is emerging as a likely challenger. Unlike hype-based memecoins, RTX is tackling actual real-world financial problems and could become a viable competitor for speculative assets like PEPE. You might also like: SHIB faces challenges while Remittix gains traction with real-world solutions PEPE’ s path to $50 billion market cap Pepe is trading at around $0.057115, having increased by 5.88% in the last 24 hours. Though at its highest, the volume for PEPE dropped by 25.49%, currently at $806.82 million, an indication of the diversifying sentiment in the market. There needs to be otherworldly adoption, constant hype and extra whale activity for PEPE to hit the market cap at $50 billion. While it’s true that memecoins have gone huge in the past, sustaining them is no walk in the park. Pepe’s fate simply depends on the sustainability of investor demand. If the next Ethereum bull run triggers the mania for memecoins, PEPE can see exponential gains, but investors are searching for other coins with better fundamentals. Will PEPE remain dominant or suffer competition? While PEPE does enjoy its fanbase, history demonstrates that the reign of the incumbent memecoins does ultimately come to an end. Memecoins such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu peaked in the past only to be subjected to years-long correction. PEPE will require constant development and added utility if it is to remain in the market. Its major problem is the lack of real-world applications. Other blockchains are utility-based, yet PEPE is growing through the community. This has prompted investors to consider other tokens like Remittix that have real-world economic use cases rather than speculations. Since the memecoins are also prone to volatility, traders are now looking for coins with growth prospects for the long term, thus making RTX one interesting participant in the new crypto space. Remittix: The stealth coin that could bring down PEPE Remittix is making waves as the new meme-asset player, with instant, feeless crypto to fiat transactions. RTX’s price stands at $0.0734 and it has raised more than $13.8 million and sold 518 million tokens so far, demonstrating investor appetite. In contrast with the social media hype-based PEPE, Remittix is an actual real-world payment solution. RTX is a valuable asset that enables businesses, entrepreneurs and even everyday people to swap crypto for fiat with bank delay or fees. Take the South American freelancer who’s got customers in the United States. They no longer need to wait for days for the payment, they can use RTX for an instant borderless transaction. That real-world application is what distinguishes RTX from the so-called PEPE memecoins. Remittix could be better than PEPE in 2025 If PEPE were to reach a $50 billion market cap, it would be among the most massive memecoin narratives. But for the patient investor, RTX can offer more sustainable growth on the heels of its profitability-based utility. Even with the giant of the memecoins ecosystem being PEPE at the moment, RTX adoption in global payment can make the token the most expensive blockchain asset. RTX, with its growing ecosystem and investor interest, is undoubtedly one promising candidate to be on equal grounds with speculative tokens as a formidable opponent. Because PEPE is focused on hype in the markets and RTX is focused on the elimination of the financial inefficiencies, investors must choose which direction holds the highest probable long-run potential. Invest in the blockchain payment future of Remittix While PEPE reigns supreme on the memecoins, RTX is demonstrating that utility projects can be serious business. With the addition of a fiat to crypto payment solution right from the outset, RTX is quickly emerging as the leader of the digital payment facilitators. Simply put, while PEPE is aiming for a $50b market cap, RTX’s ever-more pervasive use could make it an even better long-term wager. Long-term growth investors seeking to eschew the memecoins are flocking to RTX in great numbers and it’s fast on its way to being one of the hottest crypto plays for 2025.

41710585,https://timestabloid.com/?p=60382,1742057760,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Cardano (ADA) at a Turning Point as Buyers and Sellers Battle for Control,https://timestabloid.com/cardano-at-a-turning-point-as-buyers-and-sellers-battle-for-control/,"Over the last 24 hours, ADA has fluctuated between $0.730 and $0.755, currently trading around $0.7523. The price remains under pressure after dipping below $0.720, and despite recovery efforts, resistance near $0.7750 continues to pose a challenge. Cardano Price Action After bouncing from the $0.650 support level, ADA has struggled to build upward momentum. It remains below $0.770 and the 100-hour Simple Moving Average (SMA), indicating weak buying strength. Additionally, it is also trading below the 200 EMA line with resistance at $0.7514 on the ADA/USDT hourly chart, further limiting potential gains. Key Support and Resistance Levels For ADA to gain bullish momentum, it must clear the $0.7750 resistance level. A successful breakout could drive the price toward $0.800, with the next major hurdle at $1.00. If buyers sustain momentum beyond this point, further gains toward $1.20, $1.25, and $1.35 could follow. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Conversely, immediate support is around $0.720. Losing this level may push ADA back to its recent low of $0.650. If selling pressure increases, additional support zones lie at $0.620 and $0.600. A stronger downtrend could expose the cryptocurrency to deeper losses, with critical support around $0.580 and $0.550. Technical Indicators Reflect Uncertainty Market indicators show mixed signals. The hourly RSI is hovering near the neutral 50 level, signaling indecision among traders. Meanwhile, the MACD suggests bearish momentum, making it difficult for ADA to overcome resistance. The low trading volume further reinforces market uncertainty . Market Outlook To shift toward a bullish trend, ADA must reclaim $0.7750 and hold above it. Traders should monitor key levels closely, as a breakout past $0.7750 or a drop below $0.720 could determine the cryptocurrency’s.

The market is watching these cryptocurrencies closely, anticipating key price changes. This article reveals crucial price levels and insights that could shape the future of these popular coins. Stay tuned to discover which digital assets may be on the verge of a breakout. Dogecoin's Recent Decline Amid Long-Term Recovery Dogecoin experienced a significant drop of around 34% over the last month, despite a favorable 69% increase over the past six months. This period has been characterized by notable price swings, showcasing short-term setbacks alongside long-term strength. Such volatility indicates that while there have been pullbacks, there remains an underlying resilience that may attract bullish sentiment moving forward. Currently, Dogecoin is trading between approximately $0.145 and $0.296, with resistance around $0.39 and a key support level at about $0.09. Bears are currently in control, as momentum indicators and RSI suggest a weak market. Traders might explore short positions near resistance and watch for potential entry points if the price finds stability at support levels. Shiba Inu: Key Levels and Market Dynamics Amid Bearish Trends Shiba Inu experienced a nearly 25% drop over the past month, with considerable volatility. The decline over the last six months was milder at about 4.6%, indicating a mix of sharp corrections and overall subdued pressure. Price movements and oscillators show regular fluctuations, highlighting the challenges faced by bulls during this timeframe. Current prices lie between $0.0000106 and $0.0000182, with resistance at approximately $0.0000226 and support near $0.0000073. Bears currently dominate the market, as momentum indicators remain negative. Traders may consider short-term opportunities within this range, monitoring for breaks above resistance or rebounds from support to potentially shift market momentum. Conclusion DOGE shows promise as it positions for a breakout. Traders are watching for key price levels that could signal significant movement. Meanwhile, SHIB 's sell-off seems to be slowing, indicating potential stabilization. These trends suggest that both coins could see interesting developments soon.

Addressing members of the XRP community, Hogan highlighted the fundamental difference between XRP and Bitcoin. Given the differences between the two assets, he asked XRP holders to “be kind to the BTC guys.” The Unique Bitcoin and XRP Ideology According to Jeremy Hogan on X , Satoshi Nakamoto founded Bitcoin on the libertarian idea of self-custody. The asset was also created to provide immunity to deflation and control, among other things. He mentioned these features to outline the need to keep an eye on the core focus behind Bitcoin amid a shift in big money control over the past few years. Since at least 2020, there has been a massive emergence of corporate investors in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Firms like Michael Saylor’s Strategy and asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity now have big stakes in Bitcoin. In addition, the US government now has a strategic Bitcoin reserve , following an Executive Order signed by President Donald Trump. According to Jeremy Hogan, these adoptions are incompatible with BTC’s overall idea. This contrasts with XRP, which was designed for mainstream economic integration. BTC, XRP, and the Reserve Conflict Since President Donald’s campaign months, the conversation around a strategic national Bitcoin reserve has been on the forefront. The conflict occurred earlier this month when the President announced the national crypto reserve, including XRP, Cardano, and other altcoins. This shift sparked debate in the market, with Bitcoin Maxis kicking against the idea. This shift marked the renewed rivalry between the BTC and XRP ecosystems. Altcoin proponents argued that the idea of a crypto reserve for the country should be representative of its technological makeup. Eventually, only a Bitcoin reserve was created, with other altcoins pitched for potential inclusion in the Sovereign Wealth Fund. XRP ETF May Level the Playing Field Bitcoin generally has the first-mover advantage in the crypto ecosystem, even in pioneering the exchange-traded fund (ETF) market. However, based on the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) pro-crypto shift, other assets like XRP may eventually get an associated ETF. Asset managers pushing for an XRP ETF product include CoinShares, Bitwise, Grayscale, and WisdomTree. BlackRock is also speculated to be eyeing the offering after the completion of the Ripple versus US SEC lawsuit. With confirmations of advanced negotiation for the Ripple Lawsuit settlement , the prospects of the XRP ETF appear to be high. If approved, the coin may also welcome increased adoption from institutional investors to bridge the Bitcoin liquidity gap further.

Each year, several digital coins rise above others, showing strong growth potential. Currently, BlockDAG (BDAG) , Arbitrum (ARB), Filecoin (FIL), and Hedera (HBAR) are grabbing attention. These cryptos aren’t just popular because of temporary excitement; each has real fundamentals, increasing adoption, and upcoming important events. Anyone looking for breakout crypto with real potential should pay attention to these four names. The big question now is how high they’ll climb. BlockDAG (BDAG): Primed for Major Growth in 2025 BlockDAG (BDAG) is quickly becoming one of the top breakout cryptos of 2025. The project’s momentum isn’t based on temporary excitement—it’s backed by solid future events. With its mainnet scheduled for launch in 2025 and ten major exchange listings coming soon, BDAG will likely get significant market exposure. Already, BlockDAG raised more than $202.8 million in presales, and its early buyers experienced a huge 2380% price increase. Unlike many cryptocurrencies that disappear shortly after launch, BDAG offers practical use. Its network allows fast and scalable transactions, making it an excellent Layer 1 blockchain. Market experts predict BDAG could reach $1 by the end of 2025, a big jump from its current price of $0.0248 in batch 27. Demand remains high, with more than 18.7 billion coins already sold. Miner sales exceeded $6.5 million, with over 16,000 miners sold. Given these numbers, the excitement and growth around BlockDAG seem likely to continue rising. It’s becoming one of the strongest crypto choices for 2025. Arbitrum (ARB): Enhancing Ethereum’s Efficiency Arbitrum (ARB) helps Ethereum scale by offering quicker and cheaper transactions. It uses optimistic rollups, processing transactions off-chain first, and then finalizing them on Ethereum. This reduces network congestion and lowers transaction costs significantly. Because of these advantages, many top DeFi platforms now integrate Arbitrum. ARB currently trades at around $0.42, showing steady activity. As Ethereum continues to improve and grow, Arbitrum’s role will likely become even more important. Its strong performance makes it a key crypto player in decentralized finance in 2025. Filecoin (FIL): Revolutionizing Cloud Storage Filecoin (FIL) provides decentralized cloud storage, offering a secure alternative to traditional cloud services. Users can rent their unused storage space, creating a decentralized data storage marketplace. This approach increases privacy, security, and data accessibility. Currently priced around $2.98, FIL’s value recently dipped about 6.40% in a day. However, as Web3 and decentralized services gain popularity, Filecoin is well-placed to play a crucial role in future data storage. This strong potential positions FIL as a notable breakout crypto in 2025. Hedera (HBAR): Big Business Blockchain Solution Hedera (HBAR) solves blockchain’s scalability issues using its unique Hashgraph technology, allowing many transactions simultaneously. This ensures fast, secure, and efficient operations. Major companies such as Google, Boeing, and IBM already use Hedera’s technology, showing its reliability and practicality. HBAR trades around $0.249 as of March 6, 2025, slightly down by about 2.75% recently. However, its strong adoption by large corporations indicates continued future growth. Hedera’s real-world use makes it a solid choice among breakout cryptos in 2025. Which Crypto is the Top Pick for 2025? The Most Promising Crypto for 2025 With numerous cryptocurrencies available, only a few stand out each year. Arbitrum boosts Ethereum’s efficiency, Filecoin revolutionizes cloud storage, and Hedera appeals strongly to big businesses. However, BlockDAG tops the list due to its impressive momentum. BlockDAG’s upcoming mainnet launch, major exchange listings, and huge presale success point to explosive growth potential. Analysts see BDAG reaching as high as $1 from its current batch 27 price of $0.0248. For anyone looking to choose crypto that’s primed for significant growth, BlockDAG stands out as the clear winner for 2025.

The project left out the precise amount of tokens the hacker drained from the liquidity pool in the post. However, there were instructions for users to follow in the aftermath of the hack. It looks like we've been hacked. Something from our deployer key on our end was leaked, resulting in all vesting tokens being dumped and drained from the liquidity pool. The dApp contracts are still safe and unaffected by the hack, but please revoke access from the dApp and… — Berally 🐻⛓️ (@Berally_io) March 15, 2025 What happened to Berally? “Looks like we’ve been hacked,” the post from Berally revealed hours ago. “Something from our deployer key on our end was leaked, resulting in all vesting tokens being dumped and drained from the liquidity pool.” According to the post, dApp contracts were not affected by the hack and are still safe. However, Berally urged users to revoke access from the dApp and Staking while the team makes sense of things. “We are actively investigating the incident and will provide updates as soon as possible,” the post concluded . In another post, users were warned not to interact with the Berally token for now. In the comment section of the post, netizens blew hot, disappointed by what happened. One user wanted to know how devs lost the private keys which seems to be the root cause of the exploit. The X account handler replied with an apology, admitting fault and calling it a “skill issue.” A builder on Berachain also weighed in with advice and a scathing comment. “Take snapshots by block before the hacker, re-airdrop, and acknowledge the loss of $90k,” they wrote. “Or you can even only buy the token back and cover this 90k.” The user also added that the Berally team had been warned several times about its “several vulnerabilities” but that, in this case, the exploit happened because a “dev leaked the key.” Other user comments also seemed to imply that most believed the exploit was an inside job and that a scam had been perpetrated. Berachain’s co-founder Smokey also took to X to report the hack. His tweet went out before the hack was officially reported by Berally and urged users to be cautious, citing fears of a potential exploit. How Berachain has been doing since it launched Berachain is an EVM-identical Layer 1 blockchain that utilizes the Proof of Liquidity (PoL) consensus mechanism. It launched its mainnet on February 6, 2025, and its native token, BERA, reached an all-time high of $14.99 on the same day. Unfortunately, it was unable to sustain that value; those who received the airdrop, which was 15.8% of the total 500 million supply, took profit along with market uncertainty, which triggered a sharp decline. As such, BERA dropped to as low as $4.74 within days. By mid-February, the price had stabilized somewhat, hovering around $6.04 to $6.20. BERAUSDT 1-hour price chart In February, Smokey, the chain’s founder, took to X with a long post detailing his thoughts on the launch and how things were going. “Honestly, as I sit down to write this post, I’m still at a bit of a loss for words. The chain wasn’t real for so long that, at this point, it almost feels weirder that it is,” the post began. “I’m a little torn because I could certainly write exactly about how I feel, and feed an army of trolls, or I could bullpost into the void and seem like a delusional goof (which I occasionally am),” it continued. Smokey listed many of what the chain had going for it, then said that “as the full Proof of Liquidity feature set rolls out, user incentives from their favorite applications, and exciting novel dApps + rewards vaults going live on Berachain, we’ll get to see whether the Emperor really has clothes.” Smokey also admitted that he knows there is a lot of room to improve and that there have been mistakes along the way, but he also vowed the team will do its absolute best to make the improvements happen. As he rounded up the long post, he thanked his team for “putting up with me and my stupidity on a daily basis” and teaching him something new every day. “I’m privileged to work with a group of brilliant devs and indomitable BD beras while building this chain,” Smokey added . “The market’s not pretty. I’m not gonna pretend I’m happy about it, but I’d rather see fairweather friends depart now than worry about them down the road.” Berachain has faced criticism about its ever-present sell pressure based on concerns about tokenomics. Berachain reportedly sold over 35% of BERA supply to private investors across multiple funding rounds. Long vesting schedules also contribute to the persistent sell pressure.

Ethereum ( ETH ) spiked on Saturday to exceed this month’s low of $1,762. At the time of publication, it was trading at around 1,940.57. ETH, the second-biggest cryptocurrency, remains in a deep bear market after falling by over 53% from its highest level in December. One reason for the ongoing sell-off is that investors remain in the sidelines as the crypto and stocks market retreats amid President Donald Trump’s tariffs . Third-party data shows that Wall Street investors have continued to sell their Ether ETFs. According to SoSoValue , all Ethereum ETFs shed over $143 million in assets this week, a big increase from the $119 million they lost a week earlier. They have lost assets in the last three straight weeks, bringing the cumulative total net inflows to $2.56 billion. Grayscale’s ETHE has over $2.35 billion in assets, followed by Blackrock’s ETHA, which has $2.1 billion. All Ethereum ETFs have over $6.6 billion, much lower than Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) $93 billion. Further, the futures market is sending a warning about Ethereum prices. Data shows that linear weekly futures have moved to the backwardation phase for the first time since August. Backwardation is a period where futures prices are lower than the current levels.

It has risen from a low of $1,762 to $1,930. Ethereum has failed to flip the important psychological point at $3,000 into a support. It also remains below the crucial resistance level at $2,115, the lowest swing in August, and the neckline of the triple-top point at $4,000. Ethereum has formed a death cross pattern as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages crossed each other. It has also formed a bearish pennant pattern, pointing to more downside ahead. This bearish view will be confirmed if it drops below this month’s low of $1,762.

This came after a statement from the TON Foundation that Pavel Durov’s passport has been returned by the French authorities. TON Price. Source: CoinGecko Recall the developments that transpired during the summer of last year when the French authorities arrested Telegram’s founder, Pavel Durov, on suspicion that various offenses had been committed through the app that he runs. Needless to say, TON felt the consequences immediately, given its history with Telegram, and its price tumbled by double digits. Details were scarce in the following months, but TON failed to recover despite the market-wide bull run, and it bottomed at around $2 after trading above $8 before Durov’s arrest. The TON Foundation announced earlier today positive developments on the manner, indicating that “Pavel Durov’s passport has been returned to him by French authorities, granting him the freedom to leave the country at his discretion.” “This news marks a significant moment of resolution. With nearly a billion users worldwide, Telegram represents a global movement committed to the freedom of communication and the inalienable right to privacy. As part of the decentralized TON community, we have stood in solidarity with Pavel, supporting his unwavering dedication to defending the right to free speech and privacy online.” reads the statement. As the chart above demonstrates, TON’s price reacted immediately again and skyrocketed by over 20%. It managed to overcome the $3 resistance and spiked to a high of $3.5 before correcting slightly.

Over the past 24 hours, XRP recorded a staggering trading volume of $445 million, surpassing even Bitcoin and Ethereum. This renewed trading frenzy underscores the strong demand for XRP in South Korea, a market known for its deep liquidity and enthusiastic crypto traders. XRP’s Popularity in South Korea: A Long-Standing Trend South Korea has historically been one of the strongest markets for XRP, with retail investors and institutional players consistently driving high volumes. Unlike in other regions, where Bitcoin and Ethereum typically dominate, XRP has carved out a unique position in the Korean market due to its fast transaction speeds, low fees, and the strong presence of Ripple’s technology in cross-border payments. Upbit’s trading data reveals that Korean traders have maintained a strong appetite for XRP, often making it one of the most liquid assets on the platform. This is not the first time XRP has led trading activity on Upbit , but the latest surge in volume reinforces its resilience and growing appeal among South Korean investors. #XRP IS MOST TRADED #Crypto ON KOREAN EXCHANGE UPBIT with a 24-hour trading volume of $445 million. WE'RE SO BACK pic.twitter.com/6dTR1AZiNC — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) March 15, 2025 Factors Driving XRP’s Trading Surge Several factors contribute to XRP’s continued dominance on Upbit. First, South Korean traders are known for their speculative trading strategies, often favoring high-volatility assets like XRP. With the crypto market experiencing renewed momentum, traders are flocking to cryptos with strong price action, and XRP has emerged as a preferred choice. Another significant driver is the regulatory clarity surrounding XRP in South Korea. Unlike in the U.S., where Ripple has faced legal battles with the SEC, the regulatory landscape in South Korea is more defined, allowing exchanges to list XRP without major restrictions. This clarity has helped sustain investor confidence and trading activity. Additionally, the recent developments in the broader XRP ecosystem, including partnerships and network upgrades, have fueled optimism. The integration of XRP in remittance services and the growing adoption of the XRP Ledger for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications have reinforced its utility, attracting more traders and investors. The Broader Market Implications XRP’s trading volume on Upbit highlights a broader trend in the cryptocurrency market. South Korean exchanges have long been considered a leading indicator of retail interest, and a surge in XRP activity could signal increasing global demand. Historically, heightened trading activity in South Korea has often preceded significant price movements in the crypto market. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The so-called “Kimchi Premium” phenomenon—where crypto prices on Korean exchanges trade at a premium compared to global markets—has been observed in previous bull cycles. While XRP’s current surge on Upbit has not led to a significant premium, it reflects the heightened interest that could drive further momentum. Moreover, XRP’s strong performance in South Korea could influence other markets, as global traders and investors take cues from the trading behavior of Korean participants. As the trend persists, XRP may experience a surge in liquidity and demand on prominent exchanges globally, further solidifying its position in the market. XRP’s Market Strength Reinforced XRP’s emergence as the most traded cryptocurrency on Upbit, with a 24-hour trading volume of $445 million, is a testament to its enduring appeal in the South Korean market. The combination of strong retail demand, regulatory clarity, and ongoing ecosystem developments has positioned XRP as a key player in the global crypto landscape. XRP’s dominance in Korea may spark broader adoption and drive price growth, as the market evolves. Whether this momentum translates into sustained growth or remains a short-term trading phenomenon remains to be seen. However, one thing is clear—XRP remains a force to be reckoned with in cryptocurrency. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Meet the X-Series Miner Revolution,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/is-blockdag-cryptos-greenest-pow-coin-meet-the-x-series-miner-revolution,"The crypto market often debates the environmental cost of Proof-of-Work (PoW) coins. Bitcoin and similar coins have faced criticism for high power consumption. BlockDAG is changing this narrative. Its unique technology blends secure PoW consensus with eco-friendly mining practices, drawing crypto fans who want sustainability without compromising security. The X-Series miners are at the heart of BlockDAG’s green vision. These innovative mining rigs use significantly less energy than traditional setups. Crypto enthusiasts are quickly noticing BlockDAG’s environmental edge, especially as its presale continues to break records, making it a hot pick for users who care about a cleaner digital future. Why BlockDAG’s Technology is Eco-Friendly BlockDAG uses Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology combined with PoW, unlike traditional blockchains. Instead of miners working individually and wasting energy by racing to solve the same puzzle, DAG miners collaborate, processing multiple transactions simultaneously. This reduces redundant calculations, significantly cutting down on electricity usage. Traditional PoW systems need huge amounts of computational power. BlockDAG’s design allows miners to handle transactions faster and with fewer resources. Lower computational demands naturally lead to lower electricity consumption. For users looking for a coin that respects the environment without sacrificing performance, BlockDAG presents a strong case. Additionally, BlockDAG’s protocol rewards efficiency rather than just raw power. By incentivizing low-energy mining, the network attracts environmentally-conscious miners. This efficient approach doesn’t just help the planet; it also reduces the costs miners have to pay for energy bills, creating a win-win situation. Meet the Revolutionary X-Series Miners The star of BlockDAG’s eco-friendly approach is the X-Series mining rigs. These rigs come in three popular models: X10, X30, and X100. Each miner provides different levels of daily BDAG rewards, making it accessible for beginners as well as seasoned crypto miners. What’s impressive about these miners is their low power usage. While standard mining equipment drains massive amounts of energy, the X-Series miners achieve high performance with minimal consumption. The flagship model, the X100, produces up to 2,000 BDAG coins daily, making it a popular choice for experienced miners. Despite this output, it maintains extremely low energy usage, demonstrating BlockDAG’s commitment to sustainability. Thanks to user-friendly designs, setting up these miners is straightforward. Even beginners can start mining quickly without worrying about complex setups or expensive electricity bills. With over 16,200 units sold recently, it's clear that crypto miners value the efficiency and profitability of these green mining rigs. BlockDAG’s Presale Hits New Milestones BlockDAG’s presale has become one of the most successful of 2025, reflecting strong community support. As of March 2025, it has already raised over $201 million, with more than 18.7 billion BDAG coins sold. These impressive figures show growing confidence in the network’s potential and its unique approach to mining. Currently, BDAG is in its 27th presale batch, priced attractively at $0.0248 per coin. This pricing represents significant growth from its initial stages, attracting both newcomers and veteran crypto supporters. With plans to list BDAG on ten major centralized exchanges soon, interest continues to build as more users recognize BlockDAG’s environmental benefits alongside financial opportunities. The successful presale and upcoming exchange listings underline a strong community belief in BlockDAG’s eco-friendly mining strategy. Users are excited about the potential for significant returns once the coin becomes publicly traded. Community Growth and Future Plans BlockDAG’s eco-friendly stance is resonating with the wider crypto community. The network recently partnered with SpaceDev to expand its global presence. Through programs like hackathons, ambassador initiatives, and technical grants, BlockDAG aims to spread awareness about sustainable crypto mining globally. Additionally, BlockDAG is preparing for its mainnet launch later in 2025. This upcoming milestone promises even faster and greener transaction processing. The combination of ongoing developments, strategic partnerships, and consistent community growth highlights the network’s forward-thinking approach. BlockDAG also continues enhancing miner efficiency, ensuring users can mine profitably without environmental concerns. This continuous improvement, combined with an active, growing user base, positions BlockDAG to become one of the leading eco-friendly PoW coins in the crypto industry. Why BlockDAG Could Become Crypto’s Green Standard As crypto users become more conscious of their environmental impact, BlockDAG stands out with its genuinely sustainable PoW model. The innovative use of DAG technology, paired with highly efficient X-Series miners, offers a viable solution to the typical energy-intensive issues associated with traditional mining. This approach appeals not just to miners but also to users seeking eco-friendly alternatives. With increasing global attention on sustainability, BlockDAG’s strategy positions it perfectly to capture this growing market segment. Its successful presale further validates community belief in its potential, creating momentum as the coin approaches public exchange listings. In short, BlockDAG’s technology and strategic partnerships promise a greener crypto future. Its mining rigs make sustainability accessible without compromising performance, appealing directly to the next generation of crypto enthusiasts. BlockDAG might just set a new standard for responsible crypto mining in the years to come.

The poll, conducted by left-leaning pollster Data For Progress, involved 1,169 likely US voters. Republicans Show Support For Crypto Strategic Bitcoin Reserve The supposed crypto strategic reserve uses government spending to purchase and hold cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). The POTUS also hinted at the possibility of having XRP , Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) as part of the digital assets in the national treasury. According to the poll, 51% of respondents opposed the proposed reserve, while another 34% supported it. Also,15% of the survey respondents were neither here nor there. Some self-acclaimed Republicans supported the proposal, 41-40, while Democrats opposed it 59-29. This result clearly indicates the stark ideological divide between both parties. Americans Ask US Government to Decrease Crypto Funding Apart from their opinion on the crypto strategic reserve, the US voters were also asked whether the government should consider increasing, decreasing, or maintaining funding levels for nine potential priorities for the federal government. To this question, 45% of respondents said it was best for the government to decrease the federal funding for digital asset and blockchain development. If this is the case, the funding for crypto and blockchain will rank lowest, even below the funds allocated for Artificial Intelligence (AI) research and space exploration. 12% asked for an increase, 31% said it should be maintained at the same level, while 12% were indecisive. Noteworthy, Republicans made up 36% of those who advised the federal government to decrease its funding for the burgeoning sector. US Senator Reintroduce National Bitcoin Reserve Bill Amidst these polls, the new Head of the U.S. Historic Senate Subcommittee on crypto, Senator Cynthia Lummis, has reintroduced a bill aimed at creating the national Bitcoin reserve . The first time she introduced this bill was July 2024, and since then, she has made a few changes to the proposal. After much rebranding and adjustment, the new bill is now called the “Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide Act,” or the Bitcoin Act.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) rose to $84,525 on Saturday, up 10% from its lowest level this month. It remains in a local bear market after falling by over 22% from its highest level this year. At the time of publication, it was trading at just over $84,335. Bitcoin and other altcoins rose slightly on Friday, mirroring the performance of other assets like stocks and gold. The Dow Jones index rose by over 650 points, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 jumped by 117 and 450 points, respectively. Gold jumped to a record high of $3,010. Bitcoin price faces potential risks Bitcoin’s recovery faces two potential risks and two opportunities. First, there are signs that investors are still in a sense of fear. While the fear and greed index has exited the extreme fear zone of 18, there are signs that investors are still fearful. It remains in the fear zone of 22. Historically, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies do well when the index is in the greedy zone. This fear explains why spot Bitcoin ETFs shed $143 million in assets, bringing the weekly outflows to $870 million. They had outflows in the last five consecutive weeks . Second, technically, Bitcoin has formed a death cross as the 50-day and 200-day Weighted Moving Averages crossed each other. This crossover often leads to more downside over time. In Bitcoin’s case, there is still room to retest $73,900, the highest level in March 2024.

Recession fears may inspire the central bank to embrace a dovish tone and hint at more interest rate cuts. A change of tune by the Federal Reserve would be a positive thing for Bitcoin, altcoins, and other altcoins. The other opportunity is that investors may embrace a risk-on sentiment and buy the dip in the stock and crypto market. That’s because the most extreme risks of tariffs have now been priced in as the stock market shed trillions in value. This performance has happened before, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic. Investors panicked and sold stocks and crypto in March 2020 and then bought the dip as the Fed embraced a highly dovish sentiment.

Crypto analysts suggest that the coming weeks will steadily increase the cryptocurrency’s value. A bullish rally may be expected in the latter part of 2025, potentially pushing AMP above $0.00907. However, conducting your research and seeking professional financial advice is recommended. Why is AMP up? AMP’s price has increased today. Additionally, the coin has experienced a considerable gain of 1.70% over the last 24 hours. The price is trading at $0.00422, which is in the average range as the bulls remained in the lead. Will AMP reach $0.010? AMP’s resistance level is at $0.006, yet a break above this level is possible if sufficient buying momentum builds. A break near or above $0.010 will require a more robust push but isn’t impossible, as the coin achieved this level on December 3, 2024. What will AMP price target be in 2025? The highest price target for AMP in 2025 is $0.00907. Will AMP ever reach $1? Amp has never spiked above the $0.12 level. Even this price mark was observed only once at the start of the token’s launch, and AMP has never seen this level again. It seems highly unlikely for AMP to achieve $1 soon. Will AMP reach $10? According to the price prediction, AMP will not achieve this level in the next 10 years until something unusual happens. Considering AMP’s current market cap of only $423.6 million, the scenario seems almost impossible. What will AMP be worth in 2030? The highest price of AMP in 2030 is expected to be around $0.0342. Does AMP have a good long-term Future? Amp is trading near its average price level if observed over the longest price period levels. It can be a good long-term investment, as its price is expected to double in 2025 and reach $0.0393 by 2031.

AMP historic price sentiment The AMP token was officially launched on September 11, 2020, with an initial price of $0.009. In its early months, AMP experienced a downward trend, hitting an all-time low of roughly $0.0007 on November 17 of the same year. AMP price history However, the token reversed its fortunes entering 2021. It surpassed its launch price, reaching a notable high of about $0.046 on February 14, 2021. The momentum continued, and by April 18, AMP’s price peaked at $0.064. AMP set new records, reaching a high of $0.077 on May 7, 2021, and then $0.12 on June 16, following its listing on the prominent cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase. Despite these spikes, the overall trend for the rest of the year was bearish. By September 2021, AMP had fallen below the $0.05 mark as per crypto market data. In January 2022, AMP declined further to $0.02. The bear market proved challenging, and by June of that year, AMP’s price had fallen below its initial launch price. On September 7, it hit a 52-week low of $0.0054. In 2023, AMP attained a maximum price of $0.00642 and a minimum price of about $0.00146. Near the end of the year, AMP was trading at $0.0035. At the start of 2024, AMP gradually started its bullish cycle and reached $0.0056. On March 13, it peaked at $0.0129 before reversing. For May, June, and July, the AMP token continued its slow descent from the $0.0081 level to reach $0.0040, almost losing 40% of its value in three months. At the start of August 2024, AMP continued following the downtrend, reaching $0.0031, but made high spikes, leveling back to $0.00342 on August 25. In September 2024, the AMP token spiked as high as $0.00446 briefly, but in October, the AMP price dipped to the $0.00362 level. In November, AMP touched the $0.00800 mark and spiked higher to $0.0119 on December 8, 2024. AMP then corrected into 2025 below the $0.00649 mark in January and $0.00594 in February. In March, AMP came further down to the $0.0051 level.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,TRADING|FIAT|BUSINESS|MARKET|EXCHANGE|OTHER|ICO|BLOCKCHAIN|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-15 17:25:00

Bitcoin ETFs, which saw significant inflows following their U.S. launch in January last year, have experienced major outflows, losing about $3.8 billion since Feb. 24 of this year, according to Farside Investors data. Meanwhile, gold ETFs recorded their highest monthly inflows since March 2022 last month, according to the World Gold Council . These flows have meant that gold ETFs have now “reclaimed the asset crown over bitcoin ETFs,” as Bloomberg Senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said on social media. Spot bitcoin ETFs listed in the U.S. firs t surpassed gold ETFs in assets under management in December 2024 as the cryptocurrency market surged after Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential elections. Meanwhile, gold has been seeing a significant run. This Friday, it exceeded the $3,000 per ounce mark for the first time ever, with gold futures for April delivery breaking through the same level earlier in the week. Market volatility and geopolitical uncertainty have been helping the price of the precious metal rise as demand for a safe haven continues to grow.Read more: Gold's Historic Rally Leaves Bitcoin Behind, But the Trend May Reverse",Markets|Bitcoin ETF|Gold,EN,0,0,FIAT|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-15 17:26:13

The upward momentum of Solana is linked with its ability to stay strong following updates to the network and a price recovery for Dogecoin from $1.6 to $1.7 coupled with a doubling in the number of active addresses hints at renewed confidence in the coin. Excitingly, alongside these developments, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is on a presale roll, accumulating $3,400,000 and gaining 5,700 holders. As Phases 3 hits full sprint towards a sell-out, the question remains: can Mutuum Finance (MUTM) replicate the projected pump of both SOL and DOGE? Solana (SOL) a Technical Crossroad Solana (SOL) is trading at $124.61, experiencing a bumpy road following a fall from January’s peak of $294. Bearish pressure emerges from technical indicators, yet projections indicate a 2025 recovery to $293.76. Long-term optimism is supported by the scalability of the network and a growing ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). But Solana (SOL) congestion problems and competitive pressures remain. A clear break above $200 could reignite an upward momentum back towards Solana (SOL) target of $359.5. As Solana navigates the line between development and disruption, investors are keeping their eyes peeled. The Speculative Surge of Dogecoin Dogecoin’s 2.8% increase to $1.7 is reflected in whale accumulation—1.7 billion DOGE bought in 72 hours Analysts connect that activity to speculation about a potential spot ETF, which is similar to historical precedent with Bitcoin. Technical charts signal a crucial support level at $1.6; holding this floor could bounce DOGE on a path to $0.5. The RSI pattern of the token resembles those before previous rallies, namely an 187% rise in February 2024. Skepticism abounds regarding its utility, but Dogecoin remaining a community-driven force brings the $3 target still alive for enthusiasts. The Momentum of Mutuum Finance’s Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) launches Phase 3 of its presale at $0.02, having raised $3.4 million from 5,700 investors. The price for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens in the next phase of the crowd sale will be $0.025, representing an immediate gain of 25% for the current holders. Tokenomics Detail $0.06 Listing Price for 200% Profit at Launch After Mutuum Finance (MUTM) listings, analysts see it up to around $3.50—a 17,400% climb vs this stage—thanks to buy pressure inherent to the lending model. Unlike SOL and DOGE, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has real DeFi utility, such as peer-to-peer lending and interest-earning mtTokens. Security and Momentum The smart contract audit of Muutum Finance with certik has reached the final stage and all results will be out soon on official channels. This move strengthens transparency as the MUTM presale progresses. The platform’s revenue-sharing mechanism — buying back tokens to distribute to stakers — generates persistent demand, unlike the speculative boom and bust cycles of meme coins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a structured introduction to DeFi’s lending sector as Solana and Dogecoin chase lofty targets. The quick fill rate of Phase 3 highlights the urgency of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) investors wanting to get in and the first participants are in line to cash out with explosive returns. Can we expect a similar ascendancy for Mutuum Finance (MUTM), as we’ve seen with SOL and DOGE? Its unique value proposition could lead to a truly unique trajectory, based on market dynamics at play.

If the market price reaches $0.72 then this represents a significant 1,706% growth from the current value. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents the biggest risk because it remains in its presale stage at only $0.02. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) experts predict $13 as its next target price which will produce a staggering 64,900% rise surpassing Cardano (ADA) growth potential. Active investors follow the race between these two assets because they expect either one to achieve the predicted massive gain first. The Crypto community considers Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to be an upcoming interest platform because analysts predict it will become the top winner in this market. Mutuum Finance Phase 3 presale. Investors acquired more than 5600 presale tokens to produce a dynamic level of investor support worth $3.3 million. Mutuum Finance Phase 3 token purchasers in their purchase phase can expect double returns worth $0.06 during the exchange launch period. Cardano’s Path to $13: A Potential Breakout Ahead Analysts forecast Cardano (ADA) will surge to $13 according to their findings about the market environment under a Donald Trump presidency. ADA presents itself as one of the most promising blockchain assets because its current value at $0.72 indicates the possibility of a 1,706% surge. A constant rise in value results from network maintenance upgrades and growing market acceptance together with scalable design improvements. Investors continuously explore promising crypto opportunities because ADA maintains its position as a strategically significant asset for long-term gains. Mutuum Finance Presale Investors show growing interest in Mutuum Finance because they continue to support its project development regardless of Cardano’s market performance. During the pre-sale phase investors achieved an outstanding milestone by providing more than $3.3 million in funding for reaching 5600 participants. The token value of MUTM tokens showed growth during Phase 3 initial stages and continues increasing toward its launch price expectation of $0.06. Mutuum Finance introduces a dual-lending framework to enhance decentralized loans by meeting all requirements held by borrowers and lenders. The P2C system controls automated liquidity pools to modify interest rates which optimizes capital efficiency. Users can establish straight loan terms when intermediaries are eliminated by P2P exchanges because this system represents a superior way of managing worldwide assets. Users benefit from automated security for transparent transactions while having the capability to choose either fixed or variable interest rates in the system. The platform establishes trust for users because it subjects itself to external audits and makes all its smart contracts available as open-source code with full visibility. Strategic Growth & Community Rewards The Mutuum Finance platform undergoes continuous success development because it employs a buyback strategy together with revenue sharing (staking rewards) mechanisms within enduring economic frameworks. Future listings of new exchanges will improve inter-user accessibility while enhancing marketplace liquidity because of rising demand for this platform. $100,000 Giveaway Mutuum Finance rewards its first users by distributing $100,000 worth of MUTM tokens through a ten-participant giveaway with each participant receiving $10,000 in tokens. The referral program accelerates organizational growth by offering bonus rewards which users receive for introducing new investors to the community. Cardano (ADA) faces stiff competition from Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in their race toward $13 because MUTM expects a 64,900% growth that places it ahead in this contest. The dual-lending revolution, strong investor support and growth-oriented programs has propelled Mutuum Finance to gain substantial market dominance in decentralized finance. Early investors can take advantage of the current $0.02 presale price to obtain substantial gains because the Phase 3 pricing will not change. Purchase MUTM tokens today in DeFi since the prices will escalate so join in on the future of decentralized finance.

Some analysts suggested that a rebound could be around the corner as whales continue to bet on the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Rejection At $84,000, But Analysts Show 2020 Similarities – Recovery Ahead? Chainlink Recovers Critical Support On Friday, Chainlink surged over 10% to turn the $14 resistance into support again. The cryptocurrency lost this crucial level on Monday following the recent crypto market crash, which saw Bitcoin (BTC) fall to its lowest price in months. During the correction, LINK dropped to a four-month low at $11.71, retesting its post-election breakout levels for the first time since late November. Over the past three days, the token hovered between the $12.5-$13.5 price zone, failing to break above the range’s upper boundary and retest the $14 mark until today. It’s worth noting that this level has been a critical support during LINK’s past rallies, serving as a key breakout and bounce point in the previous cycle, Q1 2024’s high, and the post-US election pump. Moreover, whenever this level has been lost, it has led to long accumulation periods for the cryptocurrency. After today’s surge, LINK has reached a high of $14.71 before retracing to the $14.4-$14.5 price range over the past few hours. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that holding its current level “could set the stage for a rebound to $24.” As Martinez has pointed out, Chainlink has been in an ascending parallel channel since July 2023, moving between the pattern’s upper and lower boundary over the last year and a half. LINK surged to the channel’s upper trendline every time it retested the lower zone before dropping back, repeating the cycle. Based on this, the recent recovery of the parallel channel’s lower range could send the cryptocurrency to the mid-zone of the pattern before a climb to the upper boundary. “A Spike in buying pressure at the current levels can help Chainlink rebound to the upper boundary at $45,” the analyst explained. Is LINK Poised For A Reversal? Notably, whales had bought over 3 million LINK in five days, Martinez pointed out on Tuesday, and online reports revealed that an address has continued to purchase Chainlink during the rest of the week. Lookonchain recently reported that a large-scale address has “spent 12.1 million USDC to buy 863,174 LINK at $14,” holding a total of 1.07 million tokens, valued at $15.53 million. Additionally, the address has a long position on LINK, worth $31 million. Analyst AMCrypto Alex pointed out that LINK remained in its long-term uptrend channel despite Tuesday’s low. However, he considers there is a high chance that the token will retest the $10 mark before the bottom formation. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Retests Crucial Support Level – Is A 50% Price Drop On The Horizon? Meanwhile, trader Crypto Rand suggested that Chainlink is ready to bounce as “LINK marines are getting ready for the bull reversal.” The market watcher pointed out the cryptocurrency has been forming a falling wedge pattern since the start of 2025, and the $14 support recovery is “pushing for the breakout.” A breakout from the pattern’s upper trendline, which is around the $14.5 mark, could propel the token’s price to a 30% surge near the $20 barrier. As of this writing, LINK is trading at $14.51, an 11.6% surge in the daily timeframe.

These digital assets are catching the attention of large investors known as ""whales."" This article explores the top coins poised for significant growth, based on the trends and moves in the market. Readers will discover which cryptocurrencies are primed for a surge. SUI Volatility: Short-Term Dip Amid Strong Half-Year Growth SUI saw a sharp decline over the past month with a 32.84% drop, while over the last six months it soared by 122.95%. Price swings imply a volatile course, reflecting a period of short-term weakness alongside a strong long-term rally. Recent performance highlights significant disparity between immediate negative momentum and extended growth. Trading now occurs between $2.11 and $3.83, with nearby resistance at $4.83 and solid support at $1.40. Bearish signals persist as momentum and oscillators lean negative, with a 42.26 RSI that does not signal strong buying pressure. Watching the support area and potential breakout above resistance could drive trading decisions as the market seeks a clearer trend. Avalanche Facing Key Levels Amid Recent Downturn Avalanche experienced a nearly 29% drop over the past month and about a 21% decline over the last six months. A one-week decrease of roughly 6% added to the downward momentum. Price moves have been choppy, indicating persistent weakness without any sudden recovery. Indicators have reflected negative momentum, pointing to continued bearish pressure. Current prices are trading between approximately $17 and $32, with a resistance level at $41 and a second barrier near $56. Bears seem to dominate, although the lack of a clear trend could allow for a bounce if buyers engage near the support at $11. Traders might consider strategies to capitalize on potential movements within these key levels. Stacks Shows Significant Declines in Recent Months Stacks dropped nearly 34% over the last month and faced a decline of almost 58% in the past six months. Weekly losses of about 8% highlight the ongoing downward trend. The price has oscillated within a narrow range from $0.58 to $1.21 during this time. Momentum and oscillator readings confirm sustained bearish activity, indicating ongoing pressure in recent periods. Current prices trade between $0.58 and $1.21 with immediate support near $0.32 and resistance around $1.60. Bearish forces currently dominate, with no clear upward trend in sight. Traders may consider buying near the support level while looking to short near the resistance, exercising caution in a market characterized by limited price movement. Arbitrum ARB: Bearish Retracement with Key Levels to Watch ARB prices dropped 26% in one month and fell nearly 29% over the last six months. The coin traded within a range of $0.297 to $0.599, demonstrating a consistent decline that signals fading buyer interest and increasing selling pressure. The current price is set between $0.297 and $0.599, with clear support at $0.17 and resistance near $0.78, followed by a second resistance at $1.08. Negative indicators and waning momentum show a market led by bears with no clear trend. Traders might consider waiting for a bounce at support before testing the resistance level for any signs of reversal. Conclusion SUI , AVAX , STX , and ARB have emerged as strong candidates favored by large investors. These coins are gaining attention due to their innovative features and potential for growth. As the market steadies, these coins may offer significant returns. Investors are watching them closely, reflecting a belief in their future performance.

The Leverage Shares 2X Long Coinbase Daily ETF (COIG) is designed to deliver twice the daily return of Coinbase’s stock price, offering traders an amplified exposure to the U.S.’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. The ETF, which carries an expense ratio of 0.75%, is listed on Nasdaq, according to a press release. The launch comes amid a significant cryptocurrency market downturn that saw bitcoin (BTC) drop by around 19% over the last three months, from over $105,000 to now stand at wrought $84,000. COIN shares saw even worse performance, losing nearly 42% of their value during the same period. The new ETF allows investors to take advantage of Coinbase’s stock performance volatility without directly holding shares. These types of single-stock leveraged ETFs, for both longs and shorts sides, are typically used for short-term trading due to the high levels of risks associated with daily compounding. The profits and losses for both types of these are amplified when the prices of the underlying stocks move significantly.

He is unfazed despite the S&P 500 entering into correction territory after dropping over 10% since its February high. O’Leary expects the market to recover from the dip soon. In an interview with Yahoo Finance, O’Leary said that tariffs should be seen as “negotiating tools of economic warfare.” His statement follows Trump’s 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The US has further threatened to impose 200% tariffs on French champagne and European alcoholic beverages. Trump’s latest threat was in retaliation for the EU’s plan to impose tariffs on American whiskey products. The US stock market endured its highest three-week sell, with the S&P dropping to its lowest value in six months. Addressing the recession concerns, the Shark Tank judge said, “I’m in the camp that says Trump doesn’t want to trash the market indefinitely.” Shark Tank’s Kevin O’Leary doesn’t see a recession in the near future He believes Trump’s actions will not harm the market for an extended period. He is only focusing on balancing global trade for the United States. The ongoing correction is just short-term and will be resolved before next year’s midterm election. O’Leary said the recent sell-off should be seen as the ideal time for investments. Large companies are trading previously expensive stocks at much lower and more attractive prices. This provides upside potential for investors to buy into established companies. He mentioned the Russell 2000 index, which is “fraught with value all over the place.” The shark himself has invested more into index funds as they’re “on sale.” He says people are overreacting as if the world is ending when the situation is not really alarming. He said investors should focus on long-term gains and buy the dip rather than panic. Nobody likes volatility, but as an investor, you learn that you have to hold your nose, and when there’s blood in the streets, you have to be buying,” added O’Leary. O’Leary, who was given the title of “Mr Wonderful” for his sharp financial advice and blunt attitude, doesn’t “see the recession” anytime soon. He said, “I’m not saying we won’t have one, but I don’t see it yet.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

With selling pressure, dominating the market, SHIB is struggling to regain momentum, thus the question, when will the meme coin end its 100 day price downtrend. SHIB price today trades at $0.0000127 with a marginal 0.7% increase in 24 hours. When Will the 100-Day Shiba Inu Downtrend End? Shiba Inu price has been stuck in a persistent downtrend for more than 100 days as depicted on the daily price chart. This downtrend follows reduced interest in meme coins as crypto traders turn away from more speculative assets. SHIB price has been forming lower highs and lower lows, as selling pressure increases. During this period, SHIB’s market cap has dropped by more than 50% from $16 billion to the current $7 billion. For a SHIB’s price rally to happen and invalidate this prolonged bearish structure, it needs to break resistance at the descending trendline. The major resistance level is at $0.0000136, and if SHIB can move above this level, it could flip the market structure to bullish. If SHIB can successfully breach the $0.0000136 resistance, a significant 108% rally would follow that would propel SHIB towards the 79% Fibonacci level of $0.0000286. This rally largely depends on buyers and whales accumulating buying the meme coin to push the price higher. On the other hand, if the Shiba Inu price continues to move within this descending trendline and fails to make a breakout, the downtrend will persist. This will support a bearish Shiba Inu price prediction that will drop the meme coin to support at $0.0000108. SHIB/USDT: 1-Day Chart Shibarium Network Approaches 10M Block Record One of the factors that could push Shiba Inu price out of the 100-day downtrend is the growth of the Shibarium network. Per Shibariumscan, the number of blocks on the network now stands at 9.94 million, and could soon hit the 10M milestone and ignite a massive rally for the meme coin. Shibariumscan Despite this growth, the layer 2 network continues to see reduced adoption. Data from DeFiLlama indicates that the Total Value Locked (TVL) on the network has dropped from $6 million to around $1.81 million, which is a nearly six times drop. As network activity drops, Shiba Inu price may continue to face bearish headwinds that will extend the 100-day decline and push it to the $0.0000108 support level. However, if the $10M block milestone helps to drive adoption, it could spark a bullish reversal for SHIB.

However, as we’ve mentioned time and time again, corrections in the market – any market – are healthy. Even better, we’ve noticed a rare bullish signal in Bitcoin. Spoiler alert: it’s one of the strongest (because it’s pretty much worked every single time) technical patterns as far as $BTC is concerned. US Dollar Strength Index (DXY) Hints at Bitcoin Reversal First things first, it’s important to understand that Bitcoin has an inverse correlation with the US Dollar Strength Index (DXY). Simply put, Bitcoin’s price increases whenever DXY is sloping downwards and vice versa. The DXY decreased by over 3.4% in a single week recently. Such a rapid fall in the DXY has only occurred thrice before, and each of those instances saw $BTC shed its sluggishness and rally violently to new highs. To further understand just how prominent this bullish signal is, let’s take an in-depth look at what happened in the past – seeing as in the markets, past action is a strong predictor of future prices. In 2015, DXY fell sharply, and Bitcoin climbed by over 200% in just a few months. The first few months of 2020 saw the exact same thing unfold, i.e., DXY sloped downwards and BTC sloped upwards simultaneously. The latest and greatest instance was during the 2022 bear market recovery, when a decline in DXY was followed by a long-drawn consolidation in $BTC – and then a sharp move upwards. Bitcoin’s Chart Also Screams Bullishness In addition to an inverse relationship with DXY, Bitcoin’s chart is also showing a handful of positive signs. On the weekly chart, $BTC is taking support on the 50 EMA (Exponential Moving Average). Furthermore, it has formed a pretty neat hammer candle, which is a classic buy signal. On the 4-hour and 1-hour timeframes, Bitcoin is hovering over the 10 & 20 EMAs, which are both sloping upwards. This is a strong indicator of an upcoming price explosion towards the upside. If you’re looking to make the most of the forthcoming Bitcoin (and crypto) rally, here are the best new presales to buy. Since these are tokens that haven’t yet been listed, you can grab them for astonishingly cheap prices. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best New Presale to Buy to Get Behind Bitcoin’s Growth With Bitcoin finally showing some serious intentions to rally upwards, it’s worth backing a project like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . It is, after all, a meme coin that can help you maximize your earnings from Bitcoin’s growth. Here’s how: As a token holder, you’ll receive free $BTC via airdrops. Just make sure you buy and hold $BTCBULL in Best Wallet . Secondly, because these $BTC airdrops are slated to take place every time Bitcoin reaches a new milestone ($150K, $200K, $250K, and so on), the price of the $BTCBULL token, too, will rise by leaps and bounds. Also, given that BTC Bull Token works on meme coin fundamentals, it’s expected to generate better returns than Bitcoin. Expert BTC Bull Token price predictions suggest the token could reach $0.0084 by the end of 2025. That’s a nearly 3.5x return on your investment – provided that you get in now when the token is in presale ($3.6M+ raised) and available at some of its lowest ever prices. 1 $BTCBULL is currently selling for just $0.00241. 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – First-Ever Solana Layer-2 Currently in Presale Bitcoin might be the biggest cryptocurrency out there, but blockchain networks like Solana have occupied a significant place in the crypto economy, too. And with Bitcoin to pull the entire crypto market along with it, an altcoin with real utility like Solaxy ($SOLX) is in a pole position to skyrocket. Solaxy will build the first-ever Layer 2 scaling protocol on Solana. It will provide a much-needed boost to the Solana network, which has recently been struggling with scalability issues and failed transactions. Essentially, the abundance of meme coin launches in the last few months has overwhelmed Solana, and its mainnet is in dire need of some relief. Solaxy will do so by processing transactions away from the network’s primary chain, i.e., on a sidechain. Additionally, since it’s a multi-chain token (works on both Ethereum and Solana), it will leverage Ethereum’s liquidity while providing the same top-notch security and affordability that Solana is known for. It’s also among the hottest presales of 2025 , having already amassed over $26.4M. You can join the hype by shelling out just $0.001664 per token. Check out our guide on how to buy Solaxy for more info. 3. Bitcoin Pepe ($BPEP) – Fascinating New Project Aiming to Create Bitcoin L2 Bitcoin Pepe calls itself the ‘World’s ONLY Bitcoin Meme ICO.’ Although we still believe BTC Bull Token to be the king of all Bitcoin meme coins , it’s worth noting that $BPEP, unlike $BTCBULL, is actually based on the Bitcoin blockchain. $BPEP’s aim is simple. It wants to combine Bitcoin’s class-leading liquidity and security with Solana’s speed and low fees and use that to create a meme layer-2 network on Bitcoin. By becoming a hub for meme coin activities within the Bitcoin ecosystem, Bitcoin Pepe plans to kickstart a new era of DeFi and meme coin trading on the world’s most popular blockchain. The project, which is currently in its presale, has witnessed significant investor interest. It has managed to raise a whopping $4.8M so far, and you can currently buy one token for an extremely low price of $0.0281. Bottom Line To conclude, Bitcoin has by no means fallen out of favor in the market. With a rare and extremely strong buy signal in DXY divergence and several other technical analysis confluences in play, the OG crypto is highly likely to start an upmove sooner rather than later. Although $BTC itself as well as the other top cryptos mentioned in this guide can easily make you a crypto millionaire in 2025, it’s important to not go into overdrive. That means only investing a sum that’s small enough for you and doing your own research before diving in. Remember, none of the above is a substitute for professional financial advice.",Cryptocurrency Market News,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-03-15 17:53:21

BinoFi (BINO) is one such standout. With its rapid surge in market adoption and innovative features, BinoFi has become the talk of the town among Solana investors, many of whom are setting their sights on a $4 price target. For those seeking a potential breakout cryptocurrency, BinoFi’s trajectory could be the opportunity they've been waiting for. Innovation at Its Core BinoFi’s impressive investor buzz stems largely from its innovative approach to the future of cryptocurrency. At a time when blockchain platforms face criticism for being either too costly, too centralized, or too fragmented, BinoFi offers key solutions to these problems with a hybrid CEX/DEX exchange model. This hybrid platform combines the best of centralized exchanges (liquidity and speed) with decentralized exchanges (security and transparency). It’s not just a step forward; it’s a leap into a new era of trading that appeals to both institutional investors and retail traders alike. Investors recognize that this dual utility sets BinoFi apart from other projects crowding the space. Equally impressive are its gasless transactions, a feature designed to eliminate a notorious bottleneck in blockchain usability. High fees have long plagued networks like Ethereum, limiting accessibility for smaller investors. By providing a gasless trading experience, BinoFi creates an equitable, user-friendly environment that lowers barriers to entry and enhances adoption. On top of this, BinoFi’s cross-chain trading technology allows users to execute transactions across multiple blockchains without the need for risky bridges or wrapped tokens. This is a game-changer in a fragmented crypto ecosystem, as it facilitates fluid interoperability and puts BinoFi leagues ahead of competitors struggling with compatibility issues. Market Adoption Spurs $4 Price Target With this robust tech stack and user-centric approach, BinoFi's market adoption has been both fast and widespread. Early milestones, including its CoinMarketCap listing and the upcoming MVP launch, have put it on the radar of major crypto players and retail investors alike. Yet, these are just the stepping stones. The larger story here is investor confidence and anticipation of BinoFi's long-term value growth. Market analysts and blockchain experts point to BinoFi’s innovative features and growing user base as reasons for its impressive price projections. Some forecasters are suggesting a $4 price target, representing significant upside from its current valuation. With BinoFi’s commitment to executing on its roadmap, such a price point doesn’t seem outlandish. For context, investing $1,000 now in $BINO tokens at $0.02 during its current presale phase, the investment will ballon to 15,000 right out the gate, considering the $0,30 listing price, and if the price reaches $4, as analysts suggest, their investment would skyrocket to $200,000. That’s a staggering 19,900% ROI, a figure that’s hard to ignore, even in the high-risk, high-reward world of cryptocurrencies. Expert Opinions Bolster the Buzz The crypto community isn’t the only one rallying behind BinoFi . Industry experts have been vocal about their belief in the platform’s potential. One analyst remarked, “BinoFi is solving some of the most persistent challenges in crypto markets with gasless fees and cross-chain functionality. Its hybrid model is the bridge many users have been waiting for to balance liquidity and security.” Another seasoned investor commented, “At its current valuation, BinoFi is a hidden gem. With its innovative features, it’s not hard to see how it could gain mainstream traction and make the $4 target a reality.” These expert endorsements, combined with BinoFi’s solid technology and community support, amplify the excitement surrounding this ambitious project. The Window of Opportunity For those willing to take early positions in promising crypto projects, there’s no denying that BinoFi is lighting up the investment landscape. Its mix of user-friendly features, rapid adoption, and visionary goals sets the stage for potentially remarkable growth. Final Thoughts BinoFi’s rise as a potential Ethereum and Solana competitor is no coincidence. Its hybrid exchange model, gasless transactions, and commitment to cross-chain functionality highlight its ambition to redefine the standards of crypto trading. Add to that its growing community and impressive milestones, and it’s clear why investors are circling this project in droves. For those looking to invest in the next big blockchain innovation, BinoFi might just be the breakout star of 2025. Whether or not it hits the highly anticipated $4 target, one thing is certain–this is a project destined to make waves in the crypto world.

Yet, in recent weeks, the king of crypto seems to have hit a roadblock on its path back to the it’s all time high $108K. While Bitcoin remains a dominant force, its challenges of scalability, energy consumption, and macroeconomic pressures have left investors questioning its ability to reclaim its previous glory anytime soon. BinoFi (BINO ), a rising star in the cryptocurrency market that is quietly capturing the attention of both retail and institutional investors. With its cutting-edge technology and a clear focus on innovation, BinoFi is emerging as a standout performer in the blockchain space, making waves while Bitcoin appears stuck in consolidation. Why Bitcoin Is Facing Headwinds Bitcoin's inability to surge past the $100K mark is tied to several factors. The ongoing economic uncertainty around global interest rates and inflation has tightened liquidity, reducing capital flow into high-risk assets like crypto. Scalability remains another key issue. While Bitcoin is seen as a store of value, its utility as a transactional currency has always been limited due to slow transaction speeds and high fees. These factors have forced investors to explore more agile, technologically advanced alternatives that better align with the evolving needs of the crypto ecosystem. The Rise of BinoFi (BINO): The Token That’s Turning Heads While Bitcoin struggles, BinoFi has emerged as a beacon of opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on the next big thing in crypto. Positioned as an innovative force in the blockchain sector, BinoFi boasts several groundbreaking features that set it apart from Bitcoin and many of its competitors. Hybrid CEX/DEX Model One of BinoFi's most talked-about features is its hybrid exchange model , which blends the familiarity of centralized exchanges (CEX) with the transparency and autonomy of decentralized exchanges (DEX). This hybrid approach eliminates the need for users to choose between accessibility and control and is already being hailed as a game-changer for crypto trading. Gasless Transactions Transaction costs have long been a pain point in crypto, with high gas fees often deterring smaller investors. BinoFi addresses this issue head-on with its pioneering gasless transaction model. By allowing users to trade without incurring hefty fees, BinoFi significantly lowers the barrier to entry for new market participants and amplifies its appeal to everyday traders. Cross-Chain Compatibility BinoFi also shines with its focus on interoperability. Its cross-chain trading capability allows users to transact across multiple blockchains without relying on cumbersome bridges or intermediaries. With this feature, BinoFi positions itself as a hub for seamless connectivity in a fragmented blockchain ecosystem. Why Investors Are Flocking to BinoFi The buzz around BinoFi is not just about its technology; it’s about its potential for massive returns. Early projections estimate that BinoFi could achieve exponential growth as its user base rapidly expands. Much of this enthusiasm stems from its unique value proposition, which addresses many of the issues currently holding back Bitcoin and other major cryptos. Additionally, BinoFi has already achieved key milestones, including its listing on CoinMarketCap and the successful launch of its MVP (minimum viable product) in a very short time. These achievements, coupled with its innovative features, signal a well-executed roadmap that’s hard to ignore. For many investors, the shift to BinoFi represents a chance to get in on the ground floor of a promising project. While Bitcoin remains a ""safe haven"" for long-term holders, the excitement and potential ROI around BinoFi are difficult to match. What’s Next for Bitcoin and BinoFi? Bitcoin’s path to $108K is far from over, but it will require overcoming significant hurdles and external pressures. Meanwhile, BinoFi is thriving in its role as an emerging disruptor, with all signs pointing to sustained growth in market adoption. With its forward-thinking approach, BinoFi is not just another altcoin–it’s a glimpse into what the future of cryptocurrency could look like. For investors, the choice is increasingly clear. While Bitcoin continues to consolidate, BinoFi offers innovation, accessibility, and enormous potential for returns. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or just starting, keeping an eye on BinoFi might be the smartest move you make this year. Will Bitcoin bounce back and reclaim its throne? Only time will tell. But for now, BinoFi is the story stealing the spotlight in the crypto world.

Synthetix Network price analysis revealed a strong bullish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. The SNX/USD value has hiked up to $0.844 in the last 24 hours. Technical indicators give a negative signal, whereas the price charts depict relatively bullish market conditions. Is SNX a good investment? The Synthetix rebranding in 2018 rejuvenated the ecosystem, which has grown continually with multiple listed synths. Despite concerns over the stability of its stablecoins, SNX, the native token, is set to mark new records, as we shall explore in Cryptopolitan’s SNX price predictions from 2025 to 2031. It is expected that SNX will reach $6.07 by 2030. Why is SNX up? The cryptocurrency market is under bullish pressure, and SNX faces the same sentiment. However, it is discouraging that SNX has been following a bearish price curve after December 8, 2024, over the larger picture. The SNX price has increased to $0.844 as it gained up to 1.90% of its total value in the last few hours. What is the target price for SNX? The target price for SNX is $1.61 for the current year. Will SNX reach $5? The current price action does not justify predicting a $5 target. However, in the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, and if the token maintains its price levels, a recovery can be initiated. It can be expected that SNX will reach $5 by 2029. Will SNX reach $6? According to SNX price prediction, SNX will reach the $6 level by the fourth quarter of 2030. The last time SNX was seen at the $6 level was April 2022. Will SNX reach $10? According to crypto analysts’ price predictions, SNX may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like far target. Will SNX reach $100? No, market analysts don’t expect SNX to reach $100 during the next 10 years. How high can SNX go? The highest expected price for SNX is $6.97, which it will achieve in 2031. Does SNX have a future? SNX is trading significantly lower than its mid-December price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current low price and a favorable future valuation of $6.97 by the end of 2031, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment.

Synthetix historic price sentiment SNX price history Kain Warwick launched Synthetix in September 2017 under Havven (HAV). The HAV Airdrop Campaign ran between 4 and 14 February 2018 and offered two million tokens for around $1 million. On November 30, 2018, Synthetic announced its rebranding from Havven. This included renaming its native token, HAV (Havven token), to SNX. The contract address did not change. It registered its lowest price at $0.03258 on January 5, 2019. Different from most mega-altcoins, SNX did not rally after launch; it consistently traded below $0.5 until the last quarter of 2019. In 2020, it made a mega rally to $7.3. In the 2021 bull cycle, it shot higher, and on February 14, it registered its all-time high at $28.77. It reversed to $5 in July before pumping again to $15 in September. In the 2022 crypto winter, SNX shed most of its value as it retreated to the $2 mark by the end of the year. In 2023, it consistently traded between $1.5 and $3 until the last quarter, when it had its break. In March 2024, SNX reached a high of $5; in July, SNX came down from the $2.01 to $1.65 range. In August 2024, the SNX token’s price dipped as low as $1.20, and September saw a maximum price of $1.71. In October 2024, SNX dipped and became rangebound. It closed the month with a $1.31 price tag, while December saw a stream of improved prices with a peak price of $3.38. During the remainder of December, SNX kept shedding its value, and it entered 2025 with a wave of correction to $1.90. The average price of the SNX token was 1.74 in January and has since corrected to $1.20 in February. In March, SNX price has declined to the $0.89 range.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,SNX|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|BNB|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-15 18:05:00

Crypto enthusiasts watch closely for the next price shifts. Will ADA's sluggish trend reverse, or can XRP sustain its momentum? Discover insights into the potential price movements of these popular coins in this detailed analysis. Cardano's Six-Month Surge vs. Recent Pullback Price slid about 6 percent over the past month while recording a striking 122% gain over the past six months. The coin experienced a temporary downturn that contrasts with its impressive long-term growth. Historical performance reflects a shift from minor short-term weakness to robust upward momentum in recent months. Current prices hover between $0.4443 and $0.8893. Immediate resistance is set near $1.15, while support is identified around 0.26. Bears exert some control in the short term with mixed indicators like an RSI of 48.11, suggesting no clear trend yet. Trading strategies might target moves within these levels, awaiting clearer trends to confirm a bullish reversal. Upward Surge Amid Mixed Short-Term Performance XRP experienced a minor decline of 0.72% over the past month, yet it recorded an impressive six-month surge of 329.99%. Recently, a one-week increase of 2.89% suggests a potential bounce back, following a brief selloff. This half-year gain indicates strong momentum amidst market volatility, highlighting the dynamic trading environment surrounding the coin. Currently, XRP is trading between $1.60 and $2.88, with resistance at $3.61 and support at $1.06. The market shows a balance between bulls and bears, as the RSI remains around 52 and oscillators signal a slight negative trend. Traders could explore buying near support levels while monitoring for a breakout toward the $3.61 resistance. Conclusion ADA is facing a tough time with a potential downturn, while XRP shows a short-term rise. Both coins have active communities hoping for bullish moves. ADA needs strong support to avoid further decline. XRP's recent gains have lifted spirits, but sustaining momentum is key. The next few days will be crucial. Monitoring market trends and investor behavior can provide insights into the future direction for both ADA and XRP. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Speaking at the Credit Opportunities Symposium held at New York University on Friday, the Avenue Capital Group co-founder highlighted the risks of market unpredictability. “The problem for markets is when they don’t know what to do,” Lasry said. “An economy can’t survive like that. It slows everything down and can send the economy into recession.” Lasry acknowledged that the economy remains strong, but he noted that uncertainty about the direction of the economy could drive more investors to the credit markets as stock returns look increasingly unpredictable. Lasry’s comments came as the S&P 500 Index fell for a fourth straight week, taking its year-to-date losses to about 4.5%. Meanwhile, U.S. investment-grade bond spreads widened to their widest levels since September, signaling rising credit risk.

According to the latest post by the producers of the movie, it will be available on streaming platforms like Prime and Apple TV, starting from April 15. In the teaser that was made available on blogging platform X, pre-orders are also open to users who want to support the feature documentary. The released trailer features the life of Vitalik Buterin as a young prodigy who set out to reimagine the internet. The movie takes a close look at the life of the inventor, through his early years, right up to the moment he became a leader in the technology space. The documentary also features Ethereum, and how it evolved over the years into a global movement, becoming a billion-dollar project in the rising cryptocurrency industry. The movie looks at Ethereum through the lenses of Buterin and how he has been able to redesign the future of the internet through the project. Vitalik Buterin’s documentary captures Ethereum’s history The highlights captured in the trailer, show the humble beginnings of Vitalik Buterin, with a scene showing him a little boy of about five years wielding a bat in a garden. It also captures the several stages of development that Ethereum has undergone since its inception, showing several integral stages where the project hit milestones.

You can preorder today to give the film a boost. pic.twitter.com/DKBEVAQ7Ao — Vitalik: An Ethereum Story (@EthereumFilm) March 14, 2025 In addition, the footage also showed the NFT gold rush, the battle for the king of the internet and the multiple periods of collapse that the industry has suffered during the blockchain era. Other details in the trailer showed the step-by-step software upgrade of the Ethereum blockchain, headed by an unreluctant leader whose genius mind got him the deserved spotlight. Ethereum has come a long way since it launched on July 30, 2015, with its Genesis block containing 8,893 transactions. The initial set of transactions on Ethereum’s Frontier allocated different amounts of Ether tokens to different wallet addresses, introducing a block reward of about 5 ETH. Since then, the blockchain has evolved, seeing a lot of creations and other decentralized blockchain solutions like that of competitors Cardano and Solana. Crypto community members share reactions to the documentary Since its creation ten years ago, Ethereum has fought for its place, with the project currently sitting comfortably in second place in terms of market capitalization. The project has also enjoyed the support of its crypto community members, who have watched Ethereum’s price go from under $1 in 2015 to about $4,891 in November 2021, the token’s all-time high to this day. The token has suffered a lot of pullbacks following several bear markets, it is now trading at about $1,921 at the time of writing. In a previous post by the handle in charge of the documentary, it noted that the documentary is available on all Emirates and Cathay Pacific flights. “Small first step of our mainstream distribution, Vitalik: An Ethereum Story documentary is now available on any Emirates and Cathay Pacific flight! More exciting updates to come,” the post said. Meanwhile, the documentary has been met with mixed reactions from members of the crypto community on X. While most of them believe that the premiere could send the price of Ethereum to the moon, others are anticipating the release of the documentary just to get to know Vitalik Buterin better. According to a user, he expects it to be a good watch for both the crypto and non-crypto people. “Very different from crypto to sentiment. Brings back the big vision of the Internet running on Ethereum for its unique properties, cyberpunk Ideals, unique positive sum community that builds & invests to help people in the world with real solutions,” a user added, noting that watching the trailer gives him a bullish sentiment about Ethereum.

Many crypto companies had trouble with the agency because they did not know which rules applied to their businesses. The new SEC Commissioner, Hester Peirce, has created a new task force. This task force aims to set clear rules instead of suing and punishing crypto companies. This change occurred when President Donald Trump returned to the White House. He has plans to support crypto innovation while tackling fraud and security issues. US SEC Unveils New Vision for Crypto Regulation In a recent interview, Peirce shared her plan to bring clear rules to crypto regulation, supported by SEC Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda. This is a shift from the old approach, where companies often face legal action without clear regulatory guidance. The SEC is holding a crypto policy conference on March 21 to discuss how digital assets should be regulated. Regulators, industry leaders, and policymakers will attend to help create clearer rules for the crypto industry. SEC’s Push for Clearer Crypto Policies with Industry Input Peirce wants the SEC to work with industry experts to create fair policies for crypto. The SEC’s task force has already sent out 50 questions to gather feedback from industry leaders. These questions focused on tokenized securities, decentralized finance (DeFi), stablecoins, and crypto trading. The SEC Commissioner said the response has been positive so far. Experts have raised issues like defining digital assets and balancing consumer protection with innovation. Peirce also notes that some challenges, like stablecoin legislation, need Congress’ attention. Whether the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) should oversee market structure remains. SEC Moves Towards Clarity and Fairness for Crypto Under Peirce’s leadership, the SEC is stepping away from its previous focus on lawsuits. The agency has already taken steps in this new direction by ending some legal battles, including a high-profile case against Coinbase and not limited to OpenSea . This plan aims to make fair rules so businesses in the United States can grow without worrying about lawsuits. Congress and the Supreme Court are watching the SEC and may step in if the agency fails to provide regulatory clarity. Also, pro-crypto Paul Atkins is set to become SEC chairman. His leadership could further support Peirce’s vision and give the crypto industry the clear rules it has wanted for years.

MUTM has now garnered over 5,700 holders and raised $3.4 million in funds, with the move underlining increasing institutional interest. Phase 3 is being filled quickly after a subsequent price increase to $0.025 in the next stage, providing early investors with immediate gains. This has led for the token’s unique economic model to be garnering attention for its unique economic model being viewed as a high-potential altcoin to speculative assets such as Solana, and with an exchange listing at $0.06 to $4.2 post-launch target. Presale Momentum Builds Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is seeing never-before-seen demand in its third presale phase which has been augmented by a 25% price increase that is set to occur in phase four. At the current $0.02 price, investors will make an instant profit when phase two activates the $0.025 valuation. With the protocol’s clear tokenomics and real-world utility in decentralized lending, over 5,700 holders have already taken their spots. In contrast to the broader bearishness of the market that the Solana network is enduring, the buy-and-distribute mechanism around MUTM generates constant demand, diverting platform revenue into the purchase of tokens. The repurchased tokens are then distributed to stakers, generating cyclical incentives for long-term holding.

Phase-three participants are being offered a launch price of $0.06 — a figure that would yield 200% returns, and while analysts reiterate the climbing price is a net positive, they warn the circuit becomes more difficult as projects yet to be listed demonstrate more volatility. The conservative estimates have MUTM at $4.2 just a few months after launching on the exchanges- a 24,450% price spike from its current presale price. That prediction comes thanks to the platform’s growing usefulness: users deposit assets like ETH or stablecoins and receive interest-bearing mtTokens in return, which accrue value over time and can be swapped across DeFi platforms. At the same time, the protocol’s overcollateralized lending model reduces the risks of default, making it attractive to stability-minded investors concerned about assets such as Solana that do not have integrated financial mechanisms. Security Guaranteed Moving Forward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in the process of completing a Certik audit of its smart contracts, which is expected to inspire confidence among investors once results are published on official pages. The audit is part of the team’s commitment to transparency, which is a positive sign compared to multiple projects that have been prioritizing hype over security. As Solana struggles with on-chain congestion and speculation, MUTM’s focus on real-world DeFi solutions like peer-to-peer lending, shifting interest rates, and liquidity mining makes it a long-term competitor. The Solana billionaire’s turn to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) indicates a strategic reassessment toward projects that combine innovation and practicality. There’s no doubt: Phase three is filling up fast, and the last chance to get tokens at $0.02 is closing. With a $4.2 price projection to reflect a mainstream adoption value, MUTM provides a rare synthesis in accessibility and potential growth—one savvy investors are racing to take advantage of. Act Before Phase Four Timing remains critical. The bulls are out to play and early participants will secure lower prices as they position for cascading gains with the presale stages. In a sea of passing trends, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out by combining DeFi’s world-altering potential with an echo chamber economic model that can ultimately strengthen itself. The roadmap of the project—audit completion, exchange listings, and feature rollouts— paves the way for 2025, which will be a pivotal year. For those looking for assets anchored in utility rather than speculation, MUTM’s third phase represents an opportunity that is impossible to ignore. Because there is only a small quantity of tokens available for the third and final phase—the tokens of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are selling out fast.

A massive whale accumulation by Cardano (ADA) whales is fuelling speculation for a price spike amid rising network activity. Whales Can Send Cardano Price Across The $1 Mark According to an X post by on-chain analyst Ali Martinez, Cardano whales have gobbled up 130 million ADA in the last three days. The total value of ADA accumulated by the whales stands at $97.5 million with retail traders contributing their fair share. Pundits say the recent accumulation spree is an indicator for a potential rally for Cardano price. There is significant optimism that ADA can cross the $1 mark after prices fell to $0.70 . Prior to the decline to $0.70, Cardano’s price traded as high as $1.13 over a 30-day period. Now, rising whale activity is stoking belief for ADA to reclaim its previous highs but several hurdles stand in the way. For starters, the network’s unique wallets trading (UWT) indicator has reached all-time lows. However, analysts say the dip in unique wallets is “the calm before the storm” before the start of a rally. “Usually when the number of UWT dips below 1.5k per day, it doesn’t take long until something happens,” said one analyst. ADA’s Ecosystem Continues To Buzz Despite Price Decline. At the moment, ADA price is floating around the $0.7 mark but the ecosystem is alive with activity. Still reeling from the highs of its inclusion in the Crypto Strategic Reserve , institutional interest is climbing. Furthermore, speculation around ADA for X payments has triggered theories that the asset is headed to $10. Cardano Foundation CEO Frederik Gregaard has confirmed that the network is working with NASA on satellite data and provenance capabilities. Daily trading volumes for ADA stands at $777 million, down by 22.7% over the last. Despite the decline in volumes, analysts say Cardano is on course to flip Solana if it attracts more decentralized applications.

It is also reported that he went to Dubai. A few days earlier, authorities had allegedly agreed to make some changes to the conditions of Durov's detention and supervision at his request. The Telegram founder is a citizen of Russia, France, the UAE and St. Kitts and Nevis. According to French journalist Cyril Amursky, Durov faceв up to 20 years in prison. Detention of Telegram CEO Pavel Durov The businessman was detained at Le Bourget airport on the evening of August 24, 2024. He was charged with, among other things, complicity in the distribution of drugs and child pornography, as well as refusing to provide information requested by authorized authorities. Billionaire Elon Musk called the news of the Telegram founder's detention a ”compelling advertisement” for the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Among other things, it guarantees freedom of speech and press. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin criticized Durov's detention and worried about the ”future of software freedom” in Europe. Journalist Tucker Carlson called Durov's detention a ”living warning” for platform owners who refuse to censor the truth at the request of governments. ”Pavel Durov left Russia when the government tried to control his Telegram. But in the end it wasn't Putin who arrested him for allowing the public to enjoy free speech. It was a Western country, an ally of [U.S. President Joe] Biden's administration and a NATO enthusiast, who locked him up,” he wrote. According to Carlson, clouds are quickly gathering over the once free world. Amid the news, Toncoin (TON) quotes collapsed below the $6 mark. The asset lost 13.2% in 24 hours, according to CoinGecko . Recall, Durov was first included in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index ranking. He took 279th place out of 500 with a fortune of $9.15 billion.

Now, all eyes are on the Ethereum Pectra upgrade as the next spark for an ETH price surge. FloppyPepe (FPPE) , the AI token priced at just $0.0000002 in its presale, isn’t sitting still. After raising nearly $1 million in a sold-out private round within 24 hours, its ongoing presale has already crossed the one million mark—and it’s just getting started. Those on the sidelines might get left watching from afar as FloppyPepe (FPPE) races ahead. Ethereum Pectra Upgrade To Unfold: The Catalyst That Could Send The ETH Price Soaring The upcoming Ethereum Pectra upgrade, combining the Prague and Electra updates, aims to improve scalability, security, and efficiency. Key changes include raising validator staking limits from 32 to 2,048 Ethereum and allowing gas fee payments with stablecoins. These improvements could push the ETH price higher. Originally set for March 2025, the Ethereum Pectra upgrade faced delays due to bugs on the Holesky and Sepolia testnets. With Holesky now stable , testing has resumed, and Ethereum developers are cautiously preparing for a mainnet rollout. While Donald Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve announcement at the crypto summit generated buzz, it failed to drive lasting market momentum. Attention is shifting toward the Pectra upgrade as a stronger catalyst for ETH price growth. Analysts like Javon Marks highlight a hidden bullish divergence in the Ethereum price chart, a pattern suggesting a breakout above $4,850, and clearing that mark could pave the way toward $8,000 and beyond. Ethereum is currently trading at $1907 and is expected to rally. With the Pectra upgrade approaching, technical and fundamental factors could push the ETH price to new all-time highs. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Turns AI And Meme Culture Into Unstoppable Gains Though President Donald Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve made headlines at the crypto summit, the ETH price remains dependent on bullish sentiment fueled by the Pectra upgrade to experience significant growth. At the same time, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is capturing attention by fusing meme culture with AI-driven advancements, making analysts predict a 1,400X rally soon. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is bridging the gap between blockchain and art by partnering with a renowned artist to create handcrafted digital collectibles. This fusion of creativity and DeFi adds intrinsic value and offers a unique blend that appeals to collectors and investors. The meme coin is also set to benefit from the hype surrounding the Donald Trump Bitcoin Reserve, which was a key topic of discussion at the White House crypto summit. The AI token deflationary model, which burns 1% of tokens per transaction, steadily reduces supply while increasing scarcity and redistributing rewards to long-term holders. A SolidProof-audited smart contract further strengthens security, reinforcing trust and stability. Investors are eyeing FloppyPepe (FPPE) to make massive gains with the ETH price failing to be impacted by the Donald Trump Bitcoin Reserve narrative at the crypto summit. FloppyPepe (FPPE) offers an interactive experience through its advanced AI-powered tools. The Meme-o-Matic AI agent, live on Telegram, lets users craft high-quality memes from text, images, and videos, fueling a vibrant, AI-driven community. Taking engagement further, FloppyX, an AI-powered video bot, transforms text inputs into dynamic video content, making up real-time interaction.

It processes inputs from user commands, market data, and on-chain sources to provide real-time responses, visualize trends, and automate actions like crypto alerts. With continuous learning and future upgrades, such as real-time video generation and dApp integration, this intelligent agent is driving FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) ecosystem forward. In contrast, others struggle to keep the spotlight. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Presale: Where Early Birds Catch the Gains FloppyPepe (FPPE) is stealing the spotlight while the ETH price fails to surge, even with Donald Trump's Bitcoin Reserve narrative at the crypto summit. Packed with token rewards, endless entertainment, and a stage-based presale driving explosive early gains, this AI meme token is shaking up crypto. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is making waves with a jaw-dropping presale price of just $0.0000002. Early adopters are already piling in, chasing the next big meme coin explosion. With its AI ecosystem and deflationary model, this new meme coin is set to be a golden ticket for early adopters before its price takes off.

The price could hit a high of $3.99 in 2025. XRP Price Today: XRP value has gained 3.33% in 24-hours to $2.22. Ripple’s XRP finally neared the long-awaited $3 mark after President Donald Trump announced a new U.S. strategic crypto reserve that will include XRP and other digital assets. XRP price is currently up 5% to $2.42. If the bullish momentum sustains, XRP could aim at its next resistance levels at $2.529. On the flip side, if it loses out on steam, XRP price will remain range bound between its key support levels at $2.35 and $2.31. Our XRP price prediction will explore the potential answers to questions such as “Will XRP reach $10 in 2025?” by providing short term and long-term Ripple (XRP) price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $ 2.40348203 2.25% Market cap $ 139,663,744,818.51 Circulating Supply 58,108,919,817.00 Trading Volume $ 3,689,357,567.0948 All-time high $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 XRP Price Prediction 2025 The main factor that will decide XRP’s trend in 2025 is the conclusion of the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit . Which is expected to conclude on the 16th of April. This could finally materialize as the SEC has proposed to classify XRP as a payment, rather than a security. Moreover, the SEC believes that XRP can help release funds stuck in the U.S. Nostro accounts, which can then be used to buy more Bitcoins. There is more positive news for Ripple, as Franklin Templeton has announced filing for an XRP ETF. Once launched, it is expected to be listed on Cboe BZX Exchange. Moreover, Ripple has received approval from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) to offer regulated crypto payments in the Dubai International Finance Centre (DIFC). The exchange inflow vs outflow graph from March 1st to March 11th, shows 501k outflows in comparison to 482k inflows. This signals a spike in strong investor interest, which is a big thumbs up for XRP. XRP Exchange Inflow vs Outflow If things go in favor of Ripple, XRP price could surge to a maximum of $5.81 by the end of 2025. In contrast, if the lawsuit continues, XRP could remain under a narrow range with a potential low of $2.3. That being said, we can expect an average price of $4.89. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2026 5.6 6.25 8.64 2027 7.15 8.89 12.25 2028 11.3 14.11 16.53 2029 13.98 16.48 21.12 2030 16.92 19.87 26.97 XRP Price Prediction 2026 XRP price will likely witness a strong growth in 2026. There is a possibility that XRP can break through the $8.64 level and hold the price by the end of 2026. The minimum XRP price will be around $5.6, with an average trading price of $6.25. This could be a result of Ripple’s role in CBDC development and XRP’s rising institutional demand. XRP Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP’s price will range between $7.15 to $12.25. XRP price might record an average level of $8.89. The reason behind this surge could be due to Ripple’s increasing domination in the payment sector, accelerating XRP’s buying demand and utility. XRP Price Prediction 2028 In 2028, Ripple could increase its use cases, including new dApps and announcements regarding XRP. This might boost the dominance of XRP as the second largest altcoin by market cap. We expect the XRP price to range between $11.3 to $16.53. The average trading price could be around $14.11. XRP Price Prediction 2029 Partnerships with multiple governments and wider adoption might strengthen XRP’s price in 2029. The altcoin might record a trading range between $13.98 to $21.12, with an average price of $16.48. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The long-term XRP price prediction depends on Ripple’s ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market. If everything remains positive, XRP price could scale between $16.92 to $26.97. With that price range, the average tag could be at $19.87. Ripple (XRP) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Based on historic price sentiments and XRP’s rising popularity, here are the long-term XRP price projections for 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040 and 2050.

Source: Coinstats According to Coinmarketcap, ORDi started trading in May 2023 at $25.3466. It later fell, reaching its lowest value of $2.86 in September 2023. Binance listed ORDI on November 17, 2023. However, due to a lack of clear information from Binance, there needed to be more clarity, leading many to mistakenly believe that ORDI was a direct product of the Ordinals protocol. This misunderstanding contributed to ORDI’s dramatic market performance. The meme coin saw a 40% increase in value within a single day, culminating in a 100% rise over four days. Despite these fluctuations, ORDI’s popularity surged, and by the end of 2023, its price had climbed above $50. ORDI peaked in March 2024, hitting an all-time high of $96.17. It later moved into a bear run, and by April, it had already dropped by 50%. It started recovering in November, rising above the $35 mark and crossed in December, trading at $48 The coin crossed into 2025, trading at $35.70. The trend quickly reversed and fell below $12 in February and $10 in March.",Crypto Price Predictions|ORDI,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|ICO|ORDI|ZRX|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-15 18:45:00

41713981,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=693688,1742064329,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41713981.jpeg,New poll shows widespread opposition to US crypto reserve plan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/poll-shows-opposition-crypto-reserve-plan/,"A new poll from the advocacy group Data for Progress has shown that most American voters do not support a crypto strategic reserve. According to the poll results published on March 14, 51% of voters opposed the idea when asked directly. The poll shows that the majority of Democrats and Independents were against the idea, with 59% and 56%, respectively, not supporting it. However, 40% of Republicans also opposed it. This follows President Donald Trump’s signing of an executive order to establish the crypto reserve. Part of the executive order indicates that the US government will acquire Bitcoin and four other digital assets for the stockpile. While the US has not bought any cryptocurrency, it has already created a strategic Bitcoin reserve using the seized Bitcoin. Still, Data for Progress polls show that crypto might be unpopular, as only 10% of voters consider it the highest funding priority for the federal government. Crypto is last on the list of priorities for federal funding (Source: DataforProgress) The organization noted that out of nine potential funding priorities that it identified, including Medicare, Social Security, public infrastructure, and artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency came in dead last. It said: “Only 10% of voters believe the U.S. should increase federal funding for cryptocurrency and blockchain development.” Interestingly, not only did most voters consider crypto the lowest priority for funding, but a sizable portion (45%) also want the federal government to reduce funding for crypto, while 29% think it should stay at the current level. The poll was based on a survey of 1,169 likely US voters nationwide between March 8 and 10, with each respondent self-identifying their party. Congress members question the concept of a crypto reserve The poll highlights the disparity between public opinion and prevailing sentiments in the crypto industry. Although industry stakeholders are divided on which crypto should be part of the reserve, the majority agree that the US should have a strategic Bitcoin reserve and buy more BTC, noting that this could positively impact the US economy. However, most voters do not see things the same way. For many, social programs and infrastructural projects require what the federal government should invest in, not cryptocurrencies. Even 40% of Republicans who are core Trump supporters oppose the digital assets stockpile. Voters are not the only ones with this view, as Democrats in Congress have also pushed against the crypto reserve. The House Oversight Democrats described the idea as a way for Trump to enrich himself and his allies at taxpayers’ expense. According to Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-VA) , the reserve does not offer any clear benefit for Americans and will only waste resources. He noted that the US, through Congress, had created reserves for specific commodities based on their strategic value, especially during economic crises. “No strategic need has arisen that would necessitate investment in the volatile and speculative cryptocurrency market,” Rep. Connolly added. Some Republicans in Congress have equally expressed skepticism about the need for a crypto reserve. Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) told Semafor that while he did not mind the idea, he could not see its utility and that it could affect law enforcement asset forfeitures. “And I don’t like the fact that law enforcement could be negatively impacted in terms of future flows for asset forfeitures,” Senator Thom said. Meanwhile, the impact of the reserve announcement on the crypto industry has already worn off. Bitcoin, which spiked close to $100,000 after the initial announcement, is already down to $84,000, while other cryptocurrencies have also declined in value.

Federal prosecutors say John Khuu illegally imported counterfeit pharmaceutical and MDMA pills from Germany and subsequently used dark web markets to distribute the illicit substances to customers across the US. Khuu, 29, was paid in Bitcoin and other crypto assets, which he and his co-conspirators exchanged for US currency that was then laundered and transmitted to dozens of different accounts. The California resident was indicted in May 2022 in the Eastern District of Texas and charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering. Three months later, Khuu was also indicted in the Northern District of California and charged with unlawful importation of a Schedule I controlled substance. He was arrested by agents in Garden Grove, California a few days after the second indictment. Khuu’s arrest was the result of “ Operation Crypto Runner ,” a multi-agency law enforcement effort that resulted in a batch of charges filed against 21 individuals for their alleged involvement in transnational money laundering networks. Last year, Khuu pled guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business and importation of MDMA. This week, U.S. District Judge J. Campbell Barker sentenced him to 87 months in federal prison.

Support stands at $0.00001263, resistance at $0.00001287 with market sentiment guiding its next move. Investors and traders are closely monitoring for potential breakout or continued consolidation. February Performance: Strong Gains with Resistance In February 2025, Shiba Inu (SHIB) experienced a strong price rally, driven by growing investor interest and positive sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. The price surged to a monthly peak of $0.000017, reflecting solid buying momentum. However, resistance emerged at this level, leading to a pullback. By the end of the month, SHIB had stabilized around $0.00001621, indicating a consolidation phase where buyers and sellers were relatively balanced. While bullish momentum persisted, the asset struggled to maintain higher price levels due to selling pressure. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Action March Market Correction: Price Weakness Emerges As March progressed, SHIB faced downward pressure, dropping to approximately $0.00001278 by mid-month. This decline from February’s peak signaled a market correction. Several factors contributed to this pullback, including shifting investor sentiment, broader market trends, and profit-taking by traders after February’s rally. The decline suggests that buyers remain hesitant at higher levels, contributing to price weakness. However, this correction does not necessarily indicate a long-term bearish trend, as market cycles often include such phases before potential recoveries. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Technical Outlook: Signs of Potential Rebound Despite the recent drop, SHIB retains the potential for recovery. A bullish engulfing pattern has emerged on the weekly chart, suggesting that buying interest remains intact. Additionally, SHIB’s market capitalization is still around $7.53 billion, underscoring its continued relevance in the crypto space. If buyers regain confidence, the price could stabilize and trend upward again. Key Levels to Watch Moving Forward SHIB’s next price movements will depend on critical support level at $0.0000118 and resistance level at $0.000013. If the price reclaims key resistance zones, an upward trend could resume. Conversely, if bearish pressure persists, further declines may occur. Investors should closely monitor market conditions to assess whether SHIB is poised for recovery or a deeper correction in the coming weeks.

She also slammed the White House for “playing this game.” MSNBC Host Rachel Maddow calls Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve a ‘deeply old-fashioned simple scam.’ She draws a striking comparison between crypto and Beanie Babies, saying, “Cryptos operate on the same idea. They have no inherent value at all, but people speculate, hoping… pic.twitter.com/KnJrRWRnDd — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) March 8, 2025 President Donald Trump signed an executive order earlier that day establishing a national digital asset reserve. White House crypto czar David Sacks said , “The US will not sell any Bitcoin deposited into the Reserve. It will be kept as a store of value. The Reserve is like a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency, often called ‘digital gold.'” “It’s worth looking at this crypto thing a little bit,” Maddow said on her show. “Only because it is a deeply, deeply old-fashioned simple scam. At this point, which points right to the White House.” Here’s what Maddow said about Bitcoin and what she got wrong. 1. Unlike Beanies, Bitcoin’s Price Goes Up “Helpfully, the broad strokes of crypto trading are not complicated,” Maddow said. “It’s like when there was the Beanie Baby craze in the late 1990s.” “It was a Beanie Baby trading bubble,” she explained. “Other than some emotional value if you had one as a child, Beanie Babies did not have much inherent value.” “But it was worth buying up a bunch of them because there was speculation on the premise that as collectibles, maybe one day your Beanie Babies collection could be worth a lot of money.” There is, however, a key difference between Bitcoin and Beanie Babies. While Beanie Babies debuted in 1993 at the World Toy Fair in New York City, this toy fad reached its height six years later in 1999. Following the dot com crash in 2000, the auction price frenzy for Babies never recovered to those levels again. To get a realistic idea of the aftermarket value of stuffed toys, one need only study a local thrift store in their city. But unlike Beanie Babies, Bitcoin’s price has been going up ever since it launched on Jan. 3, 2009. That’s 16 years of growth in daily exchange rate for the dollar that dwarves comparable ROIs from the highest- flying tech stocks in the stock market’s entire history. During its periodic bear markets, which have so far occurred on a fairly predictable 4-year cycle, critics have repeatedly called Bitcoin a fad and declared it dead. But every time the skeptics have turned out wrong when the price sets new all-time high records within four years. When it comes to historical records, there is no sensible comparison between Beanie Babies and Bitcoin. While the toy collectibles peaked in 1999 and never recovered, Bitcoin created 84,000 new crypto millionaires in 2024, according to a report on CNBC. 2. Beanie Babies Markets Are Not Liquid or Transparent “Cryptocurrencies operate on the same idea,” Maddow went on in her segment to say. “They have no inherent value at all. The only value they have is that if you have some reason to believe that somebody else might want to buy them from you in the future.” “What that means in very practical terms is that convincing other people that your crypto is popular and in demand— that is key to actually making money.” But it’s not true that cryptocurrencies operate on the same idea as toy and fashion manias or that assets like Bitcoin have no inherent value. Beanie Babies are not a financial product and do not bear qualities that would make them suitable for use as one. It is not as easy as sending an email to exchange a truckload of toy plushies, but it is very nearly that easy to exchange Bitcoin. It’s also unfeasible to keep track of how many Beanie Babies are in the market and post up-to-the-minute daily trading data about each one. It is not only feasible with Bitcoin and other cryptos like the ones going in the national reserve— computer developers engineered them that way. That’s part of the value they provide that makes it possible to use these digital commodities as financial products and investment vehicles: liquidity and transparency. 3. Beanie Babies Are Not Durable and Fungible Like Crypto Meanwhile, Beanie Babies are not durable and fungible like cryptocurrencies. Who wants someone else’s stuffed toy that they’ve been blowing their nose on and rubbing Cheeto grease into? These inventories have market values that are highly sensitive to wear and tear, and the products are very vulnerable to deteriorating into a condition with a resale value marked well below retail. Even when maintained in mint condition, after-market values for toy collectibles are more like the market for used automobiles. After being driven off the lot, they immediately and sharply depreciate. The inventors of crypto assets BTC, on the other hand, paid careful attention to designing their economics or “tokenomics” to optimize them for resale value over time and for the foreseeable future. Cryptocurrencies like the two mentioned above have supply limits that introduce scarcity economics. They are also not subject to deteriorating physical condition. In fact, any unit of Bitcoin is always equal to any other equivalent unit in market value. This is called fungibility, and it is a system requirement for an asset to function as a currency. 4. Beanie Babies Are Not Scarce Like Bitcoin “The idea of hyping cryptocurrency is that people should buy in soon, right?” Maddow continued on her show. “Get in on the ground floor while it’s cheap because it’s about to go way up in value because there’s so much interest in it. If you get in on the ground floor now, then you’ll make a bundle. It’s the whole hype. It’s the whole scam.” While it is true that participants in crypto markets may engage in inauthentic, hyped-up marketing tactics, that doesn’t make the underlying assets a scam. Nor does it mean there aren’t more intelligent reasons why financial geniuses like BlackRock’s Larry Fink , Shark Tank panelist Kevin O’Leary , or Strategy’s Michael Saylor believe investing in Bitcoin and the blockchain is not only not a scam— but the next phase of developing the Internet and human civilization. 5. Bitcoin Commands Real Demand, Not Just Hype After making all these mistakes in her broadcast, Maddow finally undid her own case completely with her closing thoughts on this segment. “Imagine Trump had just announced that the US government was going to buy up tons of Beanie Babies,” the MSNBC host said. “We are going to establish a federal government reserve of billions of Beanie Babies.” “What do you think would happen to the value of Beanie Babies? Turns out there’s a huge guaranteed buyer for these things. They’re buying billions of them.” The answer to her question is: Their value would probably go up like most analysts expect of Bitcoin. Since there’s a huge guaranteed buyer and that buyer is the US government. Not bad for a scam.

Stone” Sfraga, posing as a crypto entrepreneur, was sentenced to 45 months in federal prison for operating a $2 million fraud scheme. Sfraga, a cryptocurrency industry regular, ran a Ponzi scheme disguised as a crypto investment opportunity. Fake Crypto Project and Ponzi Scheme Sfraga lured investors with a 60% return in just three months through his so-called “virtual wallet” scheme. But the scheme never existed. He used the money instead to pay for personal expenses and to repay earlier victims to keep the scheme going. Seinfeld-Inspired Fraud To present his business as legitimate, Sfraga asserted ownership of several firms, including “Vandelay Contracting Corp.,” named after the Seinfeld episode’s make-believe company. This was an added layer of deception, which misled investors into placing their trust in him. 17 Victims Targeted Sfraga’s scams reached as far as Brooklyn, Staten Island, and Long Island and bankrupted at least 17 investors. Some were convinced to loan him huge sums, including one man who entrusted him with $100,000 for what purported to be a construction project. Prosecutor’s Comments U.S. Attorney John J. Durham condemned Sfraga’s actions, citing the economic and emotional losses incurred by victims. Most of the victimized individuals were those he knew personally and with whom he was trusted with their savings. Crypto Scams on the Rise According to a survey by the North American Securities Administrators Association, crypto and social media scams are the biggest threat to retail investors in 2025. Figures indicate that 32% of fraud cases are from social media platforms like Facebook and X, and 31% from messaging apps like Telegram and WhatsApp.",Blockchain|Regulation,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-03-15 18:57:00

While Cardano aims for significant gains in its upcoming rally, Lightchain AI is also generating buzz. With over $17.3 million raised at a presale price of $0.006, Lightchain AI is quickly gaining traction for its unique integration of AI and blockchain technology.

As the market prepares for a breakout, Lightchain AI stands out as a promising DeFi token to watch closely for the next big opportunity. Can Cardano Reach $2.30? ​Cardano’s (ADA) potential to reach $2.30 hinges on various market factors. As of March 6, 2025, ADA is trading at approximately $0.90.

Investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions in the volatile cryptocurrency market.​ Lightchain AI – DeFi Token Everyone’s Buzzing About Move over ADA and SHIB— Lightchain AI is stealing the spotlight in the crypto world.

The altcoin has had to contend with the widespread bearish pressure and worsening investor sentiment in the general crypto market. Chainlink Price Overview On Tuesday, March 11, the Chainlink price succumbed to the market-wide downward pressure that saw the largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin hit $77,000 for the first time in over four months. Other large-cap assets also suffered in this recent market downturn, with the price of Ethereum also dropping beneath $2,000. Related Reading: Dogecoin Recovery In Sight? Key Metrics Predict A Strong Bounce The price of Chainlink appears to be recovering well in the past few days, making a play for $15 on Friday, March 14. In a show of strong resurgence, the altcoin ranked as one of the best daily gainers with an almost 10% positive performance on the day. After initially crossing $14.5 earlier in the day, the Chainlink price has returned to below the psychological $14 level. As of this writing, the price of LINK stands at around $13.83, reflecting an almost 6% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day performance, however, was not enough to wipe off the altcoin’s loss on the weekly timeframe. According to data from CoinGecko, the LINK price is down by more than 13% in the past seven days. Can LINK Price Climb To $16? While the fortunes of the Chainlink price do appear to be changing, a particular price level might be crucial to its long-term trajectory. In a post on X, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez offered insights into crucial on-chain levels for the LINK price. This analysis revolves around the average cost basis of several LINK investors. In cost-basis analysis, the capacity of a level to serve as support or resistance depends on the total amount of coins last purchased by investors in the region. As seen in the chart above, the size of the dot represents and directly corresponds to the number of LINK tokens acquired within a price bracket — while reflecting the strength of each level. Based on this analysis, Martinez noted that the Chainlink price faces major resistance around the $14.88 – $15 region where 15,450 investors bought 107.28 million LINK tokens (worth $1.62 billion at an average price of $15.13). The high investor activity has led to the formation of a supply barrier around the $15.13 region. The Chainlink price is likely to witness significant selling pressure due to investors wanting to sell their tokens after returning to their cost basis, thereby hindering further price increases and leading to price pullback. However, it is worth noting that no significant resistance levels lie beyond this $15.13 price region. Hence, investors could see the price of LINK climb to as high as $16 should it successfully breach the $15 resistance level.

Kusama’s Declining Activity on Social Media Shytoshi Kusama has been noticeably inactive on social media over the past week, a shift from his usual engagement earlier this year. His last direct post on X was on February 21, when he announced enhancements to liquidity pools on ShibaSwap . Since then, his presence has been limited to occasional retweets, with the most recent one from March 7, highlighting a post by Shiba Inu’s partner, Astra Nova. This prolonged inactivity has led to speculation within the community, with some users questioning his whereabouts and others fueling unfounded rumors. Critics have attempted to use his silence to cast doubt on his role within the ecosystem. Lucie Reaffirms Kusama’s Focus on Expanding Shiba Inu In response to concerns, Lucie clarified that Kusama’s reduced social media activity is not cause for alarm. She emphasized that his absence aligns with a strategy he previously communicated, suggesting that he is dedicating more time to expanding Shiba Inu’s global reach. Lucie implied that while Kusama may not be as visible online, he is likely engaged in offline efforts, such as strategic meetings and partnerships aimed at increasing the project’s prominence. She reassured the community that he would eventually return to social media to share updates on his ongoing work. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Not an Uncommon Occurrence Kusama’s limited online presence is not unprecedented. In the past, he has taken similar breaks from social media to focus on other commitments. For instance, in May 2024, he revealed that he had traveled to the Middle East to visit family. However, with SHIB facing challenges in maintaining its position in the market and competition increasing among meme coins, some investors remain cautious. Despite these occasional absences, Kusama has built a reputation as a dedicated figure within the ecosystem. Last year, he shared insights into his work ethic, stating that he sometimes works up to 20 hours a day to advance the project. Even during the holiday season, when most people take time off, he remained active in developing initiatives aimed at strengthening SHIB’s position in the market. As speculation continues, Lucie’s reassurance highlights that Kusama’s current focus remains on the long-term growth of Shiba Inu, with expectations that he will provide further updates once his offline efforts yield tangible results.

We expect the DOGE price to reach a new swing high of $1.07 by the end of 2025. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $0.62 $0.84 $1.07 Can DOGE Break the $1 Barrier? Given DOGE’s success, largely driven by hype with some technical progress, crossing $1 by 2025 remains a realistic possibility. A sustained media frenzy and growing endorsement deals could maintain bullish momentum. Expanded merchant adoption would also strengthen confidence in its long-term viability. Dogecoin’s Tokenomics and Long-Term Outlook The future of Dogecoin hinges on its utility. Meme popularity alone may not sustain it indefinitely, but advancements in transaction fees, speed, and business collaborations could help it thrive as a mainstream digital currency. Its large and passionate community will likely continue to drive positive evolution. Conclusion Given Dogecoin’s past price behavior, driven largely by online hype and media coverage, it has the potential to reach over $1 in 2025.

Key Insights Revealed,https://bitzo.com/2025/03/whats-fueling-the-price-increase-of-kaspa-kas-and-celestia-tia-this-week-key-insights-revealed,"Kaspa (KAS) and Celestia (TIA) have recently caught the eye of investors with their sudden price hikes. This surge has stirred curiosity in the crypto world, prompting many to seek the factors behind it. Discover the reasons driving this upward trend and explore which other coins might be on the verge of growth. Kaspa: Recent Movements Set Up Potential Trading Opportunities Kaspa registered a strong weekly gain of 16.27% before experiencing a 17.44% dip over the past month. The coin’s six-month performance recorded a 52.33% decline, highlighting a period marked by volatility and shifting sentiment. Price movements during these times reflect a turbulent environment, characterized by bursts of optimism followed by significant downturns. Current price action shows support around $0.04 and resistance near $0.15, with an additional hurdle at $0.21. The nearly neutral RSI at 49.29, paired with modest momentum, indicates indecision among traders. Trading ideas include buying near support while closely monitoring the resistance zone for potential breakouts, as the market remains balanced between bullish and bearish influences. Upbeat Celestia Rally Amid Mixed Long-Term Trends Price action showed a monthly boost of about 10% with a one-week surge near 12%, while the six-month performance slipped by 26%. Recent numbers indicate short-term strength contrasting with longer-term weakness. Volatility emerged from swift moves, with buyers stepping in over shorter horizons yet not fully overcoming the extended downtrend. Conditions have generated interest for active trading despite the uneven past performance. Current levels trade in the $2.83 to $4.89 range, with a nearby resistance at $5.71 and support at $1.57. Bulls and bears appear balanced with an RSI around 51, leading to an uncertain trend. Traders might consider entering near support and taking profits near resistance while watching for clear breakout signals. Conclusion KAS and TIA have seen significant price increases this week. Key factors include new partnerships and network upgrades. Positive market sentiment also plays a role. Both coins are attracting more attention and investment. These developments suggest a promising future for these cryptocurrencies. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

JPMorgan Chase is raising its recession forecast for the US economy from 30% at the start of 2025 to 40% due to the uncertainty brought by President Trump’s directives including his trade war against China, Canada and Mexico, reports the Wall Street Journal. Says JPMorgan economists, “We see a material risk that the US falls into recession this year owing to extreme US policies.” Analysts at Goldman Sachs also believe the odds of a US economic downturn are on the rise, raising its 12-month recession probability forecast from 15% to 20% as Trump continues to be “committed to its policies even in the face of much worse data.” The news comes as billionaire “Bond King” Jeffrey Gundlach warns capital flight could hit US markets for years to come. In a webcast presentation, the founder and CEO of investment firm DoubleLine Capital LP says Europe may drain capital from US markets as the region looks to revive industrial production. “Net investment into the United States: from about $3 trillion years ago to more than $20 trillion. That helps the US outperform ex-US markets. With European countries needing to re-industrialize, that could lead to these flows to reverse. That could mean years, maybe decades, of European stock outperformance vs. US stocks.” According to Gundlach, we are now seeing signs that European equities are beginning to outperform the S&P 500. “US stocks vs. Europe have dropped almost to 2021 levels.” Source: DoubleLine Capital/X Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

41717190,https://timestabloid.com/?p=60405,1742068036,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Surpasses Ethereum Valuation. But There Is A Catch,https://timestabloid.com/60405-2/,"XRP has recently achieved a significant milestone, momentarily surpassing Ethereum in valuation. However, this accomplishment is specific to their fully diluted market capitalizations (FDV), which assess an asset’s value based on its total supply rather than just its circulating supply. XRP’s Meteoric Rise Against Ethereum XRP’s performance since November 2024 has been nothing short of remarkable. Following an explosive rally late last year, the asset has strengthened its position against Ethereum, registering an astonishing 257% gain in value compared to ETH. This surge bolstered expectations that XRP might one day dethrone Ethereum in overall market capitalization. Earlier, XRP had already overtaken Tether (USDT) to become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. However, while the asset had gained substantial ground, it still needed additional momentum to eclipse Ethereum’s valuation entirely. That said, the latest market pullback has shaken up rankings again, temporarily pushing XRP back to fourth place. Fully Diluted Valuation: A Different Perspective Despite its recent decline, XRP has managed to outpace Ethereum in one key metric: fully diluted valuation. Prominent crypto analyst Miles Deutscher recently highlighted this development, underscoring that XRP’s total market worth—if all tokens were in circulation—has now exceeded that of Ethereum. $XRP just flipped $ETH for Fully Diluted Valuation. pic.twitter.com/L2ZEi7rxfE — Miles Deutscher (@milesdeutscher) March 14, 2025 For those unfamiliar with FDV, this metric accounts for an asset’s market capitalization by factoring in its entire supply, rather than just the amount currently circulating. This stands in contrast to traditional market cap calculations, which focus solely on the value of tokens actively in the market. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Ethereum currently holds an FDV of approximately $228.9 billion, based on its total supply of 120.61 million ETH and a trading price of $1,899.66 per token. Meanwhile, XRP’s FDV has climbed to $231.18 billion, given its total supply of 99.98 billion tokens and a market price of $2.31 per unit. This places XRP’s fully diluted market cap roughly $2.28 billion ahead of Ethereum’s. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Circulating vs. Total Supply While this may seem like a groundbreaking achievement for XRP, it comes with an important caveat. The majority of Ethereum’s supply is already in circulation, whereas a significant portion of XRP tokens remains locked in escrow accounts. If all XRP tokens were released into the market today, the asset’s market cap would indeed exceed Ethereum’s. However, until those tokens are fully unlocked, this valuation remains theoretical. Notably, XRP has occasionally surpassed Ethereum in FDV in recent weeks, fueled by the gradual release of escrowed tokens and its continued price appreciation against ETH. Nonetheless, Ethereum itself is not immune to inflationary pressures. The network’s recent Dencun upgrade has resulted in reduced transaction fees, subsequently affecting the burn rate of ETH and making its supply slightly inflationary. What Needs to Happen for XRP to Overtake Ethereum? While this latest development highlights XRP’s strong position, it does not yet translate into an outright victory in actual market capitalization. For XRP to surpass Ethereum in circulating market cap, its price would need to climb approximately 69% to reach $3.90, given Ethereum’s current market valuation of $229.12 billion. Although the fully diluted valuation metric paints an optimistic picture for XRP, true market dominance will only be achieved when the circulating supply—and investor demand—pushes its real market cap beyond Ethereum’s. Until then, XRP remains in a promising but competitive race with ETH for the number two spot in the cryptocurrency rankings.

The price has fallen by almost half after hitting a Year-to-Date (YTD) $3,635 in January. Many people wonder if Ethereum price will ever breach the $4,000 resistance and a new high of around $5,000. Notably, a big focus is on the upcoming Pectra upgrade and whether it can trigger an increase in the price of Ethereum. Ethereum Price and Rocky Start to 2025 So far, 2025 has been rough for Ethereum. At the end of January, Ethereum was trading at $3,267.90 per an earlier ETH price analysis as the forecast for January’s push to $4,000 failed. Unfortunately, it dropped to around $1,910.67 by mid-March. This big drop in just a few weeks has left several large investors selling off, as seen in Ethereum ETF outflows. While Ethereum still has high growth potential for the future, the short-term price movement has been unpredictable. The delay in key upgrades, like the Pectra update , has made things harder for Ethereum. As of press time, CoinMarketCap data shows that Ethereum’s price was trading at $1,931.64 and has seen an over 1% decline in the last 24 hours. Still, ETH remains the second largest cryptocurrency globally, with a Market capitalization of $233.12 billion. With the price drawdowns conditional, the question hinges on what its prospects for growth are in the short term. Impact of Pectra Upgrade on Ethereum As Vitalik Buterin announced, the Pectra upgrade is meant to make Ethereum faster and more efficient. It combines two key updates, Prague and Electra, designed to improve Ethereum’s performance, especially regarding scalability and staking. The mainnet launch for Pectra was expected to happen in early April, but the circumstances surrounding its testing are uncertain. This is because the Sepolia and Holesky testnets encountered configuration issues. This testnet hiccup fueled the latest Ethereum price drawdown as community sentiments dropped. However, ETH developers have stepped up to create a fix. They are set to launch the “Hoodi” testnet by Monday, March 17, which will help redirect the testing of key Pectra upgrade features. If all goes well, the mainnet launch could take place between April and May 2025. Many Ethereum proponents believe the success of Pectra might serve as a primary catalyst for the Ethereum price boom to $5,000. Ethereum ETF and Potential Impact on Price Ethereum ETFs could also boost the ETH price outlook. While Bitcoin ETFs have gained popularity, Ethereum ETFs are lagging behind in terms of sustained capital flow. Data from SoSoValue shows that Ethereum ETFs lost over $143 million in assets this week. This is a large outflow compared to last week when they recorded $119 million in outflows. Although the broader market sentiment is impacting this shift, when the stock market gains revival, the ETF market and by extension Ethereum price may gain momentum.

While major assets struggle to gain momentum, TON has defied the market trend, registering a significant 16% price surge in the past 24 hours. Reason Behind Toncoin (TON) Price Jump The asset witnessed a notable price decline in the past after Pavel was arrested in France on August 24, 2024. Data reveals that during that period, TON lost almost 35% of its gains, with its price plummeting from $6.88 to $4.44 by September 2024. However, the asset regained some optimism after pro-crypto Donald Trump won the U.S. Presidential Election, leading to a significant surge that pushed its price to $7.20. However, due to economic tensions and trade wars, overall sentiment in the crypto landscape shifted. Along with other assets, TON witnessed a price drop of over 65%, hitting a low of $2.36 on March 11, 2025. Current Price Momentum and Upcoming Levels Currently, TON is trading near $3.35 and has surged over 16% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, the asset attracted traders and investors, leading to significant participation and a 260% jump in trading volume.

The asset manager decided that both funds were no longer aligned with market conditions and customer demand. At the same time, 21Shares intends to continue to focus on providing cryptocurrency investment products in the United States. Timeline For 21Shares ETF Closure The firm announced that the liquidation of the two Bitcoin-Ethereum futures ETFs, the ARK 21Shares Active Bitcoin Ethereum Strategy ETF and the ARK 21Shares Active On-Chain Bitcoin Strategy ETF, will happen on March 28. Both funds are part of those listed on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) BZX. Per the announcement, these Funds will no longer be effective by March 27. Once the date for the closure of the ETFs comes, investors who are still in possession of the shares will receive cash payments. This reimbursement will be based on the net asset value (NAV) at liquidation. ARKY and ARKC ETFs have recorded negative Year-to-date (YTD) returns, with ARKY down by 25.15% and ARKC down over 16.05%. Details on ARKY And ARKC A shift in 21Shares’ product strategy prompted the firm to make this delisting move. Ordinarily, ARKY invests in future contracts with BTC and ETH. It is designed to outperform these two leading crypto assets over the market cycle. Unfortunately, its current YTD return suggests otherwise. There is ARKC, which focuses on investing in future Bitcoin contracts and cash equivalents. Although their Ethereum ETF partnership was dissolved a while ago, this move would not impact 21Shares’ work relationship with Cathie Wood ARK Invest. 21Shares and many other asset managers are still eyeing spot XRP ETF approval from the SEC. Market Performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum Meanwhile, Bitcoin and Ethereum’s market performance these past few days has been quite impressive. CoinMarketCap data shows that BTC is currently at $84,336.83 while ETH is at $1,936.51. The price of ETH corresponds to a 0.93% increase, while BTC is still on the red line. Regarding trading volume, ETH is 46.5% down from its level 24 hours ago. Bitcoin’s trading volume is also down 44.82%, resting at $17.34 billion. This outlook suggests possible price consolidation soon.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also making waves in 2025, with its presale speeding up, having raised $3.4 million and secured tokens for 5,700 holders. Now the presale is priced at $0.02 in Phase 3. As such, several analysts have pointed to its lending protocols and buy-pressure mechanics as driving forces behind growth, dubbing this asset a possible wealth generator. Presale Momentum Builds Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale hits Phase 3, tokens at $0.02. If phase 4 is live to investors now for $0.020 then when phase 4 launches at $0.025 this could be a healthy 25% profit. The project’s structured tokenomics ensure a 200% ROI at its exchange debut, when tokens will be offered at $0.06. The projected post-launch valuation has so far ranged between $1.50 and $3.50, prompting early participants to lock in positions before the next price increase. That kind of forecast indicates returns over 7,400% for new entrants. The platform’s DeFi lending model sets it apart from speculative counterparts. Users deposit assets (ETH or stable coins), they get mtTokens (interest-bearing tokens) in return. These tokens grow in value over time and can be exchanged on diverse DeFi class support, combining liquidity with passive income. Borrowers supply over-collateralized assets to induce system stability. This combined utility translates into sustained demand for MUTM which dynamically supports its price direction. Attention Grabbing ROI Calculations Mutuum Finance (MUTM) employs a buy-and-distribute strategy to recover fees from usage and discharge tokens from the market. These tokens are used to reward mtToken stakers creating recurring buy pressure. Along with a giveaway of $100,000 to early contributors, the approach rewards holders. These reward allocations help ensure the inclusion of liquidity mining, partnerships and development while striking a balance between short term rewards and long term rising success through tokenomics. Phase 3—the $0.02 entry point—provides a brief window before prices rise. An investment of $1,000 today can turn into $3,000 at launch. At post-launch prices of $1.50—a conservative projection—the same stake explodes to $75,000. These numbers don’t include the compounding returns from staking or liquidity provisions that drive these gains even more. Initiatives to Bolster Security Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is completing a smart contract audit from CertiK, which is expected to enhance investor confidence. Results will be shared through official channels to establish transparency. The audit fits into the team’s ongoing focus on security, especially important for maintaining user trust as user numbers increase. Pepe (PEPE) was the beneficiary of meme-based hype, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) utilizes real-world DeFi utilities. Through its lending infrastructure, yield mechanisms, and token burns, it creates an ecosystem where demand is what drives token value. On the brink of a full Phase 3, the project’s mix of innovation and accessibility gives it standout status, among 2025 portfolio builders. While other projects are chasing trends, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building trends instead. Smart investors do the presale math: lower entry pricing today = exponential gains tomorrow. With the CertiK audit being finalized and Phase 4 on the horizon, the opportunity for maximum returns decreases. Get secure tokens now or stand with the next wave of millionaires without you. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $0.02 is a decent price for investors, but time is running out. The Price Surge with Phase 4 starts soon—Get in now or miss the entire ascent! Go to the Mutuum Finance website to get in on the presale and secure your place before the next jump.

Musk has played a significant role in cutting federal spending as part of the DOGE initiative under President Donald Trump’s administration. Tsai’s wishes are to see Musk return to manage his businesses, with the role in DOGE “short-lived.” Stocks have reacted to the Tesla boss’ actions A financial investor and founder of Tsai Capital, which has tens of millions tied up in Tesla thinks the stock market has shown signs of displeasure with Musk’s activities under the DOGE initiatives. Tsai’s sentiments in an interview with The Guardian are however not reflective of his loss of faith in Musk or Tesla’s earnings potential. This is despite opinion polls establishing Musk’s unpopularity with the US public and his net worth tumbling about $23 billion in recent days. “I hope his involvement with [Doge] is short-lived so he can spend even more time on his businesses.” Tsai. The chief investment officer and president of Tsai Capital, which reportedly manages a portfolio of about $137 million revealed that stock markets had also reacted negatively to the Tesla boss’ actions when he bought Twitter, now X in 2022 for $44 billion. Yet, according to Tsai, his firm which holds about 75,000 Tesla shares made more than six times its money since first investing in Tesla in February 2020, even with the downturn in performance of late. According to The Guardian, Tsai recently told investors in a letter that Tsai Capital considers Tesla to be more of a developer of advanced electronics and software that it attaches to cars as opposed to a traditional automotive manufacturer. He also insisted that Tesla remained “on path to become one of the most valuable companies on the planet.” He said that the market’s unfavorably reacting to Musk’s recent involvement in politics was however real. But he also expressed a hope that Musk’s role in DOGE would be like other temporary commitments he previously undertook. Americans disapprove of Musk Tsai’s comments come on the backdrop of Musk’s advice for widespread sacking of government employees across services by the Trump administration. The services include humanitarian aid and development work. Some experts have however expressed concerns and warned that removing them might have serious life-threatening consequences. Research firm, SSRS carried out a poll for CNN and the results showed public disgruntlement at the actions. According to the survey, 53% of Americans disapproved of Musk, while 35% approved leaving him about 18 points underwater, according to The Guardian. According to The Guardian, the results of the poll came out two days after Tesla stock went down by more than 15% amid public protests against the company as well as vandalism which was reported at some of the company’s dealerships. ABC News recently reported that vehicles, dealerships, and charging stations have been vandalized and faced arson since Musk started his White House role leading to mass layoffs of government workers. According to the report, the latest incident occurred in Tigard, Oregon where “more than a dozen” shots were fired at a Tesla dealership, according to a public information officer at Tigard Police Department, Kelsey Anderson. These incidents rank among many others that have triggered several stakeholders’ comments including Tsai’s. Tsai is a close childhood friend of Trump’s eldest son and namesake. His descent is from a lineage of legendary investors and sets his voice apart from others who have also carefully weighed on Elon Musk, DOGE, and Tesla at the two-month mark of the second Trump presidency.

Moreover, any remaining tokens after the presale will also be burned, reinforcing its deflationary model. The burn transactions are meticulously recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), ensuring full transparency. This approach positions Arctic Pablo Coin as a lucrative asset, as the decreasing supply directly contributes to price appreciation. Investors looking for top meme coins to join for long term are eyeing this strategic burn model as a key driver of its success.

Unlike conventional presales that follow structured stages, Arctic Pablo Meme Coin presale is divided by locations, reflecting its adventurous theme. As the token advances through different phases, prices will inevitably climb. Early adopters are securing their spots before Arctic Pablo Coin moves on from Frosty Falls, knowing that this entry point won’t last much longer. Official Melania Meme Coin Gains Traction with New Partnerships and Expanding Reach Official Melania Meme Coin has recently secured strategic partnerships, bolstering its ecosystem and driving investor confidence. The project’s roadmap now includes enhanced utility features and collaborations with notable blockchain networks. As the meme coin sector continues to expand, the increasing adoption of Official Melania Meme underscores its position as a rising contender in the crypto market. Floki Inu’s Ecosystem Expansion Brings Fresh Utility to Meme Coin Investors Floki Inu has made headlines again with its latest expansion efforts, introducing new staking options and DeFi integrations. This move enhances the coin’s long-term viability, making it an attractive option for investors seeking sustainable growth.

As the presale advances through Frosty Falls, early investors are securing their holdings before prices climb even higher. While Official Melania Meme and Floki Inu also showcase strong potential, Arctic Pablo Coin’s aggressive approach to tokenomics sets it apart.

Martinez tells his 132,300 followers on the social media platform X that Solana ( SOL ) is developing a cup and handle pattern on the weekly time frame that could lead to a 2,915% surge. In technical analysis, a cup and handle pattern forms in the shape of a cup and is typically considered bullish if, after forming the cup’s handle, the price breaks out to the upside. “If confirmed, this setup could propel it toward $3,800.” Source: Ali Martinez/ X Solana is trading at $126 at time of writing. Next up is Dogecoin ( DOGE ). Martinez says that the largest memecoin by market cap is trading in an ascending channel on the weekly time frame. According to the analyst, Dogecoin could go parabolic if the $0.16 support level at the lower boundary of the parallel channel holds. Based on Martinez’s chart, it appears he’s suggesting that Dogecoin could go up to a price of over $20, a gain of around 115x from the current level. Source: Ali Martinez/ X Dogecoin is trading at $0.174 at time of writing. The widely followed analyst and trader also offers his outlook on Bitcoin ( BTC ). According to Martinez, Bitcoin is undergoing consolidation inside an ascending triangle in the one-hour time frame. In technical analysis, an ascending triangle is considered a bullish pattern that typically forms during an uptrend. A continuation of the upward price movement is confirmed when the price breaks out of the horizontal resistance line or the upper boundary of the ascending triangle pattern. “A breakout from this pattern could trigger a 9% price move.” Source: Ali Martinez/ X Bitcoin is trading at $84,979 at time of writing.

The Hedera price breakout has finally breached the persistent $0.23 resistance level, indicating a potential upward trend following weeks of consolidation. Observers are monitoring closely, considering if this signifies the commencement of a more substantial increase. Concurrently, a Hyperliquid participant has executed a substantial trade, placing $6 million on Bitcoin and Ethereum. A minor price decline could trigger liquidation, potentially destabilizing the market. However, the main point of interest revolves around BlockDAG (BDAG) , a digital asset project targeting 2025. Its presale has exceeded $202 million, and the recent inclusion of five new professionals to its core team supports further growth. With a $600 million goal, BlockDAG’s growth continues. Hedera Price Breakout Achieves Higher Levels The Hedera price breakout has surpassed the $0.23 resistance, attracting attention. This movement follows a prolonged period of consolidation, suggesting a stronger bullish trend. The action occurs after Hedera maintained the $0.175 support, supported by the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) is now at +0.09, indicating strong buying activity. However, the Awesome Oscillator remains below zero, showing some bearish signals. Should this pattern persist, an additional Hedera price breakout could establish higher price targets. The Hedera price breakout is something that many have been watching. Navigating Hyperliquid’s High-Risk Act: A Dive into Whale’s Risky Play A Hyperliquid participant undertook a significant risk on March 2, 2025, by establishing a large leveraged position on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) with $6 million USDC, totaling over $200 million in transactions. A mere 2.8% price reduction could result in liquidation. The participant acquired 49,384 ETH at $2,196 and 1,260 BTC at $85,671, but a price decrease could necessitate a sell-off. Their floating loss reached $507,000. The Hyperliquid participant’s trades influenced the market, increasing volatility. Technical indicators displayed overbought conditions, and trading volumes increased, suggesting possible price fluctuations. If liquidation occurs, it could initiate a rapid sell-off, impacting prices and overall market sentiment. This type of high-risk trading can cause major market swings. BlockDAG’s Blueprint for Success: Aligning Expertise with Presale Ambitions BlockDAG is preparing for a year of expansion, and the progress is evident. The presale has surpassed $202 million, with over 18.8 billion BDAG coins sold, now priced at $0.0248, representing a 2380% surge. Each advancement brings early participants closer to potential gains as the price continues to rise. The $600 million presale target is a key objective. With ten major exchange listings anticipated, the opportunity for maximizing gains is becoming more limited. BlockDAG has also expanded its core team to support this growth, recruiting five key personnel to reinforce its position as a digital asset project in 2025. Nicolaas David van den Bergh is appointed Chief Marketing Officer, aiming to increase brand visibility. Marcus Xavier leads the Learning Academy, ensuring users are informed and engaged. Product Manager Robert Radek refines the roadmap for effective execution. Mining specialist Joshua Sack enhances efficiency for improved user experience, while Liza Van Der Berg manages HR and Operations for internal scaling. This strategic expansion strengthens BlockDAG’s foundation, positioning it as a key project in the digital asset space. With a skilled team and a clear plan, the project is set for significant achievements. Digital Assets to Watch This Year The recent Hedera price breakout shows a potential shift, but ongoing bearish signals keep traders cautious. The Hyperliquid participant’s $6 million trade adds uncertainty, with a potential sell-off that could affect the market. While these developments create short-term speculation, BlockDAG is pursuing a different strategy. BlockDAG is focusing on scaling, securing key personnel, and working toward its $600 million goal. It is generating interest with a presale that has exceeded $202 million. A strengthened foundation, a defined strategy, and an expanding team position it as a substantial project.

Floppy AI is an inventive AI support system to improve user experience across multiple and accessible platforms. This new technology has attracted investors who aim to capitalize on FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) 1000x growth potential, positioning it as the ultimate crypto play. The Debut Floppy AI: Advanced Core Utility For FloppyPepe (FPPE) The FloppyPepe (FPPE) AI meme coin is set to launch a powerful assistant, Floppy AI, a crypto-focused technology. Floppy AI is specifically designed with cryptocurrency data to provide accurate and relevant information for users. The upcoming debut of Floppy AI will make it easily accessible and will be integrated into different platforms. Social media sites like Telegram and X (Twitter) are at the top of the Floppy AI debut list. The system features support team responsibilities that complement the integration of the AI on different platforms. Telegram support works with Floppy AI to monitor interactions and clarify inaccurate or incomplete information. Twitter guarantees accuracy, providing follow-up tweets or direct messages, while monitoring FloppyAI sentiment analysis. Additionally, the FloppyPepe (FPPE) website gives users direct support while the development team gets feedback. These provide a better FloppyAI user experience on the different platforms, driving the project’s core utility. Why FloppyPepe (FPPE) Is Poised For A 1,000x Surge Floppy AI will continue to evolve, adding more functionalities to improve FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) core utility and boost a price rally. This evolution will be driven by the AI-powered tools within the project’s ecosystem. The first tool is the meme-o-matic AI agent , which collects text prompts and converts them to high-quality images and memes. The second is the FloppyX text-to-video agent, which converts text prompts and other data to viral and engaging short-form videos. With these tools fueling the FloppyPepe (FPPE) core utility, the meme coin is set to attract the attention of broader audiences including crypto users, content creators and digital artists. Moreover, the AI meme coin will be marked for having real-world value as these images and videos can be shared and monetized. Moving forward, the FloppyPepe (FPPE) AI meme coin will employ a strategic token burn system to reduce its supply and drive its value upward.

In a new filing, the FDIC alleges that while working as an international sales representative at the International Bank of Commerce in Laredo, Texas, Martin Fernandez, Jr. “made unauthorized transfers of approximately $123,563” from the accounts of two customers between July of 2018 and August of 2021. According to the FDIC, Fernandez moved the money to three of his known associates. The US banking regulator says that one of Fernandez’s victims was an International Bank of Commerce customer who wanted to open a new account. After the account was opened, Fernandez then helped the customer transfer funds to the newly created account on or about July 18th of 2019. The following day, Fernandez made multiple transfers from the customer’s newly created account to an associate without authorization. Between five and seven months later, Fernandez made multiple unauthorized transfers from the same account to another associate without the customer’s permission. Fast forward to between July 20th of 2020 and August 12th of 2021, Fernandez also initiated multiple unauthorized transfers from the account of another customer to yet another associate. The banking regulator says that the former International Bank of Commerce employee has already been criminally charged. “On October 19, 2023, Respondent entered a guilty plea in the District Court of Webb County, Texas, to one count of third degree felony theft based on the misconduct just summarized.” The FDIC says Fernandez’s actions, which caused the International Bank of Commerce a financial loss, violated the law and constituted unsafe and unsound banking practices. Consequently, Fernandez is barred from working in US-based banks and other financial institutions regulated by the FDIC.

Expert Explains",https://timestabloid.com/by-2030-investors-may-regret-not-buying-xrp-expert-explains/,"John Squire, a recognized media figure and key opinion leader in the cryptocurrency space, has expressed confidence in XRP’s long-term potential. He predicts that many investors will look back by 2030 and regret not purchasing the asset at its current price. His remarks come as XRP, along with the broader crypto market, faces a prolonged bearish trend. Over the past few months, cryptocurrency prices have seen a steep decline. Since January 20, the global market capitalization has dropped by more than $1 trillion, with Bitcoin struggling to hold above $80,000. XRP has also experienced significant losses, with its market cap falling from a peak of $195 billion in mid-January to approximately $133 billion—a decline of $62 billion. In 5 years, everyone will wish they had bought $XRP today. — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) March 11, 2025 Despite this downturn, analysts remain optimistic about XRP’s future, pointing to regulatory progress and its strong performance in late 2024 as key indicators of potential growth. Current Market Decline Presents a Buying Opportunity Squire maintains that the present decline in XRP’s price represents a key opportunity for investors to accumulate the asset before its value surges. Several analysts share this view , arguing that corrections often allow for strategic long-term investments. A comparable situation occurred in 2020 during the market crash triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. In March of that year, XRP plummeted to a low of $0.1140, providing an entry point for investors willing to take the risk. Those who invested $50,000 at that time secured approximately 438,596 XRP tokens. Even amid the current market slump, that investment is now worth over $1,008,771. He believes that today’s price movement mirrors the 2020 scenario and could offer similar potential gains. However, for this to materialize, XRP would need to appreciate substantially from its current price level. At $2.40 per token, XRP has already increased by 1,918% from its March 2020 low. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Future Projections for Token’s Price Growth If XRP were to rise by a similar percentage from its current value, it could theoretically reach $46 per token. However, most price forecasts present more conservative expectations. For instance, well-known market analyst EGRAG has projected that XRP could reach $27, although he has not provided a specific timeframe for this prediction. Meanwhile, analysts at cryptocurrency exchange Changelly have estimated that the token could trade between $13.86 and $23.10 by 2030. While Squire has not offered a precise price target, his confidence in the token’s long-term potential aligns with broader market sentiment. Many investors see the current dip as a strategic buying opportunity, given historical patterns and the increasing regulatory clarity surrounding the cryptocurrency.

Agence France Presse (AFP) first reported the news on Saturday. Shortly afterward, the cryptocurrency market reacted. Toncoin ( TON ), the digital token linked to Telegram’s Telegram Open Network (TON), saw a dramatic surge in its trading volume, increasing by more than 15% following the announcement. Source: CoinGecko The TON token, currently valued at $3.34, has been a key development of Telegram’s blockchain initiatives. In addition, Notcoin ( NOT ), a token for a popular tap-to-earn mini-app on the platform, also experienced a rally, rising by over 12.7% at the time of publication. Durov, a billionaire Russian exile who founded the popular messaging app Telegram in 2013, faces multiple charges linked to allegedly enabling organized crime. Authorities allowed Durov to depart for Dubai, AFP reported citing an unnamed source. The move follows a ruling by an investigating judge who accepted Durov’s request to modify the conditions of his supervision several days ago. Source: CoinGecko Durov, 40, has been under investigation for several infractions, including accusations related to terrorism, drug trafficking, fraud, money laundering, and child abuse content on the Telegram platform. He was initially arrested in August following his indictment, which led to a ban on his departure from the country. Durov addressed the legal challenges in a statement posted to his official Telegram channel in September. Expressing his surprise at the charges, Durov criticized French authorities for bypassing official communication channels with Telegram’s EU representative and instead questioning him directly. He argued that holding a CEO accountable for crimes allegedly committed by others on a platform—especially one operating under pre-smartphone laws—was a “misguided approach.” In his statement, Durov also defended Telegram’s moderation practices, highlighting the platform’s daily efforts to remove harmful content and its established connections with NGOs for urgent requests. Despite the legal troubles, he reaffirmed his commitment to ensuring the safety and security of Telegram’s vast user base, which now totals nearly one billion people. As the investigation continues, Durov’s legal battles are likely to remain a topic of significant attention, especially as Telegram’s cryptocurrency initiatives continue to expand. Whether the latest legal developments will have any long-term effects on Telegram’s operations or the value of its associated tokens remains to be seen.

Bollinger Bands Creator Reveals Why It Will Become A Market Leader,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-to-surge-110/,"The XRP price could be staging a parabolic rally to new all-time highs of $110. While an analyst shares a technical analysis to back this ambitious target, Bollinger Bands creator John Bollinger declares XRP to be a market leader in the crypto space. Analyst Predicts New XRP Price Target To $110 In a rather lengthy X (formerly Twitter) post, market expert Egrag Crypto went deep into his analysis for the XRP price, basing his predictions on its Elliott Wave structure. The crypto analyst confidently forecasted that XRP was heading towards a new $110 ATH. This bullish target would represent a whopping 3,974% increase from its current market value. Related Reading: XRP Price Continuation After Crash Below $2.4? New Targets Emerge Firstly, Egrag Crypto outlines XRP’s five-wave structure, underscoring that each wave could push the cryptocurrency to a new target. The analyst reveals that XRP is currently in Wave 2 of its Elliott Wave structure and is closely approaching Wave 3, which is expected to trigger the most explosive increase. In Wave 1, XRP saw an impressive 733% increase to new highs. However, in its current Wave 2, Egrag Crypto highlights that its 2017 fractal appears more profound. With the formation of a Double Bottom pattern, the analyst has predicted a potential price breakdown for the cryptocurrency. Egrag Crypto further forecasts that Wave 3 will trigger a reversal and cause the price to skyrocket by 1,185%. This massive price increase would effectively place the XRP price at a potential target between $22 and $24. For a more conservative target, the analyst estimates a surge of around $22 to $24. For Wave 4, Egrag Crypto predicts another major retracement similar to Wave 2. However, this time, the analyst believes XRP could decline by either 14.6%, 23.6%, or 38.2% from Wave 3’s price high. This correction would mark a 65% drop from Wave 3’s peak, bringing the cryptocurrency’s price down to $8. He also highlights a worse-case bearish scenario where XRP crashes as low as $3.4. Notably, Egrag Crypto shares three potential bullish targets for Wave 5, the final part of the Elliott Wave Structure. He forecasts that the altcoin could surge between $32 to $48, $60 to $70, or $95 to $110. The analyst has based his optimistic forecast on past cycle trends, where 2017 saw a major price rally for XRP. Bollinger Bands Creator Says The Asset To Become Leader In other news, Bollinger, the creator of the renowned Bollinger Band technical analysis tool, has highlighted XRP in his latest post, questioning whether it could take a leading role in the crypto market. The technical analyst asserts that Ripple has held up better than other primary crypto vehicles.

Speaking on Friday, Vance acknowledged that while the job cuts were a key part of Trump’s plan to slash government spending, not every decision was handled correctly. “Elon himself has said that sometimes you do something, you make a mistake, and then you undo the mistake. I’m accepting of mistakes,” Vance said in an interview with NBC News. He emphasized that errors must be corrected quickly and noted that not all federal employees deserve to be fired. “There are a lot of good people who work in the government—a lot of people who are doing a very good job,” he said. “We want to try to preserve as much of what works in government as possible while eliminating what doesn’t work.” Musk’s mass firings cause legal and political battles For the past seven weeks, Musk has led an aggressive push to cut thousands of federal jobs, implementing Trump’s plan to overhaul the government. The mass layoffs have triggered lawsuits, resistance from judges, and outrage from workers who suddenly found themselves unemployed. Musk, who has been overseeing the effort, has repeatedly dismissed government employees as “fraudsters” who aren’t doing their jobs. Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, speaks during a vice presidential debate hosted by CBS News, Tuesday, Oct. 1, 2024, in New York. AP Photo/Matt Rourke – ABC7 Vance distanced himself from those sweeping accusations. “I think some people clearly are collecting a check and not doing a job,” he said . “Now, how many people is that? I don’t know, in a 3 million-strong federal workforce, whether it’s a few thousand or much larger than that.” Despite supporting the firings, Vance made it clear that not everyone deserved to lose their job. “However big the problem is, it is a problem when people are living off the generosity of the American taxpayer in a civil service job and not doing the people’s business,” he said. But he also defended those who actually show up and do their work. “You do have a lot of great civil servants who are doing important work,” he said. “I think most of those great civil servants would say we want to be empowered to do our job. We don’t want the person who doesn’t show up five days a week to make it harder for us to do what we need to do.” Vance faces public backlash and protests While Vance toured a plastics factory in Bay City, Michigan, his arrival was met with middle fingers and vulgar signs from protesters. Some held up signs with messages like “Go home, scumbag” as his motorcade passed through. The night before, he was booed at the Kennedy Center in Washington. Even in his own neighborhood in Ohio, he was confronted by pro-Ukraine demonstrators while walking with his 3-year-old daughter. “The thing at the Kennedy Center I thought was funny,” Vance said. “The thing by my house I thought was kind of annoying. I think you just kind of take the good with the bad.” Inside the factory, Vance was welcomed by a pro-Trump crowd filled with local Republicans. He spoke about Trump’s plans to rebuild American manufacturing and boost the economy. But he also warned that the process wouldn’t be immediate. “Now I have to be honest with you,” Vance said. “The road ahead of us is long, but we are already, in just seven short weeks, starting to see early indications of the president’s vision becoming our shared American reality.” Recent polls paint a different picture. A CNN poll showed that 56% of adults disapprove of how Trump is handling the economy. A Quinnipiac University poll found that 54% of registered voters share that disapproval. At the same time, Trump’s push for tariffs on foreign goods has sparked fears of a trade war that could drive up prices for consumers. Foreign policy fights and future ambitions Vance has played a major role in shaping Trump’s foreign policy, delivering a fiery speech last month at the Munich Security Conference where he criticized European leaders over free speech and mass migration. In the Oval Office, he clashed with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, accusing him of being ungrateful for U.S. financial and military aid. “I just try not to be overly scripted,” Vance said. “The classic thing to do in Munich would have been to show up and give a speech about NATO or give a speech about where the Ukraine-Russia thing was at that moment in time, and just sort of thought to myself, like, ‘What is it that I think is really important to say?’” Meanwhile, Trump stirred speculation about Vance’s political future. In a recent Fox News interview, Trump said it was “too early” to talk about Vance as a possible successor in 2028. Asked if he had plans to run for president, Vance dismissed the idea, saying his only focus is doing his job now. “Wow, I’m the vice president-elect of the United States,” Vance recalled thinking on Election Night. “And, you know, if I never go further in politics, I’m totally fine with that, but we get a really good opportunity to do a lot of really good s— the next four years.” But he didn’t rule anything out. “If I do really well for the next four years, everything else will take care of itself,” Vance said.

Some experts think DOGE could hit as high as $50 if asset manager BlackRock files for a DOGE ETF this year. This projection is not unexpected, considering the firm’s precedence in the crypto industry. DOGE Price Catalysts to Watch Dogecoin is facing intense selloff pressure in the crypto market at the moment. Notably, the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) that was supposed to fuel a DOGE price rally has not achieved this. This has created new conversation points for a potential Dogecoin price trigger. With limited smart contract functionalities, analysts believe the prospect of a Dogecoin ETF can revive DOGE’s price outlook in the mid to long term. As a memecoin, the token has seen intense fluctuations in the past few weeks, down 45.66% in the year-to-date period per data from CoinMarketCap. While the $1 price target feels elusive, more ambitious targets are on the horizon should top asset managers like BlackRock push for direct support of the coin. How Soon Can a Dogecoin ETF Launch Notably, BlackRock already dominates the spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF markets. To reiterate its dominance, there is a new Bitcoin ETF allocation to the BlackRock $150 billion model portfolio. With this, proponents believe the asset manager could replicate this strong adoption for a DOGE ETF. Grayscale Investments has already launched its Dogecoin Trust for institutional investors. Many see this move as a step towards the future asset manager filing for a DOGE ETF. Grayscale said the fund is opened for daily subscription to eligible individual and institutional accredited investors. As CoinGape reported earlier, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally acknowledged Grayscale’s spot ETF application for Dogecoin. This acknowledgment departs from the SEC’s historically rigid stance on altcoin ETFs. Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas estimate a 75% chance of a Dogecoin ETF approval. Their prediction quickly sparked excitement about DOGE’s possible price movements. Current Dogecoin Price Projection DOGE price hit a daily high of $0.175 on Friday, following a broader market uptick. Dogecoin is traded at $0.1741, demonstrating a 2.8% increase in the last 24 hours. However, the daily trading volume has decreased by 13.6% to $1.02 billion, suggesting a reduction in investor activity. Still, market participants are projecting an optimistic outlook for the memecoin. Doge Lord, a Dogecoin enthusiast, forecasted the memecoin could rise to $1 during this cycle. Others have forecasted that the Dogecoin price could hit $50 in the long term on the heels of a DOGE filing from BlackRock. While this appears economically impossible, the BlackRock influence might fuel a significant DOGE price rally. Per the current outlook, the possibility of BlackRock filing an XRP ETF application, let alone DOGE ETF this year is very slim. The asset manager has not filed any other ETFs besides BTC and ETH. The asset manager is likely cautious about altcoin ETFs, which were previously under fire from the SEC. However, with the SEC now under a new pro-crypto administration, BlackRock may change its stance on altcoin ETFs. This could eventually lead to DOGE ETF acceptance.

XRP Overtakes Ethereum In Terms of FDV According to Token Terminal, XRP's FDV has exceeded $240 billion. Ethereum's figure is $231.5 billion. However, the Ripple project cryptocurrency is still inferior to ETH in terms of capitalization. The market value of XRP is $140 billion, while Ethereum is about $231 billion. Nevertheless, XRP's rapid growth indicates a significant change in market dynamics. The price of ETH has been falling steadily in recent months. This has been affected by management problems at the Ethereum Foundation, as well as the not-so-successful implementation of the Pectra update. Earlier in the hardfork rollout, there were several failures in the Sepolia and Holesky test networks. Initially, Pectra's introduction into the mainstream was scheduled for late March. However, the developers recently pushed that date back to April. XRP Successes Meanwhile, XRP is experiencing a sharp rise. This is due to greater clarity in the regulation of the crypto industry in the US, as well as support from institutionalizers. Since Donald Trump's re-election, the asset's price has risen more than 300%, peaking at $3.38 in January. Recently, the American president mentioned XRP among the key assets to be included in the US cryptocurrency reserve. This has further boosted investor confidence in this coin. The XRP Ledger (XPRL) blockchain, which has been adopted by financial institutions such as Societe Generale, has also gained widespread adoption. Large asset managers are increasingly applying to launch spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on the Ripple cryptocurrency. Now the crypto community is discussing rumors that BlackRock may soon take this step. ”BlackRock will file ETFs for Solana and XRP. An announcement regarding Solana could come any day now. And regarding XRP, most likely after the conflict with the SEC is over,” predicted Nate Geraci, president of ETF Store. It was reported earlier that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plans to close its case against Ripple. There is a possibility that XRP may be recognized as a commodity rather than a security. Such events will have an extremely positive impact on the market dynamics of the asset.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,XRP|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-15 20:43:14

The shift in liquidity suggests traders are favoring platform-native assets for their utility and stability in uncertain macroeconomic conditions. Exchange Tokens Standout as Crypto markets recover Crypto markets saw a mild recovery of 0.13% on Friday, signaling that recent gains in top-performing assets are largely driven by traders rotating funds across different sectors rather than fresh capital inflows. This reflects a cautious sentiment among investors as global macroeconomic uncertainties—particularly escalating trade war tensions—overshadow easing U.S. inflation data published earlier this week. With broader market sentiment still leaning bearish, traders are reallocating capital between different crypto sectors, either to capitalize on niche media narratives or to exploit arbitrage opportunities. This shift has inadvertently boosted demand within the exchange token sector, led by Binance Coin ( BNB ), OKX (OKB), and Bitget (BGB). According to Coingecko, the Exchange-based tokens’ aggregate valuation grew by $1.9 billion in the last 24 hours, reaching the $122 billion mark at the time of writing. Exchange tokens sector performance, March 14 | Source: Coingecko BNB currently trades at $578.51, posting 0.2% gains intraday, while OKB has climbed to $45.05, reflecting a 7.5% increase in 24 hours. Meanwhile, Bitget’s BGB token trading at $4.18 has also surged 3.7% over the same period. Crypto Market Outlook: Altcoins to Watch ahead of US Fed Rate Decision Exchange token sector outperforming the broader market, affirms the narrative that crypto traders are moving liquidity into exchange-native assets. These tokens typically offer fee discounts, staking rewards, and governance benefits—enhancing their attractiveness in high-volatility market phases as observed this week. If this dynamic persists, BNB, OKB, and BGB could see further upside, particularly if volatility drives more trading activity. However, strategic traders may be unwilling to deploy large leverage positions to drive aggressive rallies. Without fresh bullish catalysts, buyer fatigue could set in, leading to potential liquidations across the board.” BNB Price Forecast: Breakout Momentum Builds as Bulls Target $650 Resistance BNB price has surged 21.6% over the past four days, reclaiming key technical levels as bullish momentum strengthens. The price has decisively broken above the middle Bollinger Band (20-day moving average), currently at $590, signaling a shift in market structure. The upper Bollinger Band at $637 now serves as the next resistance, and a successful breakout could drive BNB toward the $650 level. BNB Price Outlook The MACD histogram has flipped green for the first time in nearly three weeks, confirming a bullish crossover as the MACD line trends above the signal line. This momentum shift suggests increasing buying pressure, reinforcing the probability of continued upside. The recent price expansion has also been accompanied by rising volume, with the last four daily candles showing higher trading activity—typically a strong indicator of trend continuation. However, if resistance at $637 proves too strong, a rejection could lead to a retest of the $590 support level. A failure to hold above this range would expose BNB to a potential pullback toward the lower Bollinger Band at $542. Despite this risk, the overall market structure remains bullish, and a sustained close above $637 could trigger a fresh rally targeting $680 and beyond. Bitget (BGB) Price Forecast: Bulls Could Consolidate above $6 as if Market Demand Persists BGB price is showing signs of stabilization after a multi-week pullback, with buyers stepping in to defend key support levels. Despite recent bearish pressure, the price remains well above the 50-week and 200-week moving averages, signaling the broader uptrend is intact. The Parabolic SAR dots remain positioned above the price, indicating the ongoing correction phase, but a shift below could confirm a bullish reversal. Bitget (BGB) Price Forecast Currently trading at $4.455, BGB finds itself in a crucial zone where demand is beginning to resurface. The Bollinger Band Percentile (BBP) indicator has dipped into negative territory, reflecting the recent selling pressure, but this often signals an oversold condition that could pave the way for a recovery. If bulls can reclaim momentum, a breakout above $5 would open the door for a rally toward $6, aligning with prior resistance and the upper SAR targets. Conversely, failure to sustain the current level may lead to further downside risk. A break below $4 would expose lower supports, with the next major cushion near $3 OKB Price Forecast: Bulls Targeting $50 Retest OKB price is showing strong bullish momentum, rebounding sharply from its recent lows with a decisive green candle. The breakout above prior resistance suggests growing buying pressure, confirmed by the positive shift in the BBP (Bollinger Band Percentile) indicator, which has flipped green for the first time in weeks. This shift signals increasing bullish momentum after a prolonged downtrend. OKB Price Forecast The price is currently trading at $46.60, with the next significant resistance levels at the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, sitting at $47.95 and $49.78, respectively. A successful break above these levels could fuel a rally toward the psychological $50 mark and beyond. Additionally, the Parabolic SAR dots have shifted below the price action, indicating a trend reversal and reinforcing the bullish outlook. However, failure to maintain momentum could see OKB price face resistance at these key moving averages, potentially leading to a rejection and pullback. A break back below $44 would invalidate the bullish setup, with the next downside support resting near $38.48.

Meanwhile, authorities have bridged around $2 million worth of USDC stablecoins to the Avalanche network, meaning more purchases could be on the way.

The goal? Reshaping the U.S. economy and forcing other nations to negotiate on his terms. But while some American businesses are thriving, others are drowning under skyrocketing costs. The biggest winners right now are U.S. steel and aluminum manufacturers. Trump slapped a 25% tariff on imported steel and aluminum, instantly making domestic production more competitive. U.S. Steel and Cleveland-Cliffs are now in high demand, and Century Aluminum, the nation’s largest primary aluminum producer, says these tariffs will drive a “resurgence” in American aluminum production. The results are clear: hot-rolled steel prices jumped to $945 per ton, the highest since February 2024, and aluminum prices surged 45 cents per pound, passing $990 per metric ton in a single day. Companies cashing in on Trump’s trade war Anheuser-Busch, the company behind Bud Light and Michelob, is one of the biggest winners. The company doesn’t have to worry about import tariffs because 99% of its beer is brewed in the U.S. and 99% of its ingredients come from American farmers. That insulation from global trade wars has helped Anheuser-Busch’s stock jump 24% this year while competitors struggle with rising costs. Another group raking in profits? Warehouse owners. American companies are stockpiling raw materials and goods, preparing for even worse tariffs. All of that extra inventory needs storage, driving up demand for warehouse space. The gold and silver markets are also thriving. Investors see precious metals as a safe bet during economic uncertainty, and that’s exactly what’s happening now. Since the start of the year, gold prices have soared 13% to over $3,000 per ounce, while silver has climbed 14% to $34 per ounce. XAUUSD 1-hour price chart. Source/TradingView Then there’s the tech sector—at least, the software and AI side of it. Palantir, Oracle, Microsoft, and Salesforce are dodging the worst of the trade war because they don’t rely on Chinese factories. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said Palantir is in a particularly strong position, thanks to its U.S. government contracts and AI technology investments. Industries getting crushed by tariffs The stock market is bleeding. The Nasdaq has lost 2,300 points in just 30 days, a 12% drop, and the S&P 500 has crashed more than 10% from its recent highs. Investors are dumping tech stocks that depend on Chinese supply chains. No company is feeling it worse than Apple. Trump hit Chinese imports with a 20% tariff, and Apple relies on China for manufacturing. The company’s stock is down 13% since January, and analysts say moving production back to the U.S. would take at least five years and cost over $20 billion. The automakers aren’t doing much better. Ford, GM, and Tesla are scrambling as raw material costs surge. Barclays analysts estimate that Trump’s tariffs will add $400 to the cost of every car built in the U.S. That’s not good news for Tesla, which has already seen its stock plunge 36% this year. The alcohol industry is taking massive losses. Trump just announced a 200% tariff on European wine and champagne, responding to the EU’s 50% tariff on American whiskey. Retailers are scrambling to stockpile bottles, knowing prices will soon skyrocket. A $109 bottle of Chateau Rauzan Segla Margaux will cost $375 once the new tariffs kick in. It’s not just luxury goods suffering. California’s almond industry is in trouble. One-third of California’s almonds are shipped to Europe, and now they’re facing retaliatory tariffs. Farmers are bracing for major revenue losses, and industry experts say it could take years to recover. Retaliation from other countries Other nations aren’t backing down. Canada just hit back with $21 billion in retaliatory tariffs, slamming American farm products, whiskey, and other goods. Some Canadian retailers have even pulled Tennessee whiskey from their shelves entirely, refusing to sell American-made liquor in protest of Trump’s trade war. Mexico and China are also pushing back. China’s 20% tariff on American imports is a direct response to Trump’s policies, and it’s putting serious pressure on Tesla, Apple, and automakers. One company pleading for help is Tesla. In a letter to the U.S. Trade Representative’s office, Tesla warned that it faces “disproportionate impacts” from retaliatory tariffs. The electric vehicle company is already struggling with supply chain issues, and now it’s being hit from multiple directions. The stock market is reacting badly. The Dow Jones just dropped 1,000 points in the last 30 days, marking a 2.4% decline. Investors are on edge, but the Trump administration isn’t worried. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent shrugged off concerns, saying , “We’re focused on the real economy. I’m not concerned about a little bit of volatility over three weeks.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

The crypto exchange filed Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to uncover details about U.S. regulator’s actions against crypto companies. Coinbase alleged that the Federal Deposit Insurance Commission (FDIC) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have responded slowly. The trading platform said the agencies are either holding back key details or releasing documents with many important details left out. Coinbase is frustrated by the lack of clarity as it intensifies its fight to expose what it sees as unfair targeting of the crypto industry. Coinbase Fights Against Operation Chokepoint 2.0 The crypto exchange filed a Freedom of Information Act request to obtain documents from the Federal Deposit Insurance Commission. The documents were supposed to shed light on the agency’s involvement in Operation Chokepoint 2.0. This operation is an alleged effort by regulators to restrict crypto companies from accessing banking services. However, when the FDIC finally responded, Coinbase was not satisfied. In a recent X post , Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, accused the FDIC of being slow and unhelpful. He believes the agency is deliberately withholding key details about its actions. Coinbase wants to see proof that the FDIC properly documented its role in banking restrictions against crypto companies. However, the agency has not provided clear answers so far. Although the FDIC has promised to search for more records, Coinbase is not convinced it will get the full truth. The Demand for SEC’s Legal Spending Records The FDIC is not the only regulator Coinbase is challenging. The company has also filed a FOIA request against the SEC. This time, Coinbase wants to know how much money the agency has spent on legal battles against crypto companies. For years, the SEC has aggressively targeted crypto firms with lawsuits, but many of these cases have ended in dismissal. Recently, the SEC dropped its case against Kraken and OpenSea. The agency’s legal actions against Coinbase were widely criticized, but they eventually ended. The crypto firm believes that the SEC wasted public resources by going after crypto businesses instead of providing clear rules for the industry. The exchange is especially concerned about the costs of these legal actions. The SEC often hires expensive third-party contractors to assist in its cases, which likely increases the financial burden on taxpayers. Coinbase Calls for Transparency in Crypto Regulation Coinbase’s fight with regulators shows the ongoing problem between the crypto industry and the U.S. government. Under the previous administration, regulators made it harder for crypto businesses instead of giving them clear rules to follow. The exchange wants the FDIC and SEC to be open about their actions, calling for transparency. Coinbase is determined to uncover the truth and the result could change the future of the crypto industry.

The issuer is eyeing March 28 as a tentative date for the liquidation of both ETFs amid a wave of new filings in the US. 21Shares Set To Liquidate Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs According to an announcement, crypto ETF issuer 21Shares has disclosed plans to ditch its Bitcoin and Ethereum futures ETFs. Per the announcement, the affected ETFs are the ARK 21Shares Active Bitcoin Ethereum Strategy ETF and the ARK 21Shares Active On-Chain Bitcoin Strategy ETF. While the press release did not give clear reasons for the liquidations, it hinged its decision on a periodic review of its offerings. The statement cited a need to align existing product lineups with market dynamics and clients’ needs in a changing landscape. However, pundits say the liquidations are a result of jarring ETF outflows in recent months. Shareholders can sell their holdings up until March 27, a date touted as the last trading day for both ETFs. 21Shares plans to put the final nail in the coffin for both ETFs on March 28, liquidating all remaining assets. “Shareholders who continue to hold shares of a Fund on the Fund’s Liquidation Date will receive a liquidating distribution with a value equal to their proportionate ownership interest in the Fund,” read the press release. Increased ETF Activity In The Cryptoverse Despite the wave of outflows, the ETF space is sizzling with frenetic activity. Buoyed by impressive returns, 21Shares slashed fees to 0.49% for its Bitcoin Ethereum Core ETPs. Bitwise has rolled out its OWNB ETF to track companies holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets. Bitcoin ETF investors continue to put their faith in offerings in the face of price amid Rex Shares launching the first Bitcoin Corporate Bond Convertible ETF Outside of Bitcoin, several issuers have filed for XRP, HBAR, DOGE, and AVAX ETFs with the US SEC.

AAVE was one of those golden opportunities—ignored by many at its launch, only to explode in value, making early buyers incredibly wealthy. While some took the leap and secured life-changing returns, others hesitated, waiting for a “better time” to buy. The pain of missing out on massive gains is something every crypto trader knows too well, but history always presents a second chance. Right now, that second chance is Qubetics ($TICS)—and the window to get in early is closing fast. Unlike hype-driven projects, Qubetics is built for real-world utility, tackling blockchain development barriers with its QubeQode IDE and creating a seamless multi-chain ecosystem. It’s not just another token—it’s a fully-fledged blockchain platform with strong fundamentals and high adoption potential. With its Qubetics presale attracting serious attention, early adopters are securing their positions before prices climb higher. Opportunities like this don’t wait. If you missed AAVE’s early days, don’t make the same mistake again—Qubetics could be one of the best cryptos to buy this month. Qubetics: The Best Crypto to Buy This Month Before It’s Too Late Qubetics’ early supporters had a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity—whitelist members secured $TICS at just $0.01 with zero upfront investment. Since its launch on September 29, 2024, the presale has progressed through multiple stages, with prices increasing by 10% every seven days. Now, Qubetics is in its 25th presale stage, priced at just $0.1074, and it’s still one of the best cryptos to buy this month before it hits exchanges. With over $15 million raised, more than 23,000 token holders, and 499 million $TICS tokens sold, Qubetics is proving it’s a force to be reckoned with. But what really makes it one of the best cryptos to buy this month is the potential ROI for those who invest early. If you put in $1,000 today: If $TICS reaches $0.25, your investment becomes $2,326 (132.66% ROI) If $TICS hits $1, your portfolio grows to $9,206 (830.65% ROI) If $TICS reaches $5, you’d be sitting on $46,500 (4,553.26% ROI) If $TICS hits $10, that $1,000 turns into $92,065 (9,206.51% ROI) At $15, you’d have $138,597 (13,859.77% ROI) It’s no wonder why early investors are calling Qubetics one of the best cryptos to buy this month. Beyond its financial upside, Qubetics is reshaping blockchain development with its QubeQode IDE. Right now, creating blockchain applications requires extensive coding knowledge, making it inaccessible for many businesses. QubeQode IDE eliminates this barrier by offering a drag-and-drop interface, form-based configuration, and a code snippet library, allowing even non-developers to create blockchain-powered applications effortlessly. Imagine a small business wanting to build a secure tokenized rewards program for its customers. Instead of hiring a team of blockchain developers, they can use QubeQode IDE to set up their system in minutes—no coding required. Or think about a gaming studio that wants to integrate NFTs and in-game assets on multiple blockchains. With QubeQode, they can do it seamlessly, without writing complex smart contracts from scratch. This kind of accessibility is what makes Qubetics more than just another crypto—it’s a game-changing blockchain ecosystem. But time is running out. With each stage lasting just seven days, the price is about to increase again. If you’re serious about crypto, this is the best crypto presale to get into before it’s too late. AAVE: The Crypto That Left Many Watching From the Sidelines AAVE’s story is a painful reminder that the best investment opportunities don’t wait. When AAVE first launched, many dismissed it as just another DeFi lending protocol, failing to see the groundbreaking potential behind its liquidity pools and decentralized borrowing system. Those who ignored it at its early stages missed out on one of the biggest success stories in DeFi. During its ICO phase, AAVE was trading for mere cents, but once its ecosystem gained traction, the price skyrocketed. AAVE’s all-time high left many regretting their hesitation, as early investors saw unbelievable returns while skeptics could only watch from the sidelines. Today, AAVE remains one of the most recognized DeFi platforms, proving that early adoption is the key to making life-changing gains in crypto. Right now, Qubetics is in the same position AAVE was before its breakout. It has strong fundamentals, a real-world use case, and a fast-moving presale that’s attracting serious attention. The difference? You still have time to act before Qubetics goes mainstream. The question is, will you take this opportunity, or will you let history repeat itself? Final Thoughts: Don’t Watch From the Sidelines—Join This Crypto Presale Now You saw what happened with AAVE—early adopters won big, while those who hesitated missed out. Qubetics is now in that same early-stage window, and with over $15 million raised, the momentum is undeniable. Among the best cryptos to buy this month, Qubetics stands out with its real-world applications, strong fundamentals, and massive ROI potential. But time is running out. Each presale stage lasts only seven days, meaning the price will rise again soon. The best move? Join this crypto presale now before it’s too late. The best cryptos to buy this month aren’t just about speculation—they’re about recognizing the future before everyone else does. Will you be the one who takes action, or will you watch another opportunity slip away?

The G7 foreign ministers issued the warning through a joint statement after their meeting in Canada, as President Donald Trump, who is pushing for a truce, tries to get President Vladimir Putin to sign on. Ukraine had already agreed to a 30-day ceasefire, but Russia hesitated. Marco Rubio, Trump’s Secretary of State, told the G7 that Washington was still trying to figure out if Putin was delaying negotiations on purpose. “The question is, are we actually moving towards a ceasefire, or is this a delay tactic?” Rubio said. While the G7 is threatening economic retaliation, Trump has held back from immediate US sanctions, hoping diplomacy can work first. US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2016. Photograph: Chris McGrath/Getty Images – The Guardian The €300 billion in Russian central bank assets, mainly cash and government bonds, have been frozen since 2022, and there is increasing momentum to use it against Moscow. Rubio indicated that any ceasefire deal would require both sides to make concessions. “I’ve never heard Trump say that Russia has a right to take all of Ukraine and do whatever they want there,” Rubio said on Friday. Meanwhile, Trump’s national security team is set to meet after Steve Witkoff, the president’s envoy, returns from Moscow with updates on where Putin stands. For months, Washington focused on pressuring Kyiv to agree to an end to the war, but now that Putin has stalled, the attention has turned to Russia. Trump, in a Truth Social post, described his recent talks with Putin as “good and productive,” but there is still no official agreement from Moscow. Canada’s Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly made it clear that the next move is on Russia. “The ball is now in Russia’s court when it comes to Ukraine,” she said . She added that the G7 was unified in its approach. The joint statement from the G7 meeting was not easy to finalize, as one official said that the Ukraine section was a subject of tense discussions overnight and the US argued that strong language could disrupt talks with Russia, so the wording was softened to avoid pissing Putin off. Britain and France, though, wanted a harsher tone, pushing for stronger economic pressure on Moscow, which makes sense as those guys have made it pretty clear how much they do not like Putin. Putin hesitates as Russian forces gain ground in Kursk While ceasefire negotiations stall, Russia’s military has advanced in Kursk, where Ukraine had previously reclaimed over 1,000 square kilometers. Despite claiming to support a ceasefire, Putin insists that “issues” need to be resolved first, while President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called it an excuse to stall negotiations some more. Trump, in another Truth Social post, claimed that the Russian military had surrounded thousands of Ukrainian troops and that he personally urged Putin to “spare their lives.” Ukraine’s General Staff denied the claim, saying that fighting in Kursk was ongoing and that no Ukrainian soldiers were surrounded. The Russian leader cut his teeth as a KGB spy in the 1980s in Dresden, an experience that left him with an enduring fascination for all things German. | POOL photo by Artyom Geodakyan/EPA-EFE – Politico In response, Putin publicly urged Ukrainian troops to surrender on Friday, saying it would align with Trump’s request. The US had temporarily cut off military aid and intelligence-sharing with Kyiv, pushing them to accept the ceasefire deal. But now that Putin is stalling, the Trump administration has resumed military assistance. “The devil is in the details, and they will start offering you details to drag you into a dialogue, delay certain processes, and postpone the end of the war,” Zelenskyy said. He is expecting a “strong reaction” from Trump in response to Putin’s lack of commitment. The biggest challenge in the negotiations remains territorial control. Zelenskyy admitted that this would be the hardest part of any peace agreement. “Ceasefire and territories are the most difficult moments [of a negotiation],” Zelenskyy said on Friday. “The first is difficult because it requires courage and political will, the second because it requires a difficult dialogue.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Key levels to watch include $2,600, $2,500, and short-term ranges from $2,000 to $2,320, with a stop placed below $1,500. The main risk is the equities market; a relief bounce could trigger a similar reaction in crypto, particularly ETH. Bitcoin remains dominant, but a short-term bounce in ETH/BTC could see altcoins gain market share temporarily. Summary Crypto has had a crazy start to 2025, to say the least. Altcoins have been bleeding for the past few months, with Bitcoin slowly following behind—along with equities. Today, I want to discuss a potential trade idea for Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), as the market has dropped nearly 50% from its December 2024 highs of $4,000 per coin and now sitting at 1850s. I'm seeing potential for a 30% bounce on Ethereum based on the levels I'm watching. However, this is not a guarantee—nothing in the markets is (no free lunch). I'll have to play this level by level. Monthly Chart Let's start by analyzing the monthly chart. In 2022, while the market was in a bearish phase, from its all-time high the market sold off approximately 55% , bounced back, and again started its downward move creating a lower high. Now if we look at the recent data and mark the local high down to the recent low, the market has fallen approximately the same number, around 57% -which is basically the same major drop that happened in 2022. TradingView (ETH) We are also seeing a retest of the prior consolidation zone that preceded the rally in October 2023, when the overall markets bottomed and began their next leg up. This is a level where I would expect a potential reaction. Does that mean we'll bounce here and head toward all-time highs? Very unlikely. However, the point of this trading level is that there is potential for some kind of bounce. Weekly Chart Zooming into the weekly chart, I've annotated the overall trend that has been respected since the COVID low in 2020. This marks the fourth touch of this trendline, coinciding with the monthly consolidation zone I highlighted in the chart above. TradingView (ETH) The first orange-shaded area outlines the move from the low after the 55% correction from the 2022 top. This pattern is one that I'm paying attention to currently. Will I expect it to be replicated? No. Still, I'm using it to frame a potential bounce at this key area. It could be a 20% bounce, a 25% bounce, or even a 50% bounce. Or maybe not a bounce at all: this is where matters of risk management come into play, which is to be discussed later. Daily Chart Now lets take a look at the current daily chart. I've marked out the current trading range, from the high of 4,109 and the low of 1,752. The 50% level of this range is at 2,931 , which is just around a 50% move from current levels. This level would be my strong bull case short term level as in the final level I'd look to close this potential trade idea. TradingView (ETH) Below this level, we have clear areas where price previously rejected and formed resistance. The $2,600 range was a consolidation zone before the market moved lower. This will be a crucial level to watch, as any signs of weakness here would require trade management. Below that, we have the recent rejection that occurred on the Monday following the news about the Crypto Reserve. This level sits around the low $2,500s . Below these levels I am watching short term ranges from: 2000s (Would like to see a reclaim) 2150s 2320s H4 Chart The overall trend on the lower timeframes has remained bearish, so this is something I would need to see shift. We’ve started to see the potential for a short-term bottom here in the $1,700s. TradingView (ETH) In terms of market structure, I would want to see the H4 chart start forming higher highs and higher lows, signaling the potential daily/weekly retracement I'm looking for. Current Trade (Risk Management) I've provided my current trade thesis below. I will not be holding this trade all the way to the $2,900s. At the end of the day, I have no idea if ETH will have the momentum in the current environment to make a move that high, which is why I have significant levels before then within my analysis. TradingView (ETH) The stop placement here is important. This is not a random stop placed in the $1,500s because I don't want to lose a certain amount. Within my system, this is where I have to place it, as it's below a key weekly low from October 2023, where price retested the weekly trendline I discussed. This is ultimately where I would believe the bull-case bounce is unlikely. Seasonality Talk Like I discussed in my recent bull case for Bitcoin , the main risk here is equities. Based on the seasonality trend from the last 20 years, the markets typically see a potential bottom around February and March and then start to trend higher. I'm not taking this as a potential bottom signaling the continuation of the ultimate bull run we've been in, but I think this data can help frame the situation. If we do see a decent bounce before continuing lower in equities, that would, in my view, be enough to trigger a bounce in BTC/ALTs. EquityClock ETH/BTC I'm sure there are no surprises here, as I constantly preach that Bitcoin is the crypto market. BTC has outpaced ETH since 2022. The ETH/BTC pair is currently trading at the lows from December 2020! TradingView (ETH/BTC) Again, do I think this is the ultimate bottom here? Not really. I still believe Bitcoin is the dominant long-term market. But with how things are aligning, it makes sense to me that we could see the start of a potential bounce, where Bitcoin might lose some of its market share in the short term, giving altcoins a squeeze higher. Conclusion & Risks As I've stated, the main risk here is the equities market and whether we can finally see some sort of relief bounce. I believe that the macro view is still a bit shaky, and I doubt we’ll see a move straight back up toward ATHs in any risk-on markets, but that isn’t what I'm looking for here. I've started a position and outlined my key levels that I'll be watching, along with potentially locking in profits depending on how the market reacts around these price points. I hope this analysis helps and gives you another perspective on the crypto markets, especially the potential short term price action on ETH.",ETH-USD,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|ETH|BTC|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-15 21:27:53

Notably, recent market movements and mixed fundamentals have divided analysts. While some remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s potential to recover , others are sounding the alarm, with one prominent strategist warning of a potential collapse to $10,000. Mike McGlone, senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, warned about Bitcoin’s downside risks, citing macroeconomic factors and market trends that could lead to a severe decline. In a tweet on Friday, McGlone questioned whether Bitcoin could revisit $10,000, drawing attention to the rising price of gold and potential market headwinds. “Gold is up about the same amount in 2025 to March 13—about 15%—that Bitcoin is down. But with Bitcoin at about $80,000, what stops those trajectories?” he wrote . McGlone also pointed to a potential 6% decline in the S&P 500 as a key risk factor, adding that the current market cycle could mirror the speculative bubble seen 25 years ago. In an interview with Yahoo Finance, McGlone emphasized the appeal of traditional safe-haven assets amid economic uncertainty. “ Treasuries and gold are still the primary safe-haven plays ,” he explained , highlighting gold’s recent rally to $3,000 an ounce as evidence of growing investor caution. He also suggested that a broader market downturn could accelerate Bitcoin’s decline, stating, “ The riskiest assets are cryptos… I can point out that Bitcoin’s peak looks to be around $100,000, which is why gold continues to go up.” McGlone is not alone in predicting further downside for Bitcoin. Earlier this week, Arthur Hayes, former CEO of BitMEX, suggested that Bitcoin could drop to $70,000 before staging a recovery. According to Hayes, a 36% correction from Bitcoin’s peak of $110,000 would be “normal for a bull market.” He argued that Bitcoin’s next major rally would likely depend on worsening macroeconomic conditions and potential monetary policy shifts from major central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. Elsewhere, Markus Thielen, head of research at 10x Research, suggested that Bitcoin may enter a prolonged consolidation phase after reaching its recent all-time high. He noted that Bitcoin’s current technical structure resembles a “high flag” pattern, a formation that typically signals bullish continuation. However, he warned that signs of weakness within the pattern indicate market uncertainty, making it unclear whether Bitcoin will sustain its uptrend or face further corrections. However, not all analysts foresee a steep drop. On-chain data from CryptoQuant suggests that Bitcoin is nearing an “oversold” zone, with its MVRV ratio falling to 1.8, close to the 2024 correction low of 1.71. According to the firm, if Bitcoin fell to $70,000, it could present a favorable entry point for investors and spark a rebound.

In a statement on Friday, Coinbase Institutional confirmed that its derivatives arm has filed with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to self-certify futures contracts for both Natural Gas (NGS) and Cardano (ADA). “We’re excited to announce that Coinbase Derivatives has filed with the CFTC to self-certify Natural Gas (NGS) futures and Cardano ($ADA) futures… We anticipate going live with these products on Monday, March 31 .,” read the tweet from Coinbase Institutional. For context, futures allow investors to bet on the future price direction of an underlying asset like ADA without needing to own the asset outright. Coinbase Institutional, a division of the global cryptocurrency exchange, was established to cater to large-scale investors, including hedge funds, asset managers, and corporations. Over the years, it has expanded its product offerings to include prime brokerage services, staking, and a range of derivative instruments designed to meet the needs of institutional clients. Notably, in the last quarter of 2024, Coinbase Institutional reported a trading volume of $345 billion, accounting for 78% of the platform’s total trades during that period. One of the most notable milestones for Coinbase Institutional was the launch of the Coinbase Derivatives Exchange, formerly known as FairX, which the company acquired in 2022. This strategic acquisition allowed Coinbase to expand its regulated derivatives offerings, addressing the growing demand for crypto futures and options among institutional investors. As of 2025, Coinbase Institutional serves thousands of institutional clients and manages billions of dollars in assets. The introduction of ADA futures signals a broader commitment to diversifying its portfolio and reinforcing its position as a leader in institutional crypto adoption. That said, including ADA futures could catalyze price appreciation, providing institutional investors with a regulated avenue to gain exposure to Cardano. Historically, the introduction of futures contracts for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum has led to increased liquidity and price discovery. Moreover, ADA’s potential for growth has been bolstered by its recent inclusion in a policy directive from former U.S. President Donald Trump. The executive order reportedly acknowledged ADA’s role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain innovation, positioning it favorably for regulatory clarity and institutional adoption. On the regulatory front, confidence in ADA’s standing has strengthened following key legal victories. Charges against Coinbase were dismissed in February 2025, followed by a similar outcome for Kraken in March 2025. Meanwhile, the Binance case, where ADA was also targeted, has been put on hold.

41720442,https://zycrypto.com/?p=103722,1742075792,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,Ripple’s XRP Just Flipped Ethereum By Valuation — But There’s A Catch,https://zycrypto.com/ripples-xrp-just-flipped-ethereum-by-valuation-but-theres-a-catch/,"A significant event occurred in the crypto market. Ripple-affiliated cryptocurrency XRP has managed to overtake Ether (ETH) in valuation, but this only applies to their fully diluted market caps. This flipping comes amid bullish developments in the XRP ecosystem, while the Ethereum network deals with stiff competition from rivals such as Solana. XRP Surpasses Ethereum In FDV According to CoinGecko, Ethereum ranks as the second-biggest crypto, boasting a market capitalization of $231.2 billion. This is considerably bigger than XRP’s market cap of $135.7 billion. However, there seems to be a reversal of fortunes for these two top cryptocurrencies. As of press time, XRP’s fully diluted valuation stood at $234 billion. Despite the higher market cap, Ether’s FDV is lower at $232 billion. The FDV is a metric that measures the cumulative value of all existing tokens by current market price, whilst market cap only considers the tokens already in circulation. Simply put, this suggests that if all XRP tokens were in circulation, including those currently locked in Ripple’s escrow accounts, the token’s market capitalization would have usurped Ether’s. Notably, all the Ethereum tokens are already in circulation. Whether or not this FDV flipping translates into an actual market cap shift remains to be seen. At Ether’s current price of $1,923, XRP will close the market cap gap between the two assets and overthrow ETH’s reign as the second largest crypto if its price hits $4 — a roughly 67% increase from its current price of $2.35. XRP surpassed Tether’s USDT to become the industry’s third largest crypto earlier in January. If the Ripple-promoted token topples Ether, it would signal a monumental shift in the cryptosphere. All Eyes On XRP The recent XRP optimism has been fueled by Franklin Templeton’s spot XRP ETF filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The $1.5 trillion investment giant has joined other asset managers, including Bitwise, 21Shares, and WisdomTree in the race to introduce such an XRP fund in the U.S. market. Recent reports have revealed that the protracted legal spat between Ripple and the SEC is finally wrapping up. The blockchain payments firm is apparently negotiating more favorable terms after being slapped with a $125 million fine and injunction last year. Meanwhile, the SEC reportedly considers XRP a commodity rather than an unregistered security.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ethereum News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,XRP|MARKET|ETH|TRADING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-15 21:56:32
41720592,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=693158,1742076000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41720592.jpeg,Shiba Inu Millionaire Bets That Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Will Surge From $0.02 To $3 In Just 42 Days Before Litecoin (LTC) Touches $150,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/shiba-inu-millionaire-bets-that-mutuum-finance-mutm-will-surge-from-0-02-to-3-in-just-42-days-before-litecoin-ltc-touches-150/,"A Shiba Inu millionaire investor placed money into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) after purchasing coin which is expected to grow from $0.02 to $3 over six weeks. Market signals show bearishness as Litecoin (LTC) continues its attempt to recover $150 despite maintaining its $89 price point. Before Mutuum Finance enters Phase 3 of its presale series purchasers have committed $3.4 million and secured more than 5,700 token holders thus indicating growing support for the forthcoming $0.06 exchange listing price. Presale Energy for Mutuum Finance Those participating during Mutuum Finance Presale Phase 3 can seize $0.02 tokens while preparing for a 25% growth to $0.025 which experts predict will happen within days. Project tokenomics establishes a specific financial pathway where Phase 3 investors receive 3-fold returns when they purchase at the $0.06 value. Analysts forecast that MUTM tokens will rise to $3 as people start using the lending protocol and this growth would represent a staggering 14,900% increase from their current price. The specific characteristics of this system drive positive expectations. Mutuum Finance maintains a platform model which spends fees on purchasing MUTM tokens to stimulate continuous token demand through this mechanism. The mtToken system alongside user deposits create a permanent long-term holding environment that drives users to retain tokens in their portfolio. Liquidity mining and staking initiatives which consume 74% of the supply basis make it unlikely for sell pressure to emerge after launch. Litecoin’s Uphill Battle The rising attention towards Mutuum Finance generates challenging circumstances for Litecoin. LTC trades at $89 but its momentum indicators manifest strong bearish control as traders attempt to push prices past $93.17. Presently Litecoin faces bearish conditions because the 50-day SMA stands at $118.94 above current prices and RSI-14 shows weak momentum at 32. The 14,900% growth potential of MUTM dwarfs the max $201 all-time high projection for Litecoin which reflects only a 125% increase from current levels. Market dynamics separate these two cryptocurrencies from each other. The declining daily trading volume of Litecoin at $88.6 million demonstrates that investors are losing their interest in this cryptocurrency. During the recent weeks of its presale Mutuum Finance managed to accumulate $3.4 million from intense investor interest. The Shiba Inu millionaire bets that DeFi utility within MUTM will surpass Litecoin’s store-of-value functions. Secure strategic Growth The Mutuum Finance team is completing a Certik audit of its smart contracts, a move to increase trust from investors. Once the results have been tabulated, they will be announced via official channels, further demonstrating the project’s dedication to transparency. Until then, this one is in line with its orderly growth strategy that values ecosystem stability over hype-induced peaking. Buyers are taking advantage of the last presale phase under $0.025, driving down the limited inventory for Phase 3. The window to get coins at this level is closing with exchange listings around the corner. Early participants secure a 200% gain at launch and are poised for a 500%+ growth spurt when lending pools are made live. Timing the Market Shift Litecoin has until 150 — a target the backers of Mutuum Finance say MUTM will hit first. As LTC fights resistance zones and low volatility, the swift presale of MUTM and its structured tokenomics offer a dichotomy of asymmetry. For investors looking for assets that aren’t moored to the cycles of Bitcoin, Mutuum Finance is a measured way of engaging with a burgeoning frontier of decentralized lending. Phase 3 ends soon, get your MUTM tokens for $0.02. Head over to the Mutuum Finance official site to get involved with the presale and keep up to date with the audit. The market tides shifts for the prep – act fast before the liquidity events change everything.

While BTC’s price has often floundered towards the end of the week in 2025, the premier cryptocurrency would be hoping to have a different journey over the next few days. Is $90,000 The Next Stop For Bitcoin Price? Fortunately, the future seems bright for the world’s largest cryptocurrency after crypto analyst Ali Martinez took to the X platform to share an exciting bullish prognosis for the Bitcoin price. According to the trader, the price of BTC could be on its way to the psychological $90,000 level. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Since ‘The Big Dump’ – Local Trend Reversal Or Continuation? The rationale behind this positive prediction is the appearance of an ascending triangle pattern on the 1-hour timeframe of the Bitcoin chart. The ascending triangle is a pattern in technical price analysis featuring an inverse right-angled triangle with a horizontal upper boundary (connecting a series of lower highs) and a diagonal rising lower trendline (connecting the swing lows). An ascending triangle formation is usually considered a bullish chart pattern, indicating the continuation of the original upward trend. However, an ascending triangle formation can also serve as a trend reversal pattern and a bearish signal — when the asset’s price breaks down the lower trendline and in the opposite direction of the initial uptrend. As observed in the highlighted chart, the Bitcoin price seems to be breaking out of the triangle pattern through the horizontal upper trendline around $84,000. In his post, Martinez noted that a convincing and sustained close above this level the premier cryptocurrency could make a play for the psychological $90,000 level. The price target for an ascending triangle pattern is determined by adding the vertical distance between the horizontal and rising trendlines to the breakout point. A Bitcoin price leap to $90,000 would represent an almost 7% move from the current price point. As of this writing, the flagship cryptocurrency is valued at around $84,400, reflecting an almost 5% price surge in the past 24 hours. Can Rising Whale Activity Push BTC Price Up? If the Bitcoin price is going to reclaim the $90,000 level, it’s going to need all the buying pressure it can get from investors. Interestingly, the largest class of BTC investors (whales) seem to already be in the party, continuously loading their bags over the past few days. In a separate post on X, Martinez disclosed that whales that own between 1,000 and 10,000 coins have added to their holdings in recent days. Data from Santiment shows this class of whales has acquired 20,000 BTC in the last 24 hours. This high buying activity from Bitcoin whales could offer BTC’s price the necessary bullish impetus to move to $90,000.
