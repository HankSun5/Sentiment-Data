These signs are not through price moves but through changes in on-chain behavior and trader activity. At the center of these observations is Ethereum, the leading altcoin, which has always led previous altcoin seasons. However, other interesting behavior is showing up in other large-market-cap cryptocurrencies, which implies any altcoin season from here might be different from previous ones. Ethereum Usage Holds Even With Price Consolidation On-chain signals linked to an altcoin season are beginning to appear across several large-market-cap cryptocurrencies, which implies that any rotation into altcoins may not be driven by Ethereum alone this time. That said, Ethereum is still exhibiting a set of familiar traits that have always placed it at the center of past altcoin cycles. Related Reading: Ethereum Enters Overbought Levels With Weekend Pump, Why A Crash Could Be Coming For example, on-chain data shows Ethereum maintaining activity levels close to cycle highs even as its price continues to move sideways, fluctuating above and below $3,000 . In previous market periods, consolidations of this nature were typically paired with a noticeable decline in network usage as traders lost interest and speculative activity cooled. This time, that pullback in engagement has not materialized. Active addresses and transaction activity are still high, with the recent numbers coming in around 472,000 active addresses. In previous altcoin cycles, similar conditions appeared just before Ethereum began to outperform Bitcoin and led the rotation into altcoins. Now, history might be repeating itself. XRP, Solana, And BNB Reflect Early Altcoin Season Positioning In addition to Ethereum, behavior across other large-cap altcoins adds context to the setup of an incoming altcoin season. Notably, on-chain data tied to XRP shows that whales are not sending tokens to exchanges after recent price moves. The current lack of sustained inflows from XRP whales into crypto exchanges means that larger holders are holding their positions, which is a behavior more consistent with anticipation than profit-taking. Related Reading: Altcoin Season In Q1? Bitcoin, Ethereum Breakdown Maps Out Performance At the same time, Solana is also beginning to see a return of retail participation . Trading activity is picking up, but the data is still far below the levels typically associated with euphoric phases. Historically, this stage has appeared before momentum expands, when interest starts to grow, not at the end of it. Another piece of the on-chain activity comes from BNB, where average spot order sizes have been large and consistent despite relatively uneventful price action. BNB’s price action looks boring on the outside , but average spot order sizes are at levels similar to those seen before the altcoin season in 2021, and this can be taken as a sign of something interesting brewing beneath the surface. Taken together, these on-chain signals reinforce the idea that if Ethereum does drive the next altcoin season, the course of events might be much more collective and differ from the previous altcoin seasons.",Ethereum|Altcoin|Altcoin Season|BNB|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT|solana|XRP,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ETH|TRADING|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-09 21:00:41

The update comes as the team moves to curb what it described as “dangerous” incentives that encouraged low-risk coin creation over high-risk trading, a balance the platform says had begun to tilt too far in the wrong direction. Pump.fun Adds Fee-Sharing Tools for Token Creators In a statement posted on X, Pump.fun said creator fees “needed a change” and introduced a new fee-sharing model that allows creators to distribute fees across up to 10 wallets. Creators and CTO admins can now assign percentages directly through the Pump.fun app or web interface after launch. Creator fees need change. When Dynamic Fees V1 was introduced a few months ago, the goal was to help create more success cases in our ecosystem by giving top project founders and teams a strong incentive to launch their token on pump fun and drive it to success. Only a week… https://t.co/yiu9DjsCqR pic.twitter.com/TZHTPAKnfw — alon (@a1lon9) January 9, 2026 The platform said the goal is to improve trust and transparency after finding that many teams struggled to share fees cleanly and often relied on informal arrangements. Co-founder Alon expanded on the reasoning behind the change, pointing back to the introduction of Dynamic Fees V1 earlier in 2025. Creator fees need change. When Dynamic Fees V1 was introduced a few months ago, the goal was to help create more success cases in our ecosystem by giving top project founders and teams a strong incentive to launch their token on pump fun and drive it to success. Only a week… https://t.co/yiu9DjsCqR pic.twitter.com/TZHTPAKnfw — alon (@a1lon9) January 9, 2026 That system, rolled out under an update called Project Ascend , tied creator fees to market capitalization. @pumpdotfun unveils Project Ascend on Solana, revamping creator fees to foster longer-lasting token projects and prevent rug pulls. #Solana #pumpfun https://t.co/JJG4dE1BCp — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 2, 2025 Smaller tokens earned higher fees, up to 0.95% per trade between roughly 420 SOL and 1,470 SOL in market cap, with fees gradually declining to as low as 0.05% as projects grew toward $20 million valuations. Protocol and liquidity provider fees remained unchanged. The model succeeded quickly in boosting activity, as Pump.fun saw bonding curve volumes more than double, driven in part by a streaming-led launch trend that attracted first-time crypto users. However, Alon said the incentives failed to change behavior for the average memecoin deployer. Instead, creator fees increasingly reward coin creation itself, which is relatively low risk, rather than trading, which carries real downside but also generates liquidity and volume. According to the team, traders are the core of the platform, and skewing incentives away from them threatens the health of the market. The newly announced fee-sharing tools are designed to address another weakness of the original system. Pump.fun said creator fees lacked practical utility despite their potential. Projects often wanted to route fees to figures connected to a token’s narrative or to multiple contributors, but the process was clunky and sometimes required community takeovers or off-platform trust. Under the new model, fee claims are synchronized across recipients, and unclaimed fees remain permanently available to their assigned wallets. Additionally, Alon said further changes are coming and emphasized that no member of the Pump.fun or Terminal team will accept creator fees. Pump.fun Sees $6.6B Weekly Volume, But Few Tokens Break Through The changes arrive as Pump.fun continues to post record activity. This week, the platform processed $6.6 billion in trading volume, its highest weekly total to date. Creator earnings remain substantial, with data tracked by Adamtec showing more than $1.1 million claimed in the past 24 hours and nearly $7.9 million claimed over the last seven days. Source: Dune/Adamtec At the same time, token creation and graduation metrics suggest activity is concentrated in a smaller number of successful tokens. More than 27,000 tokens were launched in the past day, but fewer than 200 graduated, keeping daily graduation rates below 1%. Source: Dune/adamhec Pump.fun’s native token, PUMP, has also seen renewed short-term momentum. The token is trading around $0.0024, up roughly 10% over 24 hours, with daily volume near $175 million. Despite the rebound, PUMP remains more than 70% below its all-time high. Since August 2025, the protocol has spent roughly 1.36 million SOL, or about $236 million, on buybacks, absorbing close to 18% of the circulating supply.

Numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that the share of economic output paid to workers through wages and salaries dropped sharply in the third quarter of last year. The figure landed at 53.8%, marking the lowest level ever recorded in the modern data series tied to GDP. That reading was down from 54.6% in the previous quarter and well below the 55.6% average seen so far during the 2020s. The data came from the BLS report on labor productivity and costs released Thursday. While GDP continued to grow, the portion going to workers kept shrinking, even as companies reported some of the strongest profit margins seen in decades. The labor share measure has been tracked since 1947 and surged briefly in 2020 during the height of the pandemic. Since then, it has moved steadily lower. Over the same period, corporate profits climbed, raising fresh concerns about income gaps inside the U.S. economy as GDP expansion failed to lift worker pay at the same pace. Productivity rises as hiring stays muted The same BLS report showed labor productivity in the U.S. jumped at the fastest pace in two years during the third quarter. Economists linked part of that increase to the growing use of artificial intelligence across companies. The rise in productivity occurred alongside falling labor share levels tied to GDP, creating a split picture of economic gains. Economists said more data will be needed to understand how AI affects jobs and pay. On one side, higher productivity can support faster GDP growth without pushing inflation higher. On the other, companies can increase output while hiring fewer workers, putting pressure on wages tied to GDP growth. The BLS defines labor share as “the percentage of economic output that accrues to workers in the form of compensation.” That includes wages, salaries, bonuses, and pension contributions. Despite solid GDP expansion, that percentage continued to fall. Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Tom Barkin said recent employment data points to modest job growth and a low-hiring environment. Figures released Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed employers added 50,000 jobs last month. The unemployment rate edged down to 4.4%, even as hiring slowed. “This fine balance between a modest job growth environment with a modest labor-supply growth environment seems to be continuing, and that was encouraging,” Barkin told reporters Friday. Barkin said businesses remain cautious and are relying on productivity gains to operate with fewer workers. He said this approach has shaped hiring decisions while GDP continues to expand. He added that Federal Reserve officials must stay alert to the risks of higher unemployment and persistent inflation. Policymakers cut the benchmark interest rate for a third straight meeting last month but remain divided over further cuts due to uncertainty around inflation and the labor market. Investors currently expect two quarter-point rate cuts this year. Markets do not see another move until April or June. “Inflation has been above our target now for almost five years,” Barkin said . “It’s in a lot better shape than it was two or three years ago, but it’s certainly not all the way there.” “The unemployment rate has ticked up in the last year, and job growth is modest,” he said. “So I think you’ve got to watch both of them.” Get seen where it counts.

Today’s Bitcoin price prediction shows that if hashrate stops accelerating, the “Growth Floor” breakout could push price above $100,000. Miners Surviving on Cash Flow, Bleeding Long-Term According to analysis shared by renewable energy Engineer David, Bitcoin miners are surviving on cash flow but losing money on a full-cycle basis. Update, The Physics of Bitcoin's Silence Everyone's watching price. almost no one's watching the machine underneath it. Here's what's actually happening: bitcoin isn't stuck. it's being compressed. Two forces fight for price: → real demand (etf flows, spot bids) → mechanical… pic.twitter.com/m5MRrOtIjI — David (@david_eng_mba) January 8, 2026 Inefficient rigs (cost >$90,000) are underwater now. However, these miners don’t exit; they bleed until the network recovers. Source: david_eng_mba “Bitcoin can trade below its energy floor briefly. It cannot stay there,” David explained. David added that everyone watches the Bitcoin price, but almost no one watches the machine underneath. “Bitcoin isn’t stuck, it’s being compressed,” he said “Right now, demand is winning the war but losing every battle.” $1.2 billion flowed into spot ETFs this week, and the price moved sideways. “That’s not failure. That’s absorption.” Currently, the $90,000 level represents the hedge. Bitcoin miners are long gamma there, selling when the price rises, buying when it falls. “They’re not betting against Bitcoin. They’re hedging their book.” Every buy meets a hedge sell, every dip gets bought back, and this makes the range tighten and would eventually crush volatility. This is bullish because compression doesn’t destroy demand; it stores it. Coins are currently being transferred from weak hands to strong hands at stable prices. According to David , as volatility gets crushed, price compresses into the tight $93,000-$96,000 range. The major resistance wall sits at $100,000. When it fades and demand returns, price doesn’t grind higher; it resets higher. “This is the most dangerous moment to be bearish,” the Stanford engineer concluded. The market is pinned by dealers, and the math points to bigger upside once the tight range breaks. Price doesn’t break free by force; it moves when the hedge weakens. At the start of the year, Bitcoin’s price sits around $91,300 with 100% hedge strength. By late January, the hedge is expected to fall toward approximately 43% . Bitcoin Price Prediction: Daily Chart Shows Base Formation Above $80K The 1-day Bitcoin chart shows price stabilizing after a sharp correction, with structure depending on well-defined technical levels. Bitcoin trades below the $100,000 psychological threshold, acting as a congestion zone, while the $93,000 miner energy floor has flipped from support into near-term resistance. Declining EMAs (20, 50, 100-day averages) continue capping upside, reinforcing the corrective trend that began after the failed push above $120,000. Source: TradingView However, downside momentum has slowed. Price formed a base above recent lows near mid-$80,000, and RSI recovered above 50, signaling a shift from bearish toward neutral-to-mildly bullish conditions. This suggests selling pressure is easing. If Bitcoin reclaims and holds above $93,000, the next test sits at $100,000, where a clean break would unlock pathways toward $109,000.

Senate Reviews Crucial Crypto Bill On Friday, Senator Cynthia Lummis, a prominent advocate for pro-crypto policies, shared insights on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), indicating that the Senate is engaging in a “light reading” of the bill. This step follows extensive negotiations involving not only bipartisan discussions between Democrats and Republicans but also interactions among lobbyists from both the cryptocurrency and traditional banking sectors. Key provisions, including stablecoin incentives outlined in the GENIUS Act, are proving pivotal for the bill’s potential success, as reported by Bitcoinist over the past few weeks. Market expert MartyParty also chimed in, providing updates on social media regarding the Senate’s ongoing review of the long-awaited legislation that builds on the House-passed Digital Asset Market Clarity Act. Path To Passage MartyParty noted that the review is especially timely, as it aligns with the upcoming markup sessions scheduled for the Senate Banking Committee, chaired by Senator Tim Scott, as well as discussions in the Agriculture Committee. He clarified that these sessions aim to take place around January 15, 2026, although some reports suggest that they might occur as late as January 16. The markups will provide an opportunity for amendments, debates, and committee-level votes on the bill’s language. If the bill successfully advances out of both committees, the expert stressed that the drafts will be reconciled before moving to a full Senate floor vote. Achieving this step will require securing at least 60 votes to overcome any potential filibuster, emphasizing the need for bipartisan support.

The latest development comes just a day after the team resigned en masse from the Electric Coin Company (ECC) following a governance dispute. New Wallet Push Former ECC CEO Josh Swihart announced that the team responsible for launching Zcash and developing the Zashi wallet will now create a new Zcash wallet, code-named cashZ, by utilizing the same Zashi codebase. He explained that the group is not launching a new token and remains fully focused on Zcash development. According to Swihart, the decision to leave ECC and form a new company was driven by the need for a governance structure that better aligns with the ZEC ecosystem’s goals. His tweet read , “We are all in on Zcash. We need to scale Zcash to billions of users. Startups can scale, but nonprofits can’t. That’s why we created a new Zcash startup.” Swihart outlined three core reasons for the transition. First, he said Zcash is rooted in cypherpunk principles and requires leadership that is willing to actively defend privacy as a norm in the digital economy. Second, he argued that combining non-profit foundations with fast-moving tech startups has historically led to misalignment, while adding that a conventional startup structure allows teams and leadership to remain more accountable and aligned. Third, Swihart said Zcash must be able to scale significantly to fulfill its mission and move beyond niche adoption toward billions of potential users. CryptoPotato had earlier reported that several Zcash developers were “constructively discharged” following internal governance disputes. Falling Dev Metrics The announcement comes at a time when ZEC market performance and development metrics appear to be diverging. According to blockchain analytics firm Santiment, the token saw a sharp resurgence in late 2025. Its market capitalization increased roughly 15-fold between late September and mid-November. Since then, however, ZEC’s price has retraced by around 40% over the past two months. Amidst price struggles, Zcash’s development activity has declined to its lowest level since November 2021. Historically, the firm said, steady or rising development activity has tended to accompany stronger long-term performance among major altcoins, while falling activity can indicate reduced innovation momentum.

This $0.04 New Altcoin Is Surging 300%,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/top-crypto-to-buy-before-2027-this-0-04-new-altcoin-is-surging-300/,"Investors do not tend to wait until the excitement in the market is complete. They place them in front of the visibility peaks. That trend can be observed in the best crypto investments several years before a cycle becomes mature. According to market commentators, the best long-term returns can be made when the prices appear silent. There is one emerging cryptocurrency, which is more and more mentioned in this context. It has already shot upwards but most people feel that it is still at an early stage of growth towards 2027. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance has specialized in decentralized lending and borrowing. The protocol is developing a peer-to-contract lending model, where liquidity is supplied to a contract pool and loans originate from that pool.. Assets are deposited by users in common pools and they get mtTokens. These mtTokens symbolize their deposit and increase in value due to interest. As an example, the deposit of $1,000 in ETH into a pool that generates 6% APY would automatically reflect that yield on the balance of the mtToken with time. Mutuum Finance is also developing a peer-to-peer market. Borrowers open overcollateralized loans that have distinct loan-to-value. A borrower who purchases collateral of $2,000 can borrow $1,500 at the LTV of 75%. Liquidations are made in case the collateral value falls below the safety levels. The liquidators pay off a fraction of the debt and are offered collateral at a discount. This balances the liquidity and safeguards the system. Interest rates change depending on how much the system is being used. When the liquidity is high the rates remain low. When capital is limited the rates increase to incentivize repayments and deposit. Under some market conditions, stable rates could be available to borrowers who want to know the cost in advance. Presale Arrangement Mutuum Finance launched its presale in early 2025 and priced it in a structured way. Pricing was not sudden as the increase in demand moved in steps. The project has to date been funded approximately $19.6M, and over 18,800 holders. Out of the total amount of 4B tokens, 45.5% are used as the presale. That equals roughly 1.82B tokens. It has sold approximately 825M tokens already and that demonstrates that a huge share of early allocation is distributed now. In Phase 1 the token was introduced at a price of $0.01. It is now selling in presale Phase 7 at a price of $0.04. That is a 300% growth compared to the beginning stage. Based on the project organization, the initial price at which it will be officially launched is $0.06. Phase 1 players are placed to appreciate by up to 500% at launch, whereas subsequent buyers are introduced with less tokens at a higher price. In this, presale demand is influential. There is a predetermined allocation and price of every phase. As the demand increases, the phases sell quicker and the pricing escalates. The site also features a 24-hour leaderboard in which the highest daily depositor wins $500 in MUTM, which motivates those wishing to contribute to their cause to do so consistently, as opposed to once per month. Price Outlook As the official X statement said, Mutuum Finance is getting ready for the V1 Protocol release of its lending and borrowing protocol. The initial implementation will occur on Q1 2026 Sepolia testnet. The first available supported currencies are ETH and USDT. The main characteristics are liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and an automated liquidator bot. The security has been discussed before this milestone. The V1 protocol has been through an independent audit by Halborn Security . Mutuum Finance is also rated as 90/100 on CertiK token scan and has a bug bounty code vulnerability of $50k. According to some analysts, these measures decrease the execution risk to a large extent. In the bullish case, it is estimated that as visibility upsurges, a shift of the current position of $0.04 to higher levels to and even higher than the launch price of $0.06 may occur. According to commentators in the market, valuation may grow more over the long term as opposed to short-term spurts in case of adoption. The Concept of Stablecoins Mutuum Finance also pays significant attention to lending stablecoins, the first of which is USDT. The stablecoins minimize the volatility risk and facilitate predictable borrowing behaviour. This holds significance on the days when investors wonder why crypto is down today or when markets are trading with each sideways move. The layer-2 integration is also included in the roadmap. The layer-2 networks reduce the transaction cost and enhance speed. In the case of lending sites, this may bring in more users and get things going. Increased utilization gives rise to an increase in protocol revenue. Mutuum Finance proposes a transparent system when inquiring about the best crypto to purchase at this point with a long-term horizon in mind. It is a mix of consistent presale demand and a model that value is made by usage leading to a V1 launch. Some analysts believe this structure supports a clear price expansion scenario once the protocol becomes active. In a bullish scenario, projections show that moving from current levels toward the planned launch price could represent an initial 1.5x increase. Longer-term models tied to stablecoin lending growth and layer-2 adoption suggest that a 4x to 6x increase could be achievable over time once usage scales as outlined in the roadmap.

57021740,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=874350,1767996006,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/57021740.jpeg,Ethereum’s Long Accumulation Nears Completion While ETH/BTC Holds The Line,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereums-long-accumulation/,"Ethereum continues to trade within a prolonged accumulation phase, signaling that the market may be approaching a pivotal transition. As ETH/BTC firmly defends long-term cycle support, the structure points to quiet strength building beneath the surface, often a precursor to rotation and a decisive next move. Ethereum’s Inverted Monthly Chart Signals Late-Stage Accumulation EGRAG CRYPTO made a post, showing that Ethereum’s inverted monthly chart continues to reflect a familiar cyclical pattern, though with notable evolution. Each market cycle follows a similar rhythm, but as the asset matures, volatility compresses, and price behavior becomes more controlled. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Q1 Outlook: Analyst Shares Historical Setup As Price Nears Key Resistance In the first cycle, Ethereum experienced a brief accumulation phase followed by a sharp and violent drop. The second cycle extended the accumulation period, resulting in a more gradual decline. Meanwhile, in the third and current cycle, accumulation has lasted significantly longer, suggesting that any corrective phase should be comparatively shallow. It is important to note that the chart is inverted, meaning what appears as a drop on this view actually represents a breakout on the standard price chart. In this context, the current structure suggests that accumulation is nearing completion, and the market may be approaching its next decisive move. This setup points to a less explosive move compared to earlier cycles, but more controlled. From a price roadmap perspective, initial resistance is projected between $3,800 and $4,500. A successful flip of that zone into support could open the door toward the $6,000 to $7,500 region. The primary risk scenario remains a deeper retest toward the $1,800 to $2,200 range before a broader upside continuation. Why ETH/BTC Is A Key Market Barometer Right Now In a recent post on ETH/BTC, CyrilXBT emphasized that this remains one of the most important charts to monitor. Ethereum continues to defend the 2018 cycle support, consistently printing higher lows while price action tightens just below key resistance levels. This kind of compression often signals that the market is preparing for a larger move rather than breaking down. Related Reading: Here’s The Ethereum Descending Triangle Structure That Threatens A Crash Below $2,800 Importantly, there is no sign of panic or structural damage. Sellers have failed to force a decisive breakdown, while buyers continue to step in at higher levels, reinforcing the strength of the underlying support. The longer this base holds, the more meaningful the eventual breakout or rotation becomes. At this stage of the cycle, Ethereum does not need to outperform aggressively. Simply holding its relative value is usually enough to signal the early stages of capital rotation. Historically, sustained stability on the ETH/BTC pair tends to precede periods where Ethereum begins to take the lead once momentum fully returns.

57021742,655867,1767997836,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57021742.jpeg,Zcash Developers Spin Out New Wallet After ECC Breakup,https://bitcoinist.com/zcash-developersn-ew-wallet-after-ecc-breakup/,"A day after the Electric Coin Company’s breakup , the team behind Zashi said it is spinning out into a new Zcash-focused company and launching a new wallet built from the existing Zashi codebase. The move is framed as an effort to “scale Zcash to billions,” while keeping the group’s work narrowly centered on the Zcash stack. In a message signed by Josh Swihart, the developers said the new wallet is code-named “cashZ” and will reuse the codebase originally built for Zashi. The team also opened a waitlist for early access, telling existing Zashi users that “all you need to do is join the waitlist” and that a migration will be designed to feel as seamless as the current Zashi experience once cashZ is live “in a few weeks.” The announcement attempted to answer what it expects will be the community’s first question after an organizational breakup: whether the engineers are still committed to Zcash. “The entire team that worked at Electric Coin Company and built Zashi is still 100% focused on full-stack Zcash development,” the post said. “We aren’t launching any new coins, we’re just scaling Zcash. To do that, it required that we leave and start a new Zcash-focused company.” Why Zcash’s Core Builders Are Starting A New Company The team said the decision to form a new company came down to three ideas: Zcash’s cypherpunk roots, governance and incentive alignment, and a need to scale. In the longest section, the developers cast the past decade of crypto regulation as a kind of prolonged stress test for privacy, describing it as “a decade of compliance theater.” The post argued that privacy-preserving tools are not merely a technical preference but a civil-liberties issue that requires a more assertive posture from the organizations building them. “This effort was not simply about complying with unjust laws. Of course, we must abide by the law, or else be thrown in a cage,” the message said. “But when the law is unjust, we have a moral imperative to work to change the unjust law. One tool for that is code.” From that premise, the team connected Zcash’s mission to mainstreaming privacy online , positioning the protocol as “a peaceful global reform movement” and saying that a structure bogged down by internal friction would be poorly suited to that fight. “To do this, we need an organization that has courage,” it added, arguing for “cypherpunk leadership” and a governance model that “can’t cut through red tape.” A second argument centered on what the post described as chronic misalignment when nonprofits and venture-style startups are intertwined. The team cited recent commentary from Andreessen Horowitz to bolster the idea that crypto’s “foundation era” is ending, while distinguishing the Zcash Foundation as an example of a standalone nonprofit that can do effective work. The critique was not subtle: “Nonprofits are about rule-lawyering, while tech startups are about rewriting the rules,” the statement said, adding that nonprofit boards often lack the accountability mechanisms of corporate boards. The team also pointed to heightened scrutiny of US nonprofits and the risk of tax exemptions being challenged, arguing there is “no benefit in keeping a fast-growing technology company under a nonprofit when the substance of the organization is a for-profit.” The final section placed the wallet launch inside a bigger ambition: to make Zcash large enough that privacy becomes difficult to marginalize. It framed the strategic choice as binary: “to be so small they can’t see you, or so big they can’t stop you.” The post claimed that Zcash has undergone “a complete rebirth” over the past two years, crediting an ecosystem-wide effort and naming contributors including Sean Bowe, genzcash, and Shielded Labs , alongside “many more who prefer to remain unnamed.” That resurgence, it argued, changes the operating environment: “We are no longer so small they can’t see us. Everyone can see us. We now need to get so big they can’t stop us.” For now, the tangible deliverable is cashZ, with the team promising more details later and signaling that execution will be the message. “Actions will speak louder than words,” Swihart wrote, urging users to join the waitlist as the developers “boot up” the new wallet and push toward what they describe as “onboarding billions to Zcash.” At press time, the ZEC price recovered some losses from yesterday’s crash and traded at $436.",Crypto News|ECC|Zashi Wallet|ZCash|Zcash News|ZCash Price|ZEC|ZEC News|ZEC price,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|TRADING|ZEC|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-09 22:30:36

Can this drive higher volumes to the network and favor a bullish Solana price prediction ? Solana Mobile is a mobile operating system that aims to break up the ruling “duopoly” of Apple and Google in this space. This week, they announced the launch of $SKR, the solution’s native asset. The token will give the community governance rights over the project’s roadmap and future. According to its website, 30% of the asset’s total supply of 10 billion will be airdropped to early users. The primary goal of Solana Mobile is to turn control of the ecosystem’s growth over to the community. Token holders will have the right to decide which applications are added and launched. Increased adoption of this solution should result in higher demand for SOL down the road, as the project continues to showcase its practical use cases. Solana Price Prediction: RSI Sends Buy Signal as SOL Breaks Out of Falling Wedge The daily chart shows that a promising falling wedge breakout occurred on January 3. SOL has kept rising since then. At the time of writing, it is the second-best-performing asset in the top 5 in the past 7 days with an 8% gain. Source: TradingView This shows that buying pressure is rising as altcoins continue to recover. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) had already sent a buy signal on December 26, as it broke above the 14-day moving average. This means that bullish momentum is gaining traction. As a result, SOL could rise to $160 first and then to $200. This second target would be attainable if the token manages to break past the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). Meanwhile, meme coins across the market have been gaining serious traction, with renewed interest driving strong momentum. Top presales like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) are riding that wave, building hype ahead of launch and positioning for potential upside once they hit major exchanges. Can Maxi Doge Be the Next Dogecoin-Style Meme Coin for Traders? Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is bringing back the early Dogecoin spirit, not just with memes, but with a real community built for traders who live for the next big move. Holding $MAXI also unlocks access to an exclusive idea hub, where the community shares early opportunities , chart setups , and valuable insights in real time . Competitions like Maxi Ripped and Maxi Gains add fuel to the fire, turning high-risk, high-reward trading into a game where the best plays get rewarded. With over $4.4 million raised, now is the best time to join early. To buy $MAXI before it lists on exchanges, simply head to the official Maxi Doge website and link up any compatible wallet, such as Best Wallet . You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card to complete your purchase in seconds.

Crypto price predictions are once again pointing toward lower targets for ETH and XRP, while some traders are rotating into new launches like Maxi Doge. Fundamentally, all three remain as strong as ever, which is why many investors are seeing these dips as opportunities rather than panicking. Ethereum (ETH) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Crypto Price Prediction: Ethereum ($ETH) — The Linux of Crypto Vitalik Buterin says Ethereum is similar to Linux, with both featuring open-source architecture, offering autonomy, and providing multiple options for customization and mass-adoption use cases. I respect the theory, Vitalik. That said, Ethereum is kicking off the year with solid price action. Ethereum managed to reclaim the $3,000 level on January 2 and has stayed above that critical level since. Source: ETHUSD / TradingView At the time of writing, ETH is looking weak and is following a broader market correction. It has just broken below the first support at $3,100. The RSI is around 37 and nearing oversold levels. If ETH manages to bounce from here, it could retest the resistance around $3,300. If it does not hold this area, the next psychological support sits at $3,000. A break below that level would likely invalidate the bullish scenario and open the door to further downside. Crypto Price Prediction: Ripple ($XRP) — First ETF Outflows in Months XRP’s long ETF green streak has stopped. Spot XRP ETFs just posted their first net outflow in nearly 2 months, with about $40.8M leaving the funds and cutting total inflows down to roughly $1.2B. That outflow, combined with broader market uncertainty, has hit altcoins harder. XRP is down around 12% over the past few days and about 6% in the last 24 hours alone. With RSI sitting around 40 and still room for more downside, XRP could easily drift back to the $2.00 area. If that level breaks and does not hold, a deeper pullback toward the old support around $1.80 comes into play. If $2.00 holds, though, a bounce toward $2.20 could happen at any moment. And if price manages to push above $2.20, a retest of the recent highs near $2.40 before the end of January becomes very likely. MaxiDoge ($MAXI) — Why It Could Be the Standout Memecoin in 2026 Maxi Doge is quickly becoming one of the standout meme presales of 2026. The project has already raised over $4.43M, putting it among the strongest early performers in the meme coin category this year. Unlike typical dog-themed tokens that rely only on hype, Maxi Doge is leaning heavily into engagement, with ROI competitions, community challenges, and ongoing events designed to keep participation high throughout the presale. The leverage-inspired mascot and fitness-themed branding help it stand out in a crowded market, while the staking system adds another layer. $MAXI holders can stake for daily smart-contract rewards, with current APY sitting around 70% , creating a passive income angle alongside the meme appeal. At a current price of $0.0002775, Maxi Doge is approaching its next scheduled presale price increase. With momentum building and community activity staying strong, Maxi Doge is positioning itself as a meme coin focused on sustained engagement rather than one-off hype.

Crucially, the road there largely depends on whether U.S. regulators will finally make good on their word to deliver comprehensive crypto legislation. One market indicator drawing close attention is the steady erosion of Bitcoin’s market dominance since summer. Historically, falling BTC dominance often signals capital rotating into altcoins. This creates the perfect conditions for blue-chip altcoins such as XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin to explode in the months ahead. XRP (XRP): Payments-Focused Blockchain Targets Fresh Q1 Highs Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) is the biggest crypto in cross-border payments, thanks to near-instant settlement times and ultra-low transaction costs. Purpose-built for banks and financial institutions, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) presents a modern alternative to SWIFT. XRP’s real-world utility has been highlighted in reports from organizations including the United Nations Capital Development Fund and the White House. Today, XRP stands as the third-largest non-stablecoin cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization above $127 billion. XRP rallied sharply to an all-time high (ATH) of $3.65 mid-2025 after winning a multi-year legal battle with the SEC. Since then, the price has retraced by roughly 42%, with XRP currently trading near $2.09. Demand is returning, with XRP gaining around 11% over the past week. This is down to the launch of several spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S., which allow traditional investors to gain exposure without directly holding crypto. Should additional ETF approvals arrive alongside clearer regulatory guidance, analysts believe XRP could challenge the $5 level before the end of Q1, with more bullish projections pointing toward $10 later in the year. Solana (SOL): High-Performance Blockchain Eyes New All-Time Highs Solana ($SOL) remains one of the most prominent smart-contract platforms in the crypto space. Known for its high-speed processing and low transaction fees, the network supports roughly $9 billion in total value locked (TVL) and commands a market capitalization of about $78 billion. Recent Solana spot ETF launches from Grayscale and Bitwise could unlock fresh institutional demand, echoing the capital inflows seen previously with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. SOL is currently trading in an important technical support zone around $137. The token is hovering above its 30-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term bounce toward $130 over the weekend if the wider market dips. A decisive breakout above the sticky $250 resistance level may open the door for Solana to cross its previous ATH of $293.31 by the end of the quarter, with easy potential for a $500 later target by midyear. Beyond price action, Solana is increasingly emerging as a preferred blockchain for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Major financial institutions, including BlackRock and Franklin Templeton, have already selected Solana to issue tokenized investment products. Dogecoin (DOGE): Can the Original Meme Coin Reach $1? Dogecoin ($DOGE) , first launched in 2013, remains one of crypto’s most recognizable assets thanks to its devoted “Doge Army.” Despite its jokey origins, DOGE now boasts a market capitalization of roughly $23.5 billion, underscoring its staying power. The coin’s explosive rally during the 2021 bull market, amplified by high-profile supporters such as Elon Musk, Snoop Dogg, and Gene Simmons, cemented Dogecoin as a household name in crypto. While initially created as satire, Dogecoin’s large and liquid market has helped curb its inherent meme coin volatility. As a result, DOGE often moves in tandem with major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. The rallying cry of “Dogecoin to $1” continues to resonate with fans, although achieving that level in 2026 may prove challenging without meaningful regulatory progress in the U.S. A significant policy shift, such as renewed momentum around initiatives like Project Crypto, could spark a move from today’s $0.14 up to $0.50 as early as spring. Real-world usage is steadily expanding. Tesla accepts DOGE for select merchandise, and major payment platforms such as PayPal and Revolut now support Dogecoin transactions. Dogecoin’s all-time high of $0.7316, set during the 2021 rally, remains well above current levels, with the token still trading around 81% below that peak. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): A Meme-Styled Bitcoin Layer-2 Solution An emerging project attracting growing interest is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a project that offers a serious upgrade to the Bitcoin network under the cloak of its meme coin aesthetic. In essence, Bitcoin Hyper will bring high-speed transactions, low fees, and smart-contract functionality to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Built using the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), Bitcoin Hyper features decentralized governance alongside a Canonical Bridge designed to streamline Bitcoin transfers across multiple blockchains. The ongoing presale has already secured $30.3 million in funding, and some analysts speculate the token could deliver outsized returns (potentially up to 100×) once it becomes publicly tradable. A recent Coinsult audit reported no security issues, offering reassurance to more risk-aware investors. HYPER tokens are used for transaction fees, governance participation, and staking incentives. Early stakers can currently earn yields of up to 38% APY, though returns decrease as the staking pool expands. With the full platform launch expected in 2026, Bitcoin Hyper presents an opportunity for both long-time maxis and Bitcoin newbies to participate in Bitcoin’s evolving ecosystem.

Based on the model’s latest projections, the next bull cycle could see all three altcoins push into uncharted territory, with the possibility of setting new all-time highs and possibly even generating 10x returns for current holders. Below is Perplexity’s assessment of how these notable altcoins could perform during a 2026 crypto bull market. XRP (XRP): Perplexity AI Sees $8 Potential for Ripple’s Star Payments Solution Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) opened the year with renewed strength, rallying 19% over the first seven days of January. According to Perplexity AI, sustained upside momentum could eventually carry XRP to $8 by 2027. Source: Perplexity AI XRP was a standout performer for most of last year, particularly in July when it surged to a seven-year high of $3.65. That rally followed Ripple’s pivotal courtroom win against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which removed a major regulatory cloud hanging over the asset. The token’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) has recently eased from overbought on Monday down to 56 as traders collect profits from the New Year buzz. While this indicates a pause in upward momentum, XRP is in a solid support zone, helping preserve recent gains. Currently trading near $2.13, a move to Perplexity’s upper price target would translate into returns exceeding 275% for existing holders. Institutional demand remains a central bullish driver. The introduction of spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. has attracted large investors, mirroring the early institutional inflows seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. A Pepe (PEPE): Perplexity AI Models a 420% Upside Scenario Pepe ($PEPE) , launched in April 2023, is the largest meme coin without a doge avatar, commanding a market capitalization of around $2.6 billion. Inspired by Matt Furie’s “Boy’s Club” comic series, Pepe’s strong identity and persistent cultural relevance have kept it firmly embedded in crypto social media discourse. Even amid fierce competition in the meme-coin sector, PEPE continues to benefit from deep liquidity and a committed community. Occasional cryptic posts from Elon Musk on X have also fueled speculation that PEPE may sit alongside his well-known DOGE and BTC holdings. At present, PEPE trades around $0.000006345, approximately 78% below its December 2024 all-time high of $0.00002803. Perplexity’s most aggressive projection suggests PEPE could rally 1,791% to $0.00012, potentially surpassing its previous ATH. Pi Network (PI): Perplexity AI Predicts Either a 1,300% Surge or Further Decline Pi Network ($PI), widely known for its mobile-first mining approach that rewards daily user participation, has shown notable resilience despite recent weakness across the broader crypto market. According to Perplexity’s analysis, strong bullish momentum could drive Pi Network from its current price of $0.2092 to as high as $3, representing upside potential of more than 1,334% from current prices. The token recently outperformed larger-cap cryptocurrencies following Pi Network’s announcement of a partnership with AI company OpenMind. The collaboration demonstrates how Pi node operators can supply decentralized computing power to external organizations, underscoring a tangible real-world use case. Additional tailwinds include recent testnet upgrades, such as decentralized exchange functionality, automated market makers, improved liquidity mechanisms, and an overhauled KYC framework, all of which significantly expand the platform’s capabilities. Maxi Doge (MAXI): High-Risk Meme Coin Play Outside Perplexity’s Scope While Perplexity’s projections focus on established cryptocurrencies, many investors continue to seek higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities in early-stage presales. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is one of the most compelling new entrants, raising over $4.4 million as traders stack tokens ahead of exchange listings. The project centres around the Maxi Doge persona, Dogecoin’s jacked, unhinged, and wildly entertaining cousin who’s spent years stewing on the sidelines while his famous relative soaked up the spotlight. Now Maxi Doge is storming back into the arena, armed with elite degen instincts, absurd conviction, and a trading style defined by 1,000x leverage, zero fear, and absolutely no stop losses. MAXI is issued as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network, giving it access to robust developer tooling and a lower environmental footprint compared with Dogecoin’s proof-of-work design. The current presale phase offers staking yields of up to 70% APY, though rewards are programmed to decrease as participation grows. MAXI is priced at $0.0002775 in the latest round, with automatic price increases scheduled for subsequent stages. Tokens can be purchased using MetaMask or Best Wallet . Maxi is sending Dogecoin back to the kennel with his tail between his legs! Stay updated through Maxi Doge’s official X and Telegram pages.

Though verified users of CNCK's crypto exchange have increased each month, that growth is slowing and exchange volume was down in each of the last two quarters. The company is growing through M&A and seemingly buying good assets. But dilution remains an ongoing risk to consider. CNCK is a volatile stock that should perform with digital assets broadly. It's a high-risk, high-rewards speculative stock trading at a premium to peers. About a year ago, I initiated coverage of Coincheck Group N.V. ( CNCK ) for Seeking Alpha. The company primarily operates a Japan-based cryptocurrency exchange. Back then, I called the stock a Hold and cited what I felt where way too many risks to consider longing the stock: There is valuation risk, single jurisdiction risk, and market risk. Demand for crypto assets in Japan simply has not been as robust as it is in the rest of the world. In hindsight, a Sell call would have been more appropriate as the stock has fallen by over 70% since my article last January. Given the massive slide in the stock's price as well as several catalysts since the last note, it's time to revisit CNCK. M&A Activity Over the last year, Coincheck has been quite active with mergers and acquisitions. In October, the company completed its purchase of crypto prime brokerage Aplo SAS in an all-stock transaction. Earlier in 2025, Coincheck bought Next Finance Tech Ltd in an effort to eliminate the need for the third party staking services the company had previously been using as part of its Coincheck Staking product. More recently, the company agreed to acquire Canadian digital asset manager 3iQ from Monex Group - the latter of which is a major shareholder of CNCK stock. The deal, which will again be an all-stock transaction, would result in 27,149,684 new shares being issued. While the dilution is significant given 130.8 million shares outstanding at the end of September and likely 5-6 million shares for the Aplo deal in October, these mergers do address one of the primary concerns that I had last year when I first covered the stock. Specifically, that crypto-interest levels from the Japanese market was lackluster and a company operating a retail investor crypto exchange solely in Japan was a potentially dubious investment. With the Aplo deal, Coincheck adds an institutional investor footprint in Europe. And assuming the 3iQ deal closes, Coincheck will have ETF assets managed in the Canadian market as well. Based on my calculations of 3iQ's management fees relative to the $1.1 billion in AUM currently managed by the company, Coincheck is paying a little under 7x sales to buy 3iQ. This puts the valuation of 3iQ in line with BlackRock ( BLK ). Furthermore, Monex Group did the deal at $4 per share while CNCK stock trades under $3. My interpretation of this is Monex is simply consolidating its crypto business assets while also signaling to the market that it is committed to holding the newly issued shares since the market values them well below $4. Coincheck Metrics One of the metrics that Coincheck frequently shares to show growth is its verified accounts for the Coincheck platform. As of the end of December, that figure was just under 2.5 million. Something to consider is that month over month growth in verified accounts did go down slightly during the three months ended December. During calendar Q4 '24, monthly verified account growth averaged 1.5% each month. That figure was down to just 0.7% during calendar Q4-25. Coincheck Verified Accounts (Coincheck, Analyst's Chart) For the benefit of simplicity, we're going to also look at the quarterly exchange data through calendar year quarters rather than fiscal year quarters. While we don't yet have full financials for Coincheck through the end of calendar 2025, we do have the exchange volume data through the end of the year and it isn't really a pretty story. Calendar Quarters Exchange Volume (millions Yen) YoY Change Q2-24 1,050,308 Q3-24 1,062,632 Q4-24 1,674,094 Q1-25 1,459,506 Q2-25 1,052,175 0.18% Q3-25 949,466 -10.65% Q4-25 1,209,344 -27.76% Source: Coincheck filings. The table above shows that year over year exchange volume in 2025 has declined in each of the last two quarters. To be sure, Q4 '25 has a difficult year over year comparison due to the strength of Q4 '24. But even if we take the average exchange volume from the last three quarters compared to the prior year, 2025 was down by 15% from the 2024 time period. Latest Financials Despite the weakness in exchange volume during the 3 months ended September, Coincheck was able to generate a 58% increase in dollar-denominated top line revenue from the prior quarter and an 84% increase year over year. In Q2 for fiscal 2026, Coincheck reported $900 million in total revenue and a net profit of $2.4 million: FY26 Q2 (Coincheck) This was a sequential improvement from FY26-Q1 where Coincheck reported a $9.3 million net loss. The company said the biggest reason for the improvement in the bottom line was gross margin growth as well as declines in SG&A during the quarter. Given the cash burn through the first two quarters of fiscal year 2026, Coincheck has several quarters of cash remaining before it would figure to need to raise capital with over $60 million in cash and equivalents: Assets (Coincheck) A large amount of the assets held by the company are customer assets and borrowed crypto assets. Netting out those deposits and crypto borrowings, Coincheck has a little over $70 million in equity. Which means that at a $368 million market capitalization, CNCK is trading at a little over 5 times book value. Which is a bit pricey for the financials sector median of 1.3 and a little higher than the 4x book multiple the market is currently giving Coinbase ( COIN ). And again, there is likely going to be another 27 million shares issued when the company closes the 3iQ deal. Risks There are still several risks that potential investors should consider before longing CNCK. Given the combination of growing users and declining volume in 2025 through the company's legacy product, I think it's pretty clear Coincheck had to do something to stimulate top line revenue growth going forward. M&A is certainly a way to do that provided it brings complementary pieces into the company. In my view, Coincheck is improving its portfolio of assets out of a single jurisdiction and into synergistic businesses. But it is coming at a cost to shareholders through dilution. This is something I think investors need to continue to monitor due to Coincheck's stated goals from its prior earnings presentation. The company apparently wants to get into payments and lending as well. Closing Summary Believe it or not, I don't actually hate a speculative CNCK long under $3 per share. I'm not personally holding the stock currently. But in a broader risk market rally that takes stocks and crypto higher, I think CNCK could potentially see gains. Shares traded as high as $9 less than two months ago. Data by YCharts There was a massive intraday move on December 1st that saw over 27 million shares traded during a rally that more than doubled the stock price. Since then, CNCK shares have bled down to a fresh 52 week low before rallying back up over $3. The point is, it's an incredibly volatile stock right now. And if we see digital assets make a move higher, it would figure to bring CNCK shares higher in tandem. To be sure, this is not necessarily a great reason to ""invest"" in the stock. But if you're looking for high-risk, high-reward plays in the digital asset space, CNCK may not be a bad option.",CNCK,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2026-01-09 22:35:43

The lure behind new restrictions is a controversial Polymarket bet, which started as a bet of $32,000 but eventually became more than $400,000 shortly before the unexpected detention of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. The bill proposed by the New York Representative Ritchie Torres is the Public Integrity in Financial Prediction Markets Act of 2026. Proud to introduce the Public Integrity in Financial Prediction Markets Act today with the support of 30+ of my colleagues. The blurred line between predicting and profiting does not simply corrupt markets; it corrupts the government itself. https://t.co/uayPKdHxQn — Rep. Ritchie Torres (@RepRitchie) January 9, 2026 Torres explained that the bill came about because there was a new Polymarket account that had made a big bet on Maduro being ousted by the end of January 2026, when market odds said that the event was exceptionally unlikely to happen. Several hours later, the U.S. officials stated that Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were arrested in an overnight raid that was coordinated by the Trump administration. $BTC stays resilient above $90K despite US–Venezuela tensions, with on-chain data pointing to steady holder behavior and market calm #Bitcoin #Venezuela https://t.co/pV1VWDArfm — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 5, 2026 The contract soon repaid it within the maximum payoff, producing yields of over 1,200%. Subsequently, concerns have been raised by lawmakers and market analysts that the trade might have been pegged on material nonpublic information. Torres claimed that the episode revealed a loophole in federal legislation when prediction markets occur in mass and power, especially when they touch on major political or military judgments. @RitchieTorres moves to ban officials from trading on prediction markets after $400K Maduro bet. #PredictionMarkets #USPolitics https://t.co/SgGankYd1U — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 6, 2026 Lawmakers Seek to Close Insider Trading Loopholes in Prediction Markets Under the proposed legislation, federally elected officials, political appointees, executive branch employees, and congressional staff would be barred from buying, selling, or trading prediction market contracts linked to government policy, actions, or political outcomes. The bill does not introduce new penalties but seeks to clearly extend existing insider trading standards to prediction markets, which currently operate in a fragmented regulatory environment. Torres explained that the convergence of government activity and prediction markets represents a definite public integrity hazard, and officials cannot be put in a situation where they are able to financially gain as a result of the impacts they may have. Similar anxieties were expressed by legal writers and economists, who argued that insider trading distorts and diminishes market confidence and lowers the utility of prediction markets as forecasting instruments. The legislation is co-sponsored by a wide coalition of House Democrats, including Pelosi, Rashida Tlaib, Brad Sherman, Seth Moulton, and several other senior lawmakers. Supporters say the bill builds on the principles of the STOCK Act , which governs insider trading by members of Congress in traditional financial markets, while updating those rules for newer financial instruments. Prediction Markets Expand Rapidly as U.S. Policy Shifts The move comes as prediction markets have expanded rapidly, with the combined trading volume across major platforms exceeding $44 billion in 2025, with weekly notional volume surpassing $5 billion in early January 2026. Political events, particularly elections and geopolitical flashpoints, have become some of the most heavily traded markets. At the federal level, prediction markets have shifted from an outright ban to a more permissive stance following a series of court rulings. In 2024, a federal court ruled that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission had overstepped its authority by blocking election-related prediction contracts, a decision later upheld on appeal. Earlier enforcement actions had pushed platforms out of the U.S. market, with Polymarket blocked in 2022 after settling with the CFTC over operating an unregistered platform. Meanwhile, Kalshi was also prevented from listing election contracts in 2023 despite operating as a regulated exchange. The CFTC dropped its challenge in 2025 and has since adopted a more pro-innovation approach, issuing no-action letters for certain event contracts in December 2025.

The decision comes amid a periodic review, which Arkham carries out to determine how relevant a chain is based on factors like user demand and its overall importance to the crypto industry. Arkham’s recent cuts this year have targeted L2s Arkham shared its plan to cut Linea’s support on January 9 via its official X page, claiming Linea , which is an Ethereum layer-2 network developed by Consensys, had seemingly fallen short of its criteria. While the X post did not mention exactly which criteria failed to meet, many in the comments section speculated that it must be because it is not generating enough activity or there’s barely any interest from users to justify the cost of its maintenance. More importantly, Linea is not the only L2 to be cut by Arkham, Manta blockchain, and the Blast network are also set to be removed on January 11, according to announcements shared via their X page. Only those three have so far been announced, and the announcements all came within days of each other after we entered the new year. Last year, there were no records of any such drops by Arkham, highlighting the start of a trend that indicates Arkham may be getting rid of the less relevant or used chains as part of its routine optimization. Reactions to the removal have been mostly mixed, with users highlighting concerns about how this would result in reduced visibility for Linea and Manta, making it harder to track token movements or dumps without Arkham’s help. Does Arkham still support any L2? According to data from Arkham’s platform, the remaining Ethereum Layer 2 networks that survived the recent culling include Arbitrum , Base, Mantle, Optimism, and Polygon, specifically Polygon zkEVM. They are all famous as Ethereum scaling solutions, and thanks to the Dencun upgrade from 2024, which outsourced transaction execution to the L2s, they are less parasitic in their relationship with Ethereum, the Layer 1 they all operate on. This has increased their relevance, ensuring they will continue to see usage across key metrics as more users transact on ETH. It has also freed the L1 to focus on being a secure settlement and data availability layer, while outsourcing the actual traffic to the L2s. The Dencun upgrade introduced protodanksharding — the use of blobs — which provide a dedicated space for L2 data that doesn’t compete with standard Ethereum transactions. In 2025, subsequent upgrades like the Pectra and Fusaka upgrades built on the Dencun update by increasing the blob capacity. However, the Dencun upgrade was the pivotal one that made the idea viable. The next upgrade to occur will be the Glasterdam upgrade, scheduled for the first half of 2026, which is expected to significantly increase the number of blobs the Ethereum chain can handle, subsequently boosting the capacity of its L2s. There are also plans to increase the blob capacity via full danksharding, but the timeline for that is currently unknown. Get seen where it counts.

Rather than organic DeFi usage, institutional participation has taken the lead. The ETF narrative has broadened regulated digital asset exposure in U.S. TradFi markets, creating institutional-grade demand with a clear preference for ETH. Ethereum Price Predicition: Why Are Institutions Bullish on ETH? This capital rotation may have also been strategic, with Ethereum reaching the bottom of a potential 20-month bullish head-and-shoulders breakout over 2025. The Ethereum price has confirmed a local bottom at $2,750, forming higher lows in a fresh uptrend that solidifies the right shoulder. Momentum indicators add validity to the trend. The RSI is pressing against the 50 neutral line after several higher lows, suggesting strength beneath the surface. The MACD has also reversed towards the signal line in a potential golden cross setup, a sign that buyers may soon control the prevailing trend. A fully realised pattern breakout could see the neckline tested around $5,500 , reclaiming past all-time highs and entering new price discovery in a 75% move . But as the bull market matures, broader institutional participation alongside traction in DeFi as mainstream use cases are realised could extend the move 225% to $10,000 . Traders should watch historical psychological levels around $3,500 and $4000 all-time highs as interim resistance to the move. Bitcoin Hyper: Solana Technology Being Used for Bitcoin Institutions that chose Ethereum as their TradFi bet may soon need to reconsider, as the Bitcoin ecosystem finally tackles its biggest limitation: scalability. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bridging Bitcoin’s security with Solana tech, creating a new Layer-2 network that unlocks scalable, efficient use cases Bitcoin couldn’t support on its own. Just as Layer-2s like Ondo did for Ethereum, Bitcoin Hyper could bring Bitcoin deeper into the DeFi conversation. The project has already raised over $30 million in presale, and post-launch, even a small fraction of Bitcoin’s massive trading volume could send $HYPER significantly higher. Bitcoin Hyper is fixing the slow transactions, high fees, and limited programmability that have long capped Bitcoin’s potential – just as the market turns bullish.

This staggering figure, reported by analytics firm Centora (formerly IntoTheBlock) on social media platform X, represents an astronomical 2,500% increase from the modest $16 million recorded just one year prior. This explosive growth, observed globally throughout 2024, signals a profound acceleration in the institutional and retail adoption of blockchain-based traditional securities. Tokenized Equities Market Cap Reaches Unprecedented Heights The journey from $16 million to over $800 million in market capitalization for tokenized equities is not merely a statistic. It is a clear indicator of a fundamental shift in asset management and investment accessibility. Tokenization refers to the process of converting rights to a real-world asset, like a share of stock, into a digital token on a blockchain. Consequently, these tokens can represent fractional ownership, enabling broader participation. The reported data underscores a massive influx of capital and confidence into this nascent sector. Several key drivers have fueled this remarkable expansion. First, increased regulatory clarity in major jurisdictions has provided a more stable framework for issuance. Second, major financial institutions have launched pilot programs and products, lending credibility. Third, the technological infrastructure for trading and custody has matured significantly. Finally, investor demand for programmable, 24/7 tradable assets that bridge traditional and decentralized finance has surged. Understanding the Drivers Behind the Digital Surge To comprehend a 2,500% year-over-year growth rate, one must examine the underlying catalysts. The convergence of several macroeconomic and technological trends created a perfect environment for tokenized equities. Initially, rising interest rates in traditional markets prompted investors to seek innovative yield-generating and efficient asset structures. Simultaneously, advancements in blockchain scalability and interoperability reduced technical barriers. Institutional Endorsement and Regulatory Evolution The participation of established financial entities has been pivotal. For instance, global investment banks and asset managers have moved beyond mere exploration to active testing and limited commercial deployment. This institutional endorsement acts as a powerful validation signal for the entire asset class. Furthermore, regulatory bodies in financial hubs like Singapore, the European Union, and parts of the United States have progressed from warnings to proposing concrete, structured guidelines for security token offerings (STOs). The practical benefits of tokenization are now being realized on a larger scale: Fractional Ownership: High-value equities become accessible to a wider pool of investors. Enhanced Liquidity: Assets traditionally locked in private markets can trade on digital platforms. Operational Efficiency: Settlement times reduce from days (T+2) to minutes or seconds. Programmability: Smart contracts can automate dividends, voting, and compliance. Growth Timeline of Tokenized Equities Market Cap Time Period Approximate Market Cap Key Development Early 2023 $16 Million Nascent stage, dominated by early prototypes and niche platforms. Mid-2023 $100 Million First major bank-led pilot programs announced. Late 2023 $300 Million Regulatory frameworks begin to solidify in key regions. Early 2024 $500 Million Significant capital inflows from institutional funds. Late 2024 / Early 2025 $800+ Million Widespread platform launches and product diversification. The Broader Impact on Global Financial Markets This meteoric rise in the tokenized equities market cap has tangible implications for global finance. Primarily, it introduces a new layer of competition and innovation for traditional stock exchanges and brokerage services. Market infrastructure providers are now compelled to integrate or develop blockchain-compatible systems. Moreover, the success of tokenized equities paves the way for the tokenization of other asset classes, including real estate, commodities, and private debt. The growth also highlights the maturation of the underlying technology. Early concerns about security, custody, and market manipulation are being addressed through enterprise-grade solutions. As a result, risk-averse participants are gaining comfort. The data from Centora serves as a quantitative benchmark, proving that what was once a theoretical concept has achieved substantial, measurable scale. Challenges and Considerations for Sustainable Growth Despite the optimistic figures, the sector faces ongoing challenges. Regulatory harmonization across borders remains incomplete, creating complexity for cross-border offerings. Additionally, the legal treatment of tokenized securities in disputes or bankruptcies is still being tested in some jurisdictions. Market participants must also navigate the evolving landscape of tax reporting for digital asset transactions. Addressing these issues is crucial for transitioning from explosive growth to stable, long-term expansion. Conclusion The surpassing of an $800 million market capitalization for tokenized equities, representing a 2,500% surge from the previous year, marks a definitive inflection point. This milestone, confirmed by Centora’s analysis, demonstrates that blockchain-based digital securities have moved firmly from pilot phase to a viable, growing component of the global financial ecosystem. The convergence of institutional adoption, regulatory progress, and technological maturity has created powerful momentum. While challenges persist, the trajectory indicates that tokenized equities are poised to play an increasingly significant role in shaping the future of capital markets, democratizing access, and enhancing financial system efficiency. FAQs Q1: What exactly are tokenized equities? Tokenized equities are digital tokens on a blockchain that represent ownership in a traditional company’s stock. They mirror the economic rights of the underlying share, such as potential dividends and capital appreciation, but exist in a programmable digital format. Q2: Who is Centora, and why is their report significant? Centora, formerly known as IntoTheBlock, is a prominent market intelligence and analytics firm specializing in blockchain data. Their report is significant because it provides a trusted, data-driven benchmark from a recognized source within the industry, offering credible verification of the market’s growth. Q3: What does a 2,500% increase in market cap actually mean? A 2,500% increase means the total value of all tokenized equity tokens grew 25-fold in one year. Essentially, for every $1 the market was worth at the start of the period, it is now worth $25. This indicates extremely rapid adoption and capital allocation. Q4: Are tokenized equities the same as cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin? No, they are fundamentally different. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are native digital assets with no underlying claim. Tokenized equities are digital representations of existing, regulated traditional assets (stocks). Their value is directly tied to the performance of the real-world company. Q5: What are the main risks of investing in tokenized equities? Key risks include regulatory uncertainty, potential technological vulnerabilities in the supporting platform, lower liquidity compared to major traditional exchanges, and the complexity of legal recourse in a developing digital asset legal framework. Investors must conduct thorough due diligence.

In a video, Claver said Ripple spent roughly $2.45 billion on acquisitions in the last seven months of 2025, arguing the purchases form “pillars for a master plan” that mirrors how Amazon built dominance by owning infrastructure rather than just selling products. Why Ripple Could Be The ‘Next Amazon’ The core analogy was explicit. “Amazon’s success came from building infrastructure, not just from self products,” Claver said. “You got AWS. It became the most profitable piece of their business. That was infrastructure. They own all of the warehouses and logistics and the cloud and the marketplace.” Related Reading: How XRP Ledger Becomes The Leading Blockchain In 2026: Fintech CEO His contention is that infrastructure plays create structural advantages: lower marginal costs, faster iteration, and higher switching costs once institutions integrate. “This vertical integration is rare in financial services,” he said, arguing that most firms “specialize in one layer or partner for the rest,” which introduces friction, delays, and blame-shifting when systems fail. He also claimed the endgame resembles “winner take all dynamics,” where “network effects make the large networks exponentially more valuable than small ones” and “switching becomes cost prohibitive” once workflows are embedded. To explain the Amazon comparison, Claver mapped Ripple’s 2025 deals to what he sees as the minimum viable infrastructure bundle for an institutional “platform.” “You need custody and clearing for assets. You need treasury management for corporate operations. You need payment rails that work globally 24/7, 365,” he said. “You need a stable coin infrastructure for efficient settlements. And you need settlement assets to be able to move between all of those.” He argued Ripple has assembled those layers through a mix of older buys and 2025 mega-deals, culminating in what he called an end-to-end institutional product branded “Ripple 1.” The most prominent 2025 move, Claver said, was the $1.25 billion purchase of Hidden Road in April, now rebranded “Ripple Prime.” His framing: prime brokerage is the institutional “plumbing” that makes large-scale trading and settlement possible. “Prime brokers provide the behind-the-scenes services that make institutional trading possible,” he said. “They handle clearing. They make sure trade actually settles between counterparties. They provide custody and hold assets securely.” He added that Hidden Road served “over 300 institutional clients” and cleared “more than $3 trillion” in 2024, and claimed the business has grown “3x” since the acquisition announcement. Related Reading: XRP Retrace Is Only Temporary, What Happens Once the Uptrend Resumes He also pointed to an integration hook meant to create internal demand for Ripple’s stablecoin: “Hidden Road will use RLUSD as collateral across prime brokerage products. And this creates organic demand for Ripple stablecoin with institutional adoption.” The second pillar, he said, was Rail, acquired for about $200 million in August 2025, described as a stablecoin payments platform that operates 24/7 and reduces the need for enterprises to hold crypto directly. He claimed Rail was forecast to process “over 10%” of a $36 billion global B2B stablecoin payments market in 2025. Third came GTreasury, acquired for $1 billion after being announced in October 2025 and closing in December, which Claver described as treasury software used by large corporations and processing $12.5 trillion in annual payment volume. The strategic value, he argued, is distribution: access to CFOs and treasurers via trusted software already embedded in corporate finance workflows. The fourth, Palisade, announced in November 2025 with undisclosed terms, was framed as the “hot wallet” layer: operational wallet-as-a-service infrastructure for high-velocity transaction use cases, complementing deeper custody solutions.

According to their latest analysis, Bitcoin could potentially reach an astonishing $53.4 million by 2050 under a hyperbitcoinization scenario. This forecast, reported by Decrypt on November 15, 2024, presents one of the most ambitious long-term projections for the pioneering cryptocurrency. The analysis fundamentally reimagines Bitcoin’s role in the global financial system. VanEck’s Bitcoin Price Prediction Framework VanEck’s analysis employs a sophisticated multi-scenario approach to Bitcoin valuation. The global investment firm, which manages approximately $90 billion in assets, developed three distinct models. Each model represents different adoption trajectories for Bitcoin over the next 26 years. Consequently, investors can evaluate the cryptocurrency’s potential across various economic conditions. The firm’s methodology incorporates both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments of Bitcoin’s evolving utility. The analysis specifically examines Bitcoin’s potential integration into international trade and domestic economic measurement. VanEck’s researchers considered historical adoption curves of transformative technologies. They also analyzed monetary metals like gold as comparative assets. The resulting framework provides a structured way to assess Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. This approach reflects VanEck’s extensive experience in asset valuation and macroeconomic analysis. The Three Scenarios: Bullish, Base, and Bearish VanEck constructed three primary scenarios for Bitcoin’s development through 2050. Each scenario corresponds to different levels of global adoption and economic integration. Hyperbitcoinization Scenario ($53.4 million): This optimistic projection assumes Bitcoin captures 20% of international trade settlement volume. Additionally, it presumes Bitcoin represents 10% of U.S. Gross Domestic Product. Under these conditions, Bitcoin would function as a primary global reserve asset. Base Case Scenario ($2.9 million): This moderate forecast assumes steady but less dramatic adoption. Bitcoin would achieve meaningful penetration as a store of value and settlement layer. However, it wouldn’t dominate global trade or national economic measurement. Bearish Scenario ($130,000): This conservative model projects only 2% annual growth. It assumes limited expansion beyond Bitcoin’s current use cases and adoption levels. VanEck Bitcoin Price Forecast Scenarios for 2050 Scenario 2050 Price Target Key Assumptions Hyperbitcoinization $53.4 million 20% of international trade, 10% of U.S. GDP Base Case $2.9 million Moderate adoption as digital gold Bearish $130,000 2% annual growth, limited new adoption Understanding the Hyperbitcoinization Concept Hyperbitcoinization represents a theoretical economic transformation where Bitcoin becomes the dominant global currency. The term originated within cryptocurrency communities to describe a potential future state. In this state, individuals and institutions prefer Bitcoin over national fiat currencies. This preference would stem from Bitcoin’s superior monetary properties, including its fixed supply and decentralized nature. VanEck’s analysis applies this concept within a structured financial framework. The firm’s researchers examined how hyperbitcoinization might manifest in practical economic terms. They specifically focused on international trade settlement and GDP measurement. These metrics provide tangible ways to quantify Bitcoin’s potential economic impact. The analysis avoids speculative hype by grounding predictions in measurable economic activities. Historical precedents offer context for such monetary transitions. The global financial system has experienced several reserve currency shifts throughout history. The British pound sterling dominated international trade during the 19th century. Subsequently, the U.S. dollar assumed this role following World War II. Each transition involved complex economic and geopolitical factors. Bitcoin’s potential ascent would represent the first digitally-native reserve asset transition. Bitcoin as a Global Reserve Asset VanEck’s analysis positions Bitcoin as a potential peer or successor to gold as a reserve asset. Gold currently represents approximately $13 trillion in global above-ground value. Central banks and sovereign wealth funds hold significant gold reserves. These institutions value gold for its scarcity, durability, and independence from any single government. Bitcoin shares several of gold’s monetary characteristics while offering distinct advantages. Its digital nature enables instant global settlement. Its verifiable scarcity provides predictable inflation resistance. Its decentralized architecture ensures no single entity controls the network. These properties could make Bitcoin attractive to institutions seeking diversification from traditional assets. Several developments already signal growing institutional interest in Bitcoin. Major corporations now hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets. Sovereign wealth funds have begun exploring cryptocurrency allocations. Central banks are researching digital currencies, both centralized and decentralized. These trends suggest Bitcoin’s institutional adoption trajectory may accelerate in coming decades. Methodology Behind the $53.4 Million Valuation VanEck’s valuation methodology combines several analytical approaches. The firm’s researchers first estimated the total addressable market for Bitcoin. They examined global trade volumes, which currently exceed $32 trillion annually. They also analyzed U.S. GDP, which approaches $28 trillion. These figures provide the economic scale against which to measure Bitcoin’s potential penetration. The analysis then applied percentage allocations to these massive economic aggregates. The 20% international trade assumption represents approximately $6.4 trillion in annual settlement volume. The 10% U.S. GDP assumption represents about $2.8 trillion in economic measurement. These allocations, while substantial, remain below dominant market positions. This conservative approach within an optimistic scenario strengthens the analysis’s credibility. VanEck’s team then translated these economic allocations into Bitcoin price targets. They considered Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins. They also accounted for potential coin loss and long-term holding patterns. The resulting calculations produced the $53.4 million price target under hyperbitcoinization conditions. This methodology provides transparency about the assumptions driving the extraordinary forecast. Comparative Analysis with Traditional Assets VanEck’s forecast invites comparison with traditional asset classes. The $53.4 million price target would give Bitcoin a total market capitalization exceeding $1.1 quadrillion. This figure dwarfs current valuations of all major asset classes combined. However, the analysis assumes significant economic transformation rather than mere asset appreciation. Gold’s total market value provides a more relevant comparison point. At current prices, all above-ground gold represents approximately $13 trillion. Bitcoin reaching $53.4 million would represent nearly 100 times gold’s current valuation. This multiple reflects Bitcoin’s potential advantages in transferability, divisibility, and verifiability. It also accounts for Bitcoin’s potential to capture value beyond traditional store-of-value functions. Equity markets offer another reference point. The total global equity market capitalization currently approaches $110 trillion. Bitcoin at $53.4 million would represent approximately ten times this value. This comparison highlights the transformative economic assumptions underlying VanEck’s hyperbitcoinization scenario. The forecast essentially predicts Bitcoin becoming the foundation of a new global monetary system. Historical Context and Adoption Trajectories Technological adoption typically follows predictable patterns, though at varying speeds. The internet required approximately 25 years to reach 50% global penetration. Mobile phones achieved similar adoption in about 20 years. Bitcoin, launched in 2009, now reaches an estimated 5-10% global adoption. Extending this trajectory suggests potentially much higher penetration by 2050. Financial innovations often follow slower adoption curves than consumer technologies. Credit cards required decades to achieve widespread acceptance. Electronic trading platforms needed years to dominate financial markets. Bitcoin’s adoption as a financial asset may therefore progress more gradually than its technological adoption. VanEck’s scenarios account for these differing adoption velocities across use cases. Regulatory developments will significantly influence Bitcoin’s adoption trajectory. Clear regulatory frameworks typically accelerate institutional participation. Conversely, restrictive regulations may slow adoption in certain jurisdictions. The global nature of Bitcoin creates complex regulatory dynamics. Different countries will likely adopt varying approaches to cryptocurrency regulation and integration. Potential Economic Impacts and Considerations Widespread Bitcoin adoption would create profound economic effects. Monetary policy implementation would require fundamental rethinking. International trade settlement would become more efficient but potentially more volatile. Financial inclusion could expand dramatically in underbanked regions. These transformations carry both opportunities and challenges for global economic stability. Transition risks represent significant considerations. Moving from current financial systems to Bitcoin-dominant systems would create dislocation. Legacy financial institutions would need to adapt or risk obsolescence. Governments would face revenue challenges if Bitcoin reduces seigniorage income. These practical considerations temper even optimistic adoption forecasts. Technological developments will also shape Bitcoin’s future. The Lightning Network and other layer-two solutions could enhance Bitcoin’s transaction capacity. Privacy improvements might address regulatory concerns about transparency. Security advancements could further harden the network against attacks. These innovations will determine Bitcoin’s practical utility for global economic functions. Expert Perspectives on Long-Term Crypto Forecasts Financial analysts approach long-term cryptocurrency forecasts with appropriate caution. Most recognize the inherent uncertainty in predicting technological adoption decades ahead. However, structured scenario analysis provides valuable frameworks for understanding potential futures. VanEck’s methodology represents this disciplined approach to long-term forecasting. Historical financial forecasts offer humility about prediction accuracy. Economists consistently fail to predict recessions more than a year in advance. Stock market forecasts beyond five years show little correlation with actual outcomes. These limitations remind investors that all long-term forecasts contain substantial uncertainty. Scenario planning, rather than precise prediction, often provides more practical value. Despite these uncertainties, institutional analysis of Bitcoin has matured significantly. Major financial institutions now employ dedicated cryptocurrency research teams. Academic programs increasingly include blockchain and cryptocurrency curricula. Regulatory bodies have developed more sophisticated understanding of digital assets. This professionalization improves the quality of long-term analysis, though uncertainty remains inherent. Conclusion VanEck’s Bitcoin price prediction presents a compelling vision of cryptocurrency’s potential future. The $53.4 million 2050 forecast under hyperbitcoinization conditions challenges conventional financial thinking. However, the analysis provides a structured framework for evaluating Bitcoin’s long-term potential. The multi-scenario approach acknowledges the significant uncertainty surrounding such distant forecasts. Investors should consider these projections as illustrative scenarios rather than precise predictions. The analysis ultimately highlights Bitcoin’s transformative potential within the global financial system. As adoption continues evolving, Bitcoin’s role may expand in unexpected directions. VanEck’s forecast provides valuable perspective for long-term strategic planning regarding digital assets. FAQs Q1: What is hyperbitcoinization according to VanEck’s analysis? VanEck defines hyperbitcoinization as a scenario where Bitcoin accounts for 20% of international trade settlement and 10% of U.S. GDP, establishing it as a dominant global reserve asset. Q2: How does VanEck’s base case Bitcoin price prediction for 2050 compare to the hyperbitcoinization forecast? The base case predicts Bitcoin reaching $2.9 million by 2050, assuming moderate adoption as a digital store of value without dominating global trade or national economic measurement. Q3: What methodology did VanEck use to calculate the $53.4 million Bitcoin price target? VanEck analyzed global trade volumes and U.S. GDP, applied percentage allocations to Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins, and accounted for potential coin loss and holding patterns. Q4: How does Bitcoin’s potential role as a reserve asset compare to gold in VanEck’s analysis? VanEck suggests Bitcoin could establish itself as a global reserve asset on par with or exceeding gold, leveraging advantages in transferability, divisibility, and verifiable scarcity. Q5: What are the main factors that could prevent Bitcoin from reaching VanEck’s hyperbitcoinization forecast? Key limiting factors include regulatory restrictions, technological limitations, competition from other digital assets, failure to achieve sufficient institutional adoption, and unforeseen security vulnerabilities.

But this might just be a minor setback for bullish XRP price predictions. In the past 7 days, this altcoin has booked a 10.5% gain, being the top-performing asset in the top 5 during this period. Trading volumes jumped as buying pressure accelerated. However, bulls encountered strong selling pressure at $2.35. This level coincides with the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). The price action clearly rejected a move above this key line, indicating that the market is not yet ready to reverse its course. Meanwhile, XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) booked their first day of negative net inflows since the first of these vehicles was listed in the United States. XRP Price Prediction: XRP Needs to Stay Above $1.95 to Keep the Rally Alive As a result of the latest rally, XRP broke its bearish price structure and has already formed what could be the first leg up of an uptrend. The $1.95 level remains the key support to watch, as this is an important structural area. Source: TradingView If the price dips below this mark, it would mean that sellers are still in control of the price action, and this latest climb was just a “relief rally.” Instead, if XRP bounces back strongly off this mark, or before it hits it, the uptrend will stay alive. The next milestone would be breaking past the 200-day EMA to confirm that buyers have the strength to keep pushing the price to new heights. The crypto market is sending all kinds of signals that a recovery has started. Same as XRP, a top crypto presale called Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is seeing huge interest for bringing Solana technology to the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Uses Solana’s Architecture to Build Bitcoin’s Future Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a high-potential presale aiming to unlock the next evolution of Bitcoin by making it faster, cheaper, and ready for real DeFi.

The President specifically ruled out deploying ground troops while warning of American action if Iran escalates violence against its people, creating a complex strategic scenario that analysts are now carefully examining. Trump’s Iran Intervention Warning and Strategic Implications President Trump made his remarks during a White House briefing last week, stating clearly that the United States would intervene if Iran begins killing people. However, he immediately clarified that this intervention would not involve ground troop deployments. This nuanced position represents a deliberate shift in American foreign policy approach toward Iran. The statement comes amid ongoing tensions between Washington and Tehran that have persisted for decades. Historical context reveals this isn’t the first time a U.S. administration has considered intervention in Iran. The Eisenhower administration orchestrated the 1953 coup against Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh. The Carter administration attempted hostage rescue operations in 1980. More recently, the Obama administration pursued diplomatic channels leading to the 2015 nuclear deal, which the Trump administration subsequently abandoned in 2018. Several factors distinguish Trump’s current warning from previous administrations’ approaches: Explicit exclusion of ground forces from potential intervention scenarios Conditional trigger based specifically on Iranian actions against its population Market-focused communication that acknowledges economic implications Strategic ambiguity about what forms intervention might actually take Military Options Without Ground Troops Deployment Military analysts have identified several potential intervention methods that align with Trump’s ground troops exclusion. These options represent modern warfare approaches that minimize American casualties while maximizing strategic impact. The Pentagon has developed numerous contingency plans for Iran over decades, with recent updates focusing on limited engagement scenarios. A comparative analysis of potential intervention methods reveals distinct advantages and limitations: Intervention Method Strategic Advantages Potential Limitations Historical Precedents Airstrikes & Drone Operations Precision targeting, reduced risk to personnel, rapid deployment Collateral damage concerns, limited intelligence requirements 2011 Libya intervention, ongoing counterterrorism operations Naval Blockade Economic pressure without direct combat, international law framework Lengthy timeline, requires coalition support, escalation risks Cuban Missile Crisis 1962, Gulf War 1990-1991 Cyber Operations Deniability, minimal physical damage, targeted infrastructure disruption Attribution challenges, potential for retaliation in kind Stuxnet attack 2010, recent Russian and Chinese operations Special Operations Surgical precision, intelligence gathering, rapid extraction Higher personnel risk, limited scale, political sensitivity Bin Laden raid 2011, various counterterrorism missions Each method carries distinct implications for regional stability and international relations. Furthermore, the selection of any particular approach would signal specific strategic priorities to both allies and adversaries. Military planners must balance effectiveness against escalation risks carefully. Expert Analysis of Strategic Calculations Retired General David Petraeus, former CIA director and CENTCOM commander, recently analyzed the strategic landscape in Foreign Affairs magazine. He noted that “any U.S. intervention in Iran would require meticulous planning and clear objectives.” Petraeus emphasized that excluding ground troops significantly alters operational calculus, forcing reliance on air, naval, and cyber capabilities. Dr. Suzanne Maloney, vice president at the Brookings Institution and Iran expert, provides crucial context about Iranian domestic dynamics. “The Iranian government faces mounting internal pressures,” she explains. “Economic challenges and social unrest create vulnerabilities that external actors might seek to exploit.” Maloney’s research indicates that U.S. statements directly influence Iranian internal debates about security priorities. Market analysts immediately recognized the geopolitical risk implications of Trump’s warning. Brent crude prices increased 3.2% following the announcement, while defense sector stocks showed notable gains. The S&P 500 experienced slight volatility as investors weighed potential disruption scenarios. Gold prices also saw modest increases as some investors sought traditional safe-haven assets. Regional Reactions and Diplomatic Consequences Regional powers have responded cautiously to Trump’s statements. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, traditional U.S. allies with strained relations with Iran, have not issued official statements but diplomatic sources indicate private support for firm American posture. Conversely, Qatar and Oman, which maintain working relationships with Tehran, have called for diplomatic solutions. Israel’s position remains particularly significant given its longstanding concerns about Iranian nuclear capabilities and regional influence. Prime Minister’s office released a measured statement supporting “all actions that prevent Iranian aggression” while avoiding explicit endorsement of specific intervention scenarios. Israeli defense officials have conducted their own assessments of how U.S. actions might affect regional security dynamics. European reactions reflect transatlantic divisions on Iran policy. Germany and France have reiterated support for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) framework, urging diplomatic engagement rather than military posturing. The United Kingdom has taken a middle position, acknowledging security concerns while emphasizing multilateral approaches. These divergent positions complicate potential coalition building for any intervention scenario. Iran’s official response came through Foreign Ministry spokesperson Abbas Mousavi, who dismissed Trump’s warning as “empty threats” and “psychological warfare.” However, behind this public defiance, Iranian military commanders have reportedly increased readiness levels and conducted emergency drills. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has redeployed some assets and intensified surveillance of potential targets. Historical Context of U.S.-Iran Confrontations The current tensions exist within a historical framework spanning seven decades. The 1953 coup established patterns of intervention and resentment that continue influencing bilateral relations. The 1979 Iranian Revolution and subsequent hostage crisis created enduring diplomatic rupture. The Tanker War during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq conflict saw direct U.S.-Iran naval engagements. More recent incidents demonstrate ongoing friction points: 2016 Incident: Iranian forces captured U.S. Navy personnel who strayed into territorial waters 2019 Attacks: Strikes on Saudi oil facilities that U.S. blamed on Iran 2020 Strike: U.S. drone killing of Qasem Soleimani, IRGC Quds Force commander 2023 Seizures: Iranian capture of commercial vessels in strategic waterways Each incident has contributed to escalating tensions while establishing precedents for various response options. The pattern reveals cyclical escalation followed by temporary de-escalation, with neither side achieving decisive advantage. This history informs current assessments of how any new intervention might unfold and where potential escalation points exist. Economic and Market Impact Assessment Financial markets serve as sensitive indicators of geopolitical risk perception. The immediate reaction to Trump’s statement confirms that investors view U.S.-Iran tensions as significant market factors. Energy markets show particular sensitivity given Iran’s position as a major oil producer and the Strait of Hormuz’s crucial role in global energy transportation. Analysis of market data reveals several important patterns: Oil price volatility increases by approximately 40% during periods of heightened U.S.-Iran tensions Defense sector stocks typically outperform broader markets following intervention rhetoric Regional markets in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries show mixed reactions based on individual country exposures Currency markets reflect safe-haven flows toward Swiss franc and Japanese yen during escalation periods These market movements have real economic consequences beyond trading floors. Higher energy prices affect global growth projections, particularly in emerging markets. Defense spending allocations may shift in response to perceived threat levels. Supply chain managers increasingly factor geopolitical risk into logistics planning, especially for routes passing near conflict zones. Legal and Constitutional Considerations Any U.S. intervention in Iran would raise significant legal questions under both domestic and international law. The 1973 War Powers Resolution requires presidential consultation with Congress before introducing armed forces into hostilities. However, various administrations have interpreted this requirement differently, creating precedent for limited actions without full congressional authorization. International law presents additional complexities. The United Nations Charter generally prohibits the use of force except in self-defense or with Security Council authorization. Humanitarian intervention arguments remain controversial in international legal circles. Any U.S. action would likely face scrutiny under these frameworks, with potential implications for America’s standing in international institutions. Legal experts identify several potential justifications the administration might invoke: Collective self-defense of regional allies under attack Humanitarian intervention to prevent mass atrocities Protection of navigation rights in international waters Preemptive action against imminent threats Each justification carries distinct legal requirements and political implications. The administration’s choice among them would signal broader foreign policy principles and establish precedents for future actions. Legal scholars across the political spectrum are already debating these questions in academic journals and policy forums. Conclusion President Trump’s warning about potential U.S. intervention in Iran represents a significant development in Middle East geopolitics, with careful exclusion of ground troops deployment shaping strategic calculations. The statement has immediate implications for global markets, regional diplomacy, and international security frameworks. Historical context reveals this as another chapter in decades of U.S.-Iran tensions, while current analysis suggests distinct operational possibilities within the ground troops constraint. As regional actors and global markets assess these developments, the fundamental question remains whether rhetoric will translate to action, and if so, through what mechanisms and with what consequences. The Trump administration’s Iran intervention warning therefore serves as both policy statement and strategic signal, requiring careful interpretation by allies, adversaries, and analysts alike. FAQs Q1: What exactly did President Trump say about Iran intervention? President Trump stated that the United States would intervene if Iran begins killing people, but specifically clarified that such intervention would not involve deploying American ground troops to Iranian territory. Q2: How have financial markets reacted to Trump’s Iran warning? Markets have interpreted the statement as signaling renewed geopolitical risk, with immediate effects including higher oil prices, defense stock gains, and increased volatility in regional markets, particularly in the Middle East. Q3: What military options exist without using ground troops? Potential options include airstrikes, drone operations, naval blockades, cyber attacks, and special operations forces deployments—all methods that can achieve strategic objectives without large-scale ground force commitments. Q4: How have other countries responded to Trump’s warning? Regional allies like Saudi Arabia have offered private support while European partners have emphasized diplomacy. Iran has publicly dismissed the warning as psychological warfare while reportedly increasing military readiness internally. Q5: What legal authority would the President need for Iran intervention? The War Powers Resolution requires congressional consultation for sustained hostilities, but presidents have historically claimed authority for limited actions. International law would require self-defense justification or UN Security Council authorization for most intervention scenarios.

South Korea Using US & Hong Kong Crypto Spot ETFs As A Reference South Korea revealed in its 2026 Economic Growth Strategy plans to allow spot digital asset ETFs this year, according to Wu Blockchain , citing local media outlet News1. Spot ETFs are investment vehicles that allow traders to gain exposure to an underlying asset without having to directly own it. Such vehicles trade in the traditional markets, so investors of a spot ETF tied to a cryptocurrency never have to interact with blockchain components like wallets and exchanges. Instead, the funds buy and custody the assets on behalf of investors. In recent years, spot ETFs tied to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have gained adoption in different regions of the world as DeFi and TradFi intersect. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot ETFs for Bitcoin in January 2024 and Ethereum in July 2024, while the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) allowed both in April 2024. Approvals related to altcoins like Solana followed in 2025. Now, it would appear that South Korea is also looking to join the fray. Per the report, the country’s government has explicitly cited the digital asset spot ETF markets active in the US and Hong Kong as key reference points. Plans related to spot ETFs aren’t all that South Korea has announced. The Financial Services Commission (FSC) of the country is also accelerating the next phase of its digital asset legislation, which will establish a framework for stablecoins . In the East Asian bloc, other governments have already made progress on stablecoins. Hong Kong enacted its stablecoin legislation in August, while Japan saw the launch of its first yen-backed token in October. While South Korea has set a timeframe of 2026, it’s unknown when exactly spot ETFs could be introduced. As such, it only remains to be seen what plans the government will reveal next and which assets besides Bitcoin will be covered. Speaking of spot Bitcoin ETFs, these funds have been facing outflows in the US recently, as data from SoSoValue shows. From the chart, it’s visible that the Bitcoin spot ETF weekly netflow has mostly been negative since the cryptocurrency’s decline started in October. There were a few weeks that saw a positive value, but the scale of net inflows remained limited. The netflow for the latest week has stood at a negative $431 million, meaning that the US funds are continuing to bleed.

57022410,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=260233,1768003211,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Colombia Crypto Tax: Major Regulatory Shift Mandates Comprehensive Data Reporting,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/colombia-crypto-tax-data-reporting/,"BitcoinWorld Colombia Crypto Tax: Major Regulatory Shift Mandates Comprehensive Data Reporting BOGOTÁ, Colombia – December 2024 marks a pivotal moment for cryptocurrency regulation in Latin America as Colombia’s National Tax and Customs Directorate (DIAN) implements sweeping new reporting requirements for digital asset service providers. This Colombia crypto tax initiative represents the nation’s most significant regulatory move since first recognizing cryptocurrency transactions in 2018, fundamentally altering how exchanges, custody providers, and users interact with tax authorities. The regulation specifically mandates comprehensive data collection and international sharing mechanisms, positioning Colombia among the vanguard of nations implementing the OECD’s Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF). Colombia Crypto Tax Framework: Understanding the New Mandates Colombia’s DIAN has established precise requirements for cryptocurrency service providers operating within its jurisdiction. According to official documentation reviewed by financial analysts, the regulation specifically targets entities facilitating cryptocurrency exchanges, custody services, and trading platforms. These organizations must now systematically collect and submit detailed user identity information alongside complete transaction histories. Furthermore, the regulation enables automatic information exchange with foreign tax authorities through established international agreements. The implementation timeline shows DIAN began formal consultations with industry stakeholders in early 2024, with the final regulation published in Colombia’s Official Gazette on November 15, 2024. Service providers have a 90-day compliance window, meaning full implementation must occur by late February 2025. This accelerated timeline reflects Colombia’s commitment to international tax transparency standards while addressing domestic revenue concerns. Global Context: Colombia’s Position in International Tax Cooperation Colombia’s regulatory move aligns directly with broader international efforts to combat tax evasion through cryptocurrency channels. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) developed the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) specifically to address transparency gaps in digital asset markets. Over 48 jurisdictions have committed to implementing CARF standards by 2027, with Colombia now positioned among early adopters in Latin America alongside Argentina and Brazil. Financial transparency experts note Colombia’s regulation mirrors similar initiatives in the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework and the United States’ Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provisions. However, Colombia’s approach includes distinctive elements tailored to its domestic financial ecosystem and existing anti-money laundering frameworks. The regulation specifically references Colombia’s participation in the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) and its bilateral tax treaties with 15 nations. Operational Impact on Colombian Cryptocurrency Ecosystem The new Colombia crypto tax requirements create immediate operational challenges for service providers. Exchanges must implement enhanced Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols exceeding previous financial surveillance standards. Transaction monitoring systems must now capture granular details including wallet addresses, transaction timestamps, amounts in both cryptocurrency and Colombian pesos, and counterparty information. Additionally, providers must establish secure data transmission channels to DIAN’s designated systems. Industry analysts project implementation costs ranging from $50,000 to $500,000 per platform depending on existing infrastructure. Smaller exchanges face particular challenges, potentially leading to market consolidation. Major international platforms operating in Colombia, including Binance and Bitso, have confirmed they are adjusting their compliance systems. Meanwhile, Colombian-based platforms like Buda.com and Panda Exchange are working with local legal experts to ensure timely compliance. Key Requirements Under Colombia’s New Crypto Reporting Regulation Requirement Details Deadline User Identity Collection Full legal name, tax identification number, date of birth, address February 28, 2025 Transaction Reporting All buy/sell transactions, transfers, conversions, and staking activities Quarterly submissions International Data Sharing Automatic exchange with treaty partners beginning 2026 tax year Annual transmission Record Retention Five-year minimum for all reported data and supporting documentation Immediate upon collection User Implications and Privacy Considerations Colombian cryptocurrency users now face significantly increased transparency regarding their digital asset activities. The regulation requires exchanges to inform users about data collection practices and international sharing provisions. Privacy advocates have raised concerns about data security and potential misuse, though DIAN emphasizes compliance with Colombia’s Habeas Data law and international data protection standards. Tax professionals advise Colombian cryptocurrency holders to: Document all cryptocurrency transactions from 2024 forward Verify exchange compliance status before continuing operations Consult tax advisors regarding declaration requirements Review privacy policies of all cryptocurrency service providers Economic Rationale and Government Objectives Colombia’s Finance Ministry has articulated multiple objectives behind the enhanced crypto tax reporting framework. Primarily, the government seeks to address a significant tax gap estimated at approximately 1.2 trillion Colombian pesos ($300 million) annually from undeclared cryptocurrency gains. Additionally, the regulation supports Colombia’s commitments under its $10 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) program, which includes strengthening tax administration and combating illicit financial flows. Economic analysts note Colombia’s cryptocurrency market has grown approximately 340% since 2020, with transaction volumes exceeding $1.2 billion monthly. This rapid expansion created regulatory challenges that previous frameworks couldn’t adequately address. The new regulation provides DIAN with previously unavailable visibility into digital asset movements, potentially increasing tax revenue while reducing money laundering risks. Regional Leadership and Future Regulatory Directions Colombia positions itself as a regulatory leader in Latin America’s cryptocurrency space through this comprehensive framework. Neighboring countries including Venezuela, Ecuador, and Peru are monitoring Colombia’s implementation for potential adaptation. Regional financial integration efforts through the Pacific Alliance trade bloc may eventually harmonize cryptocurrency reporting standards across member nations. Looking forward, DIAN officials indicate potential additional measures including: Threshold-based reporting exemptions for small transactions Integration with Colombia’s Unified Tax System (SUNAT) Enhanced enforcement mechanisms for non-compliant platforms Educational initiatives for cryptocurrency users about tax obligations Conclusion Colombia’s implementation of comprehensive crypto tax reporting requirements represents a watershed moment for digital asset regulation in Latin America. The Colombia crypto tax framework establishes robust transparency standards while aligning with international best practices through OECD CARF adoption. Service providers must now accelerate compliance efforts, while users gain clarity about their reporting obligations. This regulatory evolution reflects Colombia’s balanced approach to fostering innovation while ensuring financial integrity, potentially serving as a model for other emerging markets navigating cryptocurrency taxation challenges. As implementation progresses through 2025, stakeholders across Colombia’s cryptocurrency ecosystem will continue adapting to this new regulatory reality. FAQs Q1: When do Colombia’s new cryptocurrency reporting requirements take effect? Full implementation begins February 28, 2025, following a 90-day compliance period after the regulation’s November 2024 publication. Q2: Which cryptocurrency activities must Colombian exchanges report to DIAN? Exchanges must report all user transactions including purchases, sales, conversions, transfers, and staking activities, along with comprehensive user identification data. Q3: Will Colombia share cryptocurrency user data with other countries? Yes, the regulation enables automatic information exchange with foreign tax authorities through existing bilateral treaties and multilateral agreements, beginning with the 2026 tax year. Q4: How does Colombia’s regulation relate to OECD CARF standards? Colombia’s framework directly implements OECD CARF principles, making Colombia an early adopter among Latin American nations committed to international cryptocurrency tax transparency. Q5: What should Colombian cryptocurrency users do to prepare for these changes? Users should verify their exchange’s compliance status, maintain detailed transaction records, review updated privacy policies, and consult tax professionals about declaration requirements for cryptocurrency holdings and gains.

57022412,https://timestabloid.com/?p=94523,1768003231,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Price Predictions for December 2026,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-price-predictions-for-december-2026/,"As 2026 begins, long-term expectations for XRP have returned to the center of discussion after a public comment from crypto analyst and investor Shytoshi Kusama drew renewed attention to where the asset could be headed over the next two years. His remarks, shared on social media, reignited broader debate about XRP’s valuation prospects and prompted fresh reviews of analyst forecasts and model-based projections for December 2026. XRP’s recent price history provides important context for these discussions. The asset entered 2025 with strong momentum and briefly moved above levels that had acted as resistance for several years. Optimism intensified when XRP climbed beyond $3.30 shortly before the U.S. presidential inauguration period, raising expectations that a new record could be established before the end of that year. In July 2025, XRP reached $3.66 , a price that some observers regard as a peak, though others continue to reference the 2018 high near $3.84 as the definitive benchmark. Despite this mid-year strength, the broader market environment shifted sharply in the second half of 2025. XRP lost significant ground during the final quarter, closing the year at approximately $1.84 after a decline of about 50%. That reversal reshaped sentiment and shifted attention away from near-term milestones toward longer-term recovery scenarios. Attention Turns to XRP’s 2026 Outlook With the market now in a new calendar year, investor focus has moved to where XRP could stand by December 2026. Early trading activity in 2026 has been supportive, with XRP posting gains of more than 20% within the first days of the year. This rebound has reinforced confidence among bullish participants, who argue that the previous year’s correction may have cleared excess leverage from the market. Supporters of a positive outlook cite several potential drivers. These include ongoing discussion around the CLARITY Act, continued interest in spot-based XRP exchange-traded products, and the gradual expansion of decentralized finance projects linked to the XRP ecosystem. Together, these factors are viewed as possible contributors to sustained demand over the next two years. At the same time, more cautious observers warn that macroeconomic pressures, regulatory uncertainty, and competition from other blockchain networks could limit upside. From this perspective, XRP may continue to face periods of volatility rather than a smooth upward trajectory. Analyst and Model-Based Price Estimates To assess these contrasting views, several forecasting platforms and artificial intelligence models have published estimates for XRP’s potential value by the end of 2026. Changelly projects a relatively measured path for XRP, with prices gradually advancing throughout the year. Its analysts estimate that XRP could trade between approximately $3.18 and $3.49 by December 2026, with an average price near $3.26. Reaching this range would require gains of roughly 50% to 65% from current levels, depending on the specific target. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Telegaon offers a broader outlook. While it does not outline monthly price movements, its year-end estimate suggests XRP could remain near current levels earlier in the year before accelerating toward a high near $5.18 by December 2026. Under this scenario, upside potential would depend on stronger momentum emerging later in the cycle. AI-Based Scenario Analysis Artificial intelligence models have also contributed to the discussion. ChatGPT outlined multiple possible outcomes based on varying market conditions. In its most conservative case, XRP is expected to remain within a $2 to $3.5 range through December 2026. A moderate growth scenario places the asset between $3 and $5, assuming steady expansion in institutional participation. Under more optimistic assumptions, including faster ETF adoption, ChatGPT suggests XRP could reach between $5 and $8 by year-end. In a highly optimistic case, where institutional usage and real-world settlement demand accelerate significantly, the model allows for prices exceeding $8. Google’s Gemini model presents a similar tiered framework. Its conservative outlook places XRP between $1.80 and $3.50, with the possibility of temporary dips if regulatory or market pressures intensify. An average scenario points to a range of roughly $2.81 to $4.50, while a bullish case envisions a move toward $8, with higher levels possible if institutional inflows expand meaningfully. Taken together, these projections illustrate a wide spectrum of expectations for XRP by December 2026. While no forecast guarantees a specific outcome, the renewed attention sparked by Shytoshi Kusama’s commentary underscores growing interest in XRP’s longer-term trajectory. Whether XRP ultimately tracks closer to conservative estimates or more optimistic scenarios will depend on regulatory clarity, adoption trends, and broader market conditions over the coming two years.

57022854,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=260239,1768004711,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index Plummets to 25, Unleashing Extreme Fear Among Investors",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-fear-greed-index-extreme-fear-35/,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear & Greed Index Plummets to 25, Unleashing Extreme Fear Among Investors Global cryptocurrency markets entered a pronounced state of anxiety this week as the widely monitored Crypto Fear & Greed Index plunged to a reading of 25, officially categorizing current investor sentiment as ‘Extreme Fear’. This significant drop, reported by data provider Alternative.me, represents a critical shift in market psychology with potential implications for trading strategies and asset valuations across the digital asset ecosystem. The index’s descent into this deeply bearish territory often precedes heightened volatility and can signal potential inflection points for savvy market observers. Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Its 25 Reading The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a crucial behavioral finance tool, quantifying the emotional temperature of the cryptocurrency market on a scale from 0 to 100. A reading of 25, as recorded, sits firmly within the ‘Extreme Fear’ band, which spans from 0 to 25. This metric aggregates data from multiple sources to create a composite snapshot of crowd psychology. Consequently, it provides a counterpoint to purely fundamental or technical analysis. Market historians often note that sustained periods of extreme fear have, in the past, created contrarian buying opportunities, although this is never a guarantee of future performance. Analysts emphasize that the index is a lagging indicator, reflecting sentiment that has already been expressed through market actions. The current reading suggests a market dominated by risk-off behavior, where the primary motivations are capital preservation and loss avoidance rather than growth speculation. This environment typically sees reduced trading volumes on decentralized exchanges and a flight to more stable assets, including stablecoins or even exits to fiat currency. The Six Pillars of Market Sentiment The index’s calculation is methodical and transparent, based on six weighted components. This multi-factor approach aims to prevent any single data point from skewing the overall sentiment score. Volatility (25%): This component measures the rate and magnitude of price changes, particularly for Bitcoin. Increased volatility, especially to the downside, directly feeds into fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Trading volume and price momentum are analyzed. High volume during downturns exacerbates fear, while low volume can indicate apathy or caution. Social Media (15%): Sentiment analysis on platforms like Twitter and Reddit gauges public conversation tone, tracking mentions of keywords associated with fear or greed. Surveys (15%): Periodic polls of the retail and professional investor community provide direct insight into prevailing moods. Dominance (10%): Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market cap is tracked. Rising dominance often signals a ‘flight to safety’ within crypto, as investors abandon altcoins for the perceived security of Bitcoin. Trends (10%): Search engine data, particularly Google Trends for terms like ‘Bitcoin crash’ or ‘crypto bull market,’ reveals public interest and underlying concern. Historical Context and Comparative Analysis of Extreme Fear To fully grasp the significance of a ’25’ reading, one must examine historical precedents. The index has entered the Extreme Fear zone numerous times throughout cryptocurrency’s volatile history, often correlating with major market drawdowns. For instance, readings near single digits were recorded during the March 2020 COVID-induced market crash and the cascading liquidations following the collapse of the Terra/Luna ecosystem in May 2022. Conversely, the index soared above 90 during the peak euphoria of late 2017 and again in early 2021. The table below provides a quick reference for interpreting index ranges: Index Value Range Sentiment Label Typical Market Behavior 0-25 Extreme Fear Panic selling, high volatility, negative news dominance. 26-46 Fear Cautious selling, risk aversion, reduced speculation. 47-54 Neutral Balanced buying and selling, consolidation phases. 55-75 Greed Increasing FOMO, aggressive buying, bullish news flow. 76-100 Extreme Greed Market tops, irrational exuberance, leverage buildup. Therefore, the current positioning indicates a market under significant stress. However, veteran traders often reference the adage, ‘Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful,’ highlighting the contrarian signal such readings can provide. It is essential to remember that the index measures sentiment, not valuation, and extreme fear can persist or deepen if underlying market issues are not resolved. Potential Market Impacts and Trader Psychology A prolonged period of extreme fear, as signaled by the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, triggers specific and observable market mechanics. Firstly, funding rates for perpetual swap contracts on major exchanges often turn deeply negative. This means traders holding short positions pay those holding long positions, reflecting a overwhelming bearish bias in the derivatives market. Secondly, the put/call ratio for Bitcoin options tends to spike, showing more traders are buying downside protection (puts) than betting on rallies (calls). Furthermore, on-chain data frequently shows an increase in coins moving from ‘hot’ exchange wallets to ‘cold’ long-term storage. This movement suggests that despite the fear, long-term holders (often called ‘HODLers’) are using the price drop as an accumulation opportunity, withdrawing coins to secure custody. This divergence between short-term trader panic and long-term holder conviction is a key dynamic analysts watch closely. Expert Perspectives on Sentiment Indicators Financial psychologists note that sentiment indices like this one are powerful because they make the often-irrational emotion of the crowd visible and quantifiable. ‘Markets are driven by two primary emotions: fear and greed,’ explains a behavioral finance researcher from a major university. ‘An index that captures this in real-time is invaluable for understanding market phases. Extreme readings often mark emotional exhaustion, which can be a precursor to a change in trend, though timing that change remains the great challenge.’ Portfolio managers often incorporate sentiment data into a broader risk-management framework. They might use an Extreme Fear reading not as a standalone buy signal, but as a condition that prompts them to check other metrics like network fundamentals, miner health, and macroeconomic correlations. If those other factors are stable or improving while sentiment is poor, it may strengthen a case for strategic, phased accumulation. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s decline to a reading of 25 provides a clear, data-driven confirmation that extreme fear has gripped the cryptocurrency market. This sentiment shift, driven by volatility, trading patterns, and social discourse, offers critical context for the current price action. While historically such depths of pessimism have sometimes preceded market recoveries, they also underscore the high-stress environment for participants. Investors and traders are advised to consider this sentiment data as one crucial piece of a much larger analytical puzzle, combining it with rigorous fundamental and technical research. The index’s journey out of the ‘Extreme Fear’ zone will be a key narrative to watch, as it will signal a potential restoration of market confidence and risk appetite. FAQs Q1: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 25 mean? A score of 25 means the index is in the ‘Extreme Fear’ zone (0-25). This indicates that current market data and sentiment analysis point to widespread panic, risk aversion, and negative outlook among cryptocurrency investors. Q2: Who creates the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and how often is it updated? The index is created and published by Alternative.me. It is updated daily, providing a near-real-time gauge of market sentiment based on the previous 24 hours of data. Q3: Is the Fear & Greed Index a reliable buy or sell signal? While not a direct timing signal, it is a reliable sentiment indicator. Extreme readings (like 25) often highlight maximum emotional stress, which contrarian investors view as a potential area for opportunity, but it should never be used in isolation without other analysis. Q4: Has the index been this low before? Yes. The index has reached similar or lower levels during major crypto market crises, such as the March 2020 global market crash and the May 2022 Terra/Luna collapse. These periods were marked by severe price declines and high volatility. Q5: Does the index only measure sentiment for Bitcoin? Primarily, yes. The index’s components (volatility, dominance, search trends) are heavily weighted toward Bitcoin due to its market leadership. However, since Bitcoin sentiment heavily influences the broader crypto market, the index is generally applied to the entire asset class.

The initial demand gains momentum, crowds move more quickly and fees are changed in phases. According to the market commentators, this is normally an indication that investors are setting up to a bigger movement. The signs are now being exhibited by one of the new cryptocurrencies with a price of less than $0.1. Its build-up is evident, its involvement is on the increase, and analysts think that it is in the stage where demand begins to surpass supply. What is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Preparing Mutuum Finance is a decentralized lending and borrowing. The protocol adopts two similar models that are meant to be used in real applications. Under the peer to contract model, assets are provided into common liquidity pools by the users. They are in turn issued with the mtTokens which signify their deposit. These mtTokens increase their value as interest accumulation takes place. As an illustration, the automatic addition of $2,000 dollars of USDC into a pool with a 6% APY shows the automatic addition of that yield to the mtToken balance over time. In the peer-to-peer model, borrowers can take loans directly from lenders. Collateral is deposited and a loan is borrowed with predetermined loan to value limits. A position can be borrowed as much as 75% collateral. Liquidations are made in case collateral is less than safety levels. Part of the debt is repaid by liquidators who as well are given collateral at a discount. This is to establish a balance in the system. This has been the case with the presale demand. The presale started at the beginning of 2025 and it has gone through various phases. It has been funded approximately to the tune of $19.6M, having over 18,800 holders. Approximately 825M coins are already sold. The token entered the presale at a starting price of $0.01 and is now priced at $0.04 in Phase 7. This reflects roughly 300% growth since the first phase. The total token supply is capped at 4B, with 45.5% or about 1.82B tokens allocated to the presale. According to the project structure, the official launch price is set at $0.06, which places current pricing well below the planned market entry level. Protocol Launch and Price Perspective Analysts are highly concerned with development progress. The official X statement is that Mutuum Finance is in the process of making the V1 Protocol release of its lending and borrowing protocol. The initial implementation will become the Sepolia testnet in Q1 2026. The first assets will be supported with ETH and USDT. Its main elements are liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and an automated liquidator bot. According to certain commentators, this makes execution risk much lower. In a bullish case, the first pricing will be to go out of the current level of $0.04 to the launch price of $0.06, which is logical. According to market commentators, it can be a common kind of move when a particular product becomes visible instead of at the early stages of development. Some analysts add that post-launch pricing could extend further if adoption follows the outlined roadmap. In a positive market scenario, projections suggest that a move from $0.04 toward the $0.20–$0.25 range would represent roughly a 400% to 525% increase from current levels, driven by growing usage rather than early-stage anticipation. The Reason Why Analysts Equate MUTM With Early XRP Stages The comparisons are often reduced to timing and functionality. Initial XRP was not mainstream adopted since it had a defined financial application. Mutuum Finance also has the same infrastructure first focus. Rather than creating stories, it is creating a lending platform that is meant to manage real capital. The turnout has increased steadily as opposed to explosively. The adjustment of pricing has been a stage as opposed to spikes. According to commentators in the market, this is what makes MUTM more frequently referenced when investors are enquiring what their next crypto-to-buy should be. It is still under $0.1. Stages are becoming stricter in supply. Infrastructure is almost on the way to public testing. These aspects tend to come into line prior to a wider acceptance. According to some observers, this arrangement is the reason MUTM is selling quicker as it passes through later stages. With the approach of V1 and the start of use, attention can still concentrate on the infrastructure that is already present.

After weeks of choppy trading, ETH remains caught between fading bullish attempts and persistent overhead resistance, leaving analysts sharply divided on what comes next. A minority still expects Ethereum to regain strength and eventually challenge its all-time highs, while the dominant narrative points toward a bearish 2026 marked by weaker demand and tighter liquidity conditions. Related Reading: Bitcoin Remains In A High-Risk Zone As Short-Term Holders Stay Underwater Amid this uncertainty, a CryptoQuant report offers a longer-term perspective that cuts through short-term noise. The analysis focuses on Ethereum’s Accumulating Addresses Realized Price, a metric that tracks the average cost basis of addresses that consistently accumulate ETH rather than trade it actively. Unlike momentum indicators, this measure reflects where long-term participants are willing to commit capital over extended periods. Notably, this accumulation cost has trended steadily higher since 2020. Even during the severe 2022–2023 drawdown, when ETH price corrected sharply, long-term holders largely held their ground instead of capitulating. That behavior established a durable foundation beneath the market. Today, this realized price has stabilized in the $2,700–$2,800 range, effectively forming a structural cost zone for Ethereum. As ETH hovers just above this area, the market faces a critical question: whether this long-term support continues to anchor price, or if shifting macro conditions finally challenge a regime that has held for years. Ethereum Long-Term Accumulation Regime Faces a Critical Test The report argues that the debate around Ethereum is shifting. The key issue is no longer whether the $2,700–$2,800 accumulation zone holds in the short term, but whether this long-standing accumulation regime can persist indefinitely. According to data from CryptoQuant, Ethereum stands out sharply from the broader altcoin market when viewed through this lens. Since 2022, most altcoins have suffered deep drawdowns without ever forming a durable accumulation cost base. That absence of consistent long-term buying helps explain why recoveries across the altcoin complex have been weaker and more fragile. Ethereum, by contrast, has repeatedly demonstrated an ability to retain long-term holder conviction through multiple stress periods, including 2018, 2020, 2022, and even the volatility seen in 2025. However, markets evolve, and structural regimes do not last forever. Periods of apparent stability are often when underlying assumptions are most vulnerable to change. From a forward-looking perspective, two scenarios stand out. As long as ETH price trades near or above its accumulation cost, it signals that long-term buyers remain engaged, reinforcing Ethereum’s relative resilience compared with most altcoins. On the other hand, a sustained break below this cost zone would imply a meaningful behavioral shift among long-term holders—one that could challenge the idea that Ethereum has permanently escaped its pre-2020 valuation framework. In today’s environment, short-term price swings dominate attention, but it is this structural battle beneath the surface that may ultimately define Ethereum’s next major cycle. Related Reading: Bearish Signal Emerges For Ethereum As US Spot Demand Fades Price Consolidates as Bulls Defend the $3,000 Zone Ethereum is currently consolidating around the $3,100 level after failing to reclaim higher resistance zones, reflecting a market caught between stabilization and continuation risk. The chart shows ETH trading below its short- and medium-term moving averages, with the 50-day and 100-day averages now acting as dynamic resistance rather than support. This shift confirms that the broader structure remains corrective following the rejection from the $4,000–$4,200 region earlier in the cycle. Notably, the $3,000–$3,100 area has emerged as a critical pivot. Price has repeatedly defended this zone, suggesting the presence of demand and short-term accumulation. However, upside momentum remains limited, as each bounce has been met with selling pressure near descending moving averages. This behavior is typical of markets attempting to form a base after a prolonged drawdown rather than initiating a clean trend reversal. Related Reading: Bitcoin Tests Key Resistance While $4.7B In Sell-Side Liquidity Builds From a structural perspective, ETH remains above the long-term moving average, which continues to slope upward. This indicates that the broader macro trend has not fully broken down, even though short-term momentum is weak. Volume has also declined during recent rebounds, reinforcing the idea that buyers lack conviction. For bulls, a sustained reclaim of the $3,300 level would be required to shift momentum and challenge the bearish structure. Until then, Ethereum appears locked in a consolidation phase, with downside risks persisting if the $3,000 support fails to hold.

According to the analyst, maintaining positions through periods of uncertainty could prove beneficial if XRP eventually establishes new price highs. The view was recently shared by TradingView contributor Xauluax, who assessed XRP’s recent price movements and broader technical structure. His commentary followed a sharp but brief price advance earlier this year, when XRP recorded a rapid climb from levels below $2 to above $2.40 in less than a week. That move temporarily improved market sentiment and renewed expectations of further upside. Despite this rally, the price failed to hold those gains. XRP subsequently pulled back, dropping to just above $2.00 as selling pressure returned and market confidence weakened. While this reversal unsettled some participants, the asset managed to recover modestly, stabilizing slightly above $2.10. Xauluax interprets this behaviour as a consolidation phase rather than a decisive trend reversal. Analyst Favors Gradual Positioning Strategy In his analysis, Xauluax maintained that XRP’s current valuation does not reflect its longer-term potential. On this basis, he advised investors to remain invested rather than exit positions during periods of uncertainty. He argued that market cycles often reward participants who can tolerate extended consolidation phases without reacting emotionally to price swings. A central element of his approach is the use of dollar-cost averaging. This strategy involves spreading purchases over time instead of committing capital at a single price level. According to the analyst, this method can help reduce the impact of volatility and improve average entry prices, particularly in markets that lack clear short-term direction. He also noted that XRP’s price behavior is consistent with trends observed across several major cryptocurrencies. In his view, many large-cap digital assets are currently trading in ranges that favor incremental accumulation rather than aggressive speculative positioning. As a result, he believes gradual exposure remains a reasonable approach under current conditions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Outlook for a Break Above Historical Price Levels Beyond near-term market fluctuations, Xauluax expressed confidence that XRP could eventually surpass its previous record price. XRP remains unique among the top five cryptocurrencies by market capitalization in that it did not establish a new all-time high during 2025. Its historical peak, recorded in 2018, stands near $3.84 based on widely referenced market data. The analyst suggested that this lag does not necessarily signal weakness, but rather reflects delayed price discovery. He emphasized that extended consolidation below prior highs can precede strong upward movements, although he cautioned that such progress may require time. From a technical perspective, Xauluax highlighted a key support region between approximately $1.80 and $2.10. He believes sustained trading above this zone supports a constructive outlook. If this structure holds, he sees potential for XRP to advance toward higher price levels. Under this framework, the analyst identified two potential targets. The first sits near $5, which would represent a significant increase from current levels. A second, more ambitious objective lies around $9 , implying a substantial expansion in market value if achieved. These projections align with other industry expectations. In late 2025, cryptocurrency exchange Uphold referenced an estimate from xAI’s Grok model, which placed XRP’s potential cycle peak within a range extending into the low double digits. Overall, Xauluax’s assessment underscores the importance of patience, structured investment strategies, and long-term analysis when navigating XRP’s evolving market conditions.

This one-point decline from the previous day offers a crucial, data-driven snapshot of current capital flows and investor preference between Bitcoin and alternative cryptocurrencies. Market analysts closely monitor this metric, developed by CoinMarketCap, because it provides an objective framework for understanding broader market cycles beyond simple price movements. Consequently, the current reading prompts a deeper examination of underlying blockchain activity and historical patterns. Decoding the Altcoin Season Index Dip The Altcoin Season Index functions as a critical barometer for cryptocurrency traders and long-term investors. CoinMarketCap calculates this index by comparing the 90-day price performance of the top 100 digital assets by market capitalization, deliberately excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, against Bitcoin’s performance over the same period. The methodology establishes a clear threshold: a period qualifies as a true “altcoin season” only if 75% of these top assets outperform Bitcoin. Conversely, the market enters a “Bitcoin season” when the pioneer cryptocurrency outpaces the majority. Therefore, a score of 40 sits squarely in a neutral-to-Bitcoin-dominant zone, indicating that fewer than half of the major altcoins are currently beating Bitcoin’s returns over the last quarter. This specific calculation offers several advantages for market analysis. First, it uses a substantial 90-day window to smooth out short-term volatility and identify sustained trends. Second, by focusing on the top 100 assets, it captures the sentiment around established projects with significant liquidity and community backing. Finally, the exclusion of stablecoins ensures the metric reflects speculative and investment capital, not just transactional utility. Historical data shows the index often fluctuates within a range before making decisive moves above 75 or below 25, marking clear cyclical phases. Contextualizing the Current Crypto Market Landscape The index’s movement to 40 does not occur in a vacuum. It coincides with observable on-chain and macroeconomic factors influencing trader behavior. For instance, Bitcoin’s network often sees increased accumulation from large holders during periods of perceived macroeconomic uncertainty, a trend that can suppress altcoin momentum. Simultaneously, altcoin markets frequently experience reduced trading volumes and developer activity during these phases, as capital becomes more selective. Market data from previous cycles indicates that prolonged periods with an index below 50 often precede consolidation before a potential rotation. Several interrelated factors typically contribute to a declining Altcoin Season Index. A surge in Bitcoin dominance, where Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market cap increases, is a primary driver. This often happens when investors seek the perceived safety and liquidity of the largest asset. Additionally, a downturn in overall crypto market capitalization, or “crypto winter,” usually hits altcoins harder and faster than Bitcoin, further depressing the index. Finally, a lack of major, catalyzing narratives or technological breakthroughs in the altcoin space can lead to capital stagnation, with funds not rotating out of Bitcoin into newer projects. Historical Precedents and Analyst Perspectives Reviewing past index behavior provides essential context for the current reading. For example, during the major bull market of 2021, the index repeatedly spiked above 75 for extended periods, confirming powerful altcoin seasons. In contrast, the bear market of 2022 saw the index remain persistently low, often below 25, reflecting a deep Bitcoin season where capital fled to relative safety. The current score of 40 suggests a market in a transitional or indecisive state, not firmly in either camp. Seasoned analysts, referencing data from platforms like Glassnode and CryptoQuant, note that such periods can be precursors to trend changes, depending on subsequent inflows and breaking news. Experts emphasize that the index is a lagging indicator, confirming a trend that has already been established over 90 days. Therefore, while a score of 40 confirms recent underperformance of altcoins relative to Bitcoin, it does not predict the next move. However, it serves as a vital risk-assessment tool. For investors, a low index score suggests that broad, indiscriminate altcoin investing carries higher relative risk compared to focusing on Bitcoin or highly selective altcoin projects with strong fundamentals. Portfolio managers often use this data to adjust asset allocation weights between core holdings (Bitcoin/Ethereum) and more speculative altcoin exposures. Key Differences: Bitcoin Season vs. Altcoin Season Understanding the distinct characteristics of each season is crucial for interpreting the index. Bitcoin Season: Characterized by rising Bitcoin dominance, often driven by macroeconomic fears, regulatory news, or institutional adoption focused solely on BTC. Trading volumes may concentrate on Bitcoin and major stablecoin pairs. Altcoin volatility often increases negatively. Altcoin Season: Marked by a flood of capital into smaller-cap assets. This phase is typically driven by strong narratives (e.g., DeFi, NFTs, Layer-2 solutions), explosive growth in Total Value Locked (TVL) on smart contract platforms, and a surge in initial DEX offerings (IDOs). Bitcoin’s price may rise, but its market share declines. The following table contrasts the typical market environments: Feature Bitcoin Season (Index Altcoin Season (Index > 75) Primary Driver Macro safety, institutional flows Technological innovation, sector narratives Investor Sentiment Risk-off, conservative Risk-on, speculative Market Capitalization Flow Into Bitcoin Out of Bitcoin into altcoins Typical Volatility Lower in BTC, higher in alts (downside) Extremely high across altcoin sectors Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index dip to 40 provides a data-centric, neutral gauge of current cryptocurrency market structure. It confirms a recent three-month period where Bitcoin has generally outperformed a majority of its top altcoin peers. This metric, while retrospective, is an indispensable tool for contextualizing market phases, assessing relative risk, and understanding capital rotation patterns. For market participants, the index underscores the importance of cycle awareness and fundamental analysis, especially when broad altcoin momentum wanes. Monitoring this index, alongside on-chain metrics and development activity, remains essential for navigating the complex and evolving digital asset landscape. FAQs Q1: What does an Altcoin Season Index score of 40 mean? An index score of 40 means that conditions are not currently favorable for a broad altcoin rally. It indicates that over the past 90 days, less than half of the top 100 cryptocurrencies have outperformed Bitcoin, placing the market in a neutral or Bitcoin-leaning phase. Q2: How is the Altcoin Season Index calculated? CoinMarketCap calculates the index by comparing the 90-day price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin’s performance. The score reflects the percentage of these altcoins outperforming BTC, with a reading above 75 signaling an altcoin season. Q3: Is a low Altcoin Season Index bad for cryptocurrency? Not necessarily. A low index simply describes a market phase where Bitcoin is the relative strength leader. It is a natural part of market cycles and often represents periods of consolidation or a flight to safety, which can provide a stable base for future growth. Q4: Can the index predict the next major market move? The index is a lagging indicator, confirming trends that have already occurred over a quarter. It does not predict future prices but helps identify the established market regime, which can inform probability-based assessments for future cycle rotations. Q5: Where can investors track the Altcoin Season Index? The primary source for the official Altcoin Season Index is the CoinMarketCap website. Many third-party cryptocurrency analytics and data platforms also integrate and display this metric alongside other on-chain and market indicators for comprehensive analysis.
