MSTY's dividend yield has dropped significantly and now sits below its historical average. Technical indicators like narrowing Bollinger Bands and neutral RSI readings suggest subdued volatility for both Bitcoin and MSTR stock. Unless macro or regulatory shocks reignite volatility, I expect MSTY’s yield to remain below average. MSTY ETF: Previous Thesis and New Developments I published my last article on Yieldmax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA: MSTY ) on February 27, 2025. In this piece, titled ""MSTY Is A Buy Due To Peak Yield And Implied Volatility."" I recommended a buy rating after considering the implied volatility of the MSTR stock underlying the ETF. Quote: I recommend a buy rating for YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF due to its current 160%+ dividend yield and high implied volatility of MSTR stock. Both readings are near peak levels since the fund 's inception, adding up to a very skewed reward/risk curve. Looking ahead, I see Bitcoin price to display large volatility due to a mix of ongoing catalysts. This should keep MSTR IV at elevated levels and help to sustain MSTY 's high yield. Seeking Alpha Since that time, there have been a few developments evolving around this ETF that have materially changed my assessment. In the remainder of this article, I will elaborate on the top 2 on my list A) the latest technical trading patterns of Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Strategy (MSTR) stock, and B) the dividend yield decrease. My conclusion from this reexamination is twofold. First, I believe MSTY's underlying assets have entered a consolidation phase since my last writing, which would in turn lead to quieter volatility. Second, I also expect the subdued volatility to be unfavorable for MSTY's option pricing. As such, my view is that the reward/risk ratio of this ETF has become materially less attractive than the time of my last writing, leading me to downgrade its rating to HOLD. MSTY ETF: Basic Facts A quick introduction of MSTY is helpful for readers new to the fund. MSTY ETF is issued by Toroso Investments Topco LLC and was incepted in February 2024, as you can see from the following chart. The funds generate high yield (about 133% as of this writing) via the use of covered calls on its underlying asset – the MSTR stock. As part of its strategy, the fund also uses cash and US Treasurys as collaterals as detailed in its fund's description below: MSTY fund description: MSTY aims to generate monthly income while providing exposure to the price returns of MicroStrategy stock, subject to a cap on potential gains. The fund utilizes a synthetic covered call strategy via standardized exchange-traded and FLEX options, which consists of three elements: i) synthetic long exposure, ii) covered call writing, and iii) US Treasurys for collateral. The synthetic long exposure seeks to replicate the price movements of MSTR by purchasing and selling at-the-money calls and puts that have one- to six-month terms. To generate income, the fund writes call options with an expiration of one month or less and a strike price of approximately 0%-15% above MSTR's current share price. The fund operates with an expense ratio of 0.99% and an AUM of $4.91 billion. As such, the fund offers a quite competitive combination of costs and liquidity when compared to similar ETFs. For instance, the table below shows two primary competing ETFs for MSTY: MST and IMST. As seen, they feature a higher expense ratio and/or much smaller AUM in comparison. With this background, next I will continue explaining why I see good reasons for the high yield to persist in the near future. Source: ETF.com Bitcoin and MSTR Show Signs of Consolidation Looking at the latest BTC-USD trading chart, as shown below, I am seeing several technical indicators suggesting a period of consolidation. To start, the Bollinger Bands have been narrowing significantly since my last writing, indicating a decrease in volatility and often preceding a sideways price movement in my experience. As seen, the current lower Bollinger Band is around 101,409 level and the upper band is around 110,657 level, translating into bandwidth of around 9,248. This is only a fraction of the bandwidth observed at my last writing (of almost 40,000). As another crucial technical signal, the Relative Strength Index [RSI] has also moved into a neutral range since my last writing. The RSI reading is currently at approximately 52, a neutral position that further reinforces the idea that there's no strong momentum in either direction for Bitcoin. Given the close relationship between Bitcoin and MSTR stock, MSTR's trading chart (see the second figure below) exhibits almost identical trends. Here, the width of the Bollinger Bands has also narrowed substantially since my last writing and the RSI has been hovering around the neutral level since June also. StockCharts StockCharts MSTY ETF: Dividend Yield MSTY's dividend yield has also become far less attractive than the time of my last writing due to the changes in its prices and also payouts. To wit, at the time of my publication, MSTY was priced at $20.92, and the fund was yielding about 161% at that time. It has experienced a moderate 2.37% price gain since then, if you recall from the first chart. But the ETF has delivered a total return of 38.74% thanks to its generous payouts, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's change of 3.20% over the same period. The above price changes, when combined with the changes in payouts, have resulted in a noticeable decrease in its yield. Currently, its dividend yield stands at 134%. It is of course extremely high in absolute terms. However, it is not as attractive when contextualized properly. For example, the next chart shows the historical levels of its yield. Since its inception in 2024, the fund's yield started to stabilize in early 2025. Since then, MSTY's dividend yield has reached a high of 193%, the average dividend yield for MSTY has been approximately 159%, and the lowest dividend yield was approximately 121% as seen. The current yield is thus not only noticeably lower than that at my last writing, but also lower than its historical average by a sizable margin. Seeking Alpha Other Risks and Final Thoughts Looking ahead, I expected the relatively low dividend yield to continue, given my above judgment of the consolidation of Bitcoin and also MSTR stock. As mentioned in the forgoing sections, I expect such a consolidation phase to keep the implied volatility of MSTY's underlying assets at muted levels, thus creating an unfavorable pricing environment for MSTR's option strategy. In terms of downside risks to my above thesis, the top 2 in my mind are macroeconomic conditions (in particular interest rate policy) and also regulatory developments. If central banks, particularly the U.S. Federal Reserve, signal or implement change to their interest rate hikes – in either direction, such changes could change the flow of capital into cryptocurrencies and heighten their volatility. These changes can in turn cause high volatility for MSTR stock and boost MSTY's income generation. In terms of regulatory risks, the cryptocurrency landscape is still evolving. Any sudden or significant regulatory shifts, whether positive or negative, could also cause large price swings and heightened volatility. All told, this article on MSTY is motivated largely by two changes since my last writing: the latest technical signals for bitcoin/MSTR stock and MSTY's dividend yield change. After examining these changes, I see an overall neutral reward/risk curve under current conditions. In particular, the yield is relatively low by historical standard, and I see large odds for this level of yield to persist given my analysis of the trading patterns for Bitcoin and MSTR stock. These considerations have led me to adjust my rating on MSTY to hold.",MSTY,EN,0,0,TRADING|BUSINESS|BTC|MARKET|FIAT,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-06-30 23:02:27

Lummis sought on Monday to insert language into Congress' "" Big Beautiful Bill "" that would, among other things, waive taxes on small crypto transactions below $300 and would — in the industry's view — rationalize a tax approach that currently has people hit for taxes on both the front end and back end of activity at the heart of the sector's inner workings: staking and digital assets mining. The idea of making small transactions tax-free (capped at $5,000 in overall transactions each year) would eliminate much of the burden of working out capital gains for people who only engage in a small amount of digital assets activity. That could clear a lot of headaches for those who've been hesitant to try crypto, the industry contends. The amendment pushed by Lummis, which hasn't yet come up for a vote, also addresses tax issues with crypto lending, wash sales and charitable contributions. As the Digital Chamber put it on Monday, the move on mining, staking and other ways of gaining crypto assets would repair ""a long overdue mistake on how these rewards are treated for tax purposes.""""Today, staking and block rewards are taxed upon both acquisition and point of sale,"" the U.S. crypto lobbying group argued, pushing its constituents to petition Congress for support. ""Senator Lummis’ provision solves this by taxing rewards only when sold, aligning policy with actual income."" So-called validators in a blockchain are given rewards for staking their assets, providing them a return for otherwise locking up their cryptocurrency. It's taxed when they receive the rewards and on the gains when they sell those assets. Industry critics of this approach are pushing for the change to a system that would instead tax the assets only upon their eventual sale. Crypto mining works in much the same way , with assets created in the digital mining process and then later sold. Assets gained from aidrops and forks would also get the same treatment under Lummis' amendment, getting taxed only when they're ultimately sold. The amendment might also address the wash-trading loophole lawmakers have sought for years to close. Under current rules, crypto investors can conduct a ""tax-loss harvesting"" strategy through strategically selling investments at a loss and immediately re-purchasing them. The hard-fought Senate process has been going through an unlimited amendment process known as a ""vote-a-rama"" which began Monday morning, and Lummis sought to toss this amendment into the mix. The stakes are high for congressional Republicans on the wide-reaching bill, but party leaders have struggled to keep all of their members in the yes column as Democrats unite against it, taking issue with potential cuts to Medicaid, green energy initiatives and other aspects of the nearly 1,000-page legislation. The U.S. House of Representatives barely passed its own version of the spending bill last month, and it would have to do so again if the Senate approves it with changes. Analysis of the measure concluded its provisions could add more than $3 trillion to the U.S. budget deficit.

The iPhone maker is now in advanced discussions with Anthropic and OpenAI after it held talks with Perplexity and Thinking Machines Lab to enhance Siri’s capabilities. Apple Inc. is reportedly in advanced discussions with Anthropic and OpenAI to potentially overhaul its existing AI strategy by integrating third-party large language models (LLMs) into Siri. The move is still under consideration but comes during a period of growing concern that the “Apple Foundation Models” are falling short of expectations, especially when compared to the fast-evolving capabilities of generative AI products like Anthropic’s Claude and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Internal testing showed that Anthropic’s Claude currently outperforms Apple’s own models. Apple is considering ditching its in-house AI models in Siri Apple’s evaluation of third-party models reportedly began after a disruption in management caused Siri responsibilities to shift from the AI chief, John Giannandrea, to the software engineering head, Craig Federighi, and the Vision Pro executive, Mike Rockwell. Rockwell assumed the Siri engineering role in March and initiated the testing of external LLMs, including Claude, ChatGPT, and Google’s Gemini, to assess whether they could outperform Apple’s in-house systems. After several testing phases, executives have reportedly found Anthropic’s Claude to be the most promising candidate for Siri’s requirements. This led Adrian Perica, the vice president of corporate development at Apple, to begin negotiations with Anthropic. Discussions have included requests for custom versions of Claude and ChatGPT to be trained and deployed on Apple’s Private Cloud Compute servers. Anthropic is reportedly seeking a multibillion-dollar annual licensing fee that would increase significantly over time, and that request has complicated the talks. The potential switch, though still under review, is especially notable because Apple has long prided itself on end-to-end control over its products, especially in matters of privacy and user experience. Siri already uses ChatGPT to handle some search-based queries and upcoming image generation features in iOS 26, but the assistant itself remains built on Apple’s models. OpenAI had previously offered to develop on-device models for Apple, but the company declined at the time. Until now, the company was expected to launch an upgraded Siri in 2026, powered by its internal models. These plans remain in progress under a parallel initiative known internally as “LLM Siri.” Shares of Apple rose as much as 3% after Bloomberg broke news of the potential change, which might be a sign that investors view strategic partnerships like this as a necessary step to keep pace with competitors like Google and Samsung. Reports of morale trouble and internal resistance emerge While Apple’s discussions with potential partners seem to be heading in the right direction, internal issues appear to be demoralizing workers. A group of engineers led by Ruoming Pang and reporting to senior AI director Daphne Luong, who work on Apple’s Foundation Models, have reported feeling demoralized by the company’s outside partnerships. They feel that exploring third-party LLMs places blame on them for Apple’s AI shortcomings. Some have even considered leaving for more lucrative offers from rivals like Meta and OpenAI, who are reportedly offering annual compensation packages ranging from $10M to over $40M. Employees at Apple also have the rising concern that the company’s reliance on third-party models for Siri may eventually extend to other AI features, which could potentially undermine any long-term investments in Apple’s in-house technology. Tom Gunter, a senior researcher involved in Apple’s large language model development, left the company last week after eight years. The MLX team that developed Apple’s core open-source system for machine learning on its chips also threatened to resign. After internal negotiations and counteroffers however, they agreed to stay. Bloomberg reports that Apple has shelved some internal projects entirely. For instance, Swift Assist, an Apple-developed LLM tool for code generation in Xcode , was canceled about a month ago. Instead, Apple plans to integrate third-party coding models, including ChatGPT and Claude, into the new version of Xcode expected later this year. Apple executives are also reportedly divided about how far the company should go in relying on outside AI vendors. Rockwell and Federighi appear increasingly open to short-term third-party integration, but they also believe Apple should retain ownership of AI models in the long run, given their central role in future products like robotics and wearable devices. Meanwhile, other tech giants are making these third-party partnerships. Samsung, for example, has branded its AI services under the “Galaxy AI” label but uses Google’s Gemini for many of the underlying functions. Amazon uses Anthropic’s Claude to power some Alexa+ features .

Kakao Bank: Stablecoin and Crypto Expansion Ahead The news agency wrote that the bank is carefully monitoring market trends and regulations in the crypto sector. Kakao and others are reportedly expecting imminent developments in the “domestic legal and institutional environment for cryptoassets.” Since 2019, successive South Korean governments have pursued a conservative approach to crypto regulation. This has culminated in a total ban on domestic coin launches and a blanket ban on corporate crypto investment. Banks and other financial institutions have also been reduced to a peripheral role in the crypto space, despite their once-grand plans of becoming major crypto custody players. That all looks set to change after June 3’s elections, with new President Lee Jae-myun taking a decidedly progressive stance on crypto policy. One of Lee’s key manifesto pledges was the launch of a Korean won-backed stablecoin. And his government appears ready to attempt to deliver on its promise by fast-tracking a draft stablecoin bill. Businesses like Kakao appear keen to ensure they can hit the ground running if they are given the green light to enter the market. Yonhap wrote that the company is now “making advanced preparations to be able to quickly enter the sector.” Trading volumes on the Coinone crypto exchange on June 30.

These include real-time cryptoasset price checking functions and crypto wallet links. As such, Coinone wallet holders can check the balance and KRW worth of their crypto wallets directly from the Kakao Bank app interface. New functions will also indicate the book value of crypto investments, and loss or gain-related statistics. Kakao Bank said that it would continue to look for new cooperation opportunities with Coinone and look to deepen its “participation in the cryptoassets market.” In April this year, the bank added a Coinone-linked “invest in crypto” function to its banking app. Kakao Bank has an exclusive partnership deal with Coinone, meaning that all of the exchange’s customers who want to use the KRW market must open dedicated bank accounts with the financial provider. The bank may also look to expand its crypto operations overseas. It has recently secured an operating license in Thailand. Yonhap wrote: “More than 20% of the Thai population owns cryptoassets, per some estimates. That is the highest rate in the world. This could also be a good environment for Kakao Bank to consider moving into in the future.” SK Telecom’s retail partner compensation plan stirs controversy https://t.co/IMFGqfX95N — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) June 29, 2025 As discussions on crypto continue to advance in the National Assembly, share prices in both Kakao Bank and Kakao Pay continue to show growth . Toss Bank: 48 Copyright Filings The same media outlet also reported that Toss Bank wants to become a member of the Open Blockchain and DID Association (OBDIA). The OBDIA was granted permission to operate as a non-profit corporation by the Ministry of Science and ICT in 2018. But interest in the organization has revived this year after it added a dedicated stablecoin division.

For traders, the answer hinges on risk appetite—and on which catalysts are most likely to hit before the quarter ends. MAGACOIN FINANCE: High Risk, Early Traction, Serious Momentum And then there’s MAGACOIN FINANCE —the wildcard. Still in its presale phase, the project has already raised over $10 million and is steadily gaining traction among early-stage traders. It’s politically themed, community-driven, and meme-aware—but behind the branding is a solid framework that’s drawing attention for more than just narrative. With a fixed supply of 170 billion tokens, a full audit by HashEx, and no venture capital control, MAGACOIN FINANCE is structured to favor early adopters. As capital flows toward presale opportunities, this project is showing signs of real momentum—wallet growth is consistent. This isn’t a fit for every investor. But for those comfortable with early-stage volatility and looking for potential outsized gains, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a presale to watch closely in Q3. XRP: Stability Returns as Legal Fog Clears It’s been a long time coming, but XRP finally feels like it’s out of the penalty box. The SEC settlement earlier this year did more than clear the air—it unlocked XRP’s path back to serious institutional portfolios. Since then, whispers of an XRP spot ETF have grown louder, and some analysts now place the odds of approval above 80%. The coin is holding steady above key technical support, and many traders see a clean shot toward $2.80–$3.40 in the near term—possibly more if ETF headlines materialize. It’s also worth noting XRP’s inclusion in the Nasdaq Crypto Index, which has opened the door for conservative capital to flow back in. Still, it’s not without risks. Delays on the ETF front or weak broader sentiment could keep XRP stuck in consolidation. But for traders who value regulatory clarity and exposure to real-world payment utility, XRP is arguably the most “institutional-ready” bet on the board this quarter. Avalanche: Quiet Accumulation Beneath Enterprise Momentum While XRP leans into legal strength, Avalanche is drawing attention for a different reason: adoption. AVAX’s partnership with FIFA and its push into digital collectibles via a custom Layer-1 chain have put it squarely in the conversation among institutional dealmakers. Technically, AVAX is building bullish structure. Analysts are eyeing accumulation zones between $19.50 and $21, with breakout targets around $26–$35 if volume follows through. Momentum has been brewing under the surface, and traders are starting to take notice as the wider market returns to fundamentals. Of course, Avalanche still has to contend with the Layer-1 battleground—it’s not alone, and Ethereum’s shadow looms large. But in terms of risk-reward, Avalanche is shaping up as one of the stronger mid-cap plays of the quarter. Final Word: Which Lane Are You In? XRP offers clarity, stability, and solid upside—it’s the safer lane this quarter for traders prioritizing regulation and reliability. Avalanche brings a more aggressive edge, pairing enterprise adoption with strong technical patterns for those seeking momentum without venturing too far off the beaten path. MAGACOIN FINANCE is the outlier—unproven but fast-moving, and increasingly seen as the presale that could catch the next big narrative wave. The choice depends on your risk appetite. But if this market has taught traders anything, it’s that the biggest winners often come before the spotlight hits.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-next-three-months-will-be-interesting-for-xrp-heres-why/,"Despite a series of legal wins and increasing institutional interest, XRP’s price has remained largely unchanged over the past several months. Currently trading around $2.22, the asset has struggled to gain upward momentum, even as Ripple’s ongoing legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) appears to be nearing resolution. Early Gains May Have Pre-Empted Current Stagnation Vincent Van Code, a respected software engineer and well-known figure within the XRP community, offered insights into the lack of recent price movement. According to him, a significant legal milestone occurred in July 2023, when Judge Analisa Torres declared that XRP does not qualify as a security when exchanged in secondary markets. This legal clarity triggered a strong market reaction at the time, with XRP briefly reaching $3.40 in January 2025. Van Code explained that many investors anticipated the favorable ruling and positioned themselves accordingly throughout late 2024, especially following political developments that increased confidence in a forthcoming settlement. As a result, the upward momentum that would typically follow a legal victory may have been realized prematurely. The market, he suggested, had already factored in the resolution’s outcome, which explains why XRP has since fallen and remained near the $2 mark. Law is definitely a contributing factor, but I don’t see it as a major blocker for XRP or Ripple’s success. Here’s why… The case largely wrapped up back in July 2023, when Judge Torres ruled that XRP itself is not a security — at least in programmatic sales and secondary… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) June 28, 2025 Institutional Integration Seen as Key to Future Growth While the legal uncertainty has largely been addressed, Van Code believes that the primary limiting factor for XRP’s price growth is the slow implementation of real-world utility. He emphasized that broader adoption of Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service by financial institutions will be the main driver of the next price surge. He pointed out that although some institutions have publicly announced partnerships with Ripple , many are still in the early or confidential stages of integrating Ripple’s technology into their operations. In his view, enterprise deployment within regulated environments typically requires 18 to 24 months from the point of approval to full implementation. Given that many began integration processes in late 2024, Van Code suggests that the final phases of rollout are now approaching.

Rally Expected Between August and September 2025 Van Code projected that XRP could experience its next significant rally within the next two to three months, specifically pointing to the period between August and September 2025. However, he declined to offer a specific price target for the anticipated surge, citing various market dependencies that remain uncertain. XRP has shown modest movement. As of the time of reporting, it is priced at $2.22 , representing a nearly 10% gain over the past week. While optimism remains within the community, Van Code concluded that price appreciation is more likely to follow tangible adoption milestones rather than legal developments, which have already played out in the market’s valuation.

The price has managed to stabilize despite sharp intraday swings, reflecting growing tension between bullish momentum and cautious sentiment. Analysts are now calling for a decisive move, with some expecting a breakout toward higher levels, while others warn of a possible correction if key demand zones fail to hold. Related Reading: Bitcoin Struggles Below ATH After Weeks Of Failed Attempts – $109K Level In Focus On one hand, ETH has shown strength by holding above its short-term support range, suggesting that buyers are stepping in with confidence. Bullish momentum appears to be building, especially as macro sentiment around risk assets begins to recover. On the other hand, opposing views point to weakening volume and lingering macroeconomic risks, which could trigger a deeper retracement if Ethereum fails to sustain current levels. Adding weight to the bullish case is fresh data from CryptoQuant, which highlights a strong accumulation pattern among long-term ETH holders. According to the data, significant buying pressure emerged during the recent consolidation phase, with hodlers steadily increasing their positions. This divergence between price action and accumulation behavior suggests that foundational support for Ethereum remains intact, even as traders await the next major move. Ethereum Accumulation Builds And Market Awaits Breakout Ethereum is struggling to reclaim the $2,500 level, but its ability to hold steady amid ongoing market uncertainty is a sign of underlying strength. For weeks, ETH has traded within a well-defined range between $2,200 and $2,800, with neither bulls nor bears able to take decisive control. This prolonged consolidation has delayed the long-anticipated altseason, which many believe will only begin once Ethereum breaks above key resistance and pushes into higher territory. Despite the lack of clear direction, the macro setup is becoming increasingly interesting. Global markets remain volatile, with shifting interest rate expectations, geopolitical risk, and unpredictable liquidity conditions creating mixed signals across risk assets. Yet Ethereum continues to hold firm, supported not just by technical structure but also by significant long-term holder activity. According to insights from CryptoQuant, a strong accumulation pattern has been detected among Ethereum holders. During the June consolidation phase, long-term investors steadily increased their positions, even as price action remained choppy. This divergence between price and accumulation volume signals growing confidence under the surface. When price consolidates while demand builds, the result is often explosive. With ETH holding key support levels and long-term accumulation rising, the stage may be set for a major move. If Ethereum can push through $2,500 and reclaim higher ground, it could serve as the ignition point for a broader altcoin rally. Until then, the market remains in a state of quiet buildup. Something big is coming—and Ethereum is at the center of it. Related Reading: Ethereum Sees $269M In Net Inflows In 24H – Bullish Momentum Accelerates ETH Struggles With Resistance Amid Mixed Signals Ethereum is currently trading at $2,470 after failing to hold intraday gains above the $2,500 level. The 12-hour chart shows ETH consolidating within a broader range, with $2,200 acting as strong support and $2,800 as key resistance. Despite several bullish attempts, Ethereum has struggled to reclaim higher ground, and the rejection near the 100-period SMA (green line at $2,537) signals persistent selling pressure near resistance. The price is currently trading above the 200 SMA ($2,170) and just under the 50 SMA ($2,507), which now acts as a short-term resistance. This tight positioning of moving averages suggests ETH is at a decision point—either it breaks through $2,500 to target $2,600 and higher, or it risks rolling over if bulls fail to hold momentum. Related Reading: ONDO Breaks Out Of Ascending Channel – Analyst Sets $0.29 Target Volume remains relatively flat, indicating indecision. The overall structure still favors a neutral-to-bullish bias, especially if price continues to close above the 200 SMA.

Of the participants in the survey, 27% reported that they own crypto, with the average investment being around $10 million won (just shy of $7.4k), which accounts for 14% of their portfolios. Adoption is Growing The median age for the people included in this review is between 30 and 40. Men tend to be more active in the investing space, but the findings indicate that there has been a steady increase in females participating in the crypto space since about the start of 2024. The main reasons for investing tend to be psychological (FOMO), but the authors do note a shift from that tendency from 57% to 34%, as compared with previous surveys. Other data sets include new investors in the space, growth potential, and portfolio diversification. The vast majority of investors tend to be in Bitcoin (89%), but the report notes a shift to other cryptocurrencies, particularly stablecoins, as trading experience rises. A common challenge for respondents appears to be related to exchanges, as not many native banks work with them. If regulations become more favorable, “ 7 out of 10 investors will choose a residential bank, rather than a new bank with preferential benefits ”, which paints a very clear picture of current trader sentiment. The main focus around picking an exchange also seems to be centering on how easy it will be to connect to a bank, rather than other considerations such as trading volume, convenience, and user experience. Roughly 43% of the survey participants indicated high intent to continue investing in crypto assets in the future, with an additional 28% showing moderate such. About every 7 out of 10 show above-average interest. Concerns about volatility remain high (56%), as do fears of bankrupt exchanges (61%) and the risk of fraud (61%). Crypto investments would be viewed more positively if more traditional finance (TradFi) companies participated (42%) and more legal frameworks were established (35%), further data shows. Interestingly enough, about 20% of South Korean officials also hold crypto, according to another recent survey covered by CryptoPotato earlier this year. Current Crypto Landscape in Korea Along with increased public interest, officials in Korea seem to be following suit and adopting crypto more widely. Parataxis Holdings (an American investment firm) recently announced a controlling 25 billion won ($18.3M) stake in a South Korean biotech company, with plans to be the first company in the country to create a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. Additionally, the Deputy Chief of the Bank of Korea (BOK) noted that it would be “ desirable for them to start a gradual introduction to stablecoins ”. Moreover, South Korea appears to be the best-performing market in Asia currently. The benchmark Kospi Composite Index is up almost 30% this year, to a near four-year high, with some individual stocks seeing jumps of 70%-80%. This has all likely been a cascade of events following the recent election of the crypto-friendly President, Lee Jae-myung. The country has quietly become one of the most flourishing crypto markets, with a large part of the population, as noted, investing in digital assets. The country has seen some 57 trillion won ($42 billion) in stablecoin trades for this year alone, only pushing BOK to move forward with their previous plans for a won-backed stablecoin.

XMR could reach a maximum price of $1,501.34 by the end of 2028. By 2031, Monero’s price may surge to $2,445.93.

Monero price analysis 1-day chart: XMR recovers towards $320 The 24-hour XMR/USD price chart indicates a mixed market sentiment as the altcoin observes an increase of more than 65% of its value in the last few days as XMR rose from the $220 price level to the $400 mark. However, after reaching the $400 mark, the price crashed sharply to the $310 level where it hovers as the bulls fail to climb past $320 resistance. XMR Price 1-day chart The indicators reflect the decreasing bearish price sentiment, as all three major technical indicators show positive signs. The MACD is bullish at 1.00 units and shows rising bullish pressure at the current price level.

Monero price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour price chart shows that Monero rapidly recovered after the price broke down below the descending trend’s bottom line. Currently the bulls seek to cross $320. Monero price analysis 4-hour chart The RSI is at 55.51, suggesting bullish momentum as the price climbs back towards the $320 mark.

However, the sharp crash to the $320 mark suggests strong bearish pressure. As expected, the price fell below $300 but was defended well below the well enabling a swift recovery. Now the bulls seek to go higher. According to our analysis, we expect the XMR price to rise towards the $335 mark after brief consolidation below the $325 mark. However, the bulls need to breach the $320 level and establish a foothold above $318 to initiate a rally. Is Monero a good investment? Monero is an attractive investment because it emphasizes privacy and security, utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure transaction confidentiality. Its growing adoption across various use cases and a decentralized development model enhance its long-term potential. With a limited supply and increasing investor interest, Monero offers a unique opportunity for those seeking financial autonomy and privacy to invest in cryptocurrency. However, investors should remain cautious of regulatory risks and market volatility when considering Monero as part of their portfolio, making it essential to seek investment advice . Why is XMR up today? Monero rapidly recovered after the price broke down below the descending trend’s bottom line with the bulls seeking to go past $320. Will XMR recover to its all-time high? Monero is expected to recover toward its all-time high of $518 by mid-2026 as the privacy chain continues to reduce its tech debt and progresses toward greater utility and privacy. However, the platform might have to overcome regulatory scrutiny and challenges before it can see mass adoption. How much will Monero be worth in 5 years? The Monero price prediction for 2030 suggests a minimum price of $1,048.76 and an average trading price of $1,142.11 . The maximum forecasted price is set at $1,208.35. Will XMR reach $1000? The chance of Monero (XMR) hitting $1,000 hinges on various factors, which will influence its future price movements . The adoption of privacy transactions and technological advances could increase demand. Favorable regulations and market sentiment toward privacy coins would also help. Yet, regulatory risks, competition, and market volatility are challenges. $1,000 is possible with favorable conditions, especially considering the current price but market dynamics and regulations will shape its path. Does XMR have a good long-term future? Monero (XMR) has the potential for a strong long-term future due to its focus on privacy and security, which makes it attractive to users seeking anonymity. However, regulatory scrutiny and notoriety from being the favored medium for some past criminals impact the current monero sentiment, making it challenging to become the star of the market. Monero’s commitment to privacy gives it a solid foundation for long-term growth, but it must carefully navigate market and regulatory landscapes.

Monero historic price sentiment Monero’s market value has changed dramatically since its launch in 2014, from less than $1 to over $475. May 2021 marked the highest point in Monero’s history. Monero’s price projections revealed the coin’s security. They provide investors with optimism that they will be freed from the persecution of some authorities simply by buying or selling Monero. Monero price history; Source: Coinmarketcap Across 2023, Monero’s price rose by 11.49%. The highest price was $278.56, and the lowest was $114.16. In January 2024, Monero stayed stable around the $150.00 mark as market momentum remained low. However, the stability was short-lived as February crashed to $101.95. However, XMR showed swift recovery as it closed the month near the $150.00 level again. In March and April 2024, XMR saw a steady decline from $150.00 to $120.00, where it found key support. In May 2024, XMR observed steady bullish pressure as the price rose from $120.00, approaching resistance at $150. In June 2024, Monero (XMR) traded within the $150 – $175 price range as either side struggled to make a clear breakthrough. In July, the crypto traded around the $155 mark as the price volatility remained relatively low. XMR opened trading at $156.05 in August and ended the month at $176.00, making remarkable gains. September was bearish for the asset, as the price declined below the $160 mark by the end of the month. In October, Monero observed a steep crash and has been making a swift recovery since then. In December, Monero made remarkable strides as the asset’s price broke past the $220 mark, albeit briefly as it closed the month below $200. In January, Monero saw a bullish January as the price rose from below the $200 mark to $238 by the end of the month. In February, the price fell towards the $215 mark as bears dominate the markets. In March, the price observes mixed momentum and closed the month slightly below $215. In April the consolidation continued until late into the month when it spiked past the $325 mark before ending the month around $275. In May the price continued rising rapidly as the bulls cruised past $300 ending the month around $320.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,XMR|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|FORKS|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-30 23:59:00

One side is packed with coins that move fast on hype. The other builds slowly but strongly with use cases. Some coins rise quickly and vanish just as fast. Others create a structure that lasts beyond market buzz. This guide looks at four cryptos that seem ready for serious growth. Each one brings something unique to the table. BlockDAG leads with its real-world tasks and reward-based setup. The rest show different strengths. Here’s how they compare and why they are worth a deeper look. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Purpose-Powered Airdrop Structure BlockDAG stands at the top of the highest potential crypto list by tying rewards to real user effort. Instead of easy airdrops that only ask for a click or repost, BlockDAG’s 100 million BDAG drop covers four areas: Testnet use, Presale buys, Social content, and Referrals. This system rewards actions that help the network. This setup boosts early user interest while backing up the project with tools and real tech. It supports wallet testing, smart contract tasks, and the use of mining gear like the X10, X30, and X100. The numbers show traction. BlockDAG (BDAG) has collected $326 million in presale, with 23.4 billion coins sold. Now in batch 29, BDAG price fixed at $0.0016 until the BlockDAG GLOBAL LAUNCH release. Growth here is about real action. The X1 app is already in millions of hands. Airdrop rewards are shaped to reach those doing the work, not bots. By turning effort into access, BlockDAG shows a different way to grow a blockchain. It’s a model that asks more but gives more in return. 2. Aptos (APT): Built for Speed with Meta Roots Aptos secures its position on this list thanks to its high-speed Layer 1 design, created by former Meta engineers. Using the Move programming language, it delivers fast parallel execution and high throughput, which is crucial for applications needing real-time performance. The team’s background gives it weight, as Aptos carries forward ideas once part of Meta’s Diem initiative. Its price has seen ups and downs, but the developer interest around it keeps growing. DeFi and gaming projects are finding their way onto Aptos, signalling expanding adoption. If its technical edge matches broader demand, the upside could be substantial. Still, unlike BlockDAG, Aptos does not have user-based contribution rewards, which could slow early engagement at the community level. 3. Arbitrum (ARB): Fueling Ethereum’s Scalable Future Arbitrum emerges as one of Ethereum’s most effective Layer 2 scaling tools. By cutting gas fees and speeding up transactions, it has already drawn in top DeFi players like GMX and Radiant Capital. The 2023 ARB airdrop created major attention, and the network remains active through DAO votes and ongoing ecosystem support. Ethereum’s long-term plans support its place among the highest potential crypto projects. As Ethereum works toward better scalability, Arbitrum continues to benefit. Though it does not feature mining gear or testnet engagement rewards like BlockDAG, its real-world use in easing Ethereum congestion makes it hard to overlook. For those focused on ETH-based growth, ARB stays relevant. 4. Render (RNDR): Powering AI with Shared GPUs Render is carving a space in decentralised computing by offering GPU power for 3D rendering and AI processing. It connects people needing computing power with those who have unused GPU capacity, forming a peer-to-peer market that supports heavy digital tasks. This becomes more critical as the demand for creative AI tools continues to grow. Its network has seen support from well-known media and design firms, putting it in a strong position as AI and metaverse needs rise. RNDR is used within the network for settling tasks. Although price swings have occurred, it has built a solid community and maintained steady traction. Beyond Speculation Lies Real Growth In reviewing the highest potential crypto options, it helps to filter out the noise and look for actual user impact. BlockDAG separates itself by linking its coin distribution to actions that help build and test its systems. Its mix of hardware integration, mobile mining, and a testnet ready for EVM makes it a standout project even before launch. APT, ARB, and RNDR each deliver powerful tools of their own, whether through speed, scaling, or compute sharing. Still, none blend real-world tools, grassroots contribution, and broad developer engagement like BlockDAG does. For those watching for long-term expansion supported by user effort and working products, BDAG stands at the front of the pack.

With key regulatory breakthroughs, ETF momentum, and institutional interest all aligning, these altcoins are shaping up as leading plays for the months ahead. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Emerging Giant That’s Already Drawing Insider Attention Beyond the major market names, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing increased attention from crypto analysts and high-volume traders. While it entered the conversation as a meme-driven project, its momentum and structure now place it firmly in the conversation for 2025’s top emerging tokens. With a capped token supply, a fully audited smart contract by HashEx, and a branding strategy that breaks through typical crypto noise, MAGACOIN FINANCE is already turning heads among crypto insiders. The project’s scarcity-focused model and aggressive ecosystem alignment are fueling speculation that it may become a top performer — particularly among those seeking high-conviction alternatives outside of legacy altcoins. XRP: Legal Clarity and ETF Optimism Shift the Narrative Ripple’s multi-year legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officially ended in June, marking a major win for XRP. Ripple agreed to pay a $50 million fine, while $75 million will be returned from escrow. With both parties seeking to lift restrictions on Ripple’s operations, the decision is seen as a catalyst for broader market confidence. ETF developments are adding fuel to XRP’s resurgence. Three futures-based XRP ETFs have been approved and are set to launch under ProShares Trust. CME Group is also preparing to list XRP futures contracts, further legitimizing XRP as a regulated asset class. With a spot ETF approval now seen as having an 85% chance, XRP is positioned for wider institutional adoption. XRP has rallied nearly 30% from its four-month low of $1.61, recently trading between $2.15 and $2.36. A move past key resistance at $2.40, $2.61, and $3.00 could open the door to $3.74 or even higher. Some analysts cite cycle targets as high as $19.27–$50, referencing technical echoes of the 2017 rally. Solana: ETF Race and Institutional Flow Signal Strength Solana is rapidly gaining favor among institutions, with nine separate ETF filings now on the table in the U.S. Invesco Galaxy’s latest application adds to a growing belief that altcoin ETFs — led by SOL — are likely to be greenlit in 2025. Bloomberg analysts peg approval odds above 90%, citing broad interest in Bitcoin alternatives. SOL has held firm around $144–$147 after rebounding from lows near $126. A bullish reversal pattern is building above $142.65, with potential upside toward $168 in Q3. Long-term projections range from $230 to $290 by year-end, backed by surging DeFi and gaming activity on the Solana network and record-high CME futures volumes. Ethereum: Rebound Potential Amid Whale Activity Despite a rocky June, Ethereum remains a cornerstone of market sentiment. ETH dropped over 20% during the month, mirroring past bearish patterns, but recent whale accumulation — over $1 billion worth — has renewed confidence in a rebound. Ethereum is currently trading around $2,400. However, a bullish “Head and Shoulders bottom” around $2,330 could trigger a trend reversal, with analysts eyeing $2,774 to $2,906 for July. If key resistance levels are broken, targets as high as $5,925 are on the table. Combined with record-staking volumes and consistent network strength, Ethereum remains a long-term favorite. Altcoins to Watch This Quarter As macroeconomic pressures continue to shape global markets, XRP, Solana, and Ethereum are showing signs of renewed strength heading into Q3 2025. But it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE that’s commanding attention from high-volume buyers looking for exponential upside. Every chart, every signal, and every presale surge points in one direction: this cycle’s biggest breakout altcoin may already be here.

He urged investors to stay committed and prepare for what he described as an upcoming phase of extraordinary financial opportunity, especially for those who have held onto their tokens through the market’s volatility. Wealth for Committed XRP Investors In a recent post shared on X, Coach JV predicted that individuals who have continued to hold XRP through uncertain times may eventually experience a level of financial growth that will be difficult to fully grasp. His message aligns with ongoing optimism within the XRP community regarding the token’s long-term potential and its anticipated role in reshaping the global financial system. While XRP currently trades around $2, some investors maintain expectations that its price could surge far beyond that mark. This sentiment is particularly strong among long-term holders who believe XRP could one day achieve valuations that would significantly alter their financial circumstances. There will come a moment when XRP holders who held the line won’t be able to comprehend the wealth they’ve stepped into. But don’t just wait for that day, build empires on the way there. We weren’t meant to wait for saviors. We were meant to be the builders. — Coach, JV (@Coachjv_) June 29, 2025 Ownership Distribution and Wealth Projections Recent data reveals that out of approximately 6.61 million XRP wallets, the overwhelming majority are controlled by retail holders with relatively small balances. Specifically, around 5.36 million wallets hold 500 XRP or less. Another 1.1 million wallets hold between 500 and 25,000 XRP tokens. Considering this distribution, community members frequently discuss hypothetical future valuations. For instance, if XRP were to reach $100 per token, an investor with 25,000 tokens would possess assets worth $2.5 million. However, for the majority with less than 500 XRP, even a $100 valuation might not yield transformative wealth. To address this, some community influencers have promoted forecasts suggesting XRP could climb to $1,000 or even $10,000 per coin, predictions that, if realized, would generate substantial wealth even for small holders. However, such estimates often raise questions about feasibility, especially regarding the required market capitalization and liquidity to support those price levels. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Coach JV also emphasized the importance of more than just passive investment. He encouraged XRP holders to take initiative and build value in the ecosystem. According to him, the community should not simply wait for gains but instead use this time to develop businesses, create educational resources, or contribute to the growing XRP infrastructure. His remarks suggest that success in the crypto space is not limited to price appreciation alone. Long-term investors are urged to seize opportunities for innovation, entrepreneurship, and real-world utility around XRP as the ecosystem matures. Broader Sentiment Within the XRP Community Coach JV’s remarks align with views shared by other XRP influencers. Edo Farina of Alpha Lions Academy recently suggested that holding 10,000 XRP could provide a pathway to significant financial independence. Another figure in the community stated that even 1,000 XRP might be enough to achieve a comfortable lifestyle within the next few years, depending on future market trends. As XRP continues to trade in a relatively stable range, community leaders remain focused on encouraging resilience and proactive involvement among holders.

Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 321,400 followers on the social media platform X that he’s now bullish on the native asset of the layer-1 protocol after moving above a diagonal resistance that has kept SOL bearish since late May. The trader thinks that Solana and other coins operating on its network will witness rallies this week, at the very least. “Nice downtrend break on SOL overnight, I think we’re in for a good week [this] week. SOL ecosystem [coins] also starting to perk up and look real good again. I think we’re back, baby.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, SOL is worth $152. One Solana coin that’s on the trader’s radar is the non-fungible token (NFT) project Pudgy Penguins ( PENGU ). According to the analyst, PENGU looks primed to surge after breaking out from a falling wedge structure, which is a bullish reversal pattern. “Absolute monster breakout on PENGU here overnight. Absolutely amazing chart here and will go much higher, in my opinion. Looking like a standout leader, also never had a proper price discovery run yet, so expecting this one to be a banger.” Source: Bluntz/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that PENGU will hit $0.025. At time of writing, PENGU is worth $0.014, up over 6% in the past day. As Bluntz flips bullish on Solana and PENGU, he is also hinting that altcoins are on the verge of outperforming Bitcoin ( BTC ). The trader shares the Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) chart, which tracks how much of the crypto market cap belongs to BTC. Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that BTC.D is flashing a bearish divergence on the three-day chart, suggesting that a bearish reversal is in play. A bearish BTC.D chart indicates that altcoins are gaining value faster than Bitcoin. Says Bluntz, “BTC.D presented without comment.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, BTC.D is trading at 65.45%.

Avery will collaborate with other leaders from Web3 and financial services to help shape digital asset regulations. pic.twitter.com/3j3toG65Mg — Aptos (@Aptos) June 30, 2025 According to the CFTC’s website , the subcommittee concerns itself with “issues that affect the integrity and competitiveness of U.S. markets and U.S. firms engaged in global business, including the regulatory challenges of a global marketplace.” “Avery will collaborate with other leaders from Web3 and financial services to help shape digital asset regulations,” the Monday social media post from Aptos Labs reads. Other members of the subcommittee include Capitoliis CEO Gil Mandelzis, Cargill Global Derivatives Operations Director Samina Anwar, and Uniswap Labs Chief Operating Officer Mary-Catherine Lader. CFTC Faces Staffing Shakeups News of Ching’s CFTC placement comes as the federal regulator navigates changes to crypto regulation under the new Trump administration. Four CFTC commissioners have decided to step down from their roles in recent months, with former commissioner Summer Mersinger leaving her position at the agency to begin her tenure as Blockchain Association CEO earlier this month. “There’s a growing crypto caucus in Congress, we have an executive branch that sees the inherent benefits of digital assets, and our regulatory agencies have turned the page from antagonism to collaboration,” Mersinger said in a June 2 X post. “We need to capture this moment and push pro-crypto policy across the finish line,” she added. Commissioner Caroline Pham is set to leave her position when Trump’s pick to lead the CFTC, Brian Quintenz, is appointed to his role, though a set date has yet to be confirmed. Quintenz previously spearheaded the CFTC from August 2017 through August 2021, with now former commissioner Kristin M. Johnson taking over his role in March 2022.

Solana and XRP have both remained major players in the current cycle, but growing investor attention is turning toward emerging presale projects — especially MAGACOIN FINANCE. Its early performance and structural appeal have positioned it as a compelling opportunity for those seeking high-return setups before the next market expansion. MAGACOIN FINANCE Captures Momentum from Early Adopters MAGACOIN FINANCE has experienced a surge of interest, with every presale round reportedly closing rapidly. This momentum stems from a mix of narrative strength and market fundamentals. The project is structured to reward early entry, with scarcity mechanics and a firm cap that align with long-hold accumulation strategies favored by strategic investors. Its smart contract audit and focus on stability and resistance to inflation have also helped set it apart in the eyes of capital allocators who are looking for more than short-term speculation. The token’s structural blueprint reflects long-term thinking — a key reason why both institutional and retail investors are quietly adding MAGACOIN FINANCE to their 2025 watchlists. Why Solana and XRP Holders Are Exploring New Frontiers Solana has attracted significant attention for its fast, low-fee infrastructure and increasing DeFi adoption. Similarly, XRP continues to ride institutional momentum, especially amid renewed discussions around mainstream crypto integration. Yet for many traders, the most substantial gains often come from positioning before a token becomes a household name. That’s driving capital rotation into strategic presales — with MAGACOIN FINANCE leading the charge. Investors who’ve seen the long-term performance of Solana and XRP recognize that early-stage exposure is often where wealth is made. Strategic Positioning in a Shifting Market As market cycles evolve, timing becomes everything. Investors are not only looking for the next Solana or XRP, but also for projects that offer better positioning ahead of their breakout moment. MAGACOIN FINANCE has become a focal point for those seeking to diversify outside the high-cap arena without sacrificing quality or potential upside. The presale has already delivered strong paper returns for early participants, with analysts calling it one of the most asymmetric setups of the year. The fact that previous stages sold out instantly adds an additional layer of urgency for new investors tracking performance indicators and growth velocity. What Analysts Are Saying About MAGACOIN FINANCE Crypto analysts are increasingly naming MAGACOIN FINANCE in 2025 forecasts — highlighting its potential to deliver outsized ROI compared to many listed assets. Its political and cultural alignment with the 2025 macro environment is also adding fuel to long-term projections. From early-stage momentum to reinforced token mechanics, the project checks several boxes for investors seeking undervalued high-upside entries. Analysts also note that its listing plans could open up the next leg of growth — one that favors those already positioned during the presale phase. Final Thoughts As capital shifts from post-peak assets to early-stage opportunities, MAGACOIN FINANCE is proving to be more than a speculative play. It represents a calculated move for investors aiming to enter before the crowd. For Solana and XRP holders, the move into MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t about abandoning their core holdings — it’s about amplifying potential returns by allocating to a project with real structural upside before it hits major listings.

GameFi tokens, with sky-high valuations divorced from current user numbers or revenues, embody this optimism perfectly — as CoinDesk investigated in 2022 , Decentraland's then billion-dollar market cap didn't quite match the number of active players on the platform. But, surprisingly, distributed compute tokens don't seem to enjoy the same speculative premium even when compared to their Traditional Finance traded peers like CoreWeave (CRWV). CoinMarketCap says the category of tokens for decentralized networks that provide GPU power for AI and other compute workloads, which includes well-known tokens like BitTensor, Aethir, and Render, is worth $12 billion. At the same time, market data from research group MarketsandMarkets puts the value of the GPU as a service industry at around $8 billion this year, growing to $26 billion in 2030. In contrast, CRWV closed Monday in New York at $163, putting its market cap at $79.2 billion. The company’s recent earnings forecast up to $5.1 billion in 2025 revenue, suggesting it trades at more than 15 times forward sales. That kind of multiple might be justified in a high-growth environment, but CoreWeave also posted a $314.6 million net loss in the first quarter , driven in part by stock-based compensation and continued infrastructure buildout. Despite this, investors continue to reward CoreWeave for its dominant position in centralized AI infrastructure with its stock up 300% year-to-date. The company is tightly integrated with Nvidia and has high visibility through contracts with OpenAI and other enterprise clients. Meanwhile, decentralized compute networks are delivering similar services— AI inference, rendering, and compute power — without needing to raise billions in debt or equity as they act as a broker connecting existing GPUs to users, saving the capital expenditure of buying their own server farms. These are not theoretical networks. They are functional systems already processing real workloads, and the brokerage model works for customers. Yet their collective market value remains a fraction of CoreWeave’s. Certainly, they don't have the same level of workload running through their networks, but the gap is striking. While the market treats GameFi with irrational exuberance, distributed compute tokens may be suffering from the opposite problem. Despite addressing the same market need as CoreWeave, and in some ways offering a more capital-efficient and globally scalable model without the eye-watering CapEx, they remain modestly valued. Justin Sun-Backed SRM Entertainment Announces $100 Million TRX Staking Move SRM Entertainment (Nasdaq: SRM), soon to rebrand as TRON Inc. , has staked its entire treasury of 365 million TRX tokens through JustLend, a move that could yield an annual return of up to 10%, according to a release. The move comes on the heels of a $100 million investment round closed earlier this month to fund what the company calls a “TRON treasury strategy,” essentially, a public market vehicle modeled on bitcoin-holding firms like MicroStrategy, but for TRX. That structure provides equity investors with indirect exposure to a network that plays a dominant role in USDT stablecoin settlement, particularly in the Global South, where TRON-based Tether serves as a dollar lifeline – arguably a ' Visa IPO ' moment for the region's economy. Sogni AI Debuts Mainnet, SOGNI Token to List on Kraken, MEXC, Gate.io Sogni AI, a decentralized platform for generative AI workflows, has launched its mainnet and will list its native token, SOGNI, on Kraken, MEXC, and Gate.io . SOGNI is the utility token of the Sogni Supernet. It is used for compute payments, staking, governance, and access to advanced application features. The mainnet launch includes deployments on Base, an Ethereum Layer-2 developed by Coinbase, and Etherlink, a Tezos-based EVM-compatible Layer-2 using Smart Rollups. In a release, the platform said this chain-agnostic approach is designed to balance scalability and accessibility. The project’s stated goal is to create an open and economically sustainable environment for creative AI applications, combining Web3 infrastructure with user tools that resemble Web2 services in usability. The platform also uses a non-transferable credit system called Spark Points, which are fixed-value rendering credits that can be purchased or earned within the Sogni ecosystem. Users interact with the network through three core applications: Sogni Web, Sogni Pocket, and Sogni Studio. Creators submit generative AI jobs, while node operators, or “Workers,” provide GPU resources and are compensated in SOGNI tokens.

VC Firm Says XRP Could Reach Nearly $9,000 In Just 5 Years",https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/insane-or-insightful-vc-firm-says-xrp-could-reach-nearly-9000-in-just-5-years/,"US regulators and market watchers are eyeing a fresh valuation study that puts XRP on track for a dramatic price surge by 2030. Related Reading: The $100K Mirage: Bitcoin’s Rally Not Backed By On-Chain Strength According to Valhil Capital’s deep‑dive report, XRP could climb from its current price into a range between $4,813 and $9,000 in just five years. That forecast hinges on a model that treats XRP not only as a quick way to move money but also as a store of value. Model Weighs Store Of Value According to the Athey & Mitchnick Model used by Valhil Capital, XRP’s role goes way beyond sending payments. The study gives much more weight to people holding XRP like they would gold. In their view, as more folks start treating XRP as a place to park money, fewer coins stay in circulation. That tight supply pushes the price higher. The model blends economic ideas, real‑world trends, and crypto market moves to arrive at its numbers. Key Figures Drive Forecast Based on reports, the model assumes daily transactions on XRP Ledger will hit $700 billion by 2030. It uses a one‑second transaction speed and the current 56.5 billion XRP supply. With a 10% discount rate and a five‑year adoption window, the study pegs a mid‑case price of $4,813 if about 10% of global payments run on XRPL. In a more bullish view, the researchers push store‑of‑value demand to $1 quadrillion, which shoots the price beyond $9,000. Even a $100 trillion demand level would land XRP at $908 per token. Virtuous Cycle Could Fuel Growth Based on reports from Valhil Capital, the so‑called Virtuous Cycle Flywheel could spark a feedback loop. First, higher use of XRP for cross‑border payments and FX trades drives up demand. Then, price gains lure more holders to lock away their coins, shrinking the free float. That scarcity pushes prices even higher. As value climbs, new use cases could pop up, drawing in more users and adding another spin to the cycle. Regulation And Competition Loom Large XRP’s path to mass use isn’t smooth. Legal questions still swirl around its status in the US and elsewhere. That uncertainty may scare off big financial players. Plus, central bank digital currencies, stablecoins, and rival blockchains are all chasing the same slice of the cross‑border market.

MAGACOIN FINANCE Presale Now on Radar of XRP and Dogecoin Investors,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/which-crypto-will-go-up-next-magacoin-finance-presale-now-on-radar-of-xrp-and-dogecoin-investors/,"A quiet reshuffle is happening in crypto—one that’s catching even seasoned investors off guard. While XRP and Dogecoin remain cornerstones of the altcoin conversation, momentum is rapidly shifting to something far earlier, far riskier, and—according to top analysts—far more rewarding. That token is MAGACOIN FINANCE. With over $10 million raised in a matter of weeks and each presale phase closing faster than the last, this meme-infused political crypto is capturing the kind of early-stage attention last seen in the early days of Shiba Inu and PEPE. For investors who missed those once-in-a-cycle runs, MAGACOIN FINANCE is starting to look like a rare second chance. Presale Frenzy, Cultural Punch, and a Window That’s Closing Presales don’t usually move this fast. MAGACOIN FINANCE ’s early raise already surpassed $10 million, and analysts say it’s still gaining speed. Once the presale completes and this token hits major listings, the price action could flip overnight—leaving latecomers behind. Its 170 billion token cap, audited smart contracts, and 100% community distribution model give it the backbone most meme coins lack. But it’s the branding—a fiery mix of politics, memes, and retail rebellion—that’s sending it viral. This isn’t just another Doge clone. It’s a movement. Investors are comparing its setup to the early launch windows of coins that now sit in the top 20 by market cap. But unlike those plays, MAGACOIN FINANCE still trades for fractions of a cent. The difference? This time, the crowd knows what’s coming. Why XRP and Dogecoin Holders Are Jumping Ship The shift isn’t random. XRP may finally be breathing easier post-SEC turmoil, but its path forward is now defined by modest, institutional-paced growth. That might be fine for hedge funds, but it’s leaving retail investors hungry for the kind of upside that built XRP’s early cult following. Dogecoin, meanwhile, still rides waves of Elon Musk tweets and meme culture, but its unlimited supply and stalled development have dulled its edge. Many of its biggest holders are sitting on gains—but also wondering what comes next. That’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE comes in. It offers the meme energy of DOGE and the early-mover appeal XRP once had—backed by real tokenomics, capped supply, and a narrative that’s catching fire across crypto Twitter. Presale projections ranging from 2,500% to 18,500% are fueling a fresh wave of speculation, and XRP and DOGE holders are among the first to take notice. The Clock Is Ticking—and Analysts Are Loud About It The analysts aren’t whispering. They’re naming MAGACOIN FINANCE in the same breath as the biggest altcoin launches of the past cycle. But what’s different is the structure: clean tokenomics, staking utility (planned), referral rewards, and a roadmap that doesn’t rely on luck or celebrity. It’s the kind of play that rewards speed. Getting in now—before listings, before mainstream exposure, before influencers and funds pile in—is the difference between catching the wave and watching it crash from the sidelines. MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t just another speculative punt. It’s shaping up to be the token retail traders rally around in 2025—the one they brag about months from now when prices are up 10x, 20x, or more. For XRP and Dogecoin holders feeling the itch for something faster, riskier, and potentially far more lucrative, this may be the clearest signal they’ve had all year.

This substantial investment paves the way for Datagram to launch its very own sovereign Layer-1 (L1) blockchain directly on the robust Avalanche (AVAX) platform. This development is not just another funding round; it’s a powerful signal of innovation, promising to bring advanced AI capabilities to the foundational layers of blockchain technology. What Does This Pre-Seed Funding Mean for Datagram? The recent injection of $4 million in pre-seed funding is a pivotal moment for Datagram. This crucial capital, spearheaded by Blizzard the Avalanche Fund – a venture fund specifically dedicated to supporting projects within the Avalanche ecosystem – underscores the confidence in Datagram’s vision and technological prowess. For a project at the pre-seed stage, securing such a substantial amount is a testament to its potential and the market’s growing appetite for innovative blockchain solutions. So, what exactly will this funding fuel? The primary objectives are clear and critical for Datagram’s future: Real-time Performance Optimization: At the core of any high-performing blockchain is its ability to handle transactions and data efficiently. The funds will be instrumental in fine-tuning Datagram’s network to ensure seamless, real-time operations, a necessity for AI-driven applications that demand instantaneous processing. Network Deployment: From smart contract development to infrastructure setup, deploying a new Layer-1 blockchain is a complex undertaking. The funding will facilitate the comprehensive technical deployment required to bring Datagram’s vision to life on the Avalanche network. Upcoming Node Sale: A decentralized network relies on a robust set of validators or nodes. Part of the funding will support the organization and execution of Datagram’s highly anticipated node sale, inviting community participation and strengthening the network’s decentralization. Mainnet Launch: The ultimate goal is the successful launch of Datagram’s mainnet. This funding provides the necessary runway to reach this critical milestone, enabling the network to go live and begin processing real-world transactions and AI operations. This early-stage funding is more than just money; it’s a strategic partnership that connects Datagram directly with the Avalanche ecosystem, offering not just financial backing but also invaluable technical and strategic support from a major player in the blockchain space. Why Avalanche? The Power of an Avalanche L1 Ecosystem Datagram’s decision to launch its sovereign Layer-1 blockchain on Avalanche is a strategic masterstroke, leveraging the unique capabilities of the Avalanche platform. Avalanche is renowned for its innovative Subnet architecture, which allows developers to launch custom, application-specific blockchains with tailored functionalities. This is precisely where Datagram finds its perfect home. Here’s why Avalanche stands out as the ideal launchpad for Datagram’s L1: Scalability and Throughput: Avalanche’s architecture is designed for high transaction throughput and rapid finality, crucial for an AI-driven network that might process vast amounts of data and complex computations. Customizability (Subnets): The Subnet model allows Datagram to create its own sovereign blockchain with custom rules, tokenomics, and even virtual machines, optimized specifically for its AI applications. This means Datagram can dictate its own gas fees, define its own security model, and control its network parameters without being constrained by the main Avalanche C-chain. Interoperability: While sovereign, Datagram’s L1 will benefit from seamless interoperability with the broader Avalanche ecosystem and potentially other blockchains, fostering a more connected and efficient decentralized landscape. Developer-Friendly Environment: Avalanche offers an EVM-compatible environment, making it easier for developers familiar with Ethereum to build and deploy on its network, accelerating Datagram’s development timeline. Strong Community and Funding Support: The backing from Blizzard the Avalanche Fund is a clear indicator of the strong support system available for projects building within the Avalanche ecosystem. By building an Avalanche L1 , Datagram gains the best of both worlds: the independence and customization of a sovereign chain, coupled with the security, scalability, and robust infrastructure of the Avalanche network. Datagram’s Vision: Pioneering an AI Blockchain Future The most intriguing aspect of Datagram is its core identity as an “ AI-driven network project .” This positions it at the forefront of a burgeoning trend: the integration of artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. While AI and blockchain often operate in separate spheres, their convergence holds immense promise for solving complex problems and creating novel applications. How might Datagram’s AI integration manifest on its new Layer-1 blockchain? Decentralized AI Models: Datagram could enable the training, deployment, and verification of AI models in a decentralized manner, ensuring transparency, immutability, and resistance to censorship. Automated Network Optimization: AI could be used to autonomously manage and optimize the blockchain’s performance, resource allocation, and security protocols in real-time, leading to a more efficient and resilient network. Data Integrity and Verification: For AI models that rely on vast datasets, blockchain can provide an immutable ledger for data provenance and integrity, ensuring that AI models are trained on verifiable and untampered information. Smart Contract Enhancement: AI could potentially enhance smart contract capabilities, enabling more complex, adaptive, and intelligent automated agreements that respond to real-world data and events. New DApp Categories: The fusion of AI and blockchain could unlock entirely new categories of decentralized applications (dApps), from AI-powered prediction markets to autonomous decentralized organizations (DAOs) with intelligent decision-making capabilities. The challenge for any AI blockchain project lies in bridging the computational intensity of AI with the distributed nature of blockchain. Datagram’s approach to building a sovereign L1 on Avalanche suggests a design focused on optimizing this delicate balance, potentially by offloading heavy AI computations while leveraging the blockchain for verification, consensus, and data integrity. Understanding the Layer-1 Blockchain Landscape For those new to the space, a Layer-1 blockchain refers to the base protocol of a blockchain network – the fundamental architecture upon which other applications and scaling solutions (Layer-2s) are built. Bitcoin and Ethereum are prime examples of Layer-1 blockchains. They handle core functionalities like transaction validation, consensus mechanisms, and network security. The emergence of new Layer-1 blockchains like Datagram’s, particularly on platforms like Avalanche, signifies a continuous evolution in the blockchain landscape. While some might question the need for yet another L1, the trend towards application-specific blockchains (often enabled by Subnets or similar technologies) highlights a critical need for specialized environments. These tailored L1s can: Offer Niche Optimizations: Datagram’s L1 is designed specifically for AI applications, meaning it can be optimized for the unique demands of AI, which generic L1s might not fully support. Provide Economic Sovereignty: A sovereign L1 allows Datagram to control its own fee structure, potentially offering more predictable and lower transaction costs for its users, free from the congestion and fluctuating fees of larger L1s. Ensure Security and Control: By operating its own L1, Datagram has greater control over its security parameters and governance model, ensuring that the network evolves in line with its core mission. Datagram’s choice to build a new Layer-1 blockchain on Avalanche is a strategic decision aimed at creating an optimal environment for its unique AI-driven functionalities, rather than merely adding another general-purpose chain to the mix. Looking Ahead: Datagram’s Node Sale and Mainnet Launch The funding announcement is merely the first step in Datagram’s ambitious roadmap. The immediate future holds two significant milestones: the node sale and the mainnet launch. These events are crucial for the decentralization, security, and operationalization of the Datagram network. The Node Sale: This will be an opportunity for individuals and entities to acquire and operate validator nodes on the Datagram network. Participating in a node sale typically involves staking a certain amount of the native token, contributing to the network’s security and earning rewards for validating transactions. It’s a key mechanism for distributing control and fostering a decentralized community. For those interested in supporting and participating in the foundational layer of an AI-driven blockchain, this will be a critical event to watch. The Mainnet Launch: This is the moment when the Datagram blockchain officially goes live, transitioning from a test environment to a fully operational network. Upon mainnet launch, real transactions will be processed, dApps can be deployed, and the full vision of Datagram’s AI capabilities will begin to unfold. This marks the true beginning of Datagram’s journey as a live, functional blockchain. As Datagram moves closer to these milestones, potential users, developers, and investors should closely monitor official announcements for details regarding participation in the node sale and the specific features and functionalities that will be available upon mainnet launch. This is an exciting time for innovation in the blockchain and AI convergence space. Conclusion: A Powerful New Era for AI and Blockchain Datagram’s successful $4 million pre-seed funding round and its commitment to launching a sovereign Layer-1 blockchain on Avalanche represent a significant leap forward in the quest to merge artificial intelligence with decentralized technologies. By building an optimized Avalanche L1 specifically for its needs, Datagram is poised to unlock new possibilities for an AI blockchain future, offering a robust, scalable, and customizable platform for AI-driven applications. This venture not only strengthens the Avalanche ecosystem but also pushes the boundaries of what’s possible when cutting-edge AI meets the power of decentralized networks. The upcoming node sale and mainnet launch are eagerly anticipated events that could usher in a new era of intelligent, autonomous, and transparent digital interactions.

Lummis highlights a remedy for miners and stakers’ taxation,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/sen-lummis-pushes-to-fix-unfair-tax-rules/,"The crypto industry supporters are backing Senator Cynthia Lummis’ amendment to include digital asset tax changes in the “big, beautiful bill.” While senators consider passage of the more than 1,000-page reconciliation bill , the crypto-friendly Wyoming Republican is advocating for adding some provisions to address “unfair tax treatment” of crypto. In an X post , Lummis highlighted that for a long time, miners and stakers have faced double taxation . She added that they get taxed once when they earn block rewards and again when they sell them. According to Lummis, the remedy for this is to end this unfair tax policy and make sure the US becomes the leading power in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Sen. Lummis highlights a remedy for miners and stakers’ taxation A one-pager from Sen. Lummis’ office, obtained by reporters, hinted that the provisions would establish a de minimis exemption with a threshold of $300. It includes language about how miners and stakers are required to pay taxes. According to the briefing, the goal is to match the taxes on mining and staking rewards with when people actually gain economic benefits, instead of making them report based on changing and often unclear market values when they receive them, the document stated. Additionally, it highlighted that this method helps avoid cash flow issues where taxpayers have to pay taxes on assets they have not sold and might find it hard to turn into cash. In the meantime, some in the industry needed people to call lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune, and express their support. In addition, various crypto advocacy groups have been lobbying for tax changes on crypto and, most importantly, pushing for a de minimis exemption. Matthew Pines, a Bitcoin Policy Institute Executive Director, offered his opinion. In an X post, Pines noted that the Congress is currently drafting the Senate reconciliation bill and that a particular Bitcoin de minimis tax exemption is at stake. “Please take five minutes today to call or email your elected officials — especially Senator Mike Crapo (R-ID), the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee — and ask them to support this commonsense fix,” he added. Kristin Smith, the president of the Solana Policy Institute, also expressed her support. According to Smith, fair tax rules for staking are essential for the US to lead in crypto. She also emphasized that Congress can boost local growth and create jobs by clarifying stakeholder tax rules. However, it is unclear whether Lummis’ amendment can find its way into the “big, beautiful bill.” Several foreign investors intend to shift from the US Treasuries amid increased inflation The Senate is currently voting on several proposed amendments, and President Trump is demanding that the Republicans get the bill through by Friday this week, according to reports from sources. The bill must still clear the House before landing on Trump’s desk. As the bill moves through the US Senate, more foreign investors are looking to shift away from the US Treasuries, which are losing their appeal due to concerns about deficit spending and tariffs that could increase inflation. President Donald Trump’s large tax cut and big spending measures will ramp up US debt by $3.3 trillion, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated, as runaway deficits and sweeping debt led Moody’s to cut its credit rating in May. Toshinobu Chiba, who manages rates and credit funds at Simplex Asset Management in Tokyo, stated that he was definitely worried about the growing fiscal deficit. Chiba mentioned that he has been using futures to move away from the US Treasuries and invest in European debt. He then revealed plans to switch to the cash bond market once Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” is approved and inflation expectations rise. He anticipates that the first choices should be in Europe, especially the bunds and French bonds, adding that Australia and Singapore are also options for global investors.
