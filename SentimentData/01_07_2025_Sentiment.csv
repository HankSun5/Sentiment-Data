MSTY's dividend yield has dropped significantly and now sits below its historical average. Technical indicators like narrowing Bollinger Bands and neutral RSI readings suggest subdued volatility for both Bitcoin and MSTR stock. Unless macro or regulatory shocks reignite volatility, I expect MSTY’s yield to remain below average. MSTY ETF: Previous Thesis and New Developments I published my last article on Yieldmax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA: MSTY ) on February 27, 2025. In this piece, titled ""MSTY Is A Buy Due To Peak Yield And Implied Volatility."" I recommended a buy rating after considering the implied volatility of the MSTR stock underlying the ETF. Quote: I recommend a buy rating for YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF due to its current 160%+ dividend yield and high implied volatility of MSTR stock. Both readings are near peak levels since the fund 's inception, adding up to a very skewed reward/risk curve. Looking ahead, I see Bitcoin price to display large volatility due to a mix of ongoing catalysts. This should keep MSTR IV at elevated levels and help to sustain MSTY 's high yield. Seeking Alpha Since that time, there have been a few developments evolving around this ETF that have materially changed my assessment. In the remainder of this article, I will elaborate on the top 2 on my list A) the latest technical trading patterns of Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Strategy (MSTR) stock, and B) the dividend yield decrease. My conclusion from this reexamination is twofold. First, I believe MSTY's underlying assets have entered a consolidation phase since my last writing, which would in turn lead to quieter volatility. Second, I also expect the subdued volatility to be unfavorable for MSTY's option pricing. As such, my view is that the reward/risk ratio of this ETF has become materially less attractive than the time of my last writing, leading me to downgrade its rating to HOLD. MSTY ETF: Basic Facts A quick introduction of MSTY is helpful for readers new to the fund. MSTY ETF is issued by Toroso Investments Topco LLC and was incepted in February 2024, as you can see from the following chart. The funds generate high yield (about 133% as of this writing) via the use of covered calls on its underlying asset – the MSTR stock. As part of its strategy, the fund also uses cash and US Treasurys as collaterals as detailed in its fund's description below: MSTY fund description: MSTY aims to generate monthly income while providing exposure to the price returns of MicroStrategy stock, subject to a cap on potential gains. The fund utilizes a synthetic covered call strategy via standardized exchange-traded and FLEX options, which consists of three elements: i) synthetic long exposure, ii) covered call writing, and iii) US Treasurys for collateral. The synthetic long exposure seeks to replicate the price movements of MSTR by purchasing and selling at-the-money calls and puts that have one- to six-month terms. To generate income, the fund writes call options with an expiration of one month or less and a strike price of approximately 0%-15% above MSTR's current share price. The fund operates with an expense ratio of 0.99% and an AUM of $4.91 billion. As such, the fund offers a quite competitive combination of costs and liquidity when compared to similar ETFs. For instance, the table below shows two primary competing ETFs for MSTY: MST and IMST. As seen, they feature a higher expense ratio and/or much smaller AUM in comparison. With this background, next I will continue explaining why I see good reasons for the high yield to persist in the near future. Source: ETF.com Bitcoin and MSTR Show Signs of Consolidation Looking at the latest BTC-USD trading chart, as shown below, I am seeing several technical indicators suggesting a period of consolidation. To start, the Bollinger Bands have been narrowing significantly since my last writing, indicating a decrease in volatility and often preceding a sideways price movement in my experience. As seen, the current lower Bollinger Band is around 101,409 level and the upper band is around 110,657 level, translating into bandwidth of around 9,248. This is only a fraction of the bandwidth observed at my last writing (of almost 40,000). As another crucial technical signal, the Relative Strength Index [RSI] has also moved into a neutral range since my last writing. The RSI reading is currently at approximately 52, a neutral position that further reinforces the idea that there's no strong momentum in either direction for Bitcoin. Given the close relationship between Bitcoin and MSTR stock, MSTR's trading chart (see the second figure below) exhibits almost identical trends. Here, the width of the Bollinger Bands has also narrowed substantially since my last writing and the RSI has been hovering around the neutral level since June also. StockCharts StockCharts MSTY ETF: Dividend Yield MSTY's dividend yield has also become far less attractive than the time of my last writing due to the changes in its prices and also payouts. To wit, at the time of my publication, MSTY was priced at $20.92, and the fund was yielding about 161% at that time. It has experienced a moderate 2.37% price gain since then, if you recall from the first chart. But the ETF has delivered a total return of 38.74% thanks to its generous payouts, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's change of 3.20% over the same period. The above price changes, when combined with the changes in payouts, have resulted in a noticeable decrease in its yield. Currently, its dividend yield stands at 134%. It is of course extremely high in absolute terms. However, it is not as attractive when contextualized properly. For example, the next chart shows the historical levels of its yield. Since its inception in 2024, the fund's yield started to stabilize in early 2025. Since then, MSTY's dividend yield has reached a high of 193%, the average dividend yield for MSTY has been approximately 159%, and the lowest dividend yield was approximately 121% as seen. The current yield is thus not only noticeably lower than that at my last writing, but also lower than its historical average by a sizable margin. Seeking Alpha Other Risks and Final Thoughts Looking ahead, I expected the relatively low dividend yield to continue, given my above judgment of the consolidation of Bitcoin and also MSTR stock. As mentioned in the forgoing sections, I expect such a consolidation phase to keep the implied volatility of MSTY's underlying assets at muted levels, thus creating an unfavorable pricing environment for MSTR's option strategy. In terms of downside risks to my above thesis, the top 2 in my mind are macroeconomic conditions (in particular interest rate policy) and also regulatory developments. If central banks, particularly the U.S. Federal Reserve, signal or implement change to their interest rate hikes – in either direction, such changes could change the flow of capital into cryptocurrencies and heighten their volatility. These changes can in turn cause high volatility for MSTR stock and boost MSTY's income generation. In terms of regulatory risks, the cryptocurrency landscape is still evolving. Any sudden or significant regulatory shifts, whether positive or negative, could also cause large price swings and heightened volatility. All told, this article on MSTY is motivated largely by two changes since my last writing: the latest technical signals for bitcoin/MSTR stock and MSTY's dividend yield change. After examining these changes, I see an overall neutral reward/risk curve under current conditions. In particular, the yield is relatively low by historical standard, and I see large odds for this level of yield to persist given my analysis of the trading patterns for Bitcoin and MSTR stock. These considerations have led me to adjust my rating on MSTY to hold.",MSTY,EN,0,0,TRADING|BUSINESS|BTC|MARKET|FIAT,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-06-30 23:02:27

Lummis sought on Monday to insert language into Congress' "" Big Beautiful Bill "" that would, among other things, waive taxes on small crypto transactions below $300 and would — in the industry's view — rationalize a tax approach that currently has people hit for taxes on both the front end and back end of activity at the heart of the sector's inner workings: staking and digital assets mining. The idea of making small transactions tax-free (capped at $5,000 in overall transactions each year) would eliminate much of the burden of working out capital gains for people who only engage in a small amount of digital assets activity. That could clear a lot of headaches for those who've been hesitant to try crypto, the industry contends. The amendment pushed by Lummis, which hasn't yet come up for a vote, also addresses tax issues with crypto lending, wash sales and charitable contributions. As the Digital Chamber put it on Monday, the move on mining, staking and other ways of gaining crypto assets would repair ""a long overdue mistake on how these rewards are treated for tax purposes.""""Today, staking and block rewards are taxed upon both acquisition and point of sale,"" the U.S. crypto lobbying group argued, pushing its constituents to petition Congress for support. ""Senator Lummis’ provision solves this by taxing rewards only when sold, aligning policy with actual income."" So-called validators in a blockchain are given rewards for staking their assets, providing them a return for otherwise locking up their cryptocurrency. It's taxed when they receive the rewards and on the gains when they sell those assets. Industry critics of this approach are pushing for the change to a system that would instead tax the assets only upon their eventual sale. Crypto mining works in much the same way , with assets created in the digital mining process and then later sold. Assets gained from aidrops and forks would also get the same treatment under Lummis' amendment, getting taxed only when they're ultimately sold. The amendment might also address the wash-trading loophole lawmakers have sought for years to close. Under current rules, crypto investors can conduct a ""tax-loss harvesting"" strategy through strategically selling investments at a loss and immediately re-purchasing them. The hard-fought Senate process has been going through an unlimited amendment process known as a ""vote-a-rama"" which began Monday morning, and Lummis sought to toss this amendment into the mix. The stakes are high for congressional Republicans on the wide-reaching bill, but party leaders have struggled to keep all of their members in the yes column as Democrats unite against it, taking issue with potential cuts to Medicaid, green energy initiatives and other aspects of the nearly 1,000-page legislation. The U.S. House of Representatives barely passed its own version of the spending bill last month, and it would have to do so again if the Senate approves it with changes. Analysis of the measure concluded its provisions could add more than $3 trillion to the U.S. budget deficit.

The iPhone maker is now in advanced discussions with Anthropic and OpenAI after it held talks with Perplexity and Thinking Machines Lab to enhance Siri’s capabilities. Apple Inc. is reportedly in advanced discussions with Anthropic and OpenAI to potentially overhaul its existing AI strategy by integrating third-party large language models (LLMs) into Siri. The move is still under consideration but comes during a period of growing concern that the “Apple Foundation Models” are falling short of expectations, especially when compared to the fast-evolving capabilities of generative AI products like Anthropic’s Claude and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Internal testing showed that Anthropic’s Claude currently outperforms Apple’s own models. Apple is considering ditching its in-house AI models in Siri Apple’s evaluation of third-party models reportedly began after a disruption in management caused Siri responsibilities to shift from the AI chief, John Giannandrea, to the software engineering head, Craig Federighi, and the Vision Pro executive, Mike Rockwell. Rockwell assumed the Siri engineering role in March and initiated the testing of external LLMs, including Claude, ChatGPT, and Google’s Gemini, to assess whether they could outperform Apple’s in-house systems. After several testing phases, executives have reportedly found Anthropic’s Claude to be the most promising candidate for Siri’s requirements. This led Adrian Perica, the vice president of corporate development at Apple, to begin negotiations with Anthropic. Discussions have included requests for custom versions of Claude and ChatGPT to be trained and deployed on Apple’s Private Cloud Compute servers. Anthropic is reportedly seeking a multibillion-dollar annual licensing fee that would increase significantly over time, and that request has complicated the talks. The potential switch, though still under review, is especially notable because Apple has long prided itself on end-to-end control over its products, especially in matters of privacy and user experience. Siri already uses ChatGPT to handle some search-based queries and upcoming image generation features in iOS 26, but the assistant itself remains built on Apple’s models. OpenAI had previously offered to develop on-device models for Apple, but the company declined at the time. Until now, the company was expected to launch an upgraded Siri in 2026, powered by its internal models. These plans remain in progress under a parallel initiative known internally as “LLM Siri.” Shares of Apple rose as much as 3% after Bloomberg broke news of the potential change, which might be a sign that investors view strategic partnerships like this as a necessary step to keep pace with competitors like Google and Samsung. Reports of morale trouble and internal resistance emerge While Apple’s discussions with potential partners seem to be heading in the right direction, internal issues appear to be demoralizing workers. A group of engineers led by Ruoming Pang and reporting to senior AI director Daphne Luong, who work on Apple’s Foundation Models, have reported feeling demoralized by the company’s outside partnerships. They feel that exploring third-party LLMs places blame on them for Apple’s AI shortcomings. Some have even considered leaving for more lucrative offers from rivals like Meta and OpenAI, who are reportedly offering annual compensation packages ranging from $10M to over $40M. Employees at Apple also have the rising concern that the company’s reliance on third-party models for Siri may eventually extend to other AI features, which could potentially undermine any long-term investments in Apple’s in-house technology. Tom Gunter, a senior researcher involved in Apple’s large language model development, left the company last week after eight years. The MLX team that developed Apple’s core open-source system for machine learning on its chips also threatened to resign. After internal negotiations and counteroffers however, they agreed to stay. Bloomberg reports that Apple has shelved some internal projects entirely. For instance, Swift Assist, an Apple-developed LLM tool for code generation in Xcode , was canceled about a month ago. Instead, Apple plans to integrate third-party coding models, including ChatGPT and Claude, into the new version of Xcode expected later this year. Apple executives are also reportedly divided about how far the company should go in relying on outside AI vendors. Rockwell and Federighi appear increasingly open to short-term third-party integration, but they also believe Apple should retain ownership of AI models in the long run, given their central role in future products like robotics and wearable devices. Meanwhile, other tech giants are making these third-party partnerships. Samsung, for example, has branded its AI services under the “Galaxy AI” label but uses Google’s Gemini for many of the underlying functions. Amazon uses Anthropic’s Claude to power some Alexa+ features .

Kakao Bank: Stablecoin and Crypto Expansion Ahead The news agency wrote that the bank is carefully monitoring market trends and regulations in the crypto sector. Kakao and others are reportedly expecting imminent developments in the “domestic legal and institutional environment for cryptoassets.” Since 2019, successive South Korean governments have pursued a conservative approach to crypto regulation. This has culminated in a total ban on domestic coin launches and a blanket ban on corporate crypto investment. Banks and other financial institutions have also been reduced to a peripheral role in the crypto space, despite their once-grand plans of becoming major crypto custody players. That all looks set to change after June 3’s elections, with new President Lee Jae-myun taking a decidedly progressive stance on crypto policy. One of Lee’s key manifesto pledges was the launch of a Korean won-backed stablecoin. And his government appears ready to attempt to deliver on its promise by fast-tracking a draft stablecoin bill. Businesses like Kakao appear keen to ensure they can hit the ground running if they are given the green light to enter the market. Yonhap wrote that the company is now “making advanced preparations to be able to quickly enter the sector.” Trading volumes on the Coinone crypto exchange on June 30.

These include real-time cryptoasset price checking functions and crypto wallet links. As such, Coinone wallet holders can check the balance and KRW worth of their crypto wallets directly from the Kakao Bank app interface. New functions will also indicate the book value of crypto investments, and loss or gain-related statistics. Kakao Bank said that it would continue to look for new cooperation opportunities with Coinone and look to deepen its “participation in the cryptoassets market.” In April this year, the bank added a Coinone-linked “invest in crypto” function to its banking app. Kakao Bank has an exclusive partnership deal with Coinone, meaning that all of the exchange’s customers who want to use the KRW market must open dedicated bank accounts with the financial provider. The bank may also look to expand its crypto operations overseas. It has recently secured an operating license in Thailand. Yonhap wrote: “More than 20% of the Thai population owns cryptoassets, per some estimates. That is the highest rate in the world. This could also be a good environment for Kakao Bank to consider moving into in the future.” SK Telecom’s retail partner compensation plan stirs controversy https://t.co/IMFGqfX95N — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) June 29, 2025 As discussions on crypto continue to advance in the National Assembly, share prices in both Kakao Bank and Kakao Pay continue to show growth . Toss Bank: 48 Copyright Filings The same media outlet also reported that Toss Bank wants to become a member of the Open Blockchain and DID Association (OBDIA). The OBDIA was granted permission to operate as a non-profit corporation by the Ministry of Science and ICT in 2018. But interest in the organization has revived this year after it added a dedicated stablecoin division.

For traders, the answer hinges on risk appetite—and on which catalysts are most likely to hit before the quarter ends. MAGACOIN FINANCE: High Risk, Early Traction, Serious Momentum And then there’s MAGACOIN FINANCE —the wildcard. Still in its presale phase, the project has already raised over $10 million and is steadily gaining traction among early-stage traders. It’s politically themed, community-driven, and meme-aware—but behind the branding is a solid framework that’s drawing attention for more than just narrative. With a fixed supply of 170 billion tokens, a full audit by HashEx, and no venture capital control, MAGACOIN FINANCE is structured to favor early adopters. As capital flows toward presale opportunities, this project is showing signs of real momentum—wallet growth is consistent. This isn’t a fit for every investor. But for those comfortable with early-stage volatility and looking for potential outsized gains, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a presale to watch closely in Q3. XRP: Stability Returns as Legal Fog Clears It’s been a long time coming, but XRP finally feels like it’s out of the penalty box. The SEC settlement earlier this year did more than clear the air—it unlocked XRP’s path back to serious institutional portfolios. Since then, whispers of an XRP spot ETF have grown louder, and some analysts now place the odds of approval above 80%. The coin is holding steady above key technical support, and many traders see a clean shot toward $2.80–$3.40 in the near term—possibly more if ETF headlines materialize. It’s also worth noting XRP’s inclusion in the Nasdaq Crypto Index, which has opened the door for conservative capital to flow back in. Still, it’s not without risks. Delays on the ETF front or weak broader sentiment could keep XRP stuck in consolidation. But for traders who value regulatory clarity and exposure to real-world payment utility, XRP is arguably the most “institutional-ready” bet on the board this quarter. Avalanche: Quiet Accumulation Beneath Enterprise Momentum While XRP leans into legal strength, Avalanche is drawing attention for a different reason: adoption. AVAX’s partnership with FIFA and its push into digital collectibles via a custom Layer-1 chain have put it squarely in the conversation among institutional dealmakers. Technically, AVAX is building bullish structure. Analysts are eyeing accumulation zones between $19.50 and $21, with breakout targets around $26–$35 if volume follows through. Momentum has been brewing under the surface, and traders are starting to take notice as the wider market returns to fundamentals. Of course, Avalanche still has to contend with the Layer-1 battleground—it’s not alone, and Ethereum’s shadow looms large. But in terms of risk-reward, Avalanche is shaping up as one of the stronger mid-cap plays of the quarter. Final Word: Which Lane Are You In? XRP offers clarity, stability, and solid upside—it’s the safer lane this quarter for traders prioritizing regulation and reliability. Avalanche brings a more aggressive edge, pairing enterprise adoption with strong technical patterns for those seeking momentum without venturing too far off the beaten path. MAGACOIN FINANCE is the outlier—unproven but fast-moving, and increasingly seen as the presale that could catch the next big narrative wave. The choice depends on your risk appetite. But if this market has taught traders anything, it’s that the biggest winners often come before the spotlight hits.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-next-three-months-will-be-interesting-for-xrp-heres-why/,"Despite a series of legal wins and increasing institutional interest, XRP’s price has remained largely unchanged over the past several months. Currently trading around $2.22, the asset has struggled to gain upward momentum, even as Ripple’s ongoing legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) appears to be nearing resolution. Early Gains May Have Pre-Empted Current Stagnation Vincent Van Code, a respected software engineer and well-known figure within the XRP community, offered insights into the lack of recent price movement. According to him, a significant legal milestone occurred in July 2023, when Judge Analisa Torres declared that XRP does not qualify as a security when exchanged in secondary markets. This legal clarity triggered a strong market reaction at the time, with XRP briefly reaching $3.40 in January 2025. Van Code explained that many investors anticipated the favorable ruling and positioned themselves accordingly throughout late 2024, especially following political developments that increased confidence in a forthcoming settlement. As a result, the upward momentum that would typically follow a legal victory may have been realized prematurely. The market, he suggested, had already factored in the resolution’s outcome, which explains why XRP has since fallen and remained near the $2 mark. Law is definitely a contributing factor, but I don’t see it as a major blocker for XRP or Ripple’s success. Here’s why… The case largely wrapped up back in July 2023, when Judge Torres ruled that XRP itself is not a security — at least in programmatic sales and secondary… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) June 28, 2025 Institutional Integration Seen as Key to Future Growth While the legal uncertainty has largely been addressed, Van Code believes that the primary limiting factor for XRP’s price growth is the slow implementation of real-world utility. He emphasized that broader adoption of Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service by financial institutions will be the main driver of the next price surge. He pointed out that although some institutions have publicly announced partnerships with Ripple , many are still in the early or confidential stages of integrating Ripple’s technology into their operations. In his view, enterprise deployment within regulated environments typically requires 18 to 24 months from the point of approval to full implementation. Given that many began integration processes in late 2024, Van Code suggests that the final phases of rollout are now approaching.

Rally Expected Between August and September 2025 Van Code projected that XRP could experience its next significant rally within the next two to three months, specifically pointing to the period between August and September 2025. However, he declined to offer a specific price target for the anticipated surge, citing various market dependencies that remain uncertain. XRP has shown modest movement. As of the time of reporting, it is priced at $2.22 , representing a nearly 10% gain over the past week. While optimism remains within the community, Van Code concluded that price appreciation is more likely to follow tangible adoption milestones rather than legal developments, which have already played out in the market’s valuation.

The price has managed to stabilize despite sharp intraday swings, reflecting growing tension between bullish momentum and cautious sentiment. Analysts are now calling for a decisive move, with some expecting a breakout toward higher levels, while others warn of a possible correction if key demand zones fail to hold. Related Reading: Bitcoin Struggles Below ATH After Weeks Of Failed Attempts – $109K Level In Focus On one hand, ETH has shown strength by holding above its short-term support range, suggesting that buyers are stepping in with confidence. Bullish momentum appears to be building, especially as macro sentiment around risk assets begins to recover. On the other hand, opposing views point to weakening volume and lingering macroeconomic risks, which could trigger a deeper retracement if Ethereum fails to sustain current levels. Adding weight to the bullish case is fresh data from CryptoQuant, which highlights a strong accumulation pattern among long-term ETH holders. According to the data, significant buying pressure emerged during the recent consolidation phase, with hodlers steadily increasing their positions. This divergence between price action and accumulation behavior suggests that foundational support for Ethereum remains intact, even as traders await the next major move. Ethereum Accumulation Builds And Market Awaits Breakout Ethereum is struggling to reclaim the $2,500 level, but its ability to hold steady amid ongoing market uncertainty is a sign of underlying strength. For weeks, ETH has traded within a well-defined range between $2,200 and $2,800, with neither bulls nor bears able to take decisive control. This prolonged consolidation has delayed the long-anticipated altseason, which many believe will only begin once Ethereum breaks above key resistance and pushes into higher territory. Despite the lack of clear direction, the macro setup is becoming increasingly interesting. Global markets remain volatile, with shifting interest rate expectations, geopolitical risk, and unpredictable liquidity conditions creating mixed signals across risk assets. Yet Ethereum continues to hold firm, supported not just by technical structure but also by significant long-term holder activity. According to insights from CryptoQuant, a strong accumulation pattern has been detected among Ethereum holders. During the June consolidation phase, long-term investors steadily increased their positions, even as price action remained choppy. This divergence between price and accumulation volume signals growing confidence under the surface. When price consolidates while demand builds, the result is often explosive. With ETH holding key support levels and long-term accumulation rising, the stage may be set for a major move. If Ethereum can push through $2,500 and reclaim higher ground, it could serve as the ignition point for a broader altcoin rally. Until then, the market remains in a state of quiet buildup. Something big is coming—and Ethereum is at the center of it. Related Reading: Ethereum Sees $269M In Net Inflows In 24H – Bullish Momentum Accelerates ETH Struggles With Resistance Amid Mixed Signals Ethereum is currently trading at $2,470 after failing to hold intraday gains above the $2,500 level. The 12-hour chart shows ETH consolidating within a broader range, with $2,200 acting as strong support and $2,800 as key resistance. Despite several bullish attempts, Ethereum has struggled to reclaim higher ground, and the rejection near the 100-period SMA (green line at $2,537) signals persistent selling pressure near resistance. The price is currently trading above the 200 SMA ($2,170) and just under the 50 SMA ($2,507), which now acts as a short-term resistance. This tight positioning of moving averages suggests ETH is at a decision point—either it breaks through $2,500 to target $2,600 and higher, or it risks rolling over if bulls fail to hold momentum. Related Reading: ONDO Breaks Out Of Ascending Channel – Analyst Sets $0.29 Target Volume remains relatively flat, indicating indecision. The overall structure still favors a neutral-to-bullish bias, especially if price continues to close above the 200 SMA.

Of the participants in the survey, 27% reported that they own crypto, with the average investment being around $10 million won (just shy of $7.4k), which accounts for 14% of their portfolios. Adoption is Growing The median age for the people included in this review is between 30 and 40. Men tend to be more active in the investing space, but the findings indicate that there has been a steady increase in females participating in the crypto space since about the start of 2024. The main reasons for investing tend to be psychological (FOMO), but the authors do note a shift from that tendency from 57% to 34%, as compared with previous surveys. Other data sets include new investors in the space, growth potential, and portfolio diversification. The vast majority of investors tend to be in Bitcoin (89%), but the report notes a shift to other cryptocurrencies, particularly stablecoins, as trading experience rises. A common challenge for respondents appears to be related to exchanges, as not many native banks work with them. If regulations become more favorable, “ 7 out of 10 investors will choose a residential bank, rather than a new bank with preferential benefits ”, which paints a very clear picture of current trader sentiment. The main focus around picking an exchange also seems to be centering on how easy it will be to connect to a bank, rather than other considerations such as trading volume, convenience, and user experience. Roughly 43% of the survey participants indicated high intent to continue investing in crypto assets in the future, with an additional 28% showing moderate such. About every 7 out of 10 show above-average interest. Concerns about volatility remain high (56%), as do fears of bankrupt exchanges (61%) and the risk of fraud (61%). Crypto investments would be viewed more positively if more traditional finance (TradFi) companies participated (42%) and more legal frameworks were established (35%), further data shows. Interestingly enough, about 20% of South Korean officials also hold crypto, according to another recent survey covered by CryptoPotato earlier this year. Current Crypto Landscape in Korea Along with increased public interest, officials in Korea seem to be following suit and adopting crypto more widely. Parataxis Holdings (an American investment firm) recently announced a controlling 25 billion won ($18.3M) stake in a South Korean biotech company, with plans to be the first company in the country to create a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. Additionally, the Deputy Chief of the Bank of Korea (BOK) noted that it would be “ desirable for them to start a gradual introduction to stablecoins ”. Moreover, South Korea appears to be the best-performing market in Asia currently. The benchmark Kospi Composite Index is up almost 30% this year, to a near four-year high, with some individual stocks seeing jumps of 70%-80%. This has all likely been a cascade of events following the recent election of the crypto-friendly President, Lee Jae-myung. The country has quietly become one of the most flourishing crypto markets, with a large part of the population, as noted, investing in digital assets. The country has seen some 57 trillion won ($42 billion) in stablecoin trades for this year alone, only pushing BOK to move forward with their previous plans for a won-backed stablecoin.

XMR could reach a maximum price of $1,501.34 by the end of 2028. By 2031, Monero’s price may surge to $2,445.93.

Monero price analysis 1-day chart: XMR recovers towards $320 The 24-hour XMR/USD price chart indicates a mixed market sentiment as the altcoin observes an increase of more than 65% of its value in the last few days as XMR rose from the $220 price level to the $400 mark. However, after reaching the $400 mark, the price crashed sharply to the $310 level where it hovers as the bulls fail to climb past $320 resistance. XMR Price 1-day chart The indicators reflect the decreasing bearish price sentiment, as all three major technical indicators show positive signs. The MACD is bullish at 1.00 units and shows rising bullish pressure at the current price level.

Monero price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour price chart shows that Monero rapidly recovered after the price broke down below the descending trend’s bottom line. Currently the bulls seek to cross $320. Monero price analysis 4-hour chart The RSI is at 55.51, suggesting bullish momentum as the price climbs back towards the $320 mark.

However, the sharp crash to the $320 mark suggests strong bearish pressure. As expected, the price fell below $300 but was defended well below the well enabling a swift recovery. Now the bulls seek to go higher. According to our analysis, we expect the XMR price to rise towards the $335 mark after brief consolidation below the $325 mark. However, the bulls need to breach the $320 level and establish a foothold above $318 to initiate a rally. Is Monero a good investment? Monero is an attractive investment because it emphasizes privacy and security, utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure transaction confidentiality. Its growing adoption across various use cases and a decentralized development model enhance its long-term potential. With a limited supply and increasing investor interest, Monero offers a unique opportunity for those seeking financial autonomy and privacy to invest in cryptocurrency. However, investors should remain cautious of regulatory risks and market volatility when considering Monero as part of their portfolio, making it essential to seek investment advice . Why is XMR up today? Monero rapidly recovered after the price broke down below the descending trend’s bottom line with the bulls seeking to go past $320. Will XMR recover to its all-time high? Monero is expected to recover toward its all-time high of $518 by mid-2026 as the privacy chain continues to reduce its tech debt and progresses toward greater utility and privacy. However, the platform might have to overcome regulatory scrutiny and challenges before it can see mass adoption. How much will Monero be worth in 5 years? The Monero price prediction for 2030 suggests a minimum price of $1,048.76 and an average trading price of $1,142.11 . The maximum forecasted price is set at $1,208.35. Will XMR reach $1000? The chance of Monero (XMR) hitting $1,000 hinges on various factors, which will influence its future price movements . The adoption of privacy transactions and technological advances could increase demand. Favorable regulations and market sentiment toward privacy coins would also help. Yet, regulatory risks, competition, and market volatility are challenges. $1,000 is possible with favorable conditions, especially considering the current price but market dynamics and regulations will shape its path. Does XMR have a good long-term future? Monero (XMR) has the potential for a strong long-term future due to its focus on privacy and security, which makes it attractive to users seeking anonymity. However, regulatory scrutiny and notoriety from being the favored medium for some past criminals impact the current monero sentiment, making it challenging to become the star of the market. Monero’s commitment to privacy gives it a solid foundation for long-term growth, but it must carefully navigate market and regulatory landscapes.

Monero historic price sentiment Monero’s market value has changed dramatically since its launch in 2014, from less than $1 to over $475. May 2021 marked the highest point in Monero’s history. Monero’s price projections revealed the coin’s security. They provide investors with optimism that they will be freed from the persecution of some authorities simply by buying or selling Monero. Monero price history; Source: Coinmarketcap Across 2023, Monero’s price rose by 11.49%. The highest price was $278.56, and the lowest was $114.16. In January 2024, Monero stayed stable around the $150.00 mark as market momentum remained low. However, the stability was short-lived as February crashed to $101.95. However, XMR showed swift recovery as it closed the month near the $150.00 level again. In March and April 2024, XMR saw a steady decline from $150.00 to $120.00, where it found key support. In May 2024, XMR observed steady bullish pressure as the price rose from $120.00, approaching resistance at $150. In June 2024, Monero (XMR) traded within the $150 – $175 price range as either side struggled to make a clear breakthrough. In July, the crypto traded around the $155 mark as the price volatility remained relatively low. XMR opened trading at $156.05 in August and ended the month at $176.00, making remarkable gains. September was bearish for the asset, as the price declined below the $160 mark by the end of the month. In October, Monero observed a steep crash and has been making a swift recovery since then. In December, Monero made remarkable strides as the asset’s price broke past the $220 mark, albeit briefly as it closed the month below $200. In January, Monero saw a bullish January as the price rose from below the $200 mark to $238 by the end of the month. In February, the price fell towards the $215 mark as bears dominate the markets. In March, the price observes mixed momentum and closed the month slightly below $215. In April the consolidation continued until late into the month when it spiked past the $325 mark before ending the month around $275. In May the price continued rising rapidly as the bulls cruised past $300 ending the month around $320.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,XMR|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|FORKS|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-30 23:59:00

One side is packed with coins that move fast on hype. The other builds slowly but strongly with use cases. Some coins rise quickly and vanish just as fast. Others create a structure that lasts beyond market buzz. This guide looks at four cryptos that seem ready for serious growth. Each one brings something unique to the table. BlockDAG leads with its real-world tasks and reward-based setup. The rest show different strengths. Here’s how they compare and why they are worth a deeper look. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Purpose-Powered Airdrop Structure BlockDAG stands at the top of the highest potential crypto list by tying rewards to real user effort. Instead of easy airdrops that only ask for a click or repost, BlockDAG’s 100 million BDAG drop covers four areas: Testnet use, Presale buys, Social content, and Referrals. This system rewards actions that help the network. This setup boosts early user interest while backing up the project with tools and real tech. It supports wallet testing, smart contract tasks, and the use of mining gear like the X10, X30, and X100. The numbers show traction. BlockDAG (BDAG) has collected $326 million in presale, with 23.4 billion coins sold. Now in batch 29, BDAG price fixed at $0.0016 until the BlockDAG GLOBAL LAUNCH release. Growth here is about real action. The X1 app is already in millions of hands. Airdrop rewards are shaped to reach those doing the work, not bots. By turning effort into access, BlockDAG shows a different way to grow a blockchain. It’s a model that asks more but gives more in return. 2. Aptos (APT): Built for Speed with Meta Roots Aptos secures its position on this list thanks to its high-speed Layer 1 design, created by former Meta engineers. Using the Move programming language, it delivers fast parallel execution and high throughput, which is crucial for applications needing real-time performance. The team’s background gives it weight, as Aptos carries forward ideas once part of Meta’s Diem initiative. Its price has seen ups and downs, but the developer interest around it keeps growing. DeFi and gaming projects are finding their way onto Aptos, signalling expanding adoption. If its technical edge matches broader demand, the upside could be substantial. Still, unlike BlockDAG, Aptos does not have user-based contribution rewards, which could slow early engagement at the community level. 3. Arbitrum (ARB): Fueling Ethereum’s Scalable Future Arbitrum emerges as one of Ethereum’s most effective Layer 2 scaling tools. By cutting gas fees and speeding up transactions, it has already drawn in top DeFi players like GMX and Radiant Capital. The 2023 ARB airdrop created major attention, and the network remains active through DAO votes and ongoing ecosystem support. Ethereum’s long-term plans support its place among the highest potential crypto projects. As Ethereum works toward better scalability, Arbitrum continues to benefit. Though it does not feature mining gear or testnet engagement rewards like BlockDAG, its real-world use in easing Ethereum congestion makes it hard to overlook. For those focused on ETH-based growth, ARB stays relevant. 4. Render (RNDR): Powering AI with Shared GPUs Render is carving a space in decentralised computing by offering GPU power for 3D rendering and AI processing. It connects people needing computing power with those who have unused GPU capacity, forming a peer-to-peer market that supports heavy digital tasks. This becomes more critical as the demand for creative AI tools continues to grow. Its network has seen support from well-known media and design firms, putting it in a strong position as AI and metaverse needs rise. RNDR is used within the network for settling tasks. Although price swings have occurred, it has built a solid community and maintained steady traction. Beyond Speculation Lies Real Growth In reviewing the highest potential crypto options, it helps to filter out the noise and look for actual user impact. BlockDAG separates itself by linking its coin distribution to actions that help build and test its systems. Its mix of hardware integration, mobile mining, and a testnet ready for EVM makes it a standout project even before launch. APT, ARB, and RNDR each deliver powerful tools of their own, whether through speed, scaling, or compute sharing. Still, none blend real-world tools, grassroots contribution, and broad developer engagement like BlockDAG does. For those watching for long-term expansion supported by user effort and working products, BDAG stands at the front of the pack.

With key regulatory breakthroughs, ETF momentum, and institutional interest all aligning, these altcoins are shaping up as leading plays for the months ahead. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Emerging Giant That’s Already Drawing Insider Attention Beyond the major market names, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing increased attention from crypto analysts and high-volume traders. While it entered the conversation as a meme-driven project, its momentum and structure now place it firmly in the conversation for 2025’s top emerging tokens. With a capped token supply, a fully audited smart contract by HashEx, and a branding strategy that breaks through typical crypto noise, MAGACOIN FINANCE is already turning heads among crypto insiders. The project’s scarcity-focused model and aggressive ecosystem alignment are fueling speculation that it may become a top performer — particularly among those seeking high-conviction alternatives outside of legacy altcoins. XRP: Legal Clarity and ETF Optimism Shift the Narrative Ripple’s multi-year legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officially ended in June, marking a major win for XRP. Ripple agreed to pay a $50 million fine, while $75 million will be returned from escrow. With both parties seeking to lift restrictions on Ripple’s operations, the decision is seen as a catalyst for broader market confidence. ETF developments are adding fuel to XRP’s resurgence. Three futures-based XRP ETFs have been approved and are set to launch under ProShares Trust. CME Group is also preparing to list XRP futures contracts, further legitimizing XRP as a regulated asset class. With a spot ETF approval now seen as having an 85% chance, XRP is positioned for wider institutional adoption. XRP has rallied nearly 30% from its four-month low of $1.61, recently trading between $2.15 and $2.36. A move past key resistance at $2.40, $2.61, and $3.00 could open the door to $3.74 or even higher. Some analysts cite cycle targets as high as $19.27–$50, referencing technical echoes of the 2017 rally. Solana: ETF Race and Institutional Flow Signal Strength Solana is rapidly gaining favor among institutions, with nine separate ETF filings now on the table in the U.S. Invesco Galaxy’s latest application adds to a growing belief that altcoin ETFs — led by SOL — are likely to be greenlit in 2025. Bloomberg analysts peg approval odds above 90%, citing broad interest in Bitcoin alternatives. SOL has held firm around $144–$147 after rebounding from lows near $126. A bullish reversal pattern is building above $142.65, with potential upside toward $168 in Q3. Long-term projections range from $230 to $290 by year-end, backed by surging DeFi and gaming activity on the Solana network and record-high CME futures volumes. Ethereum: Rebound Potential Amid Whale Activity Despite a rocky June, Ethereum remains a cornerstone of market sentiment. ETH dropped over 20% during the month, mirroring past bearish patterns, but recent whale accumulation — over $1 billion worth — has renewed confidence in a rebound. Ethereum is currently trading around $2,400. However, a bullish “Head and Shoulders bottom” around $2,330 could trigger a trend reversal, with analysts eyeing $2,774 to $2,906 for July. If key resistance levels are broken, targets as high as $5,925 are on the table. Combined with record-staking volumes and consistent network strength, Ethereum remains a long-term favorite. Altcoins to Watch This Quarter As macroeconomic pressures continue to shape global markets, XRP, Solana, and Ethereum are showing signs of renewed strength heading into Q3 2025. But it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE that’s commanding attention from high-volume buyers looking for exponential upside. Every chart, every signal, and every presale surge points in one direction: this cycle’s biggest breakout altcoin may already be here.

He urged investors to stay committed and prepare for what he described as an upcoming phase of extraordinary financial opportunity, especially for those who have held onto their tokens through the market’s volatility. Wealth for Committed XRP Investors In a recent post shared on X, Coach JV predicted that individuals who have continued to hold XRP through uncertain times may eventually experience a level of financial growth that will be difficult to fully grasp. His message aligns with ongoing optimism within the XRP community regarding the token’s long-term potential and its anticipated role in reshaping the global financial system. While XRP currently trades around $2, some investors maintain expectations that its price could surge far beyond that mark. This sentiment is particularly strong among long-term holders who believe XRP could one day achieve valuations that would significantly alter their financial circumstances. There will come a moment when XRP holders who held the line won’t be able to comprehend the wealth they’ve stepped into. But don’t just wait for that day, build empires on the way there. We weren’t meant to wait for saviors. We were meant to be the builders. — Coach, JV (@Coachjv_) June 29, 2025 Ownership Distribution and Wealth Projections Recent data reveals that out of approximately 6.61 million XRP wallets, the overwhelming majority are controlled by retail holders with relatively small balances. Specifically, around 5.36 million wallets hold 500 XRP or less. Another 1.1 million wallets hold between 500 and 25,000 XRP tokens. Considering this distribution, community members frequently discuss hypothetical future valuations. For instance, if XRP were to reach $100 per token, an investor with 25,000 tokens would possess assets worth $2.5 million. However, for the majority with less than 500 XRP, even a $100 valuation might not yield transformative wealth. To address this, some community influencers have promoted forecasts suggesting XRP could climb to $1,000 or even $10,000 per coin, predictions that, if realized, would generate substantial wealth even for small holders. However, such estimates often raise questions about feasibility, especially regarding the required market capitalization and liquidity to support those price levels. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Coach JV also emphasized the importance of more than just passive investment. He encouraged XRP holders to take initiative and build value in the ecosystem. According to him, the community should not simply wait for gains but instead use this time to develop businesses, create educational resources, or contribute to the growing XRP infrastructure. His remarks suggest that success in the crypto space is not limited to price appreciation alone. Long-term investors are urged to seize opportunities for innovation, entrepreneurship, and real-world utility around XRP as the ecosystem matures. Broader Sentiment Within the XRP Community Coach JV’s remarks align with views shared by other XRP influencers. Edo Farina of Alpha Lions Academy recently suggested that holding 10,000 XRP could provide a pathway to significant financial independence. Another figure in the community stated that even 1,000 XRP might be enough to achieve a comfortable lifestyle within the next few years, depending on future market trends. As XRP continues to trade in a relatively stable range, community leaders remain focused on encouraging resilience and proactive involvement among holders.

Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 321,400 followers on the social media platform X that he’s now bullish on the native asset of the layer-1 protocol after moving above a diagonal resistance that has kept SOL bearish since late May. The trader thinks that Solana and other coins operating on its network will witness rallies this week, at the very least. “Nice downtrend break on SOL overnight, I think we’re in for a good week [this] week. SOL ecosystem [coins] also starting to perk up and look real good again. I think we’re back, baby.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, SOL is worth $152. One Solana coin that’s on the trader’s radar is the non-fungible token (NFT) project Pudgy Penguins ( PENGU ). According to the analyst, PENGU looks primed to surge after breaking out from a falling wedge structure, which is a bullish reversal pattern. “Absolute monster breakout on PENGU here overnight. Absolutely amazing chart here and will go much higher, in my opinion. Looking like a standout leader, also never had a proper price discovery run yet, so expecting this one to be a banger.” Source: Bluntz/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that PENGU will hit $0.025. At time of writing, PENGU is worth $0.014, up over 6% in the past day. As Bluntz flips bullish on Solana and PENGU, he is also hinting that altcoins are on the verge of outperforming Bitcoin ( BTC ). The trader shares the Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) chart, which tracks how much of the crypto market cap belongs to BTC. Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that BTC.D is flashing a bearish divergence on the three-day chart, suggesting that a bearish reversal is in play. A bearish BTC.D chart indicates that altcoins are gaining value faster than Bitcoin. Says Bluntz, “BTC.D presented without comment.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, BTC.D is trading at 65.45%.

Avery will collaborate with other leaders from Web3 and financial services to help shape digital asset regulations. pic.twitter.com/3j3toG65Mg — Aptos (@Aptos) June 30, 2025 According to the CFTC’s website , the subcommittee concerns itself with “issues that affect the integrity and competitiveness of U.S. markets and U.S. firms engaged in global business, including the regulatory challenges of a global marketplace.” “Avery will collaborate with other leaders from Web3 and financial services to help shape digital asset regulations,” the Monday social media post from Aptos Labs reads. Other members of the subcommittee include Capitoliis CEO Gil Mandelzis, Cargill Global Derivatives Operations Director Samina Anwar, and Uniswap Labs Chief Operating Officer Mary-Catherine Lader. CFTC Faces Staffing Shakeups News of Ching’s CFTC placement comes as the federal regulator navigates changes to crypto regulation under the new Trump administration. Four CFTC commissioners have decided to step down from their roles in recent months, with former commissioner Summer Mersinger leaving her position at the agency to begin her tenure as Blockchain Association CEO earlier this month. “There’s a growing crypto caucus in Congress, we have an executive branch that sees the inherent benefits of digital assets, and our regulatory agencies have turned the page from antagonism to collaboration,” Mersinger said in a June 2 X post. “We need to capture this moment and push pro-crypto policy across the finish line,” she added. Commissioner Caroline Pham is set to leave her position when Trump’s pick to lead the CFTC, Brian Quintenz, is appointed to his role, though a set date has yet to be confirmed. Quintenz previously spearheaded the CFTC from August 2017 through August 2021, with now former commissioner Kristin M. Johnson taking over his role in March 2022.

Solana and XRP have both remained major players in the current cycle, but growing investor attention is turning toward emerging presale projects — especially MAGACOIN FINANCE. Its early performance and structural appeal have positioned it as a compelling opportunity for those seeking high-return setups before the next market expansion. MAGACOIN FINANCE Captures Momentum from Early Adopters MAGACOIN FINANCE has experienced a surge of interest, with every presale round reportedly closing rapidly. This momentum stems from a mix of narrative strength and market fundamentals. The project is structured to reward early entry, with scarcity mechanics and a firm cap that align with long-hold accumulation strategies favored by strategic investors. Its smart contract audit and focus on stability and resistance to inflation have also helped set it apart in the eyes of capital allocators who are looking for more than short-term speculation. The token’s structural blueprint reflects long-term thinking — a key reason why both institutional and retail investors are quietly adding MAGACOIN FINANCE to their 2025 watchlists. Why Solana and XRP Holders Are Exploring New Frontiers Solana has attracted significant attention for its fast, low-fee infrastructure and increasing DeFi adoption. Similarly, XRP continues to ride institutional momentum, especially amid renewed discussions around mainstream crypto integration. Yet for many traders, the most substantial gains often come from positioning before a token becomes a household name. That’s driving capital rotation into strategic presales — with MAGACOIN FINANCE leading the charge. Investors who’ve seen the long-term performance of Solana and XRP recognize that early-stage exposure is often where wealth is made. Strategic Positioning in a Shifting Market As market cycles evolve, timing becomes everything. Investors are not only looking for the next Solana or XRP, but also for projects that offer better positioning ahead of their breakout moment. MAGACOIN FINANCE has become a focal point for those seeking to diversify outside the high-cap arena without sacrificing quality or potential upside. The presale has already delivered strong paper returns for early participants, with analysts calling it one of the most asymmetric setups of the year. The fact that previous stages sold out instantly adds an additional layer of urgency for new investors tracking performance indicators and growth velocity. What Analysts Are Saying About MAGACOIN FINANCE Crypto analysts are increasingly naming MAGACOIN FINANCE in 2025 forecasts — highlighting its potential to deliver outsized ROI compared to many listed assets. Its political and cultural alignment with the 2025 macro environment is also adding fuel to long-term projections. From early-stage momentum to reinforced token mechanics, the project checks several boxes for investors seeking undervalued high-upside entries. Analysts also note that its listing plans could open up the next leg of growth — one that favors those already positioned during the presale phase. Final Thoughts As capital shifts from post-peak assets to early-stage opportunities, MAGACOIN FINANCE is proving to be more than a speculative play. It represents a calculated move for investors aiming to enter before the crowd. For Solana and XRP holders, the move into MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t about abandoning their core holdings — it’s about amplifying potential returns by allocating to a project with real structural upside before it hits major listings.

GameFi tokens, with sky-high valuations divorced from current user numbers or revenues, embody this optimism perfectly — as CoinDesk investigated in 2022 , Decentraland's then billion-dollar market cap didn't quite match the number of active players on the platform. But, surprisingly, distributed compute tokens don't seem to enjoy the same speculative premium even when compared to their Traditional Finance traded peers like CoreWeave (CRWV). CoinMarketCap says the category of tokens for decentralized networks that provide GPU power for AI and other compute workloads, which includes well-known tokens like BitTensor, Aethir, and Render, is worth $12 billion. At the same time, market data from research group MarketsandMarkets puts the value of the GPU as a service industry at around $8 billion this year, growing to $26 billion in 2030. In contrast, CRWV closed Monday in New York at $163, putting its market cap at $79.2 billion. The company’s recent earnings forecast up to $5.1 billion in 2025 revenue, suggesting it trades at more than 15 times forward sales. That kind of multiple might be justified in a high-growth environment, but CoreWeave also posted a $314.6 million net loss in the first quarter , driven in part by stock-based compensation and continued infrastructure buildout. Despite this, investors continue to reward CoreWeave for its dominant position in centralized AI infrastructure with its stock up 300% year-to-date. The company is tightly integrated with Nvidia and has high visibility through contracts with OpenAI and other enterprise clients. Meanwhile, decentralized compute networks are delivering similar services— AI inference, rendering, and compute power — without needing to raise billions in debt or equity as they act as a broker connecting existing GPUs to users, saving the capital expenditure of buying their own server farms. These are not theoretical networks. They are functional systems already processing real workloads, and the brokerage model works for customers. Yet their collective market value remains a fraction of CoreWeave’s. Certainly, they don't have the same level of workload running through their networks, but the gap is striking. While the market treats GameFi with irrational exuberance, distributed compute tokens may be suffering from the opposite problem. Despite addressing the same market need as CoreWeave, and in some ways offering a more capital-efficient and globally scalable model without the eye-watering CapEx, they remain modestly valued. Justin Sun-Backed SRM Entertainment Announces $100 Million TRX Staking Move SRM Entertainment (Nasdaq: SRM), soon to rebrand as TRON Inc. , has staked its entire treasury of 365 million TRX tokens through JustLend, a move that could yield an annual return of up to 10%, according to a release. The move comes on the heels of a $100 million investment round closed earlier this month to fund what the company calls a “TRON treasury strategy,” essentially, a public market vehicle modeled on bitcoin-holding firms like MicroStrategy, but for TRX. That structure provides equity investors with indirect exposure to a network that plays a dominant role in USDT stablecoin settlement, particularly in the Global South, where TRON-based Tether serves as a dollar lifeline – arguably a ' Visa IPO ' moment for the region's economy. Sogni AI Debuts Mainnet, SOGNI Token to List on Kraken, MEXC, Gate.io Sogni AI, a decentralized platform for generative AI workflows, has launched its mainnet and will list its native token, SOGNI, on Kraken, MEXC, and Gate.io . SOGNI is the utility token of the Sogni Supernet. It is used for compute payments, staking, governance, and access to advanced application features. The mainnet launch includes deployments on Base, an Ethereum Layer-2 developed by Coinbase, and Etherlink, a Tezos-based EVM-compatible Layer-2 using Smart Rollups. In a release, the platform said this chain-agnostic approach is designed to balance scalability and accessibility. The project’s stated goal is to create an open and economically sustainable environment for creative AI applications, combining Web3 infrastructure with user tools that resemble Web2 services in usability. The platform also uses a non-transferable credit system called Spark Points, which are fixed-value rendering credits that can be purchased or earned within the Sogni ecosystem. Users interact with the network through three core applications: Sogni Web, Sogni Pocket, and Sogni Studio. Creators submit generative AI jobs, while node operators, or “Workers,” provide GPU resources and are compensated in SOGNI tokens.

VC Firm Says XRP Could Reach Nearly $9,000 In Just 5 Years",https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/insane-or-insightful-vc-firm-says-xrp-could-reach-nearly-9000-in-just-5-years/,"US regulators and market watchers are eyeing a fresh valuation study that puts XRP on track for a dramatic price surge by 2030. Related Reading: The $100K Mirage: Bitcoin’s Rally Not Backed By On-Chain Strength According to Valhil Capital’s deep‑dive report, XRP could climb from its current price into a range between $4,813 and $9,000 in just five years. That forecast hinges on a model that treats XRP not only as a quick way to move money but also as a store of value. Model Weighs Store Of Value According to the Athey & Mitchnick Model used by Valhil Capital, XRP’s role goes way beyond sending payments. The study gives much more weight to people holding XRP like they would gold. In their view, as more folks start treating XRP as a place to park money, fewer coins stay in circulation. That tight supply pushes the price higher. The model blends economic ideas, real‑world trends, and crypto market moves to arrive at its numbers. Key Figures Drive Forecast Based on reports, the model assumes daily transactions on XRP Ledger will hit $700 billion by 2030. It uses a one‑second transaction speed and the current 56.5 billion XRP supply. With a 10% discount rate and a five‑year adoption window, the study pegs a mid‑case price of $4,813 if about 10% of global payments run on XRPL. In a more bullish view, the researchers push store‑of‑value demand to $1 quadrillion, which shoots the price beyond $9,000. Even a $100 trillion demand level would land XRP at $908 per token. Virtuous Cycle Could Fuel Growth Based on reports from Valhil Capital, the so‑called Virtuous Cycle Flywheel could spark a feedback loop. First, higher use of XRP for cross‑border payments and FX trades drives up demand. Then, price gains lure more holders to lock away their coins, shrinking the free float. That scarcity pushes prices even higher. As value climbs, new use cases could pop up, drawing in more users and adding another spin to the cycle. Regulation And Competition Loom Large XRP’s path to mass use isn’t smooth. Legal questions still swirl around its status in the US and elsewhere. That uncertainty may scare off big financial players. Plus, central bank digital currencies, stablecoins, and rival blockchains are all chasing the same slice of the cross‑border market.

MAGACOIN FINANCE Presale Now on Radar of XRP and Dogecoin Investors,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/which-crypto-will-go-up-next-magacoin-finance-presale-now-on-radar-of-xrp-and-dogecoin-investors/,"A quiet reshuffle is happening in crypto—one that’s catching even seasoned investors off guard. While XRP and Dogecoin remain cornerstones of the altcoin conversation, momentum is rapidly shifting to something far earlier, far riskier, and—according to top analysts—far more rewarding. That token is MAGACOIN FINANCE. With over $10 million raised in a matter of weeks and each presale phase closing faster than the last, this meme-infused political crypto is capturing the kind of early-stage attention last seen in the early days of Shiba Inu and PEPE. For investors who missed those once-in-a-cycle runs, MAGACOIN FINANCE is starting to look like a rare second chance. Presale Frenzy, Cultural Punch, and a Window That’s Closing Presales don’t usually move this fast. MAGACOIN FINANCE ’s early raise already surpassed $10 million, and analysts say it’s still gaining speed. Once the presale completes and this token hits major listings, the price action could flip overnight—leaving latecomers behind. Its 170 billion token cap, audited smart contracts, and 100% community distribution model give it the backbone most meme coins lack. But it’s the branding—a fiery mix of politics, memes, and retail rebellion—that’s sending it viral. This isn’t just another Doge clone. It’s a movement. Investors are comparing its setup to the early launch windows of coins that now sit in the top 20 by market cap. But unlike those plays, MAGACOIN FINANCE still trades for fractions of a cent. The difference? This time, the crowd knows what’s coming. Why XRP and Dogecoin Holders Are Jumping Ship The shift isn’t random. XRP may finally be breathing easier post-SEC turmoil, but its path forward is now defined by modest, institutional-paced growth. That might be fine for hedge funds, but it’s leaving retail investors hungry for the kind of upside that built XRP’s early cult following. Dogecoin, meanwhile, still rides waves of Elon Musk tweets and meme culture, but its unlimited supply and stalled development have dulled its edge. Many of its biggest holders are sitting on gains—but also wondering what comes next. That’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE comes in. It offers the meme energy of DOGE and the early-mover appeal XRP once had—backed by real tokenomics, capped supply, and a narrative that’s catching fire across crypto Twitter. Presale projections ranging from 2,500% to 18,500% are fueling a fresh wave of speculation, and XRP and DOGE holders are among the first to take notice. The Clock Is Ticking—and Analysts Are Loud About It The analysts aren’t whispering. They’re naming MAGACOIN FINANCE in the same breath as the biggest altcoin launches of the past cycle. But what’s different is the structure: clean tokenomics, staking utility (planned), referral rewards, and a roadmap that doesn’t rely on luck or celebrity. It’s the kind of play that rewards speed. Getting in now—before listings, before mainstream exposure, before influencers and funds pile in—is the difference between catching the wave and watching it crash from the sidelines. MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t just another speculative punt. It’s shaping up to be the token retail traders rally around in 2025—the one they brag about months from now when prices are up 10x, 20x, or more. For XRP and Dogecoin holders feeling the itch for something faster, riskier, and potentially far more lucrative, this may be the clearest signal they’ve had all year.

This substantial investment paves the way for Datagram to launch its very own sovereign Layer-1 (L1) blockchain directly on the robust Avalanche (AVAX) platform. This development is not just another funding round; it’s a powerful signal of innovation, promising to bring advanced AI capabilities to the foundational layers of blockchain technology. What Does This Pre-Seed Funding Mean for Datagram? The recent injection of $4 million in pre-seed funding is a pivotal moment for Datagram. This crucial capital, spearheaded by Blizzard the Avalanche Fund – a venture fund specifically dedicated to supporting projects within the Avalanche ecosystem – underscores the confidence in Datagram’s vision and technological prowess. For a project at the pre-seed stage, securing such a substantial amount is a testament to its potential and the market’s growing appetite for innovative blockchain solutions. So, what exactly will this funding fuel? The primary objectives are clear and critical for Datagram’s future: Real-time Performance Optimization: At the core of any high-performing blockchain is its ability to handle transactions and data efficiently. The funds will be instrumental in fine-tuning Datagram’s network to ensure seamless, real-time operations, a necessity for AI-driven applications that demand instantaneous processing. Network Deployment: From smart contract development to infrastructure setup, deploying a new Layer-1 blockchain is a complex undertaking. The funding will facilitate the comprehensive technical deployment required to bring Datagram’s vision to life on the Avalanche network. Upcoming Node Sale: A decentralized network relies on a robust set of validators or nodes. Part of the funding will support the organization and execution of Datagram’s highly anticipated node sale, inviting community participation and strengthening the network’s decentralization. Mainnet Launch: The ultimate goal is the successful launch of Datagram’s mainnet. This funding provides the necessary runway to reach this critical milestone, enabling the network to go live and begin processing real-world transactions and AI operations. This early-stage funding is more than just money; it’s a strategic partnership that connects Datagram directly with the Avalanche ecosystem, offering not just financial backing but also invaluable technical and strategic support from a major player in the blockchain space. Why Avalanche? The Power of an Avalanche L1 Ecosystem Datagram’s decision to launch its sovereign Layer-1 blockchain on Avalanche is a strategic masterstroke, leveraging the unique capabilities of the Avalanche platform. Avalanche is renowned for its innovative Subnet architecture, which allows developers to launch custom, application-specific blockchains with tailored functionalities. This is precisely where Datagram finds its perfect home. Here’s why Avalanche stands out as the ideal launchpad for Datagram’s L1: Scalability and Throughput: Avalanche’s architecture is designed for high transaction throughput and rapid finality, crucial for an AI-driven network that might process vast amounts of data and complex computations. Customizability (Subnets): The Subnet model allows Datagram to create its own sovereign blockchain with custom rules, tokenomics, and even virtual machines, optimized specifically for its AI applications. This means Datagram can dictate its own gas fees, define its own security model, and control its network parameters without being constrained by the main Avalanche C-chain. Interoperability: While sovereign, Datagram’s L1 will benefit from seamless interoperability with the broader Avalanche ecosystem and potentially other blockchains, fostering a more connected and efficient decentralized landscape. Developer-Friendly Environment: Avalanche offers an EVM-compatible environment, making it easier for developers familiar with Ethereum to build and deploy on its network, accelerating Datagram’s development timeline. Strong Community and Funding Support: The backing from Blizzard the Avalanche Fund is a clear indicator of the strong support system available for projects building within the Avalanche ecosystem. By building an Avalanche L1 , Datagram gains the best of both worlds: the independence and customization of a sovereign chain, coupled with the security, scalability, and robust infrastructure of the Avalanche network. Datagram’s Vision: Pioneering an AI Blockchain Future The most intriguing aspect of Datagram is its core identity as an “ AI-driven network project .” This positions it at the forefront of a burgeoning trend: the integration of artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. While AI and blockchain often operate in separate spheres, their convergence holds immense promise for solving complex problems and creating novel applications. How might Datagram’s AI integration manifest on its new Layer-1 blockchain? Decentralized AI Models: Datagram could enable the training, deployment, and verification of AI models in a decentralized manner, ensuring transparency, immutability, and resistance to censorship. Automated Network Optimization: AI could be used to autonomously manage and optimize the blockchain’s performance, resource allocation, and security protocols in real-time, leading to a more efficient and resilient network. Data Integrity and Verification: For AI models that rely on vast datasets, blockchain can provide an immutable ledger for data provenance and integrity, ensuring that AI models are trained on verifiable and untampered information. Smart Contract Enhancement: AI could potentially enhance smart contract capabilities, enabling more complex, adaptive, and intelligent automated agreements that respond to real-world data and events. New DApp Categories: The fusion of AI and blockchain could unlock entirely new categories of decentralized applications (dApps), from AI-powered prediction markets to autonomous decentralized organizations (DAOs) with intelligent decision-making capabilities. The challenge for any AI blockchain project lies in bridging the computational intensity of AI with the distributed nature of blockchain. Datagram’s approach to building a sovereign L1 on Avalanche suggests a design focused on optimizing this delicate balance, potentially by offloading heavy AI computations while leveraging the blockchain for verification, consensus, and data integrity. Understanding the Layer-1 Blockchain Landscape For those new to the space, a Layer-1 blockchain refers to the base protocol of a blockchain network – the fundamental architecture upon which other applications and scaling solutions (Layer-2s) are built. Bitcoin and Ethereum are prime examples of Layer-1 blockchains. They handle core functionalities like transaction validation, consensus mechanisms, and network security. The emergence of new Layer-1 blockchains like Datagram’s, particularly on platforms like Avalanche, signifies a continuous evolution in the blockchain landscape. While some might question the need for yet another L1, the trend towards application-specific blockchains (often enabled by Subnets or similar technologies) highlights a critical need for specialized environments. These tailored L1s can: Offer Niche Optimizations: Datagram’s L1 is designed specifically for AI applications, meaning it can be optimized for the unique demands of AI, which generic L1s might not fully support. Provide Economic Sovereignty: A sovereign L1 allows Datagram to control its own fee structure, potentially offering more predictable and lower transaction costs for its users, free from the congestion and fluctuating fees of larger L1s. Ensure Security and Control: By operating its own L1, Datagram has greater control over its security parameters and governance model, ensuring that the network evolves in line with its core mission. Datagram’s choice to build a new Layer-1 blockchain on Avalanche is a strategic decision aimed at creating an optimal environment for its unique AI-driven functionalities, rather than merely adding another general-purpose chain to the mix. Looking Ahead: Datagram’s Node Sale and Mainnet Launch The funding announcement is merely the first step in Datagram’s ambitious roadmap. The immediate future holds two significant milestones: the node sale and the mainnet launch. These events are crucial for the decentralization, security, and operationalization of the Datagram network. The Node Sale: This will be an opportunity for individuals and entities to acquire and operate validator nodes on the Datagram network. Participating in a node sale typically involves staking a certain amount of the native token, contributing to the network’s security and earning rewards for validating transactions. It’s a key mechanism for distributing control and fostering a decentralized community. For those interested in supporting and participating in the foundational layer of an AI-driven blockchain, this will be a critical event to watch. The Mainnet Launch: This is the moment when the Datagram blockchain officially goes live, transitioning from a test environment to a fully operational network. Upon mainnet launch, real transactions will be processed, dApps can be deployed, and the full vision of Datagram’s AI capabilities will begin to unfold. This marks the true beginning of Datagram’s journey as a live, functional blockchain. As Datagram moves closer to these milestones, potential users, developers, and investors should closely monitor official announcements for details regarding participation in the node sale and the specific features and functionalities that will be available upon mainnet launch. This is an exciting time for innovation in the blockchain and AI convergence space. Conclusion: A Powerful New Era for AI and Blockchain Datagram’s successful $4 million pre-seed funding round and its commitment to launching a sovereign Layer-1 blockchain on Avalanche represent a significant leap forward in the quest to merge artificial intelligence with decentralized technologies. By building an optimized Avalanche L1 specifically for its needs, Datagram is poised to unlock new possibilities for an AI blockchain future, offering a robust, scalable, and customizable platform for AI-driven applications. This venture not only strengthens the Avalanche ecosystem but also pushes the boundaries of what’s possible when cutting-edge AI meets the power of decentralized networks. The upcoming node sale and mainnet launch are eagerly anticipated events that could usher in a new era of intelligent, autonomous, and transparent digital interactions.

Lummis highlights a remedy for miners and stakers’ taxation,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/sen-lummis-pushes-to-fix-unfair-tax-rules/,"The crypto industry supporters are backing Senator Cynthia Lummis’ amendment to include digital asset tax changes in the “big, beautiful bill.” While senators consider passage of the more than 1,000-page reconciliation bill , the crypto-friendly Wyoming Republican is advocating for adding some provisions to address “unfair tax treatment” of crypto. In an X post , Lummis highlighted that for a long time, miners and stakers have faced double taxation . She added that they get taxed once when they earn block rewards and again when they sell them. According to Lummis, the remedy for this is to end this unfair tax policy and make sure the US becomes the leading power in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Sen. Lummis highlights a remedy for miners and stakers’ taxation A one-pager from Sen. Lummis’ office, obtained by reporters, hinted that the provisions would establish a de minimis exemption with a threshold of $300. It includes language about how miners and stakers are required to pay taxes. According to the briefing, the goal is to match the taxes on mining and staking rewards with when people actually gain economic benefits, instead of making them report based on changing and often unclear market values when they receive them, the document stated. Additionally, it highlighted that this method helps avoid cash flow issues where taxpayers have to pay taxes on assets they have not sold and might find it hard to turn into cash. In the meantime, some in the industry needed people to call lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune, and express their support. In addition, various crypto advocacy groups have been lobbying for tax changes on crypto and, most importantly, pushing for a de minimis exemption. Matthew Pines, a Bitcoin Policy Institute Executive Director, offered his opinion. In an X post, Pines noted that the Congress is currently drafting the Senate reconciliation bill and that a particular Bitcoin de minimis tax exemption is at stake. “Please take five minutes today to call or email your elected officials — especially Senator Mike Crapo (R-ID), the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee — and ask them to support this commonsense fix,” he added. Kristin Smith, the president of the Solana Policy Institute, also expressed her support. According to Smith, fair tax rules for staking are essential for the US to lead in crypto. She also emphasized that Congress can boost local growth and create jobs by clarifying stakeholder tax rules. However, it is unclear whether Lummis’ amendment can find its way into the “big, beautiful bill.” Several foreign investors intend to shift from the US Treasuries amid increased inflation The Senate is currently voting on several proposed amendments, and President Trump is demanding that the Republicans get the bill through by Friday this week, according to reports from sources. The bill must still clear the House before landing on Trump’s desk. As the bill moves through the US Senate, more foreign investors are looking to shift away from the US Treasuries, which are losing their appeal due to concerns about deficit spending and tariffs that could increase inflation. President Donald Trump’s large tax cut and big spending measures will ramp up US debt by $3.3 trillion, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated, as runaway deficits and sweeping debt led Moody’s to cut its credit rating in May. Toshinobu Chiba, who manages rates and credit funds at Simplex Asset Management in Tokyo, stated that he was definitely worried about the growing fiscal deficit. Chiba mentioned that he has been using futures to move away from the US Treasuries and invest in European debt. He then revealed plans to switch to the cash bond market once Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” is approved and inflation expectations rise. He anticipates that the first choices should be in Europe, especially the bunds and French bonds, adding that Australia and Singapore are also options for global investors.

Just a couple of days ago, Amazon lost a key vice president helping oversee generative artificial intelligence development and the company’s Bedrock service, as the competition for talent heats up. Vasi Philomin said that he left Amazon for another company, without providing specifics. A company spokesperson confirmed that Philomin had recently left after eight years with Amazon. Philomin helped lead generative AI efforts and product strategy, and oversaw foundation models known as Amazon Titan. Reports indicate that Rajesh Sheth, a vice president previously overseeing Amazon Elastic Block Store, had assumed some of Philomin’s responsibilities. Philomin left Amazon earlier in June. Tech leaders embrace AI as workforce shifts toward innovation and efficiency While AI is expected to eliminate some positions, Jassy emphasized that Amazon will continue expanding its workforce in AI, robotics, and advanced technologies. He noted that the shift will allow employees to move away from repetitive tasks and instead focus on more innovative and engaging work. Just recently, Jassy noted that he expects the company’s workforce to decline in the next few years as Amazon embraces generative AI and AI-powered software agents. He told staffers in a memo that it would be “hard to know exactly where this nets out over time” but that the corporate workforce would shrink as Amazon wrings more efficiency out of the technology. The message is resonating across the tech industry. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently stated that AI now handles between 30% and 50% of the workload at his company. Meanwhile, Shopify and Microsoft encourage employees to integrate AI into their daily tasks. Klarna’s CEO noted in May that the company has reduced its workforce by approximately 40%, attributing the decline partly to AI adoption and natural staff turnover. According to Jassy, AI will free employees from routine and “make all our jobs more interesting,” while enabling staffers to invent better services more quickly than before. AI-driven efficiencies fuel job cuts and mixed market performance across tech sector Amazon and other tech companies have also been shrinking their workforces through layoffs over the past several years. Amazon has cut more than 27,000 jobs since the start of 2022, and it has announced smaller, more targeted layoffs in its retail and devices units in recent months. Amazon shares are flat this year, underperforming the Nasdaq, which has gained 5.5%. The stock is about 10% below its record reached in February, while fellow megacaps Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia are all trading at or near record highs . BT Group Chief Executive Allison Kirkby notes that the progress in artificial intelligence could deepen significant job cuts at the British telecoms company, the Financial Times reported on Sunday. Kirkby told the newspaper that BT’s plans to cull more than 40,000 jobs and strip out 3 billion pounds ($4 billion) of costs by the end of the decade “did not reflect the full potential of AI”. “Depending on what we learn from AI … there may be an opportunity for BT to be even smaller by the end of the decade,” Allison Kirkby said. Amazon races to produce more advanced AI, and it expects its own success will lead to fewer corporate jobs, according to a memo from CEO Andy Jassy. Job growth limits will be driven in particular by so-called agentic AI, which can perform tasks with minimal or even no additional input from people. Amazon is working to bolster its reputation in AI development, after rivals like OpenAI and Google have taken an early lead, particularly with consumer-focused models.

Today, the spotlight is firmly on the US stock markets , which have opened significantly higher, signaling a renewed sense of optimism among investors. This positive momentum is a crucial indicator, not just for equity holders, but also for those navigating the digital asset space. What does this upward swing mean, and how might it influence the broader economic outlook that crypto enthusiasts are always watching? US Stock Markets Soar: What’s Driving the Optimism? The morning bells rang with good news for Wall Street, as all major indices reported healthy gains. This immediate uplift has certainly caught the attention of market participants, eager to understand the underlying currents driving this positive shift. Here’s a snapshot of the opening performance: Index Opening Performance S&P500 +0.32% NASDAQ +0.44% Dow Jones Industrial Average (Dow) +0.50% These figures, while seemingly modest on their own, represent a collective sigh of relief and a potential turning point for investor sentiment. But what exactly is fueling this enthusiasm? Several factors could be at play: Economic Data Surprises: Recent economic indicators, such as inflation cooling faster than expected or robust job reports, often reassure markets that the economy is on a stable path. Corporate Earnings: Strong earnings reports from bellwether companies can instill confidence, suggesting that corporate America is resilient and profitable, even in challenging environments. Monetary Policy Expectations: Hopes of central banks, particularly the Federal Reserve, potentially easing their hawkish stance on interest rates in the near future can significantly boost market optimism. Geopolitical Stability: A period of reduced geopolitical tension, or progress in international relations, can also contribute to a more stable and predictable market environment. Understanding the Current Stock Market Rally: A Deeper Dive When we talk about a stock market rally , we’re referring to a period of sustained price increases across a broad range of stocks. This isn’t just about a single day’s performance; it’s about the potential for a more extended positive trend. A rally often signifies a shift from a period of uncertainty or decline to one of renewed growth and investor confidence. For many, it’s a signal to reassess portfolios and potentially re-enter the market. Historically, rallies are driven by a combination of fundamental economic improvements and psychological shifts among investors. When the fear of recession subsides, and prospects for future earnings improve, capital tends to flow back into equities. This positive feedback loop can accelerate gains. The current rally could be an early indicator that the market is pricing in a more favorable future, moving past recent headwinds like inflation concerns or supply chain disruptions. It’s important to observe which sectors are leading the charge. Often, technology stocks (heavily represented in the NASDAQ) are highly sensitive to interest rate expectations and economic growth, making their performance a key barometer. Similarly, industrial and financial stocks (prominent in the Dow) reflect broader economic health. How Does Positive Market Sentiment Influence Crypto? The relationship between traditional finance and the cryptocurrency market is becoming increasingly intertwined. A surge in market sentiment on Wall Street often creates a ‘risk-on’ environment, where investors become more willing to allocate capital to higher-risk, higher-reward assets. Cryptocurrencies, while volatile, are often perceived as such assets. When traditional markets perform well, a portion of that newfound confidence, and capital, can flow into digital assets. Here’s how this dynamic often plays out: Increased Risk Appetite: A strong stock market indicates a generally healthy economic climate, encouraging investors to seek greater returns by venturing into more speculative assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. Institutional Flow: Major financial institutions that invest in both traditional equities and digital assets may increase their exposure to crypto as their overall portfolio performance improves. Correlation: While not always perfectly correlated, Bitcoin, in particular, has shown periods of correlation with tech-heavy indices like the NASDAQ. When tech stocks do well, Bitcoin often follows suit, albeit with higher volatility. Macroeconomic Indicators: The same macroeconomic factors that drive stock market performance (e.g., inflation rates, interest rate decisions) also heavily influence crypto prices, as they affect liquidity and investor capital allocation strategies. For crypto investors, observing the stock market is no longer optional; it’s a vital part of understanding the broader financial currents that can impact their digital holdings. Navigating the Economic Outlook: Opportunities and Challenges A positive shift in the economic outlook presents both exciting opportunities and inherent challenges. On the opportunity front, a robust economy typically means higher corporate profits, more employment, and potentially greater consumer spending, all of which can indirectly benefit the crypto ecosystem by increasing disposable income and investment capital. For those invested in both traditional and digital assets, this could mean a period of broad-based portfolio growth. However, challenges persist. While the current gains are encouraging, the global economy is still grappling with various complexities: Persistent Inflation: Despite signs of cooling, inflation remains a concern, potentially leading to further interest rate hikes if it reaccelerates, which could dampen market enthusiasm. Geopolitical Risks: Ongoing conflicts and international tensions can quickly shift market sentiment, leading to volatility and risk aversion. Regulatory Landscape: For crypto, the evolving regulatory environment across different jurisdictions remains a significant factor, capable of impacting market structure and investor participation. Market Volatility: Even in a bull market, corrections and pullbacks are natural. Investors must be prepared for fluctuations and not solely rely on short-term gains. Understanding these dualities is crucial for making informed investment decisions and building a resilient portfolio. Building Investor Confidence in Volatile Times The current upward trend in investor confidence is a welcome development, especially after periods of heightened uncertainty. However, true confidence is built not just on good news, but on a solid understanding of market dynamics and a disciplined investment approach. For both traditional and crypto investors, maintaining a long-term perspective and managing risk are paramount. Actionable Insights for Investors: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on economic data, central bank announcements, and geopolitical developments. These factors profoundly influence both stock and crypto markets. Diversify Wisely: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. A diversified portfolio across different asset classes (equities, bonds, real estate, and cryptocurrencies) can help mitigate risk. Risk Management: Understand your risk tolerance. Use tools like stop-loss orders or dollar-cost averaging, especially in the volatile crypto market, to manage potential downsides. Long-Term Vision: Focus on your long-term financial goals rather than getting swayed by short-term market fluctuations. Both stock markets and crypto have historically rewarded patient investors. Consult Experts: If unsure, seek advice from financial advisors who can provide personalized guidance based on your financial situation and objectives. The current market rally is a positive sign, but it’s part of a larger, ongoing narrative. By understanding the forces at play and adopting a strategic approach, investors can navigate the complexities of the financial world with greater confidence. Conclusion: A Bullish Horizon for Financial Markets? Today’s strong opening for the US stock markets paints a promising picture, suggesting a potential shift towards a more optimistic phase for global financial markets. The gains across the S&P500, NASDAQ, and Dow reflect a confluence of positive economic signals and renewed investor confidence . This surge not only benefits traditional equity holders but also sends encouraging ripples through the cryptocurrency space, often indicative of a broader ‘risk-on’ environment. While the economic outlook continues to evolve with its inherent opportunities and challenges, the current stock market rally provides a valuable barometer for the overall health of the financial system. For investors, staying vigilant, informed, and strategic will be key to harnessing the potential of this upward momentum.

Recently, a significant stride was made that has caught the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike: the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially acknowledged Grayscale’s amended application. This isn’t just any filing; it concerns the conversion of Grayscale’s substantial Digital Large Cap Fund into an ETF. This development, as reported by Solid Intel on X, marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing quest for broader, regulated access to the crypto market. What Does the SEC’s Acknowledgment of the Grayscale ETF Filing Signify? For those closely following the cryptocurrency space, the SEC’s actions are always under intense scrutiny. An acknowledgment, while not an outright approval, is a crucial procedural step. It means the regulator has received and is formally processing the updated application. Think of it as the starting gun for a more detailed review period. Grayscale has been a persistent advocate for bringing digital asset investment products into mainstream financial structures, and this latest move signals that their efforts continue to gain traction. This acknowledgment is particularly noteworthy because it comes after a period of increased regulatory clarity and, in some cases, approval of other crypto-related investment vehicles. It suggests a growing willingness from the SEC to engage with and formally review proposals for more complex digital asset funds. For the average investor, this procedural advancement is a hopeful sign that a more accessible and regulated investment option might be on the horizon, potentially reducing the barriers to entry for traditional investors looking to diversify into digital assets. Unpacking the Digital Large Cap Fund : What Assets Are Involved? The fund in question, Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC), is not just a single-asset fund. It’s a diversified basket of some of the most prominent cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Understanding its composition is key to appreciating its potential impact as an ETF. The fund currently comprises: Bitcoin (BTC): The undisputed king of cryptocurrencies, often seen as ‘digital gold’. Ethereum (ETH): The leading smart contract platform, foundational to DeFi and NFTs. XRP: A cryptocurrency designed for fast, low-cost international payments. Solana (SOL): A high-performance blockchain known for its speed and scalability. Cardano (ADA): A blockchain platform focused on security, scalability, and sustainability through peer-reviewed research. The inclusion of these diverse assets within a single fund offers investors exposure to a broad segment of the digital asset market without needing to purchase and manage individual cryptocurrencies. This diversification strategy is appealing, as it potentially mitigates some of the volatility associated with single-asset crypto investments, providing a more balanced entry point for institutional and retail investors alike. Why is a Crypto ETF Conversion So Pivotal for Investors? The conversion of a trust like GDLC into a spot Crypto ETF is a game-changer for several reasons. Currently, investors access GDLC through a trust structure, which can sometimes trade at a significant premium or discount to its underlying net asset value (NAV). An ETF structure, however, is designed to track its underlying assets much more closely due to its creation and redemption mechanism. Here’s why this matters: Enhanced Accessibility: ETFs are traded on traditional stock exchanges, making them easily accessible through standard brokerage accounts. This opens the door to a vast pool of investors who might be hesitant to navigate crypto exchanges or manage private keys. Increased Liquidity: As an ETF, the fund would benefit from the deep liquidity of traditional markets, potentially leading to tighter spreads and more efficient trading. Regulatory Clarity: An SEC-approved ETF operates under a robust regulatory framework, offering investors a higher degree of protection and oversight compared to unregulated crypto products. Institutional Adoption: ETFs are familiar investment vehicles for institutions, financial advisors, and wealth managers. An approved Grayscale ETF could unlock significant institutional capital flows into the digital asset space. Simplified Diversification: For investors looking for diversified exposure to large-cap digital assets without the complexities of direct ownership, an ETF provides a straightforward solution. The shift from a trust to an ETF fundamentally transforms how investors can interact with these digital assets, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the innovative world of cryptocurrency. The SEC and the Road to Crypto Adoption: A Shifting Landscape? The SEC ‘s approach to cryptocurrency has historically been cautious, prioritizing investor protection in a nascent and often volatile market. However, recent events, including the approval of several spot Bitcoin ETF s earlier this year, indicate a significant evolution in their stance. This acknowledgment of Grayscale’s diversified fund application further underscores this shifting landscape. The Commission’s deliberation process is rigorous, involving detailed reviews of market surveillance, custody solutions, and potential manipulation risks. Grayscale’s amended filing likely addresses many of these concerns, reflecting lessons learned from previous applications and ongoing dialogue with regulators. While the path to approval is rarely straightforward, the SEC’s engagement signals a pragmatic approach to integrating digital assets into regulated financial products, recognizing their growing presence and investor demand. This isn’t just about one fund; it sets a precedent. Each acknowledgment and potential approval helps to build a clearer regulatory pathway for future crypto-related investment products, fostering a more mature and stable digital asset ecosystem. Beyond Bitcoin ETF s: What This Means for Broader Market Access? While the excitement around spot Bitcoin ETF s has dominated headlines, the acknowledgment of Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund is arguably more significant for the broader crypto market. A diversified large-cap fund offers exposure to more than just Bitcoin, providing investors with a curated selection of leading cryptocurrencies that represent different facets of the digital economy. This development could pave the way for other multi-asset or sector-specific crypto ETFs in the future, expanding the range of regulated investment products available to the public. It signifies a maturation of the market, moving beyond single-asset focus to embrace the diversity and innovation within the digital asset space. For investors, this means more choices, potentially better risk management through diversification, and easier integration of digital assets into traditional portfolios. Looking Ahead: The Road to Approval While the SEC’s acknowledgment is a positive step, it’s crucial to remember that it is not a final approval. The regulatory process involves multiple stages, including public comment periods and further reviews. Grayscale will continue to work closely with the SEC to address any remaining concerns and navigate the complexities of bringing such a product to market. The journey has been long and arduous for Grayscale, but their persistence highlights the immense potential they see in democratizing access to digital assets through regulated financial products. The outcome of this application will undoubtedly have far-reaching implications for the digital asset industry, influencing investor sentiment, market dynamics, and the future trajectory of crypto adoption within traditional finance. Keep an eye on this space; the next few months could be truly transformative.

This article explores how Ondo (ONDO) , Maker (MKR) , and others are poised for potential growth, reshaping the financial landscape. Ondo Price Snapshot Amid Altcoin Season and Global Bull Outlook ONDO recent performance reflects a sharp decline, with a one-week drop of 6.81% and a one-month fall of 23.82%. The half-year performance shows a significant decrease of about 54.05%. These numbers indicate a consistent downward movement in recent periods. The price behavior portrays a market that has struggled to recover, with traders witnessing a steady deterioration and clear corrections over time. The shifts in price have been considerable, signaling a need for cautious observation as market dynamics continue to evolve. Current price levels range from $0.70 to $1.05, with resistance at $1.27 and support at $0.57. A secondary barrier exists at $1.62, while another support level is noted at $0.21. Indicators like the Awesome Oscillator and Momentum Indicator near -0.100 and -0.123 suggest active selling, reinforcing a bearish sentiment. The Relative Strength Index at 37.25 hints at potential oversold conditions but does not confirm a strong rally. Trading ideas may focus on short-term pauses at $0.57 or potential reversal signs if the price breaches $1.27. With bears dominating and volatility high, any move above key resistance could signal a cautious entry for bulls aiming to restructure the current downtrend. Maker Market Outlook: Steady Half-Year Growth Amid Key Price Levels Maker saw a 6.54% gain over the past month and a notable 17.23% climb in the last six months. A recent drop of 14.15% highlights short-term volatility, yet the longer-term trend remains positive. The coin traded consistently between $1340 and $1880, demonstrating gradual strength over time. Price action reflects moments of pressure followed by recovery, suggesting a market capable of bouncing back after downturns while slowly building upward momentum. Currently, Maker is trading with significant barriers in view. There is clear support around $1111.33 and resistance at approximately $2191.33. The price is fluctuating within these defined bounds. Buyers are active near the support threshold, while sellers resist near the resistance level, indicating a balance between bulls and bears. Trading within these parameters appears promising. Pullbacks near support may offer entry points, while approaching resistance could signal taking profits. Additional levels, such as a second resistance near $2731.33 and second support near $571.33, add further caution. Moving indicators suggest a careful approach, requiring tactical entries based on real-time price behavior. IOTA Faces Significant Drops and Key Technical Levels IOTA lost nearly 29% of its value over the past month and almost 45% over the last six months. Its recent performance includes a weekly drop of about 6.51%, emphasizing persistent bearish pressure. The price action during these periods indicates an overall decline, with selling pressure consistently exceeding buying interest. Investors have shown increased caution as market momentum has slowed. Historical data suggests diminished investor sentiment and a trend primarily characterized by declines, making it a challenging environment for any bullish opportunities. IOTA is currently trading in a range between $0.14 and $0.24, with a resistance zone at $0.31 and another barrier near $0.41. The nearest support level is around $0.10, with a secondary support at $0.00046. Technical indicators reveal a continued bearish dominance, as shown by an Awesome Oscillator value of -0.026, a momentum indicator at -0.028, and an RSI of 34.89. The lack of a clear trend means the coin is likely to remain within these boundaries. Trading strategies should focus on cautiously building positions near support at $0.10 and considering profit-taking near resistance at $0.31. Conclusion Ondo (ONDO) , Maker (MKR) , and IOTA offer distinct solutions in the expanding field of real-world asset platforms. Each has its own strengths, showcasing innovation and practical applications. Ondo focuses on secure and profitable financial services. Maker leads in stability and decentralized finance. IOTA brings new efficiency in transactions. Together, they illustrate the versatile potential of blockchain technology in real-world contexts.

Dogecoin Investors Realized $124 Million In Loss Over The Last 24 Hours In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has shared how the major cryptocurrencies compare against each other in terms of the Realized Loss and Realized Profit metrics. Related Reading: XRP Down 3% After SEC Settlement Stalls, But Social Media Turns Bullish These indicators measure, as their names already imply, the amount of loss/profit that the investors on a given network are realizing through their transactions right now. The metrics work by going through the transfer history of each coin being sold to see what price it was moved at prior to this. If this previous value is less than the price that the coin’s now being sold at, then the token’s sale is leading to profit realization. On the other hand, it being higher suggests loss realization. The Realized Profit sums up the difference between the two prices involved in all sales of the former type, while the Realized Loss does the same for the latter ones. Now, here is the table shared by the analytics firm that shows how the 24-hour values of the two metrics currently stack up for the top 10 coins by market cap: As is visible above, the scale of the Realized Loss and Realized Profit differs greatly between the different assets, but one pattern is consistent: the latter outweighs the former, implying a trend of net profit-taking from the investors. One asset, however, doesn’t fit the mold: Dogecoin. The 24-hour Realized Loss for the memecoin stands at around $132 million, while the Realized Profit is much lower with a value of just $5 million. As such, it would appear that while the participants in the rest of the sector have been harvesting gains, DOGE holders have been panic capitulating at a loss instead. Among these top coins, the investors of Bitcoin have realized the largest profit, with the indicator’s value sitting at a whopping $1.3 billion. The Realized Loss is also restricted to just $33 million for the number one cryptocurrency, indicating selling has been heavily lopsided toward profit-taking.

Its Realized Loss of $18.4 million is roughly half that of its Realized Profit of $35.2 million. The fact that profit realization is so dominant for the likes of Bitcoin, however, might actually be a bearish sign. Historically, such market conditions have made tops more likely. A dominance of loss-taking, on the other hand, can facilitate reversals to the upside. As such, while not a given, Dogecoin may not be in a bad position, at least in this regard. DOGE Price Dogecoin touched the $0.170 mark during the weekend, but the memecoin has seen a retrace under $0.165 to kick off the week.

Attention is shifting from the familiar blue-chip altcoins to under-the-radar assets that offer fresh momentum and narrative-driven potential. Avalanche (AVAX), Ripple’s XRP, and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are top of mind—but an emerging contender, MAGACOIN FINANCE, is beginning to steal the spotlight among low-cap gems. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Hidden Star of 2025? As traders look beyond saturated markets, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining momentum as a breakout candidate in the low-cap altcoin space. The crypto community is quickly interacting with MAGACOIN FINANCE, and forums and social media feeds are overflowing with enthusiasm. Analysts are also paying attention, and many see its unique approach, close-knit community, and growing visibility as signs that something big might be on the horizon. What really sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its commitment to doing things right—prioritizing transparency, rock-solid security, and a truly community-driven model. The fact that it’s already been fully audited by HashEx gives it an added layer of trust in a space where that matters more than ever. With new product launches just around the corner, interest is building fast. The project’s bold branding, thoughtful design, and strong early support are creating serious momentum—and a growing sense that traders don’t want to miss out. Unlike many other altcoins that are slow to adapt or overly dependent on hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE is backed by tangible developments and a clear roadmap. As capital continues to rotate out of legacy altcoins in search of agility and upside potential, many believe MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself for a major breakout in Q3 and Q4 of 2025. AVAX: Battling Resistance, Backed by Ecosystem Growth AVAX surged over 8% in late June, touching $18.64 before pulling back to $18.03. Despite this rally, the technical picture remains cautious, with 71% bearish sentiment and stiff resistance just under $18.50. A breakout could carry it to $22.14, but failure to hold current support risks a retreat to $15.50—or even $10.50. Still, Avalanche remains a strong contender in the DeFi and gaming sectors, supported by growing real-world asset tokenization efforts. Institutional holders are staying put, while retail sentiment wavers. Key challenges include a high staking threshold and security concerns around validator penalties. XRP: Regulatory Clarity Drives Institutional Confidence XRP is trading near $2.18 following an 8.9% surge tied to its legal clarity in the U.S.—a major advantage in today’s regulatory climate. With courts confirming XRP is not a security in secondary markets, institutional adoption is on the rise. The XRP Ledger (XRPL) just rolled out a major upgrade, introducing features like token escrows, permissioned decentralized exchanges, and batch transaction support. These developments, showcased at the recent APEX 2025 summit, bolster XRP’s enterprise positioning. Analysts are eyeing a potential breakout above $2.60, which could open the door to $3.30 and beyond. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Community Resilience and Layer-2 Innovation SHIB has bounced back 17% from recent lows and is currently consolidating around $0.00001168. The rebound was powered by massive whale accumulation—over 10.4 trillion SHIB in one day. A breakout above $0.00001175 could push prices toward $0.0000120, while support holds around $0.0000110. The Shiba Inu ecosystem is picking up serious momentum. Shibarium, its Layer-2 network, is already making waves by delivering faster and more affordable transactions—a big win for users diving into DeFi, gaming, and NFTs. Meanwhile, the recent launch of the Shib Alpha Layer brings a cutting-edge twist with encrypted smart contracts, pushing the project deeper into privacy and scalability. On top of that, the rollout of ShibDAO gives the community real decision-making power, turning holders into active participants in the project’s future. Strategic moves like teaming up with DeLorean Labs are also helping SHIB bridge the gap between crypto and real-world utility. Despite market volatility, SHIB’s growing utility and strong community foundation make it a token to watch.

This mechanism does not simply encourage investors to join; it creates a competitive environment where daily bonuses are awarded to top buyers. Each day, the leaderboard resets, and the buyer with the largest contribution receives leftover BlockDAG(BDAG) coins from a fixed allocation pool. This creates a race where bigger contributions provide a clear advantage, spiking volume as investors compete to win bonuses. Buyer Battles: Strategic Edge Before Prices Rise The design of Buyer Battles gives larger buyers a strategic edge. The more significant the daily purchase, the better the chance of receiving a larger share of the bonus pool. Unlike traditional presale models with static tiers, BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles turns strategic accumulation into an exciting, high-stakes game that rewards buyers for contributing larger amounts. Each whale participant does more than increase their stake; they remove additional coins from circulation, which adds a layer of scarcity and potential future value. BlockDAG’s presale has already raised an impressive $326 million, with over 23.4 billion coins sold to date. The current price of Batch 29, in celebration of the BlockDAG GLOBAL LAUNCH release, is available at a special price of $0.0016 for all future purchases until August 11. This offer brings back one of the lowest prices seen in Batch 1, creating an exciting opportunity for new buyers to get in at a highly discounted rate. Incentive Model: Scarcity and Buyer Behavior BlockDAG is distinguishing itself by implementing a tokenomics model that directly influences both scarcity and investor behavior. Through its Buyer Battles program, BlockDAG creates a dynamic environment where buyer participation and volume impact rewards. Instead of relying solely on market movements and chart-based speculation, this system embeds scarcity into the daily activity of its presale process. For active buyers, this system offers an edge over more traditional models. Rather than passively holding, strategic participation in Buyer Battles rewards volume and contributions. As a result, it generates sustainable demand while fostering long-term engagement from the community. This method creates a more consistent and reliable path for growing the project compared to other projects driven purely by speculation. The daily scarcity driven by this model ensures that each participant, especially those making larger purchases, plays an essential role in the scarcity that drives future demand. BlockDAG’s unique presale model is pushing the boundaries of traditional crypto strategies, offering an alternative approach that is engaging, sustainable, and focused on rewarding those who contribute most. Conclusion BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles offers a dynamic, action-driven layer to its presale process. It’s designed to reward strategic buyers who actively participate in driving the project’s growth. By incorporating incentives and focusing on volume-driven scarcity, BlockDAG makes tokenomics a daily factor in presale dynamics. For buyers, this means not just passive accumulation but an opportunity to gain bonus coins through smart, strategic participation. BlockDAG’s unique approach is positioning it as a forward-thinking contender in the crowded crypto market. By incentivizing whales while creating long-term value through scarcity, BlockDAG is setting itself apart as one of the most exciting projects to join right now.

A significant development could be on the horizon, potentially reshaping how traditional investors access digital assets. Imagine gaining exposure to a leading blockchain like Solana, not just for its price appreciation, but also for the passive income it can generate through staking. This week, the whispers have grown louder, suggesting that a Solana Staking ETF might just be on the cusp of approval. This groundbreaking financial product promises to bridge the gap between conventional finance and the dynamic world of decentralized networks, offering a unique blend of growth potential and yield generation. What is a Solana Staking ETF, and Why Does it Matter? At its core, a Solana Staking ETF is an exchange-traded fund designed to hold Solana (SOL) tokens and, crucially, stake them to earn rewards. For those new to the concept, an ETF is a type of investment fund that trades on stock exchanges, much like a regular stock. It typically holds assets like stocks, bonds, or commodities. In the crypto realm, ETFs allow investors to gain exposure to digital currencies without directly buying, storing, or managing them. The ‘staking’ component is what makes this particular ETF so exciting. Staking involves locking up cryptocurrency to support the operations of a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain network, like Solana. In return for contributing to the network’s security and validation process, stakers receive rewards, often in the form of newly minted tokens. The REX-Osprey SOL + Staking ETF, specifically mentioned by Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, aims to do exactly this: track Solana’s performance while simultaneously generating yield through its staking activities. This offers a dual benefit for investors: potential capital appreciation from SOL’s price movements and ongoing income from staking rewards. Key aspects of a Staked Solana ETF: Indirect Exposure: Investors gain exposure to Solana without needing a crypto wallet or understanding complex blockchain mechanics. Yield Generation: The ETF’s design allows it to participate in Solana’s staking mechanism, passing on yield to investors. Regulatory Wrapper: Being an ETF, it operates within a regulated framework, potentially appealing to institutional investors and those wary of direct crypto investments. The Path to Solana ETF Approval: Analyst Insights and Regulatory Landscape The anticipation around a Solana ETF Approval has reached a fever pitch, largely thanks to insights from prominent industry analysts. James Seyffart, a well-respected Bloomberg ETF analyst, recently stirred the pot with his suggestion on X (formerly Twitter) that a Solana Staking ETF could indeed see approval this very week. His comments carry weight, given his track record in forecasting the approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. The journey for any crypto-backed ETF in the United States has been long and fraught with regulatory challenges. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has historically been cautious, citing concerns about market manipulation, investor protection, and the nascent nature of the crypto markets. However, the recent approvals of spot Bitcoin ETFs and, more recently, spot Ethereum ETFs, have set a precedent. While Bitcoin and Ethereum operate on different consensus mechanisms (Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake, respectively, for Ethereum post-Merge), the SEC’s evolving stance on digital assets is a positive sign. The key differentiator for a Solana Staking ETF lies in the ‘staking’ component, which the SEC has previously viewed with skepticism, often classifying staking services as unregistered securities. The approval of an ETF that actively engages in staking would signal a significant shift in this regulatory perspective, potentially opening doors for a new wave of yield-generating crypto investment products. This move would not only validate Solana as a significant digital asset but also legitimize staking as a permissible activity within regulated financial products. Unlocking Crypto Staking Yield: Benefits for Investors For many investors, the allure of cryptocurrencies extends beyond just price appreciation; it’s also about the potential for passive income. A Crypto Staking Yield mechanism embedded within an ETF offers several compelling benefits: Simplified Access to Yield: Traditionally, earning staking rewards requires technical knowledge to set up a validator node or choose a staking service, manage private keys, and navigate unbonding periods. An ETF removes these complexities, allowing investors to earn yield through their brokerage accounts. Diversification with Income: For traditional portfolios, adding a yield-bearing digital asset can provide a new source of income, diversifying beyond traditional dividends or bond yields. It introduces a high-growth asset class with an additional income stream. Enhanced Returns: Staking rewards can significantly boost the overall return on investment, especially in volatile markets. While the primary driver remains SOL’s price, the consistent yield acts as a buffer and a compounding factor. Liquidity: Unlike direct staking which often involves lock-up periods, an ETF is traded on an exchange, offering daily liquidity. Investors can buy and sell shares throughout the trading day, providing flexibility that direct staking often lacks. Consider the potential for investors seeking exposure to the high-performance Solana network. Instead of merely buying SOL and holding it, an ETF that stakes could provide a more attractive proposition by enhancing returns through the generated yield. This could be particularly appealing to institutional investors and wealth managers looking for compliant ways to offer crypto exposure with added benefits to their clients. Navigating the Challenges: Risks and Considerations for Digital Asset ETFs While the prospect of a Digital Asset ETFs offering staking yield is exciting, it’s crucial for investors to understand the inherent risks and challenges. No investment is without its downsides, and crypto-backed ETFs are no exception. Key risks associated with Solana Staking ETFs: Market Volatility: Solana, like other cryptocurrencies, is subject to extreme price volatility. While staking yield can cushion some impact, a significant downturn in SOL’s price could still lead to substantial losses for investors. Staking Risks: Although the ETF handles the staking process, the underlying risks remain. This includes ‘slashing,’ where a validator’s staked tokens are penalized for misbehavior (e.g., going offline). While ETFs will likely use reputable staking providers, the risk is not entirely eliminated. Unbonding periods, where staked tokens are locked for a set time before they can be withdrawn, could also impact the ETF’s liquidity management. Custody and Security: The security of the underlying SOL tokens held by the ETF’s custodian is paramount. While ETFs typically use institutional-grade custodians, the risk of hacks or security breaches, though low, is always present in the digital asset space. Regulatory Uncertainty: Despite recent approvals, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies, especially those involving staking, remains fluid. Future regulatory changes could impact the ETF’s operations or even its viability. Tracking Error and Fees: ETFs aim to track the performance of their underlying assets, but ‘tracking error’ can occur. Additionally, management fees charged by the ETF provider will eat into returns, potentially offsetting some of the staking yield. Investors must carefully review the expense ratios. It is imperative for potential investors to conduct thorough due diligence and understand these risks before committing capital. While the ETF structure provides a layer of professional management and regulatory oversight, it does not eliminate the inherent risks of investing in a volatile asset class like cryptocurrency. The Dawn of Institutional Crypto Investment: What’s Next? The potential approval of a Solana Staking ETF marks a significant milestone, not just for Solana, but for the entire landscape of Institutional Crypto adoption. It signifies a growing acceptance and maturation of digital assets within traditional financial frameworks. This development could pave the way for a broader array of crypto-backed financial products, moving beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. The implications are far-reaching: Increased Mainstream Adoption: Easier access through familiar investment vehicles like ETFs can attract a wider pool of investors, including retail investors who prefer regulated products and institutional funds with strict compliance requirements. Enhanced Liquidity and Market Depth: As more institutional capital flows into Solana through ETFs, it could lead to increased liquidity and greater market depth for the SOL token, potentially reducing volatility over the long term. Validation for Proof-of-Stake: An ETF explicitly incorporating staking would further validate the Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism in the eyes of regulators and traditional finance, potentially encouraging more innovation in this area. Catalyst for Other Altcoin ETFs: If a Solana Staking ETF proves successful, it could set a precedent for similar products tracking other major altcoins that utilize staking, such as Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT), or Avalanche (AVAX). This would dramatically expand the investment opportunities within the digital asset space for traditional investors. This is not just about a single ETF; it’s about the continued integration of a revolutionary technology into the established financial system. The shift from speculative trading to regulated investment vehicles is a crucial step towards the long-term sustainability and growth of the crypto economy. Actionable Insights: What Should Investors Consider? For investors intrigued by the prospect of a Solana Staking ETF, here are some actionable insights to guide your decisions: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on official announcements from the SEC and the ETF providers. Regulatory decisions can significantly impact the launch and performance of these products. Follow reputable financial news sources and crypto analysis. Understand the Underlying Asset: Even though it’s an ETF, your investment is tied to Solana. Research Solana’s technology, ecosystem, development roadmap, and its competitive landscape. Understand its strengths and weaknesses. Evaluate Fees: All ETFs charge management fees. Compare the expense ratios of any potential Solana ETFs. Higher fees can significantly eat into your staking yield and overall returns over time. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Despite the regulatory wrapper, investing in a crypto-backed ETF still carries higher risk than traditional assets due to market volatility. Ensure this investment aligns with your overall financial goals and risk appetite. Consider Diversification: Even if a Solana Staking ETF launches, it’s wise not to put all your eggs in one basket. Maintain a diversified portfolio that balances growth assets with more stable investments. Consult a Financial Advisor: For complex investment decisions, especially involving new and evolving asset classes, seeking advice from a qualified financial advisor is always recommended. They can help you integrate this into your broader financial plan. Conclusion: A Transformative Step for Solana and Crypto The potential launch of a Solana Staking ETF this week represents more than just a new investment product; it symbolizes a transformative moment for the cryptocurrency market. It’s a testament to the growing maturity of digital assets and the increasing willingness of traditional finance to embrace innovative blockchain technologies. By offering a regulated, accessible pathway to both Solana’s growth potential and its attractive staking yield, this ETF could unlock significant institutional and retail capital, driving further adoption and legitimization of the crypto space. While challenges and risks persist, the benefits of such a product—simplified access, yield generation, and a regulatory wrapper—are undeniable. As we stand on the precipice of this potential approval, the future of digital asset investment looks brighter and more integrated than ever before. This is a significant stride towards a future where the revolutionary potential of blockchain technology is accessible to a wider global audience, paving the way for further innovation and financial inclusion.

This news, reported by Odaily, signals a crucial period for global markets, particularly for those closely watching the evolving landscape of the crypto market . Understanding the Influence of the Fed Chair and Jerome Powell’s Tenure The role of the Federal Reserve Chair is arguably one of the most influential positions in global finance. The Chair leads the U.S. central bank, making decisions on interest rates, quantitative easing, and other tools that directly impact inflation, employment, and the overall health of the economy. Chairman Jerome Powell ‘s tenure has been marked by unprecedented challenges, from navigating the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic to combating persistent inflation with aggressive interest rate hikes. His decisions have profoundly shaped the economic environment, influencing everything from housing costs to investment returns, including the performance of the crypto market . Monetary Policy Direction: The Fed Chair dictates the direction of U.S. monetary policy , which can lead to periods of expansion or contraction. Market Stability: The Chair’s communication and actions heavily influence investor confidence and market stability. Global Ripples: U.S. monetary decisions have a cascading effect on global economies and financial systems. Why Does the U.S. Treasury Secretary’s Announcement Matter? The announcement by the U.S. Treasury Secretary about the upcoming succession process is significant for several reasons. While the Federal Reserve operates independently, the Treasury Department often works in close coordination with the Fed on broader economic strategies. The timing and transparency of this announcement from Secretary Bessent underscore the importance of a smooth transition and the need for clarity in leadership at such a critical institution. This early heads-up allows markets and policymakers to prepare for potential shifts in leadership and, by extension, in monetary policy . The process involves a presidential nomination, followed by Senate confirmation. The individual chosen will inherit the immense responsibility of guiding the U.S. economy through complex global dynamics, including ongoing inflation concerns, geopolitical tensions, and technological advancements like digital currencies. Potential Impact on Monetary Policy and the Crypto Market The selection of a new Fed Chair could introduce a fresh perspective on monetary policy , potentially leading to shifts in interest rate trajectories, balance sheet management, and regulatory approaches. For the crypto market , this uncertainty can be a double-edged sword: What Changes Could a New Fed Chair Bring? A new leader might: Alter Interest Rate Strategy: A more dovish Chair might be inclined to lower rates sooner or raise them less aggressively, potentially boosting liquidity and risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, a more hawkish Chair could maintain a tighter stance, putting downward pressure on risk assets. Shift Inflation Targets: While unlikely to change dramatically, a new Chair might emphasize different aspects of the Fed’s dual mandate (maximum employment and price stability), which could subtly alter policy responses. Influence Regulatory Stance: While the Fed isn’t the primary crypto regulator, its stance on financial innovation and stability can indirectly influence how digital assets are viewed and integrated into the broader financial system. How Could This Affect the Crypto Market? The crypto market is highly sensitive to macro-economic factors, especially liquidity and interest rates. A change in Fed leadership, and thus in monetary policy , could: Impact Investor Sentiment: Perceived dovishness might spark a risk-on rally, while hawkishness could lead to caution and capital flight from speculative assets. Influence Institutional Adoption: Clarity and stability in monetary policy can encourage or deter institutional investment in digital assets. Affect Dollar Strength: Fed policy directly impacts the U.S. dollar’s strength, which in turn affects the relative value of cryptocurrencies. Navigating the Uncertainty: Actionable Insights for Investors As the succession process unfolds, vigilance and adaptability will be key for participants in the crypto market . Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Closely follow news regarding the nomination process, potential candidates, and their economic philosophies. Monitor Economic Data: Pay attention to inflation reports, employment figures, and GDP data, as these will continue to guide the Fed’s decisions regardless of who is in charge. Diversify Your Portfolio: In times of uncertainty, a diversified portfolio can help mitigate risks associated with potential market volatility. Understand Risk Management: Re-evaluate your risk tolerance and adjust your positions accordingly, especially if you anticipate significant shifts in monetary policy . The upcoming selection of the next Fed Chair is undoubtedly a pivotal moment for the U.S. economy and global financial markets. The transition from Jerome Powell ‘s leadership will be closely watched, with the potential to usher in new approaches to monetary policy that will have far-reaching implications, particularly for the dynamic and rapidly evolving crypto market .

On June 29, at block height 903,168, the network saw a significant adjustment: Bitcoin’s mining difficulty decreased by a notable 7.48%, settling at 116.96T. This isn’t just a technical blip; it’s a direct reflection of real-world events impacting the global crypto mining landscape, particularly concerning US miners and the situation in Iran. Understanding the Drop: Why Did Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Fall? The latest adjustment in Bitcoin mining difficulty is primarily attributed to two major factors, as highlighted by CloverPool data: Extreme Heat in the U.S.: A significant portion of the decline stems from U.S. miners shutting down their operations. The soaring temperatures across various states have led to operational challenges, forcing facilities to power down to prevent equipment damage and manage energy consumption. Mining ASICs generate immense heat, and operating them in already hot environments without sufficient cooling can lead to inefficiencies, breakdowns, and even fire hazards. Unconfirmed Power Outages in Iran: Iran, which contributes approximately 4% of the global Bitcoin hash rate , has reportedly experienced power outages. While details remain unconfirmed, such disruptions can significantly impact the country’s mining operations, further reducing the overall computational power dedicated to the Bitcoin network. Iran’s stance on crypto mining has been complex, often leading to temporary bans or restrictions during periods of high electricity demand. These combined pressures illustrate the increasing sensitivity of the decentralized Bitcoin network to real-world climatic and geopolitical events. Each adjustment in difficulty is the network’s way of maintaining its target block time of approximately 10 minutes, ensuring a steady supply of new Bitcoins. What is Bitcoin Mining Difficulty, and Why Does it Matter? For those new to the space, Bitcoin mining difficulty is a crucial metric that determines how hard it is for miners to find the next block on the Bitcoin blockchain. It automatically adjusts roughly every two weeks (or 2,016 blocks) to ensure that, on average, a new block is discovered every 10 minutes, regardless of how many miners are active on the network. Think of it like this: Imagine Bitcoin mining as a race to solve a complex puzzle. The difficulty adjustment ensures that no matter how many racers join or leave, the puzzle always takes about 10 minutes to solve. If more miners join, the puzzle gets harder. If miners leave, as in this case, the puzzle gets easier. Why does this matter? Network Stability: It maintains the predictable issuance of new Bitcoin, a core tenet of its monetary policy. Security: By making it consistently challenging to mine, it prevents malicious actors from easily dominating the network’s computational power. Profitability for Miners: A lower difficulty means it’s easier for active miners to find blocks and earn rewards, potentially increasing their profitability per unit of hash power. How Do Extreme Temperatures Impact US Miners and Global Hash Rate? The extreme heat gripping parts of the U.S. has presented a significant challenge for US miners . Bitcoin mining rigs, known as ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits), are powerful machines that consume substantial electricity and generate a lot of heat. To operate efficiently and prevent damage, these machines require sophisticated cooling systems. When ambient temperatures soar: Increased Cooling Costs: Air conditioning units and liquid cooling systems have to work harder, consuming more electricity themselves, thus increasing operational costs. Reduced Efficiency: ASICs perform optimally within a certain temperature range. Beyond this, their hash rate can degrade, meaning they produce less computational power for the same energy input. Forced Curtailment: In many regions, especially Texas, mining operations have agreements with energy providers to curtail (reduce or stop) operations during peak demand periods or grid stress. Extreme heat drives up residential and commercial electricity demand for cooling, often leading to miners voluntarily or involuntarily shutting down to stabilize the grid. This directly impacts the global Bitcoin hash rate . This situation highlights the growing importance of sustainable and resilient energy solutions for the crypto mining industry, especially as it increasingly integrates with traditional energy grids. Iran’s Role: Unconfirmed Outages and Their Contribution to Bitcoin Hash Rate Fluctuations Iran has been a notable player in the global crypto mining scene, largely due to its relatively cheap electricity, albeit with regulatory uncertainties. CloverPool data indicates Iran contributes approximately 4% of the global Bitcoin hash rate . Reports of unconfirmed power outages in the country, whether due to grid instability, increased domestic demand, or government-imposed restrictions, can have a noticeable ripple effect on the network’s overall computational power. The Iranian government has, in the past, implemented temporary bans on mining during peak summer and winter electricity consumption periods to alleviate strain on the national grid. Such measures, combined with potential unplanned outages, directly reduce the hash power originating from the region, contributing to adjustments like the one we’ve just seen. Implications for Miners and the Bitcoin Network: Who Benefits? When Bitcoin mining difficulty drops, it’s generally good news for the miners who remain operational and efficient. Here’s why: Increased Profitability: With an easier target to hit, miners have a higher chance of successfully solving a block and earning the block reward (currently 6.25 BTC plus transaction fees). This means that for the same amount of hash power, they are likely to earn more Bitcoin. Lower Operational Costs (Per BTC Mined): While electricity costs remain constant for operational rigs, the cost per Bitcoin mined effectively decreases because each unit of hash power is more likely to yield a reward. Network Resilience: The automatic difficulty adjustment mechanism is a testament to Bitcoin’s robust design. It ensures that even with significant fluctuations in hash rate, the network continues to function as intended, processing transactions and securing the blockchain. This adjustment acts as a self-correcting mechanism, encouraging miners to join when profitability is high and allowing less efficient miners to drop off during challenging times without compromising network security. Looking Ahead: What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Mining? The recent difficulty drop serves as a powerful reminder of the external factors influencing the highly competitive world of crypto mining . As the industry matures, we can expect a continued focus on: Energy Efficiency: Miners will increasingly invest in more efficient hardware and cooling solutions to minimize operational costs, especially in regions with fluctuating energy prices or extreme climates. Geographic Diversification: To mitigate risks associated with localized power issues or regulatory changes, mining operations may continue to diversify their geographical footprint. Renewable Energy Integration: The push towards sustainable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydro will likely accelerate, not just for environmental reasons, but also for economic stability and predictable power supply. These adjustments are a normal, healthy part of the Bitcoin network’s operation, demonstrating its adaptive nature. They highlight the dynamic interplay between technology, energy, and global climate in the ongoing evolution of decentralized finance. A Compelling Conclusion: Bitcoin’s Adaptive Strength The 7.48% drop in Bitcoin mining difficulty is more than just a statistic; it’s a narrative of resilience and adaptation within the world’s leading cryptocurrency network. Triggered by the intense heat affecting US miners and reported power outages impacting Iran’s contribution to the Bitcoin hash rate , this adjustment underscores the network’s ability to self-regulate and maintain its integrity. For active participants in crypto mining , it offers a temporary boost in profitability, while for the broader Bitcoin ecosystem, it reaffirms the network’s fundamental strength and decentralized design. As external pressures continue to evolve, Bitcoin’s adaptive difficulty mechanism remains a cornerstone of its stability and security, ensuring its journey forward.

Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), and Litecoin (LTC) are all facing critical technical zones that could define their mid-year performance. But while these legacy assets fluctuate, one project is showing nothing but upward momentum — MAGACOIN FINANCE. Analysts and early investors are calling it the most exciting early-stage entry of the year, with a rapid sellout trend and growing interest from those seeking asymmetric gains in the next cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Unstoppable Force of 2025 While Ethereum, Cardano, and Litecoin navigate summer volatility, MAGACOIN FINANCE is establishing itself as a high-conviction outlier. With entry phases selling out instantly and demand accelerating, the project is generating serious attention from investors looking to position early in this cycle. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its scarcity-driven design, a fully defined token structure, and a clear trajectory toward market entry. Analysts tracking the presale phase highlight consistent inflow behavior, suggesting that strategic buyers are positioning well in advance of broader awareness. Rather than waiting for sentiment to catch up, these investors are reading the early signals — and acting accordingly. Ethereum Holds Structure, Eyes Breakout Triggers Ethereum is currently navigating a consolidation pattern that analysts suggest may precede a larger upward move. After forming a triple bottom and holding key long-term support, ETH appears technically positioned for continuation — assuming broader market conditions remain stable. On-chain activity remains strong, bolstered by increased use of Layer 2 scaling solutions and tokenization platforms built on Ethereum. While volatility may continue into the summer, technical indicators like RSI and MACD hint at growing bullish divergence if ETH can sustain current levels. Investors are closely watching for confirmation signals that could trigger accumulation before a broader rally. Cardano Faces Pressure but Holds Long-Term Promise Despite Cardano seeing some short-term pressure as it retests some structure support zones, analysts remain long-term bullish on the asset. The Midnight protocol airdrop and Plomin Hard Fork to decentralized governance is generating fundamental interest, even as short-term sentiment remains at a caution. Technical forecasts indicate that ADA could face further losses if it doesn’t maintain critical levels. Despite everything, investor interest is still supported by DeFi development, the integration of more stablecoins and enhanced smart contracts. People who invest keep a long-term view are using the price drop of ADA to reinvest. They believe once the coin’s price crosses the resistance level. Litecoin Maintains Support as Institutional Interest Rises Litecoin is proving to be very resilient as its transactions volume continues to pick up. Furthermore, the crypto is also increasingly being used for peer-to-peer transfers and merchant payments. Litecoin, whose narrative isn’t as bold and attention-grabbing as the other altcoins, continues to attract retail and institutional interest because of its role as a fast, secure and low-fee network. Analysts are suggesting the historical convergence zone of support will activate stronger rebounds with LTC price. The next few weeks could be very important, especially if the overall sentiment becomes more positive and momentum shifts towards value networks that have proven themselves. Final Thoughts: Watch the Leaders, Follow the Movers Ethereum, Cardano, and Litecoin remain foundational parts of the market, with each offering a unique blend of utility, infrastructure value, and investor loyalty. Their price action this summer will likely shape many portfolio decisions. But beyond the familiar names, MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing attention not through speculation, but through undeniable market behavior . With early-stage positioning nearly complete and analyst sentiment firmly aligned, it’s becoming the presale event that many are calling the defining opportunity of 2025.

Imagine waking up to news of hundreds of millions of dollars in Bitcoin suddenly shifting hands. That’s exactly what happened when Whale Alert, the renowned blockchain tracking service, flagged a massive movement of 2,500 BTC from the Bitfinex exchange to an unidentified wallet. Valued at approximately $267 million at the time of the transaction, this significant BTC movement immediately raised questions: Who is behind this? What are their intentions? And what does it mean for the broader market? Who Are These ‘Crypto Whales’ and Why Do They Matter? When we talk about a crypto whale , we’re referring to an individual or entity holding a substantial amount of cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence market prices with their trades. These aren’t your everyday retail investors; they’re the giants of the digital asset world. Their movements are meticulously tracked because a large buy or sell order can send shockwaves across the market, impacting Bitcoin’s price action and overall sentiment. Why do we pay such close attention? Market Influence: A whale moving funds to an exchange might signal an intent to sell, potentially leading to a price drop. Conversely, moving funds off an exchange to cold storage could indicate a long-term holding strategy, often seen as bullish. Liquidity Indicators: Their actions can provide insights into market liquidity and supply dynamics. Sentiment Barometer: Whale movements often serve as a psychological barometer for the market. Large, unexplained transfers can create fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) or, in some cases, signal institutional interest. Unpacking the Bitfinex Transaction: The Details The recent Bitfinex transaction , as reported by Whale Alert, involved a substantial sum. Bitfinex is one of the oldest and largest cryptocurrency exchanges, known for its deep liquidity and institutional client base. A transfer of this magnitude originating from such a prominent exchange naturally attracts significant attention. Here’s a quick breakdown of the key details: Metric Detail Amount Transferred 2,500 BTC Source Exchange Bitfinex Destination Unknown Wallet Approximate USD Value $267 Million Reported By Whale Alert This isn’t the first time Bitfinex has seen large outflows, but each significant Bitcoin transfer from a major exchange warrants careful consideration, especially when the destination remains a mystery. The Mystery of the Unknown Bitcoin Wallet: What Does It Mean? The destination, an unknown Bitcoin wallet , adds layers of intrigue and speculation to this already significant event. In the world of blockchain, while transactions are public, the identities behind the wallet addresses often remain pseudonymous. This anonymity can serve various purposes, from enhancing privacy to facilitating over-the-counter (OTC) deals. Possible reasons for moving funds to an unknown wallet include: Cold Storage: The whale might be moving funds from a hot wallet (connected to the internet, like an exchange) to a more secure cold storage solution (offline wallet) for long-term holding. This is often a sign of conviction in Bitcoin’s future price. OTC Deal: The funds could be part of a large over-the-counter transaction, where a buyer and seller directly exchange assets outside of a public exchange. These deals are common for large institutional trades to avoid market slippage. Consolidation: A whale might be consolidating funds from multiple sources into a single, new address for better management. Security Reasons: Moving funds off an exchange mitigates risks associated with exchange hacks or insolvency. Preparation for Future Activity: The funds might be moved in preparation for a major investment, a new venture, or even just rebalancing a portfolio. Without further on-chain analysis or direct confirmation from the entity involved, pinpointing the exact reason behind the move to an unknown Bitcoin wallet remains speculative. However, the sheer volume suggests a calculated and strategic decision. Decoding the Bitcoin Transfer Implications for the Market The sheer size of this Bitcoin transfer naturally leads to questions about its implications for the broader cryptocurrency market. While a single large transaction doesn’t necessarily dictate market direction, it can certainly influence sentiment and contribute to market narratives. Potential implications include: Market Sentiment: Unexplained large movements can trigger a degree of uncertainty among retail investors, sometimes leading to short-term price volatility. Supply Dynamics: If the BTC is moved to cold storage, it reduces the immediate circulating supply available on exchanges, which could be seen as bullish in the long run. If it’s moved to an unknown wallet that then sends it to another exchange, it could signal an upcoming sell-off. Security Focus: Such large transfers highlight the importance of robust security practices, both for exchanges and individual holders. Regulatory Scrutiny: As the crypto market matures, large, opaque transactions might attract increased attention from financial regulators, emphasizing the need for transparency in certain contexts. It’s important for investors not to react impulsively to such news but rather to consider it as one data point among many in their overall market analysis. How to Analyze Significant BTC Movement: Actionable Insights Understanding significant BTC movement is crucial for anyone navigating the volatile crypto landscape. While the average investor may not have access to the same sophisticated tools as institutional players, there are ways to interpret on-chain data and incorporate it into your strategy. Here are some actionable insights: Follow On-Chain Analytics: Services like Whale Alert provide real-time updates. More in-depth platforms offer detailed views of whale holdings, exchange inflows/outflows, and network activity. Distinguish Between Exchange Wallets and Private Wallets: Knowing whether funds are moving to or from an exchange is key. Funds moving to exchanges often suggest an intent to sell, while funds moving off exchanges typically indicate accumulation or cold storage. Look for Patterns: Is this an isolated incident, or part of a larger trend of whale activity? Consistent outflows from exchanges, for example, could signal a bullish accumulation phase. Don’t Panic: A single large transaction is rarely enough to crash or pump the market permanently. It’s one piece of a much larger puzzle. Focus on long-term trends and fundamental analysis. Diversify Your Information Sources: Combine on-chain data with technical analysis, macroeconomic factors, and news from reputable sources. These movements are a constant reminder of the dynamic and often opaque nature of the cryptocurrency market. They underscore the importance of staying informed and understanding the underlying mechanics of blockchain transactions. A Glimpse into the Crypto Undercurrents The 2,500 BTC transfer from Bitfinex to an unknown Bitcoin wallet serves as a potent reminder of the powerful forces at play in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This significant crypto whale activity, valued at $267 million, highlights the ongoing large-scale Bitcoin transfer events that continuously shape market sentiment and dynamics. While the exact motives behind this specific Bitfinex transaction remain shrouded in mystery, such a substantial BTC movement from a major exchange warrants close observation. Whether it signals a strategic accumulation, an institutional OTC deal, or simply a security-conscious move to cold storage, these whale activities are the undercurrents that can sometimes precede significant shifts in the digital asset landscape. For investors and enthusiasts alike, understanding these movements offers a fascinating glimpse into the mechanics and psychology of the crypto market, urging us to remain vigilant and informed.

The new product, set to debut Wednesday, ignited a wave of optimism among traders, briefly pushing SOL to $161 before settling at $157. Innovative ETF Structure Bypasses SEC Approval The ETF is being introduced by REX Shares in partnership with Osprey Funds. To sidestep the traditional SEC approval process, they created a taxable C-corporation. This structure, common in energy infrastructure investments, allows for quicker rollout but is less tax-efficient, taxing dividends at both the corporate and shareholder levels. Despite the ETF’s novelty, investors tempered expectations, recognizing that similar instruments could easily emerge for other altcoins. Limited Institutional Demand Raises Questions Grayscale’s Solana Trust (GSOL), operating for over two years, manages just $75 million in assets. By comparison, Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust held $10 billion one month before the Ethereum ETF’s launch. This discrepancy suggests that institutional appetite for SOL may be modest, even with the new ETF’s added staking feature. Staking Unlocks and DApp Selling Apply Pressure SOL’s rally faces additional hurdles. Roughly $585 million in SOL will unlock from staking in the next two months, adding potential sell pressure. Major Solana-based DApps have also offloaded significant holdings. In 2025 alone, the token launch platform Pump sent $404 million worth of SOL to exchanges. These sales may explain why SOL has moved in line with ETH and BNB over the past 30 days despite the ETF announcement. Funding Rates and Network Metrics Offer No Strong Support SOL’s annualized funding rate, a key leverage indicator, remains under 10%, indicating muted bullish sentiment. Meanwhile, Solana’s network revenue has plummeted over 90% since January. Even the rise in memecoin activity has failed to restore network health. The launch of tokenized stock trading on Ethereum’s layer-2 solutions, including partnerships with Robinhood and Coinbase, further undermines Solana’s appeal in the high-performance DApp sector. While the ETF has stirred interest, competition and weak fundamentals make a sustained rally above $200 unlikely for now.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|ETH|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-07-01 02:32:52

At the moment, XRP is hovering around $2.20 to $2.23, just under an important resistance zone. The price briefly pushed above $2.20 in the past 12 hours and is trying to hold above it. While the momentum isn’t strong yet, the charts suggest XRP could be setting up for a potential move. If buyers manage to lift the price and hold it above $2.21, it might see a quick rally toward $2.25. The next target after that would be around $2.31 to $2.35. On the downside, XRP has decent support between $2.14 and $2.10, with a stronger support area near $1.95 if the market turns lower. Breakout is Coming Analyst Casi Trades says XRP’s breakout is happening, but one key thing is still needed. The price is pushing toward $2.30, and the next big moment is whether it can hold $2.25 as new support after a pullback. If this level holds, it confirms real strength in the move. Momentum indicators like RSI are still strong, showing no early signs of weakness. If all goes well, the next targets are $2.69 and $3.04, with more upside possible after that. “Now, we’re watching for #XRP to revisit $2.25 and hold it cleanly. If it does, that’s the base for the move we’ve been waiting for. Breakout season is just getting started,” the analyst said. The EVM sidechain launch adds value to Ripple’s long-term plans, but it hasn’t triggered a big rally yet.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|WALLET|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-01 02:36:05

In a significant move set to reshape the landscape of online trading, Robinhood crypto is making headlines with its ambitious expansion into new frontiers. This isn’t just about offering more cryptocurrencies; it’s about bridging traditional finance with the decentralized world, bringing innovative financial products to a broader audience. What’s Driving Robinhood’s Global Crypto Expansion? Robinhood, traditionally known for democratizing stock trading, has been steadily increasing its footprint in the cryptocurrency space. Their latest strategic initiatives signal a clear intent to become a major player in the global digital asset market. These developments aim to cater to both European and U.S. users, offering a suite of advanced tools and products that were once exclusive to seasoned crypto traders or institutional investors. This expansion reflects the growing demand for more sophisticated and accessible crypto-native financial instruments. The push into new markets and product categories is driven by several factors: Increasing Demand: A growing global appetite for crypto assets and decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. Regulatory Evolution: Adapting to and navigating evolving regulatory frameworks in different jurisdictions to offer compliant products. Technological Advancement: Leveraging blockchain technology to create more efficient and accessible financial products. Competitive Landscape: Staying ahead in a rapidly evolving market by offering cutting-edge features. Unveiling Tokenized Stocks and ETFs for EU Users One of the most groundbreaking announcements is Robinhood’s launch of tokenized stocks and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) for its users in the European Union. But what exactly are tokenized stocks, and why are they a game-changer? Tokenized stocks are digital representations of traditional securities (like shares in Apple or Tesla) that exist on a blockchain. This means that ownership of a stock is recorded on a distributed ledger, offering several potential benefits: Fractional Ownership: Investors can buy small portions of high-priced stocks, making investing more accessible. 24/7 Trading: Unlike traditional markets that operate during specific hours, tokenized assets can potentially be traded around the clock. Increased Liquidity: By opening up trading to a global, always-on market, liquidity can improve. Transparency: Blockchain’s immutable ledger provides a transparent record of ownership. Lower Fees: Blockchain-based transactions can sometimes incur lower fees compared to traditional brokerage services. This move is particularly significant for EU users, providing them with a novel way to access global equity markets through a familiar and regulated platform like Robinhood. It represents a tangible step towards the convergence of traditional finance and blockchain technology, offering a glimpse into the future of investing. Diving into Perpetual Futures Trading with Bitstamp Beyond tokenized securities, Robinhood is also stepping into the derivatives market by facilitating perpetual futures trading for EU users, leveraging a partnership with Bitstamp. Perpetual futures are a popular type of derivative contract in the crypto world, allowing traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without an expiry date, unlike traditional futures contracts. Key aspects of perpetual futures include: No Expiration: Traders can hold positions indefinitely, as long as they meet margin requirements. Leverage: They often allow for significant leverage, amplifying both potential gains and losses. Funding Rates: A unique mechanism that ensures the perpetual futures price stays close to the spot price of the underlying asset. The introduction of perpetual futures trading via Bitstamp opens up advanced trading strategies for Robinhood’s EU clientele, enabling them to hedge existing positions, speculate on price movements, or gain exposure to crypto assets with capital efficiency. This offering signifies Robinhood’s commitment to providing a comprehensive suite of trading tools that cater to more sophisticated investor needs within the digital asset ecosystem. Building the Future: Robinhood’s Layer-2 for Real-World Assets Perhaps one of the most forward-looking initiatives is Robinhood’s plan to build its own Layer-2 (L2) blockchain on Arbitrum, specifically designed to support real-world assets (RWAs). This move is incredibly strategic and positions Robinhood at the cutting edge of blockchain innovation. What are Real-World Assets (RWAs)? RWAs refer to tangible and intangible assets from the traditional financial world that are tokenized and brought onto a blockchain. This can include anything from real estate, commodities, and art to bonds, invoices, and intellectual property. Tokenizing RWAs aims to: Increase Liquidity: Make illiquid assets more easily tradable. Improve Transparency: Provide a clear, immutable record of ownership and transactions. Reduce Costs: Streamline processes and reduce intermediaries. Expand Accessibility: Allow fractional ownership and global participation. By building its L2 on Arbitrum, a leading Ethereum scaling solution, Robinhood is ensuring that its RWA initiatives will benefit from Ethereum’s robust security while achieving faster transaction speeds and lower costs. This infrastructure development is crucial for handling the volume and complexity associated with tokenizing and trading traditional assets on a blockchain. It underscores Robinhood’s long-term vision of integrating traditional finance with decentralized technology, potentially creating new markets and investment opportunities. Enhanced Offerings for US Users: Ethereum Staking and Tax Tools While EU users are getting new trading instruments, Robinhood hasn’t forgotten its U.S. user base. According to Blockworks, U.S. users will soon gain access to Ethereum staking and Solana staking, alongside new crypto tax tools. These features address key pain points and opportunities for crypto investors in the U.S. Ethereum Staking: A Path to Passive Income Staking involves locking up cryptocurrency to support the operations of a proof-of-stake blockchain network, like Ethereum. In return, stakers earn rewards, similar to earning interest on a savings account. For Robinhood users, this means: Passive Income: An opportunity to earn rewards on their ETH holdings without actively trading. Network Security: Contributing to the security and decentralization of the Ethereum network. Simplicity: Robinhood will likely simplify the complex process of staking, making it accessible to a broader audience. The addition of Solana staking further diversifies the passive income opportunities. Moreover, the introduction of crypto tax tools is a much-needed feature for U.S. investors grappling with the complexities of crypto taxation. These tools will help users track their transactions, calculate capital gains and losses, and simplify tax reporting, making crypto investing less daunting from a compliance perspective. The Bigger Picture: What Does This Mean for Robinhood Crypto and the Industry? Robinhood’s latest announcements paint a picture of a company aggressively pursuing growth and innovation in the digital asset space. This multi-pronged strategy positions Robinhood crypto as a significant player, not just as a retail trading platform, but as an infrastructure builder for the future of finance. Here’s a quick overview of the geographical offerings: Feature Target Region Significance Tokenized Stocks & ETFs EU Users Bridging TradFi and Crypto, fractional ownership. Perpetual Futures (via Bitstamp) EU Users Advanced derivatives trading, hedging opportunities. Layer-2 on Arbitrum (for RWAs) Global (Infrastructure) Future-proofing for Real-World Assets, scalability. Ethereum & Solana Staking U.S. Users Passive income, simplified participation in PoS. Crypto Tax Tools U.S. Users Simplifying compliance, reducing tax burden. These moves could set a precedent for other traditional financial platforms looking to integrate deeply with the crypto economy. By offering a blend of traditional asset exposure through tokenization, advanced derivatives, and core crypto-native features like staking, Robinhood is positioning itself as a holistic digital asset hub. What Are the Potential Challenges and Opportunities Ahead? While the opportunities are vast, Robinhood will face challenges. Regulatory clarity remains a significant hurdle, particularly for novel products like tokenized stocks and perpetual futures across different jurisdictions. The competitive landscape is also fierce, with numerous crypto-native exchanges and DeFi protocols already offering similar services. However, Robinhood’s established brand, user-friendly interface, and existing customer base give it a strong advantage. If successfully executed, these initiatives could attract a new wave of investors to the crypto space, making digital assets more mainstream and accessible than ever before. Conclusion: A New Era for Robinhood and Digital Assets Robinhood’s ambitious expansion marks a pivotal moment for the platform and the broader digital asset industry. By pioneering tokenized stocks and ETFs in the EU, diving into perpetual futures , building a dedicated Layer-2 for real-world assets , and enhancing U.S. offerings with Ethereum staking and tax tools, Robinhood is not just adapting to the future of finance—it’s actively shaping it. This strategic evolution solidifies Robinhood crypto ‘s commitment to bridging the gap between traditional finance and the decentralized world, promising a more integrated and accessible financial ecosystem for users worldwide.

Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart recently announced that the “REX-Osprey SOL + Staking ETF,” a pioneering Solana ETF proposed by Rex Shares and Osprey Funds, could go live as early as this week. This imminent launch marks a significant milestone for the broader crypto ETF landscape, offering a novel avenue for mainstream investors to gain exposure to the high-performance Solana blockchain and its native SOL token, alongside the added benefit of staking rewards. What Exactly is a Solana ETF and Why Does it Matter? For many, the world of digital assets can seem complex and daunting. An Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) simplifies this by allowing investors to buy shares in a fund that holds underlying assets, without directly owning those assets. In this case, a Solana ETF would hold SOL tokens, providing an accessible, regulated investment vehicle. This matters because it bridges the gap between traditional finance and the rapidly evolving crypto market. Historically, investing in cryptocurrencies required navigating complex exchanges, managing private keys, and understanding blockchain mechanics. An ETF streamlines this process, making it as straightforward as buying a stock. This accessibility is crucial for attracting institutional capital and retail investors who prefer the familiarity and regulatory oversight of traditional investment products. It democratizes access to a dynamic asset class, allowing individuals and institutions to participate in the growth of the Solana ecosystem through familiar investment channels. The REX-Osprey Innovation: Pioneering Solana Staking in an ETF What makes the REX-Osprey offering particularly unique is its inclusion of Solana Staking . Staking is a process where cryptocurrency holders lock up their assets to support the operations of a proof-of-stake blockchain network, like Solana, and in return, earn rewards. This ETF is designed not only to track the price of Solana but also to potentially pass on these staking rewards to its investors. This dual benefit could make it an exceptionally attractive option for those seeking both capital appreciation and passive income. Think of it this way: instead of just holding SOL and hoping its price goes up, investors in this ETF could also benefit from the passive income generated through staking. This innovative structure differentiates it from many existing or proposed crypto investment products, adding an income-generating component that aligns with traditional investment strategies focused on yield. The integration of staking within an ETF framework represents a significant step forward, offering a more holistic investment proposition in the digital asset space. The Ascent of Institutional Crypto: Why Now? The impending launch of the REX-Osprey Solana ETF is not an isolated event but rather a symptom of a larger trend: the increasing embrace of institutional crypto . Major financial institutions, wealth managers, and even sovereign funds are actively exploring and allocating capital to digital assets. This shift is driven by several factors: Maturing Market: The cryptocurrency market has grown significantly in size, liquidity, and regulatory clarity over the past few years, shedding its early ‘Wild West’ image. Demand from Clients: Both retail and institutional clients are increasingly demanding exposure to digital assets for diversification, inflation hedging, and growth potential in a rapidly digitizing global economy. Technological Advancements: Innovations like Solana’s high-throughput blockchain, with its impressive transaction speeds and low fees, are proving their real-world utility beyond speculative trading, supporting a burgeoning ecosystem of decentralized applications. Regulatory Progress: While still evolving, regulatory frameworks for digital assets are becoming clearer in various jurisdictions, providing more confidence for traditional players to enter the space. This growing institutional interest is a powerful validation for the crypto space, signaling its transition from a niche, speculative asset class to a recognized component of diversified investment portfolios. The availability of regulated products like this ETF is key to facilitating this transition, providing the necessary infrastructure for large-scale adoption. Unlocking New Digital Asset Funds and Opportunities The introduction of a Solana ETF with staking capabilities could open the floodgates for more diverse digital asset funds . As investors become more comfortable with regulated crypto products, we may see a proliferation of ETFs and other structured products tracking various cryptocurrencies, DeFi protocols, or even NFTs. This expands the investment universe beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum, allowing for more granular exposure to specific segments of the crypto economy. For investors, this means: Diversification: Access to a broader range of digital assets, reducing reliance on just one or two major cryptocurrencies and allowing for more nuanced portfolio construction. Ease of Access: Investing through traditional brokerage accounts, eliminating the need for crypto wallets, complex exchange registrations, or managing private keys. Professional Management: The fund is managed by professionals, handling the intricacies of asset custody, rebalancing, and staking operations, thereby reducing the operational burden and technical risks for individual investors. This evolution makes the crypto market more accessible and appealing to a wider investor base, potentially leading to increased liquidity, market stability, and overall maturation of the digital asset ecosystem. Navigating the Path: Challenges and Considerations While the prospect of a Solana ETF is exciting, it’s important for investors to be aware of potential challenges and considerations: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies, including Solana, are known for their significant price fluctuations. An ETF tracking SOL will be subject to this inherent volatility, meaning its value can rise or fall sharply in short periods. Regulatory Environment: The regulatory landscape for digital assets is still evolving globally. Changes in regulations could impact the fund’s operations, its ability to offer staking rewards, or investor sentiment, leading to unforeseen risks. Staking Risks: While staking offers rewards, it also comes with risks such as “slashing” (penalties for validator misconduct or downtime) or liquidity constraints if staked assets are locked for a period. The ETF provider would need robust mechanisms to mitigate these risks and ensure the fund’s stability. Fees: Like all ETFs, there will be management fees that could eat into returns, especially compared to direct asset ownership and self-staking. Investors should carefully review the expense ratio. Prospective investors should conduct thorough due diligence, understand the fund’s prospectus, and consider their individual risk tolerance before investing in any crypto-related product, including this innovative crypto ETF . What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Investment? The launch of the REX-Osprey Solana ETF is more than just another product; it’s a testament to the increasing maturity and mainstream acceptance of the digital asset space. It signifies a growing confidence from traditional financial institutions in the underlying technology and economic models of cryptocurrencies. This could set a precedent for future innovations, including more staking-enabled ETFs for other proof-of-stake networks, further integrating yield-generating opportunities into regulated investment products. This development is likely to accelerate the integration of crypto into traditional finance, making it easier for institutions and individuals to participate in this transformative asset class. It’s a clear signal that institutional crypto is here to stay and will continue to shape the future of global finance, paving the way for a more accessible and diversified investment landscape. Conclusion: A New Era for Digital Asset Investment The impending launch of the REX-Osprey Solana ETF marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency market. By combining the accessibility of an ETF with the yield potential of Solana Staking , it offers a sophisticated yet user-friendly gateway to one of the most promising blockchain ecosystems. This move not only validates Solana’s growing importance but also signifies a broader trend towards regulated, institutional-grade access to digital assets. As the lines between traditional finance and crypto continue to blur, this ETF stands as a beacon for the future of investment, promising enhanced opportunities for investors worldwide.

Robinhood EU , the popular investment platform, has just made an exciting announcement that could put a piece of the world’s most innovative private companies, OpenAI and SpaceX, right into your portfolio. This isn’t just any giveaway; it’s a chance to own tokenized stocks , representing a cutting-edge shift in how we think about ownership and digital assets . What’s the Buzz Around Robinhood EU’s Latest Move? In a bold move that’s set the European investment scene abuzz, Robinhood EU recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to reveal an exclusive offer for its qualifying users. The platform is giving away tokenized shares of two highly sought-after, privately-held companies: OpenAI and SpaceX. This initiative isn’t just a marketing stunt; it signals Robinhood’s commitment to expanding access to unique investment opportunities for its European user base. This limited-time offer provides a unique chance for eligible users to claim these tokens by July 7. It’s a strategic play by Robinhood to enhance its presence in the competitive European market, distinguishing itself by offering access to assets typically out of reach for individual retail investors. Understanding Tokenized Stocks: Are They the Future of Digital Assets? The term “ tokenized stocks ” might sound complex, but it’s essentially about representing traditional company shares on a blockchain. Think of it as digitizing ownership. Instead of holding a physical stock certificate or an entry in a traditional brokerage database, you hold a digital token that represents a share of a company’s equity. These tokens are typically issued on a blockchain, offering several potential benefits: Fractional Ownership: Tokenization often allows for the division of assets into much smaller, more affordable units, making high-value shares accessible to a broader range of investors. Increased Liquidity: Potentially enabling 24/7 trading on global markets, unlike traditional stock exchanges with limited hours. Enhanced Transparency: Blockchain’s immutable ledger provides a clear, verifiable record of ownership and transactions.

This politically charged token has emerged as one of 2025’s most talked-about opportunities, and analysts believe its asymmetric setup could deliver more during the next bull cycle. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Drawing Strategic Capital MAGACOIN FINANCE is a project which has gained traction due to the early-stage token mechanics, scarcity-based model, and cultural relatability. MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as perhaps the most asymmetric play for 2025 thanks to the speed at which every presale phase has sold out and the multi-stage upside analyst projections has us seeing. What makes this different isn’t comparison or social chatter. It’s the structure. The contract has been audited, the supply mechanics are disciplined, and presale momentum is rapid. These are potent conditions that appeal to retail and institutional investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE has been flagged as one of the few assets that can actually tilt portfolio returns by analysts, with some projection as the token goes from presale to being accessibly available in the market. XRP Faces Tight Resistance, But Long-Term Momentum Builds XRP has recently broken out technically on the back of volume and increased institutional activity. Following a recent successful flip of critical resistance zones, a longer-term uptrend appears likely. Still, traders are cautious as the potential upside is limited by upper resistance that capped the past rallies. Even if we’re uncertain in the immediate term, most think XRP is bullish in the long term. Institutional adoption is accelerating, exchange reserves are declining, and market structure facilitates a multi-year potential rise. Nonetheless, some investors may be flipping capital into high-upside opportunities while XRP’s next move is developing. Solana Retains Strength, But Traders Eye Pullback or Breakout Solana has held firm amid market volatility, sustaining strong support and maintaining high trading volume. Institutional interest is rising, and analysts highlight Solana’s positioning as a key infrastructure player in the tokenized economy. Yet, much like XRP, SOL is navigating a tight technical channel. While momentum suggests potential upside, price action remains pinned below major resistance. As a result, some investors are seeking more aggressive growth plays with earlier entry points. Investor Behavior Is Shifting As XRP and Solana stabilize and test key levels, capital rotation is underway. Savvy investors are diversifying into tokens that offer high-reward setups with strong foundational credibility. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its growing traction and strategic visibility, is fast becoming a top allocation choice. Its political branding and economic timing have created a rare alignment — a token that’s both narrative-rich and structurally sound. For those seeking upside without excessive dilution or timeline constraints, the project represents a compelling option. Final Thoughts Recalibration is the theme of crypto market 2025. XRP and Solana may still have their fanbase, but the likes of MAGACOIN FINANCE has caught attention with its early-stage setup and potential. With analysts flagging it for exponential upside and investors positioning ahead of broader exposure, the window to enter may not stay open for long.

What July Hides For Bitcoin The numbers support the observation. According to the Coinglass dataset, the mean return for June over the past twelve years is essentially zero (-0.12 %), while July posts a respectable +7.56% on average and an even stronger +8.90 % on the median. August cools to a modest +1.75% mean, and September is where the sell-side pressure historically bites, averaging -3.77% with a negative median of -4.35%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Freezes Over $100,000 As OG Whales ‘Dump On Wall Street’: Expert A simple frequency count underscores the asymmetry: July has finished green in eight of the last twelve years, whereas August and September managed only four positive outcomes each. Years that veterans still recall – 2017’s +65.32 % August melt-up followed by a -7.44 % September slide, or 2020’s +24.03 % July rally that surrendered to a -7.51 % September pullback – appear to have etched the “big flush-out” narrative into collective memory. Daan’s takeaway is behavioural rather than predictive: “August & September are where we often see a big flush-out but are also the dips you often want to be buying into the end-of-the-year rally… it’s good to be aware of these seasonalities. That way you can focus more on the larger timeframe and won’t get spooked or get over-excited too easily.” The comment arrives just as Bitcoin tests a cluster of long-timeframe resistances. In a post on Saturday he reminded followers that BTC is “close to all-time high but at resistance… [it] is yet to close a weekly or more than two consecutive daily candles above that resistance. Once it does, we can start getting excited for a larger move.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Bears Are Taking Fresh Market Positions, But Are They Safe? The seasonality conversation matters because it collides with a crowded macro calendar and a notoriously illiquid holiday stretch. While historical averages do not guarantee future performance, the heat-map suggests that directional conviction often returns in October – the best-performing month on the table with a +21.89 % mean. For traders, that leaves a two-month corridor in which whipsaw moves are common and positioning discipline becomes paramount. Daan extends the framework to altcoins via the TOTAL3 index (crypto market cap excluding Bitcoin and Ether). “The TOTAL Altcoin Market Cap has held on to its local support but is still not showing any clear trend… to really get this high timeframe move going you want to break those local highs above the ~$950 B mark. At that point you can start aiming for cycle highs.” Whether 2025 repeats the seasonality script will hinge on the macro environment, ETF inflows and, above all, Bitcoin’s ability to convert resistance into fresh price discovery. Until that weekly close arrives, seasoned traders appear content to keep summer expectations firmly tethered to the data – exactly as Daan recommends. At press time, BTC traded at $107,344.

Ripple, a major player in the blockchain space, has officially launched the XRPL EVM Sidechain on mainnet. This isn’t just another update; it’s a monumental step that brings Ethereum-compatible smart contracts directly to the XRP Ledger. For anyone invested in the future of digital finance and decentralized technology, this move signifies a powerful leap forward, promising to unlock new possibilities for developers and users alike. What is the XRPL EVM Sidechain and Why is it a Game-Changer? At its core, the XRPL EVM Sidechain is an innovative bridge connecting two distinct, yet powerful, blockchain ecosystems: the XRP Ledger and Ethereum. Historically, these networks operated largely in isolation, each with its unique strengths and weaknesses. The XRP Ledger, known for its speed and efficiency in processing payments, lacked native smart contract capabilities comparable to Ethereum’s robust ecosystem. Ethereum, on the other hand, boasts the largest and most vibrant decentralized application (dApp) ecosystem but often grapples with scalability issues and high transaction fees. This sidechain changes everything. It allows developers to deploy smart contracts written in Solidity (Ethereum’s primary smart contract language) directly onto a network that is deeply integrated with the XRP Ledger. Think of it as opening a superhighway between two bustling cities that were previously connected only by slow, winding roads. This integration means that the vast universe of Ethereum dApps can now potentially leverage the speed and low transaction costs associated with the XRP Ledger, creating a powerful synergy that benefits the entire Web3 community. Bridging Worlds: The Fusion of XRP Ledger and Ethereum dApps For years, the blockchain industry has sought true interoperability – the ability for different blockchain networks to communicate and interact seamlessly. The launch of the XRPL EVM Sidechain is a significant stride in this direction. The XRP Ledger has always been a powerhouse for fast, low-cost transactions, making it ideal for payments and token issuance. However, its original design did not prioritize complex smart contract functionality to the extent seen on Ethereum. By integrating the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) – the computational engine that powers Ethereum’s smart contracts – into a sidechain, the XRP Ledger ecosystem gains immediate access to a mature and widely adopted development environment. This means that decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces, gaming dApps, and countless other applications that thrive on Ethereum can now find a new home on a network known for its efficiency. It’s about bringing the best of both worlds together, offering developers more choices and users more accessible, high-performance applications. A New Era for Developers: Building on the Ripple Blockchain The impact of this development on developers is profound.

Are you ready to explore how this new fund could reshape the future of corporate treasuries? What is the Digital Asset Treasury Fund (DAT Fund) and Why Now? The newly established digital asset treasury fund , or DAT Fund, is designed to provide structured and secure pathways for large entities to gain exposure to the burgeoning world of cryptocurrencies. Unlike traditional crypto funds often geared towards individual or high-net-worth investors, the DAT Fund specifically caters to the unique needs and regulatory considerations of corporate and institutional investors. This includes corporations, endowments, pension funds, and family offices looking to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on the growth potential of digital assets. The timing of this launch by Pantera Capital is particularly pertinent. In recent years, we’ve witnessed a dramatic shift in perception surrounding digital assets. What was once considered a niche, volatile asset class is now increasingly recognized for its potential as a hedge against inflation, a source of uncorrelated returns, and a frontier for technological innovation. Corporations, in particular, are grappling with negative real interest rates and the need to optimize their balance sheets. Holding significant cash reserves in a low-yield environment can erode purchasing power over time. The DAT Fund offers an alternative, professionally managed solution to address these challenges. How Does the DAT Fund Facilitate Cryptocurrency Investment? For many corporate treasuries, direct exposure to cryptocurrencies presents a myriad of operational and compliance hurdles. Managing private keys, navigating complex regulatory frameworks across different jurisdictions, and ensuring robust security protocols can be daunting. The DAT Fund aims to simplify this process, offering a streamlined approach to cryptocurrency investment . Here’s how it typically works: Professional Management: The fund is managed by Pantera Capital’s team of experts, who possess deep knowledge of the digital asset market, including market trends, risk management, and security best practices. Diversified Exposure: Rather than investing in a single cryptocurrency, the DAT Fund likely offers exposure to a diversified portfolio of digital assets, mitigating individual asset volatility and enhancing overall portfolio stability. Enhanced Security: Leveraging institutional-grade custody solutions and robust security protocols, the fund minimizes the risks associated with holding digital assets directly. Regulatory Compliance: The fund is structured to adhere to relevant financial regulations, providing peace of mind for compliance-sensitive institutional investors. Liquidity Management: While details specific to the DAT Fund’s liquidity are proprietary, institutional funds typically aim to balance liquidity needs with long-term growth objectives, often through redemption windows or secondary market access. This structure allows corporations to gain exposure to the asset class without the need to build out their own internal crypto expertise or infrastructure, making it an attractive proposition for those new to the space. Why Are Institutional Investors Turning to Digital Assets? The shift among institutional investors towards digital assets is driven by several compelling factors. It’s not merely about chasing high returns, but about strategic portfolio diversification and adapting to a rapidly evolving financial landscape. Consider these key drivers: Factor Explanation Inflation Hedge With unprecedented monetary expansion, many institutions view Bitcoin, often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ and other scarce digital assets as a potential hedge against inflation and currency debasement. Portfolio Diversification Cryptocurrencies have historically shown low correlation with traditional asset classes like stocks and bonds, offering valuable diversification benefits to a balanced portfolio. Technological Innovation Investment in digital assets is also an investment in the underlying blockchain technology, which promises to revolutionize various industries from finance to supply chain management. Growth Potential Despite past volatility, the long-term growth trajectory of the digital asset market remains attractive, driven by increasing adoption and technological advancements. Demographic Shift Younger generations of investors and beneficiaries are increasingly comfortable with and demand exposure to digital assets, influencing institutional allocation decisions. Pantera Capital’s DAT Fund capitalizes on these trends, providing a vehicle that aligns with the evolving investment mandates of large-scale capital allocators. Pantera Capital’s Expertise in Blockchain Technology The credibility of the DAT Fund is significantly bolstered by the reputation and extensive experience of its creator, Pantera Capital. Established in 2003, Pantera Capital transitioned its focus to blockchain technology and digital assets in 2013, making it one of the earliest and most experienced institutional investors in the space. Their long track record spans multiple market cycles, offering invaluable insights and strategic positioning. Pantera’s expertise in blockchain technology extends beyond mere investment. They have been instrumental in fostering the growth of the ecosystem, investing in a wide array of projects from foundational protocols to decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This deep understanding of the underlying technology, coupled with their extensive network within the crypto community, positions them uniquely to identify promising opportunities and manage the complexities inherent in this nascent asset class. Their long-standing presence provides a layer of trust and sophistication that many new entrants to the digital asset fund space may lack. The Broader Impact: Reshaping Corporate Treasuries The launch of the DAT Fund by Pantera Capital is more than just a new investment product; it’s a bellwether for a significant shift in corporate finance. As more corporations consider digital assets, the role of the corporate treasury is evolving from a purely risk-averse function to one that strategically seeks growth and diversification. This includes: Strategic Asset Allocation: Treasuries may begin to allocate a small percentage of their reserves to digital assets as part of a long-term strategic plan. Risk Management Evolution: New frameworks for assessing and managing the unique risks of digital assets will emerge. Operational Integration: Integration of digital asset management into existing financial systems and reporting structures. Talent Development: A growing need for treasury professionals with expertise in digital assets and blockchain. This fund serves as a bridge, connecting the traditional world of corporate finance with the innovative realm of digital assets, potentially paving the way for a new standard in treasury management. Actionable Insights for Prospective Investors For corporate and institutional investors considering the Pantera Capital DAT Fund, or similar digital asset offerings, here are some actionable insights: Conduct Thorough Due Diligence: Understand the fund’s investment strategy, underlying assets, risk management framework, and fee structure. Assess the manager’s track record and expertise. Define Your Investment Objectives: Clearly articulate why you are considering digital assets. Is it for diversification, inflation hedging, or growth? This will help align with the right fund. Start Small and Scale Up: Given the nascent nature of the asset class, consider starting with a small, conservative allocation and gradually increasing it as you gain comfort and understanding. Consult with Experts: Engage with financial advisors, legal counsel, and tax professionals who specialize in digital assets to understand the implications for your specific organization. Stay Informed: The digital asset space is dynamic. Continuous education on market trends, regulatory changes, and technological advancements is crucial. Conclusion: A New Era for Institutional Crypto Adoption Pantera Capital’s introduction of the digital asset treasury fund is a landmark event, signifying a robust institutional embrace of cryptocurrencies. By offering a professionally managed, secure, and compliant vehicle, the DAT Fund addresses many of the barriers that have historically prevented corporate and institutional investors from entering the digital asset space. This move by a leading firm like Pantera Capital not only validates the asset class but also accelerates the integration of cryptocurrency investment into mainstream finance. As the world continues to digitalize, the foresight to leverage cutting-edge blockchain technology for treasury management will become a key differentiator for forward-thinking organizations. The DAT Fund represents a significant step towards a future where digital assets are a standard component of sophisticated financial strategies.

The recent announcement that Zodia Custody , a leading institutional-grade crypto custodian, has successfully acquired UAE-based Tungsten Custody Solutions, is one such pivotal moment. This isn’t just another corporate deal; it’s a powerful statement about the growing maturity of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, particularly in the Middle East, and a clear sign of traditional finance’s increasing embrace of digital assets. For anyone tracking the institutional adoption of crypto, this development offers profound insights into the future of secure digital asset management and regulatory compliance. Understanding the Players: Who is Zodia Custody ? Before diving into the implications of this acquisition, it’s essential to understand the core entities involved. Zodia Custody stands out in the crowded crypto space due to its unique backing. Launched by Standard Chartered, a global banking giant with a strong presence across Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, Zodia Custody brings a level of institutional rigor and trust that many crypto-native firms are still striving to achieve. Their mission has always been clear: to provide secure, compliant, and reliable digital asset custody services for institutional investors. This means handling cryptocurrencies with the same level of security and regulatory oversight traditionally applied to conventional financial assets. Their foundation is further strengthened by strategic partnerships, including Emirates NBD, one of the largest banking groups in the Middle East. This dual backing from major banks underscores a critical trend: traditional financial institutions are not just observing the crypto market from the sidelines but are actively participating, building the necessary infrastructure to support institutional adoption. This institutional pedigree gives Zodia a significant edge, especially in regions like the UAE, which are keen on attracting legitimate and well-regulated crypto businesses. Why the UAE? The Growing Significance of Crypto Custody UAE The United Arab Emirates has rapidly emerged as a global hub for innovation, technology, and increasingly, digital assets. Its proactive regulatory approach and strategic location make it an attractive destination for crypto businesses looking to expand their global footprint. The demand for robust Crypto Custody UAE solutions has surged as more institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals in the region seek secure ways to hold their digital assets. Tungsten Custody Solutions, the acquired entity, had already established a foothold in this promising market. Their local expertise, understanding of regional nuances, and existing client base provide Zodia Custody with an invaluable springboard. The acquisition effectively fast-tracks Zodia’s expansion plans, allowing them to immediately tap into the burgeoning UAE crypto market without having to build from scratch. This strategic move is a testament to the UAE’s vision of becoming a leading digital economy, where regulated and secure crypto services are not just tolerated but actively encouraged. Key factors driving the demand for secure crypto custody in the UAE include: Institutional Interest: A growing number of family offices, sovereign wealth funds, and traditional financial institutions in the region are exploring digital asset investments. Regulatory Clarity: The UAE’s efforts to create a clear regulatory framework provide confidence for businesses and investors. Technological Adoption: A tech-savvy population and government initiatives promote blockchain and digital asset innovation. Navigating the Regulatory Landscape: The Pursuit of a VARA License Perhaps one of the most critical aspects of this acquisition is its direct link to Zodia Custody’s pursuit of a full Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license from Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA). The VARA License is a gold standard in the global crypto regulatory landscape, signifying a robust commitment to compliance, security, and investor protection. VARA was established to regulate virtual assets and virtual asset activities across Dubai (excluding the Dubai International Financial Centre, which has its own regulatory body). Its mandate is to create a safe and progressive environment for virtual asset innovation, while also mitigating risks associated with money laundering, terrorist financing, and consumer protection. Obtaining a full VASP license from VARA is a rigorous process, requiring applicants to demonstrate stringent controls over security, governance, risk management, and compliance. How does the Tungsten acquisition aid Zodia in this pursuit? Tungsten’s existing operations and understanding of the local regulatory environment likely provide Zodia with: Local Expertise: Insights into VARA’s specific requirements and processes. Operational Readiness: Pre-existing infrastructure and operational frameworks that can be adapted to VARA’s standards. Market Credibility: A demonstrated commitment to operating within the UAE’s regulatory expectations. This strategic alignment positions Zodia Custody strongly to become a fully licensed and regulated custodian in one of the world’s most forward-thinking jurisdictions for digital assets. A VARA license would not only enhance Zodia’s credibility but also provide institutional clients with the assurance that their assets are held with a fully compliant entity. A Trend in Motion: The Strategic Digital Asset Acquisition Wave The Zodia Custody-Tungsten deal is not an isolated incident but rather indicative of a broader trend: the increasing wave of Digital Asset Acquisition and consolidation within the cryptocurrency industry. As the market matures, companies are looking beyond organic growth to strategic mergers and acquisitions as a means to expand market share, acquire talent, gain regulatory advantages, and diversify service offerings. What drives this acquisition trend? Regulatory Clarity: As jurisdictions like the UAE establish clearer rules, firms with existing licenses or strong compliance frameworks become attractive targets. Market Consolidation: A fragmented market is slowly consolidating, with stronger, better-capitalized players acquiring smaller, specialized firms. Access to New Markets: Acquisitions provide immediate access to new geographical markets and client bases. Talent and Technology: Acquiring firms can gain access to specialized talent, proprietary technology, and operational expertise. Institutional Demand: As more institutions enter the space, the demand for integrated, comprehensive services grows, prompting firms to expand their capabilities through M&A. This trend signifies a maturation of the digital asset industry, moving away from its nascent, often unregulated, beginnings towards a more structured and institutionalized future. It’s a clear signal that serious capital is flowing into building the foundational infrastructure for the next phase of crypto adoption. Impact on the UAE Crypto Market : What Does This Mean for the Region? The acquisition has significant implications for the broader UAE Crypto Market . It reinforces the country’s commitment to becoming a global leader in the digital economy and a safe haven for virtual asset innovation. Here’s how this deal could shape the landscape: Increased Institutional Confidence: The presence of a well-backed, regulated custodian like Zodia Custody will instill greater confidence among traditional financial institutions and large corporations looking to enter the crypto space. Attracting Foreign Investment: A robust regulatory and custodial infrastructure makes the UAE even more attractive for foreign direct investment into the digital asset sector. Fostering a Compliant Ecosystem: The focus on obtaining a VARA license emphasizes the importance of compliance, pushing other market participants towards higher standards. Innovation and Growth: With secure infrastructure in place, the UAE crypto market can expect to see further innovation in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and other blockchain-based applications. This move positions the UAE not just as a hub for crypto trading, but as a critical center for the underlying infrastructure that supports the entire digital asset ecosystem. It demonstrates a strategic vision to build a sustainable and regulated market, rather than just chasing short-term trends. Benefits of This Strategic Move The Zodia Custody acquisition of Tungsten brings a multitude of benefits, not just for the entities involved but for the wider digital asset ecosystem: Enhanced Market Reach: Zodia Custody immediately expands its footprint in a key strategic region, gaining access to Tungsten’s existing client base and local market knowledge. Regulatory Advantage: The acquisition significantly aids Zodia’s pursuit of a full VARA license, positioning them as a leading regulated custodian in Dubai. Strengthened Institutional Trust: The combined expertise and regulatory focus provide greater assurance for institutional clients seeking secure and compliant digital asset solutions. Operational Synergies: Integration of technologies and teams can lead to more efficient operations and enhanced service offerings. Contribution to UAE’s Vision: The deal supports the UAE’s ambition to be a global leader in digital assets by bringing in high-standard, bank-backed infrastructure. Looking Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities While the acquisition is a significant positive step, it’s important to acknowledge that integration processes can present their own set of challenges. Merging two distinct operational cultures, technological stacks, and client bases requires careful planning and execution. Furthermore, the regulatory landscape for digital assets is constantly evolving, requiring continuous adaptation and vigilance from custodians. However, the opportunities far outweigh the challenges. With a strong presence in the UAE, Zodia Custody is well-positioned to capitalize on the increasing institutional demand for digital assets across the Middle East and beyond. This expansion could lead to the development of new products and services tailored to the region’s specific needs, further solidifying Zodia’s role as a pioneer in institutional crypto custody. Conclusion: A New Era for Institutional Crypto in the Middle East The acquisition of Tungsten Custody Solutions by Zodia Custody marks a powerful moment for the institutional cryptocurrency landscape, particularly in the Middle East. It underscores the growing maturity of the digital asset market, the increasing importance of robust regulatory frameworks, and the strategic foresight of traditional financial institutions embracing the future of finance. As Zodia Custody solidifies its presence and pursues its VARA License , it paves the way for greater trust, security, and mainstream adoption of digital assets within the UAE Crypto Market . This Digital Asset Acquisition is more than just a business transaction; it’s a testament to the UAE’s progressive stance and a clear indicator of where the future of secure digital asset management is headed.

Bitcoin price gains in early Q2 helped reignite momentum across the market. But it’s not just Bitcoin leading the charge — altcoins like XRP, Solana, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are drawing massive attention from analysts, institutional buyers, and early investors. While some tokens are still recovering, others have surged forward. XRP is climbing off a multi-month bottom, Solana is gaining on DeFi strength, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming the unexpected powerhouse. In this article, we dive into all three, based on data, analyst insight, and market direction, and explore how they stack up heading into Q3 2025. 1. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Underdog With Explosive Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the most watched crypto presale of 2025. This isn’t by accident — the project combines a fixed supply of 170 billion tokens with a fully audited smart contract by HashEx. There are no VC unlocks, no hidden emissions, and no inflation tricks. That’s winning serious trust from investors. Analysts point to MAGACOIN FINANCE as a top performer based on fundamentals. Unlike many tokens that rely on hype, MAGACOIN is driven by structure — and that’s what large buyers want in 2025. The presale model rewards early access, and the rising entry price every few hours is pushing urgency. But MAGACOIN isn’t just technical. Its political branding and strong viral reach have created a high-energy movement. Presale is selling out soon, and early investor interest is climbing daily. For those looking to catch major upside before listings, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the standout choice this cycle. 2. XRP Price Prediction & News: Ripple Lawsuit Update and Bullish Momentum XRP is in the news again, and this time for an amazing reason. The RippleX team recently issued version 2.5.0 of the XRP Ledger. The new update brings with it new features including TokenEscrow, Batch transactions, and Permissioned DEX access. These new features are attracting institutional partners and developers to XRP. Legally, the Ripple vs. SEC case remains pending, and the two sides are requesting the stays on appeals. A mid-August 2025 status report is due, but nothing sensational is to be anticipated before then. However, legal uncertainty has not stopped XRP’s momentum. XRP price chart 2025 breakout Technical experts pay close attention to the XRP price forecast 2025 levels. Having broken out of a long-term wedge pattern, XRP is currently testing the $2.20 support level. If momentum holds, XRP price prediction 2025 suggests a surge toward $5–$10, especially if the symmetrical triangle that’s been forming for over 330 days confirms a breakout. XRP news lawsuit updates and market signals remain bullish as summer continues. 3. Solana 2025 Outlook: USDC Boom, DeFi Growth, and Price Targets Solana has been on a tear. SOL is up from its recent low and is now facing key resistance between $148 and $150. Analysts are calling $155 the trigger point — if SOL can move above that range, it could quickly aim for $200. Some even believe $300 is on the table if current trends hold. The real driver behind Solana’s rise is its exploding DeFi and stablecoin ecosystem. Circle recently minted another $6 billion in USDC on Solana. The total USDC supply on the network now sits at $11.1 billion — more than double what it was in January. Institutional momentum is building fast. ETF filings, protocol upgrades, and deeper stablecoin liquidity are making Solana a favorite among high-volume traders. Analysts believe Solana has reclaimed its spot as one of the most important platforms in crypto. Final Thoughts XRP and Solana are showing strength, both technically and fundamentally. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is standing out for its aggressive growth strategy, strong investor response, and transparent mechanics. For the investors looking for the highest return potential in 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE is definitely the place to be. Every headline points to one clear trend — MAGACOIN FINANCE is taking over the conversation and is the crypto presale to watch.

But in reality, this designation is earned, not declared. It emerges from collective behavior, infrastructure maturation and social consensus. Gold wasn’t born a store of value – it became one over centuries of trust, utility and institutionalization. Furthermore, even assets that were once synonymous with broken dreams and vaporware can become part of the store of value narrative. In the early 2000s, tech stocks were associated with unsustainable speculation. But here we are two decades later – tech companies account for nearly half of the S&P 500, the benchmark index for generational value. Both gold and tech stocks went through periods when they were misunderstood or even mocked. Yet, they endured, not because they avoided speculation and volatility, but because over time they proved structurally relevant. Bitcoin appears to be walking the same path. Proven value-keeping and resilience By design, Bitcoin incorporates many store of value fundamentals, including scarcity, portability and divisibility. However, some aspects can’t be embedded – they require time to prove. One of these is the ability to hold value across time. A good way to assess this is through reverse pricing. For instance, if priced in gold, the US dollar and Euro have lost around 66% of their value since 2016, and these are among the most stable fiat currencies. Adding Bitcoin to the mix makes fiat currencies appear even weaker, having lost over 99% of their value relative to Bitcoin, as it outperformed gold by nearly 80 times over the same period. Another store of value aspect that requires time-testing is the ability to withstand crises. So far, Bitcoin has shown solid resilience during turbulent periods, sometimes outperforming traditional assets. One illustrative example is Bitcoin’s behavior during Donald Trump’s tariff-related market turmoil. In the week following ‘Liberation Day,’ Bitcoin outperformed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100, as well as APAC and European equities. It later surpassed gold as well, recording a 13% monthly gain. While some on Wall Street found this “impressive,” historical data suggests it’s more of a pattern than a coincidence. Even after the COVID-19 outbreak, when Bitcoin lost over 30% in a single week, it managed to recover and began outperforming the broader market in less than two months. Decreased volatility and increased liquidity The core criticism against Bitcoin as a store of value centers on its volatility. But volatility is not fixed – it evolves with adoption and market integration. Gold was highly volatile during the 1970s and early 1980s as it re-monetized after the end of the Bretton Woods system. Similarly, Bitcoin has experienced volatility in its early stages while finding its place in the financial landscape. But that volatility is consistently declining. In 2024, Fidelity noted that Bitcoin was less volatile than 33 stocks in the S&P 500, and that its volatility has been steadily decreasing as the asset class matures and its market cap grows. In 2025, this trend continued , with lower volatility peaks being recorded. As a result, Bitcoin now offers more stability than explosive growth, with a CAGR aligning more closely with gold and other store of value assets. Bitcoin’s growing institutional adoption and liquidity have been key drivers behind this shift. Over the past year, Bitcoin’s two-percent market depth on spot markets increased by 60% . Most of it came from US-based exchanges, which are increasingly focused on institutional clients. This also led to Bitcoin’s trading volume being more concentrated around US trading hours. Another factor is the increasing dominance of long-term holders, particularly with each new four-year halving cycle. These holders are generally indifferent to daily price movements and display relatively passive market behavior. This means that a store of value narrative surrounding Bitcoin is gradually pushing away the one focusing on short-term speculation. Final thoughts Bitcoin is still widely perceived as a volatile, high-risk asset, and there are valid reasons for that. But it would be careless to ignore its ongoing evolution toward becoming a legitimate store of value. No other asset is even attempting to secure this status, let alone getting as close. However, Bitcoin’s journey is far from over. Investors may want to periodically reassess their perspectives. Many views once used to define Bitcoin are becoming outdated. So instead of replaying the same old track, perhaps it’s time to take another look, with a long-term lens. Oleksandr Lutskevych is the founder and CEO of CEX.IO .

Fresh off a public listing that valued the company at nearly $18b, Circle has filed an application to become a national trust bank in the United States, Reuters reported Tuesday. If approved by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the new entity, called First National Digital Currency Bank, N.A., would allow Circle to act as a custodian for its reserves and offer secure digital asset services to institutional clients. However, unlike traditional banks, it would not be permitted to accept cash deposits or issue loans. Exclusive: Circle applies for US trust bank license after bumper IPO https://t.co/bnsIZpO7Wq https://t.co/bnsIZpO7Wq — Reuters (@Reuters) July 1, 2025 Circle Plans Hybrid Reserve Custody Model Instead, the trust charter would let Circle manage the reserves backing its stablecoin, which include short-term US Treasury bills and cash, currently held at BNY Mellon and managed by BlackRock. Some of these holdings will remain with existing partners even if the new bank becomes operational. “We’re going from the early-adopter phase of this technology into the mainstream,” Allaire told Reuters. “As a public company, and now, hopefully if we are successful in getting approval from the OCC as a national trust, that will give us a foundation that the world’s leading institutions are going to be comfortable building on.” Senate Bill Pushes Stablecoin Rules Forward Circle plans to focus on the custody of tokenized assets such as stocks and bonds on blockchain rails, rather than cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether. This focus aligns with broader trends, as financial institutions increasingly explore blockchain to modernize traditional markets. The timing of Circle’s move is significant. Earlier this month, the Senate passed a stablecoin bill that would require issuers to maintain full reserves and disclose them publicly each month. The House is expected to vote on the bill in the coming weeks, and President Trump has signaled support for such regulation. If enacted, the legislation could legitimize stablecoins in the eyes of more traditional businesses and pave the way for broader use in payments and commerce. Circle, which already plays a central role in the stablecoin market, is preparing to meet that moment with a more regulated and institution-friendly structure. Wall Street analysts began coverage of Circle this week with mostly upbeat assessments. Firms including Barclays, Bernstein and Canaccord Genuity issued buy ratings, though others like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs flagged potential valuation concerns following the stock’s sharp post-IPO rise.

However, momentum appears to have paused at the start of the new week. As of Monday, Bitcoin trades just above $107,000 after a slight 0.6% daily dip, while Ethereum has remained flat over the past 24 hours. Analysts have turned to blockchain data and macro signals for cues on where the market may head next. Related Reading: Bitcoin Freezes Over $100,000 As OG Whales ‘Dump On Wall Street’: Expert Bitcoin and Ethereum Onchain Trend Recent insights from CryptoQuant Quicktake platform contributor Amr Taha provide some context behind the price action. In a detailed post, Taha noted that Ethereum inflows to Binance have continued for five consecutive days, a trend that could suggest either rising sell pressure or repositioning by major players. At the same time, data from Bitcoin’s short-term holder (STH) Net Position Realized Cap shows a notable reversal, increasing from negative $49 billion to over $5 billion. This pattern is typically associated with increased activity from retail investors, especially during periods of upward price movement. Taha noted: Historically, spikes in (STH) occur near potential market tops, as retail investors tend to FOMO into Bitcoin rallies. While this doesn’t necessarily signal a reversal, it has often preceded short-term corrections or periods of sideways consolidation. Bitcoin’s steady climb in June, despite occasional pullbacks, appears to have encouraged smaller investors to re-enter the market. In the case of Ethereum, another CryptoQuant analyst, “crypto sunmoon,” pointed to continued accumulation by long-term holders during last month’s price consolidation. This suggests a different dynamic is at play on the Ethereum side, with more patient capital building positions amid ongoing price suppression. Long-term holder accumulation often indicates growing confidence in an asset’s future, even if current market conditions appear lackluster. US Policy and Macro Risk Add Layers to Market Outlook Beyond market behavior, external factors may also shape crypto price action. Amr Taha highlighted recent political developments in the United States, particularly former President Donald Trump’s announcement of a proposed Senate bill promising wide-reaching tax cuts. The bill, which excludes taxes on tips, overtime, and Social Security income, could lead to an increase in consumer liquidity. If passed, this could impact investor appetite across both traditional and digital markets by temporarily boosting household spending power.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk warned that the measure, if not accompanied by spending cuts, could expand the federal deficit and lead to economic instability over time. Large fiscal imbalances often have ripple effects on monetary policy, potentially affecting interest rates, inflation expectations, and risk sentiment, all of which can influence investor behavior in crypto markets. Taha concluded: Geopolitical disturbances can significantly impact investor sentiment. In response, investors might reconsider their positions in asset markets, possibly moving away from riskier assets and equities toward more stable options like bonds or safe-haven currencies.

Volatility has simmered, charts are tightening, and all eyes are on a few familiar giants. XRP is gaining after years of legal drama, Ethereum is quietly setting the foundation for its next leap, and Shiba Inu is attracting buying demand with its weekly burning data. This leaves a question among investors “?” But here’s the twist: while everyone’s focused on the same three names, a leading name is stepping into the ring — MAGACOIN FINANCE. If the crypto market is setting up for a mid-year breakout, the biggest surprise of all might not come from XRP, ETH, or SHIB — but from the underdog token preparing for its debut just as the tide turns bullish. Why are Investors Buying MAGACOIN FINANCE Aggressively? While XRP, Ethereum, and SHIB battle for position in the spotlight, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly becoming one of the most talked-about early-stage tokens of the year. Positioned as a community-first DeFi powerhouse, MAGACOIN FINANCE brings together scarcity, utility, and bold branding under one roof. Its presale is attracting early adopters for several reasons: Limited Token Supply: With scarcity baked into its tokenomics, MAGACOIN FINANCE is designed for strong supply-side pressure as demand builds. DeFi Ready: Staking, farming, and a suite of DeFi utilities are planned for launch, giving holders multiple ways to earn. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers something the giants can’t: early access at ground-floor prices. XRP is Preparing for a Solid Comeback After years of legal uncertainty, Ripple’s chapter with the SEC is finally coming to a close. A $50 million fine and the return of $75 million from civil escrow may soon clear the path for XRP to re-enter global markets with renewed confidence. Meanwhile, XRPL’s latest upgrade (v2.5.0) introduces everything from token escrow features to more robust AMM safeguards, making the network more appealing to developers and institutions. Add in new partnerships, the launch of multiple stablecoins, and the growing potential for an XRP spot ETF (now considered 85% likely), and it’s easy to see why XRP has bounced over 15% from its lows. If it breaks resistance around $2.6 and $2.9, a move toward $3.45 or higher could be on the edge. Ethereum’s Stability Meets Utility Ethereum hasn’t had the flashiest quarter, but under the surface, the network continues to strengthen. Its recent Shapella upgrade unlocked billions in previously locked ETH, increasing liquidity and reinforcing trust in the protocol. Even as technical patterns hint at short-term caution (including a rare “death cross”), long-term investors are unfazed. Ethereum-based ETFs are finally making progress in the U.S., and partnerships with Mastercard, PayPal, and Fiserv are quietly embedding ETH-backed stablecoins into real-world financial infrastructure. Price-wise, ETH is surging toward the $2,500 zone. Reclaiming major moving averages could reignite momentum for ETH price, with $3,500–$4,000 back in view if ETF inflows kick off later this year. Shiba Inu’s Strong Developments Meet Buying Demand Whales are making their move: on June 24, more than 10.4 trillion SHIB were scooped up in a single day. That massive accumulation helped spark a 17% bounce off the bottom, and SHIB is now trying to push through resistance near $0.000012. Meanwhile, the project’s development arm is busy delivering. The newly launched Shib Alpha Layer adds encrypted smart contracts and advanced scalability to Shibarium, while collaborations like the one with DeLorean Labs are boosting community engagement and real-world utility. Analysts remain cautiously bullish but the technicals suggest that SHIB may not stay quiet for long.

Thanks to their steady prices, backing from real-world assets, and growing support from regulators, these coins have become a go-to option for people looking for stability in a market known for wild swings. But some experts from the Pi community think that the rise of stablecoins could get in the way of Pi Network’s goal of becoming a widely used global currency. Can Pi Compete with Stablecoins? Pi Network’s long term goal is to make Pi Coin a global currency, focused on easy access, mobile mining, and peer-to-peer use. But without key advancements, stablecoins may continue to be the preferred choice for users seeking a stable, currency-like crypto. Stablecoins have fiat backing and institutional trust. Pi Coin still faces volatility, limited listings, and regulatory hurdles. And in order to compete globally, it must improve its real-world utility and build greater trust. What Gives Pi an Edge? Pi does have some unique advantages that could help it stand out: First, Pi’s mining is as simple as tapping an app, with no need for wallets or exchanges. This makes it far more accessible than most cryptocurrencies. Second, Pi Network’s 65 million-strong community and referral-based model create strong network effects that stablecoins don’t offer. If Pi’s real-world utility improves, this loyal base could drive significant adoption. Finally, Pi is building its own ecosystem with dApps and developer tools, including the new AI-powered Pi App Studio. If successful, this could boost engagement, attract new users, and turn Pi into a thriving digital economy. Price Struggles Continue Pi Network still faces issues like centralization, KYC delays, and low user activity. It is still in its early stages without institutional backing or proven real-world utility. Pi coin’s recent breakout above a key downtrend looked promising, but the rally did not last. It quickly reversed and the token is now sliding again. If this trend continues, PI could slide toward its all-time low near $0.40. A rebound is still possible if demand picks up, with an upside potential to $0.66. But for now, the pressure remains on the downside. It is currently trading at $0.4961, down 5% in the last 24 hours.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|ALTCOIN|MINING|FIAT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-01 04:01:31

But according to legal experts, neither of these dates hold any official importance in the lawsuit. Recently, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced on X (formerly Twitter) that Ripple is officially dropping its cross-appeal in the long-running case with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). He also said that the SEC is expected to drop its appeal too, as previously indicated. So what happens next? A user asked, “Since Ripple announced they will not appeal Judge Analisa Torres on the 2nd ruling. What is next for the SEC, Ripple, and the Court?” Former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel explained that the SEC still needs to hold a vote to officially dismiss its appeal. After that, both Ripple and the SEC will need to submit legal papers confirming the dismissal. Only then will the court’s earlier ruling take full effect. When will this happen? There’s no confirmed timeline. Fagel made it clear that no one knows the exact dates. Some people had said July 3 or August 15 as possible milestones, but Fagel stated those dates have no official connection to the case’s current process. For now, it’s a waiting game. The dismissals are expected in the coming weeks, and while it could be done quickly, it might also take a little longer. In short, no big decision is coming on July 3 or August 15. The legal process is moving ahead, but exact dates remain uncertain.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-01 04:04:59

As the new entrants are always trying to topple the veterans, a single upcoming project has started to gain some serious interest. Pepeto , a fresh player in the meme coin space, is gaining traction with a unique proposition: combining meme coin energy with real utility and infrastructure. Unlike many others before it, Pepeto isn’t just about hype. It also provides real solutions to traders and societies in Web3, all the time carrying on the exact jovial nature that spawned meme coin existence. Pepeto Redefines Meme Coins With Utility Pepeto is more than a memecoin; it’s a movement. Raised with an idea that is more than jokes and pumps. Pepeto merges the whimsical energy of meme culture with a full suite of decentralized finance tools aimed at real-world crypto users. At the heart of Pepeto is a zero-fee swap platform, built to simplify and accelerate meme coin trading. In parallel to that, the project is also launching a dedicated exchange of memecoins and a cross-chain bridge technology, permitting a smooth exchange of tokens. These services actualize actual market needs where trading meme tokens is either expensive, slow, or risky. Furthermore, the team has pledged to a community-first, transparent model that welcomes long-term developments, not short-term speculations. So far, Pepeto’s presale has raised over $5.5 million, and the token is still priced attractively at $0.000000137. It remains unclear how seriously the integration of major exchanges might revolutionize the game before they are listed and enterprises take an early position. Dogecoin Faces Pressure From New Contenders Dogecoin paved the way for meme coins. Developed in 2013 as a mockery of Bitcoin, it happened to become a valid digital resource. It was at its most popular when Elon Musk declared that it is the people’s crypto and fired up interest around the world. Merchants have since accepted Dogecoin, which is used for tipping and widely traded on major platforms. Nevertheless, it has stagnated in development and does not offer more advanced functionality such as smart contracts or DeFi. Dogecoin continues to survive on community strength and simplicity. But in a fast-evolving Web3 world, that might not be enough to hold off more utility-driven contenders like Pepeto. Shiba Inu Faces Competition From Pepeto Shiba Inu began as a so-called “Doge killer” in 2020. However, it soon evolved to be more than a meme. With the launch of ShibaSwap, its own NFT line, and an upcoming Layer 2 network named Shibarium, SHIB offers significant technical depth. It brought tokens such as Bone and Leash, and the entire ecosystem encourages the attention of both meme enthusiasts and DeFi fans. In 2025, Shiba Inu has maintained relevance through consistent updates and strong exchange support. However, as newer projects like Pepeto blend community with actual tools built for traders, SHIB’s growth path faces fresh competition. Can PEPE Maintain Its Meme Coin Reign? PEPE entered the scene as a tribute to the iconic Pepe the Frog meme. Unlike SHIB and Pepeto, it proudly avoided offering utility. Zero taxes, zero pretense, simply 100% meme power. This approach led to a dramatic rise in early 2023, pushing PEPE’s market cap past $1.6 billion. The coin emerged as the poster boy of quick meme-powered speculation. However, without a roadmap or tools for actual use, PEPE may struggle to build long-term value. It is a cultural icon, but its infrastructure is lacking, which makes it less appealing to any serious investor who is interested in much more than hype. Why Pepeto Is the Best Buy Now Pepeto is carving a space where fun meets function. It offers Web3 users a practical solution in the form of zero trading fees, cross-chain swaps, and a community-first exchange. It is cheap, with increasing interest among investors, and is, therefore, an excellent decision before mainstream penetration. Unlike many memecoins, Pepeto offers substance, sustainability, and a story that resonates in 2025. ABOUT PEPETO Pepeto is a cutting-edge cryptocurrency project blending the playful spirit of memecoins with a powerful, utility-driven ecosystem. It features a zero-fee exchange, a cross-chain bridge for seamless swaps, and staking rewards designed to support the next generation of tokens.

While Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe Coin (PEPE) struggle to hold investor interest, a new and electrifying meme-powered token is swiftly gaining momentum — Little Pepe (LILPEPE). Currently in its red-hot presale phase, Little Pepe is being whispered about in private crypto circles and rapidly shared across meme communities. Its price? Just $0.0012, still under the radar but already packing the kind of traction that could lead to exponential growth. What Makes Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Different? Little Pepe isn’t simply another frog-themed token that people may recall from memes; it’s a whole new Layer 2 blockchain ecosystem that operates on the $LILPEPE token. Most Layer 2s only aim to expand Ethereum, but LILPEPE goes further by merging high-tech with culture and creativity. Key Features That Set It Apart: Lightning-Fast Transactions: Built to process high volumes at warp speed and meme token transfers. Ultra-Low Fees: A user-friendly cost structure that encourages frequent transactions and fosters viral activity. Meme Magic Engineered In: The core of the LILPEPE chain is driven by meme culture, integrating shareable, interactive content directly into its ecosystem. Unlike many meme coins that are launched and left to drift, Little Pepe is backed by anonymous experts known to have played instrumental roles in the success of several top meme coins. These aren’t just developers — they are meme architects with proven track records. Explosive Presale Performance Little Pepe’s ongoing presale is nothing short of sensational. Stage 2 sold out ahead of schedule, raising $1,325,000 — a clear sign of growing investor confidence. Now in Stage 3 at $0.0012, the token has already seen a 20% increase since the presale began. So far, over 1.96 billion tokens have been sold — 87% of the available 2.25 billion. With this kind of momentum, it’s no surprise that some analysts are whispering about a potential 310x return — the kind of explosive rally that turns modest investments into life-changing gains. Community-First Mentality: The $777,000 Giveaway The Little Pepe team isn’t just focused on utility and scalability — they’re actively celebrating the culture that fuels their growth. To mark the presale’s viral success and the imminent launch of the LILPEPE Layer 2 chain, the project has announced a massive $777,000 giveaway . Here’s how it works: 10 lucky winners will each receive $77,000 worth of $LILPEPE tokens. Over 10,000 entries have already been recorded, showing just how strong and active the community is becoming. Entry is simple and open to anyone who follows the presale and participates in the token ecosystem. This bold move rewards early supporters and reinforces Little Pepe’s position as a community-first project, a value that meme coin traders hold dear. Meme Traders Are Accumulating LILPEPE Now The early-stage momentum of Little Pepe is backed by tangible data and genuine excitement, not just social media hype. With a functional roadmap, a growing community, Layer 2 tech under development, and meme-savvy founders, LILPEPE is attracting seasoned meme coin investors who recognize an early-stage opportunity when they see it. Moreover, the current presale pricing of under $0.0015 makes LILPEPE incredibly appealing to traders seeking outsized gains. Compared to the stagnant charts of SHIB and PEPE, this new entrant offers something those tokens no longer can: potential. And that potential is what’s driving the quiet accumulation. Smart money moves early — before the media headlines catch on. Final Thoughts: Little Pepe Could Be the Meme Coin of 2025 As the meme coin landscape evolves, only projects that combine culture, community, and genuine utility will thrive in the coming cycles. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is poised to survive and dominate due to its tech-forward approach, viral marketing, and highly strategic presale momentum. While SHIB and PEPE holders quietly exit their positions, those in the know are accumulating LILPEPE — and fast. With just a fraction of its total supply remaining in the presale, and the price still under $0.0015, now may be the final window to get in before the broader market catches wind of this next-generation meme chain.

With key ecosystem upgrades, institutional adoption, and ETF excitement a in play, all three altcoins are generating significant attention. But will they lead the next major rally—or is another breakout altcoin about to steal the spotlight? MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Altcoin Insiders Don’t Want You to Miss As headlines focus on legacy altcoins, one token is quietly positioning itself to dominate the 2025 cycle. That token is MAGACOIN FINANCE —and crypto insiders are already piling in. What Makes MAGACOIN FINANCE Different? This isn’t a meme. This is momentum. Unmatched breakout potential – MAGACOIN FINANCE is already drawing attention from early movers and high-volume wallets. Strategic analyst picks – Leading altcoin analysts are calling it a likely outperformer in 2025. Explosive brand power – MAGACOIN FINANCE taps into one of the most viral cultural narratives in modern crypto. Early-stage buyers are already treating it as the next Dogecoin or Shiba Inu—but on steroids. The energy is different. The hype is higher. And the timing couldn’t be more perfect. Why These Altcoins Are in Focus for 2025 Investor demand is rising fast as major altcoins return to the spotlight. Cardano is rolling out advanced scalability tech, XRP is closing in on long-awaited legal clarity, and Dogecoin is positioning itself for real-world payment use. Cardano (ADA): Scaling for a Billion Users Cardano’s 2025 roadmap emphasizes long-term growth through Layer-2 innovations. Hydra, Midgard, zkFold, and Gummiworm are some of the cutting-edge solutions driving faster and cheaper transactions. Key Cardano Drivers: $100 million ADA converted to BTC/stablecoins to boost DeFi 30% growth in stablecoin market cap Brave browser integration reaching 86M+ users ETF optimism rising with 55% approval probability Price Outlook: Analysts predict ADA could surge between $1.20 and $5.66, fueled by accelerating Layer-2 adoption and explosive growth in Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem. XRP: Legal Breakthroughs and Institutional Momentum XRP may be nearing a turning point. With a 70% chance of a lawsuit settlement by August, analysts believe regulatory clarity could unlock a wave of institutional capital. XRP Developments to Watch: Three XRP ETFs launched in Canada U.S. ETF application under review by Franklin Templeton Ripple’s $1.25B Hidden Road acquisition Launch of RLUSD stablecoin on XRP Ledger Price Outlook: Analysts forecast XRP to reach up to $5.81 in 2025, with bullish catalysts like ETF approval and legal resolution on the horizon. Dogecoin (DOGE): Breaking Resistance and Gaining Legitimacy Dogecoin is re-entering the institutional conversation. After reclaiming $0.16 support, DOGE is targeting $0.195–$0.30 in the coming weeks. What’s Powering Dogecoin: Dogecoin Reserve launched with a $1.8M purchase Grayscale DOGE Trust opens institutional access Coinbase launches DOGE futures Elon Musk hints at X integration for tipping and payments Price Outlook: Bullish mid-term targets hover around $0.30, with long-term speculation reaching $0.55 to $1 if adoption expands. What’s Fueling the Current Altcoin Rally? The June 2025 altcoin rally is being driven by three core forces: Institutional Adoption: ETFs, trust funds, and futures are legitimizing crypto assets. Scalability Upgrades: Cardano and XRP are introducing advanced L2 and DeFi solutions. Market Sentiment: Investor interest is rising, and price action is confirming technical strength. Recent Metrics: ADA futures open interest: $694 million XRP whale accumulation activity growing DOGE breaking out from multi-month consolidation zones But even as these coins surge, smart money is beginning to look elsewhere. Why Analysts Are Forecasting a Breakout Crypto veterans know the signs: Early wallet activity is spiking Momentum is accelerating daily The FOMO is real—and spreading fast This is not just another speculative token. Insiders are calling this a rare window—one that won’t stay open much longer. Every cycle has a breakout token that takes the entire market by surprise. In 2025, many believe this is it. The Rally Is Here. Will You Miss It? ADA, XRP, and DOGE are clearly in motion. They’re solid plays for exposure to this altcoin rally. But the biggest returns rarely come from the expected picks. MAGACOIN FINANCE is already rewriting the rules. It’s not just trending—it’s taking over the narrative. Thousands have already joined the movement. The question is, will you?

47156859,https://invezz.com/?p=2784660,1751347439,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"Solana price rally to $200 brewing, while Mutuum Finance eyes $1",https://invezz.com/news/2025/07/01/solana-price-rally-to-200-brewing-while-mutuum-finance-eyes-1/,"Solana (SOL) is eyeing a potential rally toward $200, but key catalysts are needed to drive momentum. The network recently faced a 14% pullback from $158 to $143 due to stalled DApp growth and fading memecoin hype. Futures data shows increasing leveraged positions, yet sentiment remains cautious with funding rates dropping to 0%. Analysts believe a spot SOL ETF approval and renewed focus on tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) could reignite interest. Despite recent weakness, Solana (SOL)’s $10B total value locked (TVL) and its efficiency advantages over Ethereum (ETH) suggest strong upside if institutional confidence returns. A shift in sentiment could accelerate a breakout beyond current resistance. But while Solana (SOL) captures headlines with its $200 price target, seasoned investors chasing exponential returns are shifting focus to earlier-stage platforms where the upside isn’t just 2x or 3x, but 30x and beyond. That’s exactly why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining rapid traction. Still priced at just $0.03 in its Phase 5 presale, it offers what SOL no longer can—real early entry with explosive upside potential. For example, a $3,000 investment into MUTM at $0.03 will balloon to $90,000 if the token hits a realistic post-launch value of $0.90, which analysts from top platforms have highlighted as achievable given the project’s lending utility, beta-ready platform, and rising community interest. With each presale phase pushing the price higher toward the $0.06 cap, this window is tightening fast—and those who wait may find themselves chasing momentum instead of capturing it. In the middle of Phase 5, with over $11.3 million already raised and 12,600+ holders, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t just another presale. It’s a structured roadmap-driven project that’s aiming to become the backbone of peer-to-peer and peer-to-contract lending. And retail is starting to catch on. Over 35% of wallets joining in Phase 5 have deposits under $1,000—indicating a growing movement of individual investors preparing for what many believe could be the next 30x launch. Roadmap execution positions MUTM for fast-track growth What separates Mutuum Finance (MUTM) from the noise of other early-stage projects is its clear roadmap and timely delivery. The beta version of the platform is on track to launch alongside the token listing, creating a smooth transition from presale to live utility. Once the beta is released, it will mark the start of real-time usage, setting the foundation for the stablecoin system and Layer-2 infrastructure to follow. This momentum will be followed by the rollout of Mutuum’s decentralized stablecoin, which will only be minted when users borrow against assets like ETH or BTC and will be burned upon repayment or liquidation. Governance will manage its interest rates to help it hold its peg near $1. This mechanism not only supports long-term price stability but will also increase trust in the protocol’s treasury structure. Beyond that, the protocol is integrating with Layer-2 technology, dramatically reducing fees and speeding up transactions. This will be critical for high-volume lending and borrowing, especially as more users move assets into the platform to either earn passive income or unlock liquidity. Another investor who deposits $10,000 in USDC through Mutuum’s P2C lending model will receive mtUSDC, which automatically accumulates interest over time. Assuming an average APY of 18% (depending on pool utilization), this investor could earn $1,800 per year in completely passive income—without needing to reinvest or actively manage the position. Plus, those mtTokens can be used in other ecosystem functions like staking for MUTM token rewards, compounding the benefits even further. Borrowers will have their own edge. For example, someone holding $10,000 worth of ETH can borrow up to 75% (depending on LTV ratio) of that value without selling their asset. This strategy will allow them to keep market exposure while using borrowed capital for other opportunities. Since all loans will be overcollateralized, and liquidations handled through the protocol’s “Stability Factor,” the system will remain balanced and safe for all users. The team is also running a $100K giveaway to reward early believers, with ten winners set to receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. Combined with a $50,000 bug bounty in partnership with CertiK, the developers are showing a commitment to platform security and community trust. Mutuum’s CertiK audit has already achieved a 95.00 Token Scan Score and a 77 Skynet Score, validating the strength of its code and structure. Passive income with a $0.03 entry: 20x is just the start At just $0.03 per token, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents one of the most underpriced entries in the current DeFi cycle. Investors who deploy $4,000 at this price point and ride the token to $0.60—just a 20x move—will walk away with $80,000. For those eyeing even greater returns, projections as high as $1 per token are firmly in play as the roadmap advances and retail demand builds. The urgency is growing fast. As soon as Phase 5 ends, the token price will increase to 0.035, and the entry point for massive gains will disappear. While SOL targets a move to $200, the real explosion may come from projects still trading under the radar—projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that have already secured strong funding, thousands of holders, and a product roadmap leading straight to live utility. Those who wait for confirmation will pay more. Those who move before the beta launches will own the upside.

Call Me a Fool If You Want”",https://coinpedia.org/news/i-could-be-a-fool-but-i-still-bought-bitcoin-says-robert-kiyosaki/,"The post Robert Kiyosaki Says, “I Bought Another Bitcoin Today. Call Me a Fool If You Want” appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Renowned finance author Robert Kiyosaki has revealed that he bought more Bitcoin, reaffirming his belief that the asset could eventually hit $1 million. Having first entered the market at $6,000, he’s already seen over 1,000% gains with BTC now trading above $107,000. Despite this surge, Kiyosaki isn’t cashing out; he’s buying more, emphasizing the importance of owning Bitcoin over time, not just watching the price move. He encourages buying less and waiting for the right time, and seeing it grow. It will be the best investment policy, according to him. Kiyosaki Prefers the Gamble Bought another Bitcoin today. I realize I could be wrong and a sucker. Would not be the first time in my life I was played for a FOOL. Yet I believe Bitcoin will one day soon….be $1 million a coin. If I am a sucker…. I’d rather be a sucker than a LOSER if Bitcoin does go to… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) July 1, 2025 In a refreshingly honest post on X, Kiyosaki admitted the possibility of being wrong, even “played for a fool.” Still, he said he’d rather take the risk of being a “sucker” than miss out completely. His message was about the mindset of a long-term investor who loves to take calculated risks and has conviction in long-term value, not just chasing trends or trying to time the market. Moreover, Bitcoin has already broken past $111,900, proving its resilience and growth potential. To reach Robert Kiyosaki’s bold $1 million target , it would need to rise about 855% from current levels. Still, Kiyosaki remains confident, pointing to Bitcoin’s past performance and upcoming events like the halving to support his long-term outlook. [post_titles_links postid=”476909″] His Advice to Investors In a reflective tone, Kiyosaki acknowledged that he can afford to lose the $100,000 investment because of his past, where he’s been both a sucker and a loser, but gained “wisdom and experience” through those failures. He encouraged followers to think for themselves rather than blindly follow influencers or online sentiment. Rather than hyping Bitcoin to his audience, Kiyosaki left his post with a grounded reminder: “Think for yourself.” His approach blends personal insight with a broader lesson he has gained, which often comes with failure, and it’s better to take calculated risks than live with regret. As Bitcoin continues to test new highs and draw institutional interest , Kiyosaki’s faith in its future may resonate with many retail investors watching from the sidelines.

However, the lack of utility has been inescapable. The coin is currently down over 77% since its all-time high of 2021. The trend does not appear to be changing soon, which has left investors looking for options elsewhere. One of the main options for DOGE holders right now is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a utility-driven project that is basking in praise from all over the crypto market. While Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has yet to hit the mainstream, crypto analysts forecast that it could be one of the biggest gainers of 2025. Herein lies the perfect opportunity for you to capitalize on the expected massive returns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale wows analysts Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in phase 5 of its presale, which has been a massive success. So far, it has raised over $11.3 million from around 12,550 unique buyers. The numbers keep rising daily as investors seek to make the most out of the presale. Tokens in the current phase are going for $0.03, a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. The price will continue to rise until the listing price of $0.06. As such, the current price is a 50% discount on the expected listing price. This presents a massive opportunity for you to get in before the price goes supernova. So far, investors have made full use of this opportunity, buying 50% of the tokens set aside for the current phase. That means the window to make massive returns in fast closing, with the price set to go up by 16.67% in phase 6 to $0.035. How high could MUTM tokens rise According to analysts, the price of MUTM tokens could rise to $2 once they go live. Based on the current price of $0.03, that would represent an over 6,500% increase in price. That means if you buy $1300 worth of tokens right now, your investment could grow to over $84000. This massive return can be yours right now. Since there is no limit on how much you can buy in the presale, you could make life-changing returns with this one buy. One reason why analysts are so optimistic about the future of MUTM tokens is the protocol framework design. The team plans to use protocol profits to support the price of MUTM tokens on the open market. The purchases on the open market will help to boost the price of MUTM tokens, increasing their appeal to buyers. Consequently, this will attract fresh capital to the project, which could make MUTM the biggest gainer of 2025. Security on Mutuum Finance The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team is committed to the security of all aspects of the project. The first step they will take is to screen all addresses trying to connect to the protocol. This screening process will ensure that potentially bad actors are stopped even before their first transaction. Besides address screening, they plan to conduct intensive asset screening. That will ensure that assets with suspicious security standards do not make it onto the protocol. For instance, if a token is highly centralized, that could expose liquidity in the protocol to price manipulation. As such, assets that show a high level of centralization will not be allowed. The team could also impose asset caps, which would help to protect the protocol from sudden price movements by containing the fallout. As part of the security measures, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has partnered with CertiK on a $50,000 USDT bug bounty program. The bug bounty program is split into four tiers, which are critical, major, minor, and low. At the top of this tiered system is the critical level, which includes vulnerabilities that could have the biggest impact on the security of the ecosystem. Those who identify these vulnerabilities will receive the biggest rewards. Protocol design Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a DeFi protocol that allows users to deposit their assets into smart contract pools to receive interest. Borrowers can deposit overcollateralized collateral in the pools to access the liquidity. The interest rates for both lenders and borrowers in the pools are based on the pool’s utilization rate. For instance, if a lender deposits $10,000 USDC in a pool, and the utilization rate rises, it could push their yield to 13%. That means they will receive $1,300 per year on their deposit. This is a great system to make passive income in the crypto sector with minimal effort. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents one of the best opportunities for massive returns in the crypto sector in 2025. With analysts forecasting returns of 65x or higher, the opportunity for life-changing returns is just a few clicks away in the ongoing presale.

In the United States, the Supreme Court declined to hear a case brought by a Coinbase user who claimed the IRS violated his Fourth Amendment rights by obtaining his financial data through a broad exchange summons. The decision lets a lower court ruling stand, reinforcing the government’s ability to access crypto transaction data for tax enforcement. Meanwhile in Europe, Europol announced the arrest of five individuals allegedly involved in a €460 million cryptocurrency investment fraud network spanning Spain, Hong Kong, and other jurisdictions. Supreme Court Declines Coinbase User’s Appeal in IRS Privacy Case, Raising Alarms Over Crypto Surveillance The United States Supreme Court has declined to hear a case brought by James Harper, a cryptocurrency user who alleged that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) violated his Fourth Amendment rights by obtaining his personal financial data through a sweeping summons to Coinbase. The Court issued its decision on Monday, leaving in place a ruling by the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, which sided with the IRS. The case originated in 2020, when Harper sued the federal tax agency and several of its officials, claiming that they unlawfully conducted a search and seizure of his private financial information. Harper’s legal team argued that the IRS had overstepped its constitutional authority by demanding his user data from Coinbase without a warrant or individualized suspicion. At the heart of the case is a 2016 “John Doe” summons issued by the IRS to Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States. The summons required the company to turn over account information for over 14,000 users who transacted more than $20,000 in Bitcoin between 2013 and 2015. Harper, who claims he properly reported his transactions and paid taxes, said he was swept up in the mass data collection effort despite having no direct contact with the agency beforehand. Harper’s lawsuit sought to challenge the legality of such sweeping data requests, arguing that they violated his right to privacy and constituted an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment. However, the US District Court for the District of New Hampshire dismissed the case in 2021, and the First Circuit later upheld that decision, effectively denying Harper legal recourse. Coinbase Weighs In With Support Coinbase itself filed an amicus curiae brief in support of Harper, warning the Supreme Court of the precedent the lower court ruling could set if left unchallenged. The company said the IRS’s broad approach could allow the government to “trace users’ every crypto transaction in the past and monitor every crypto transaction in the future,” raising significant concerns about financial surveillance. Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, was outspoken about the broader implications. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), he said: “We believe in tax compliance, but this goes far beyond a narrow and tailored request and far beyond crypto. This applies to banks, phone companies, ISPs, email, you name it [...] you should have the same right to privacy for your inbox or account as you have for a letter in your mailbox.” Despite these warnings, the Supreme Court’s decision not to review the case effectively allows the IRS to continue utilizing broad data requests to cryptocurrency platforms, sparking renewed debate over digital privacy rights in the U.S. The decision comes at a time of heightened IRS scrutiny on digital asset activity. According to crypto tax software firm CoinLedger, user mentions of IRS warning letters surged by 758% in support chats during the most recent tax season. While not all letters suggest wrongdoing, CoinLedger said many are linked to data obtained via John Doe summonses issued to exchanges such as Coinbase and Poloniex. “[IRS letters] don’t necessarily indicate wrongdoing,” CoinLedger noted. “In many cases, recipients are simply crypto investors known to the IRS through John Doe Summons.” As the IRS expands its efforts to enforce tax compliance in the rapidly evolving digital asset space, more investors are likely to find themselves in the agency’s crosshairs—often without prior notice. Implications for Digital Privacy and Constitutional Protections By refusing to hear Harper’s appeal, the Supreme Court has allowed a significant precedent to stand—one that critics argue could weaken Fourth Amendment protections in the digital age. Privacy advocates warn that the ruling could embolden federal agencies to use sweeping surveillance tactics not just in the cryptocurrency space, but across a range of digital platforms and services. With no further judicial review available, Harper’s case now becomes a cautionary tale for digital asset holders in the United States. It also raises urgent questions about the balance between tax enforcement and constitutional rights in an increasingly digital economy. Europol Arrests Five in $542M Crypto Fraud Crackdown Spanning Spain, US, France, and Estonia Meanwhile, in a sweeping international operation that shows the growing global focus on cryptocurrency-related crime, the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol) announced the arrest of five individuals allegedly linked to one of Spain’s largest ever crypto investment fraud schemes. According to a statement released on Monday, the arrests were made by Spain’s Guardia Civil with support from Europol, the United States, France, and Estonia. Authorities allege that the network defrauded more than 5,000 victims out of €460 million—approximately $542 million at the time of publication—through a sophisticated web of deception involving fake crypto investment products, shell companies, and international money laundering techniques. The coordinated crackdown took place last Wednesday, with three suspects apprehended and properties searched in Spain’s Canary Islands, while two more arrests were executed in Madrid. These raids led to the seizure of electronic devices, documents, and bank records believed to be connected to the fraudulent scheme. Authorities believe the operation was led by a core group of individuals who oversaw a network of global accomplices. These associates were responsible for soliciting funds from unsuspecting investors through a variety of channels, including direct bank transfers, crypto transfers, and even cash withdrawals. “To carry out their fraudulent activities, the leaders of the criminal network allegedly used a net of associates spread around the world to raise funds through cash withdrawals, bank transfers and crypto-transfers,” Europol said in its statement. Shell Companies and Hidden Funds As part of the investigation, officials discovered a vast corporate and banking infrastructure allegedly designed to obscure the flow of criminal proceeds. This included companies registered in Hong Kong and user accounts at various crypto exchanges under fictitious or borrowed identities. Payment gateways were also reportedly exploited to funnel illicit gains across jurisdictions and convert them into hard-to-trace assets. “Investigators suspect the criminal organisation of having set up a corporate and banking network based in Hong Kong, allegedly using payment gateways and user accounts in the names of different people and in different exchanges to receive, store and transfer criminal funds,” Europol added. This operation follows months of investigative work, including digital forensics, financial surveillance, and inter-agency intelligence sharing. In January, Spanish authorities had already frozen over $26 million in digital assets tied to a similar money laundering probe, which may now be linked to the same criminal organization. The arrests come amid a wave of international crackdowns on cryptocurrency investment scams. Just last month, the US Department of Justice announced the seizure of more than $225 million connected to so-called ”pig butchering” schemes. In these cases, scammers build trust with victims over time—often through social engineering on dating apps or messaging platforms—before persuading them to pour large sums into fake crypto investments. In a separate case also reported in June, five men pleaded guilty in a US federal court to running a $37 million crypto scam involving assets being transferred to Cambodia. These cases highlight the cross-border nature of digital financial crime and the increasing willingness of law enforcement agencies to work together in response. A Call for Stronger Regulation and Investor Vigilance The $542 million fraud in Spain shows not only the sophistication of modern financial crime but also the urgent need for clearer regulatory frameworks around digital asset investments. Authorities are urging potential investors to exercise caution and verify the legitimacy of any crypto-related opportunity—especially those promising high or guaranteed returns. Europol continues to emphasize that successful prosecution of such schemes relies on strong international cooperation and technological expertise. With billions at stake and criminal networks growing bolder, cross-border law enforcement partnerships are likely to become the norm in the fight against digital financial fraud.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|ASIA|FIAT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-01 05:30:00

XRP did it in 2017. Shiba Inu followed in 2021. Now, in 2025, one new name is surging up the ranks: MAGACOIN FINANCE . Still in its presale phase, MAGACOIN FINANCE has already raised over $10 million and sold out multiple rounds in record time. The hype isn’t just noise. With projections ranging, analysts and investors alike are beginning to ask the big question: could MAGACOIN FINANCE actually become a top 10 cryptocurrency—just like XRP and SHIB did in their prime? Why Analysts Are Watching MAGACOIN FINANCE Closely Analysts are increasingly placing MAGACOIN FINANCE at the top of their 2025 watchlists—not just because of the numbers, but because of the timing. The presale is happening during a resurgence in altcoin interest. The branding is controversial enough to spark attention, but clean enough to drive serious adoption. And the community? It’s growing faster than almost any other presale project this year. XRP has the institutions. SHIB had the memes. MAGACOIN FINANCE is gunning for both. XRP Represents Stability, SHIB Proved Meme Power—MAGACOIN Offers Both XRP’s legacy is built on real-world utility and institutional ambition. Its post-SEC recovery has made it a symbol of crypto resilience, and its current market cap north of $35 billion places it firmly in the industry’s elite. But for many early XRP holders, the big run has already happened—and new entrants are unlikely to see 100x gains from here. Shiba Inu took the opposite route. It didn’t rely on banks or payments—it rode meme culture, community virality, and relentless momentum to briefly become one of the most valuable tokens in the world. It was chaotic, irrational, and wildly profitable. And for many retail traders, it was the template for how fast things can change when a narrative catches fire. Now, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing comparisons to both. It blends SHIB-style meme energy with disciplined tokenomics more typical of XRP. With a capped supply between 100 and 170 billion tokens, a 100% community-driven model, and a presale that’s moving at lightning speed, it’s easy to see why analysts are calling it “the breakout meme token with real structure.” Could MAGACOIN Realistically Reach the Top 10? To crack the top 10 by late 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE would need a market cap of at least $23 billion—currently the level held by TRON. If it hit $1 per token, its market cap would soar to $100–170 billion, depending on supply—placing it alongside BNB, ETH, and even XRP. It’s a moonshot scenario, but that’s exactly what SHIB and XRP once were. In reality, MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the most successful presales in recent memory—without needing to dethrone any incumbents. The point is not whether it can hit a $100 billion market cap overnight, but whether it can become the kind of cultural and market force that might get close. And for now, momentum is leaning in that direction. Conclusion: Is This the Next XRP or SHIB Moment? History shows that the crypto market rewards bold bets made early. XRP rewarded those who believed before the banks did. Shiba Inu made millionaires out of memecoin gamblers. MAGACOIN FINANCE may not follow the same path—but it’s showing signs of being that kind of story. If it sustains momentum, gets listed on major exchanges, and captures the attention of both meme traders and serious crypto backers, it might not just rise—it could rocket. Top 10 in 2025? That’s still speculative. But for now, MAGACOIN FINANCE is doing exactly what XRP and SHIB did before they made history.

The funds will be used to buy BTC mining equipment, a new filing by Hut 8 Corp. revealed. Per a Bloomberg report, about $10 million in equity was sold for Bitcoin rather than dollars on Friday, in a new share issuance to private investors. “The Company intends to use the net proceeds to fund its strategic and Bitcoin accumulation goals, which may include, but are not limited to, the purchase of Bitcoin and/or miners,” the filing read. Hut 8 Corp SEC filing . Source: Hut 8 American Bitcoin is a relatively new entity launched in March , which exclusively focuses on industrial-scale Bitcoin mining and strategic Bitcoin reserve development. The company is a majority-owned subsidiary of Hut 8. Eric Trump’s brother, Donald Trump Jr, said in May, “simply buying Bitcoin is only half the story,” adding that mining it becomes a bigger opportunity under favourable economics. Hut 8 Plans American Bitcoin Merger The report added that the company is pursuing a Nasdaq listing through a full stock merger with Gryphon Digital Mining. Following the merger, both the sons of President Trump, Eric Trump, Donald Trump Jr., along with existing shareholders, will retain 98% of the shares in the new entity, a move that was already announced in May . The newly combined entity will operate under the American Bitcoin brand and is expected to carry the ticker symbol “ABTC,” on Nasdaq.

Amid this realignment in the crypto sector, this under $0.20 DeFi token, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is garnering the attention of crypto investors. According to analysts, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could rise 45x once it goes live, and best of all, it is still in the presale phase. As such, it presents a massive opportunity for huge return due to the discount in the current phase of the presale. MUTM tokens are destined for succes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in the presale, where tokens are going for a 50% discount. In the current phase 5 of the presale, tokens are going for $0.03. The tokens will list for $0.06, which makes this the perfect opportunity to add MUTM to your portfolio. So far, over $11.3 million has been raised in the ongoing presale from around 12,550 unique buyers. The presale has been a massive success, where 50% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 have been sold, less than a month after they went live. At this rate, the window for the massive discount will not last long. This is because the token price will go up by 16.67% in the phase 6 to $0.035. Why analysts are confident of a 45x increase Analysts predict that the price of MUTM tokens could rise 45x, and for good reason. One of the reasons they are so confident about the future price of the tokens is the planned beta version launch. The beta version of the Mutuum Finance platform will coincide with the token listing. This event is expected to generate massive media interest, pushing the price of MUTM tokens to new heights. One way it will achieve this is by inspiring fence-sitters to finally add MUTM tokens to their portfolio. As the capital starts to stream in, this will push up the price. Another reason for the optimism amongst investors is the upcoming altcoin rally. The crypto market is currently in a period of transition that has seen price movement remain stagnant. After this phase passes, the price of crypto is expected to explode, leading to massive gains for their holders. The next altcoin rally is expected to be led by utility, and not mere hype. This is because while meme coins helped to bring in a massive number of new users, they did not deliver on their promise of high returns. These users, who have had time to analyze their past trading strategies, are now laser-focused on utility. This new focus will benefit the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project, which is built on the solid foundation of utility. Another reason why analysts have high hopes for MUTM tokens is that the project is CertiK-audited. A CertiK audit has become crucial to the success of any project in the modern era of crypto. While projects may have gotten by in the past without one, most investors will not even look at a project twice if it has not been CertiK audited. So far, the project has a Token Scan Score of 95 on CertiK. Mutuum Finance partners with CertiK As part of the effort to maintain the highest levels of security on the ecosystem, Mutuum Finance has partnered with CertiK on a $50,000 USDT bug bounty program. The program is split into four tiers, which are critical, major, minor, and low. Those that find the most critical issues on the platform will get the biggest rewards. The protocol design Mutuum Finance is a decentralized non-custodial protocol where users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. Lenders deposit their assets in the protocol’s pools to receive interest. Borrowers, on the other hand, deposit collateral into the pools to access the liquidity. Interest rates for both lenders and borrowers are determined by the pool utilization rate. As borrowers take a larger portion of the liquidity in a pool the interest rate rises. That encourages the borrowers to repay their loans while attracting more lenders to deposit liquidity in the pools. As a result, the overall liquidity of the protocol grows. This system is designed to ensure optimal capital utilization. MUTM could be your next explosive gainer Analysts forecast that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be one of biggest beneficiaries of the upcoming altcoin rally. You can be part of this explosive 40x growth by adding MUTM tokens to your portfolio. This is the opportunity that you have been waiting for in the crypto sector.

To capitalize on this upcoming surge in prices, investors are positioning themselves in crypto projects that could deliver the biggest results. XRP, being one of the most notable names in the crypto market, has been a source of interest for crypto analysts recently. They have noted capital shifting out of XRP into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as part of an overall strategic realignment in the crypto sector. One of the reasons for this trend is that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been rightly identified as one of the biggest gainers in the upcoming bull cycle. According to analysts, MUTM tokens could soar 29x when the altcoin season starts. Let us examine why there is so much interest in MUTM tokens among XRP investors. Huge growth forecast for MUTM tokens Mutuum Finance is currently in the presale phase, where tokens are going for $0.03, a 50% discount on the listing price of $0.06. This massive discount has attracted the attention of XRP holders looking for new upside. So far, they have bought 50% of the tokens set aside for phase 5, less than a month after they launched. The presale has raised over $11.3 million so far, from around 12,550 unique buyers. These figures are expected to continue rising as more capital from new buyers keeps pouring into the presale. With the price set to go up by 16.67% in phase 6 to $0.035, the window to benefit from the 50% discount is fast closing. This is the time you should act. According to analysts, the price of MUTM tokens could soar 29x during the altcoin rally. That is a massive surge that you should not ignore. For instance, if you were to invest $1700 in the presale right now, that amount could grow to over $49,000. This optimistic forecast is based on the reality of the project, including the protocol design. One of the factors commonly cited by analysts is the planned buyback program. The Mutuum Finance team plans to use a large portion of the protocol profits to purchase MUTM tokens at market prices. That is expected to drive up the price of the tokens, increasing their prestige. That will attract more capital into MUTM tokens, creating a cycle of upward growth. Another factor that analysts point to is the planned beta version launch on the token listing day. This event will generate a lot of publicity for the project while acting as tangible proof that Mutuum Finance is a genuine project. It is expected to attract investors who were previously on the sidelines to purchase MUTM tokens, further contributing to the price increases. Savvy investors who understand the significant impact this beta platform launch will have are not waiting until then. They are securing their MUTM tokens now to capitalize on this expected surge. The Mutuum Finance protocol Mutuum Finance is a decentralized non-custodial protocol where users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. Lenders deposit their assets into the protocol’s smart contract pools to earn interest. Meanwhile, borrowers deposit collateral into the pools to access the liquidity. To ensure the safety of lenders’ funds, Mutuum Finance requires that all loans be overcollateralized. The exact level of overcollateralization is determined by various protocol parameters. These parameters assess various aspects of a project, such as its liquidity and volatility. Based on the potential of an asset for destabilizing market movement, it can get more conservative collateralization requirements. Massive giveaway Mutuum Finance has organized a massive $100,000 giveaway for presale buyers. In the ongoing giveaway, ten lucky winners could each win $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. To be one of these ten lucky winners, you only need to participate in the presale with a minimum of $50. This giveaway has been a notable driver of the presale pace. The momentum is expected to carry over to the token launch, pushing up the price of MUTM tokens. Mutuum Finance collaborates with CertiK for enhanced security Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched a $50,000 bug bounty program in collaboration with CertiK. In this partnership, security experts will receive rewards for presenting accurate bug reports to the Mutuum Finance team. The program is split into four tiers, which are critical, major, minor, and low. Depending on the potential impact of a vulnerability on the smooth operations of the platform, security experts could receive massive rewards. MUTM tokens to lead the Q3 surge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is forecast to be one of the biggest gainers of Q3. As June 2025 draws to a close, you can position yourself to be one of the beneficiaries of this expected surge by adding MUTM tokens to your portfolio right now. Best of all, you will get your tokens at a 50% discount if you can act fast enough.

So far, Solana (SOL) is emerging as one of the most talked about projects, as the price hovers around $150. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) has stalled at around $2450. Both SOL and ETH have struggled to regain momentum seen just a few weeks earlier. As a result, they are turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to drive future growth. So far, analysts give glowing reviews for MUTM tokens, forecasting that the price could rise 34x once the tokens go live. For investors, the ongoing presale presents the perfect entry point. Let us take a deep dive into why MUTM could be a better alternative than ETH and SOL. The MUTM token presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in the presale phase, where tokens are going for $0.03. The current price is a 50% discount on the listing price of $0.06, which presents the perfect entry point. So far, around 12,550 investors have raised over $11.3 million in the ongoing presale. Seeking to take full advantage of the current price, 50% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 have been sold, less than a month after they launched. However, the current discount will not last forever. In phase 6, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. Based on the current momentum of the presale, analysts forecast the token price could rise by 34x. That means if you invest $1800 in the current phase, your investment could grow to over $61,000. One of the main reasons for this optimistic forecast is the recent entry of whales into the presale. In the crypto market, ETH and SOL whales are known as trend setters. These are people who make investment choices based on extensive market research. As such, analysts often study their on-chain activity to determine the future direction of the market. With so many pouring into the MUTM token presale, this is a clear signal of the expected future returns. Besides the on-chain activity, various other factors have inspired the lofty price forecasts. One of these is the planned beta version launch. This launch will coincide with the token listing, which is expected to be a double dose of good news. It will bring more attention to the project, while also inspiring doubters to purchase tokens. The beta launch will serve as a useful demonstrator of the true potential of the project. Additionally, it will provide an avenue for analysts and commentators to examine the protocol and give their feedback. That will provide an opportunity for the Mutuum Finance team to make final tweaks before the final launch. Another reason why analysts are so optimistic about the future of MUTM tokens is that the team has already acquired a CertiK audit. The audit is a mark of quality in the crypto sector, and most savvy investors will not invest in projects that do not have one. This will help build trust in MUTM tokens, contributing to their upward price movement. Additionally, the team has already secured a listing on CoinMarketCap. This strategic move, early in the project, ensures that potential buyers will have an easy means of discovering MUTM tokens. With over 350 million monthly followers, CoinMarketCap will be an important source of capital inflows into Mutuum Finance (MUTM). CertiK partnership Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is committed to the security of its users. In line with this commitment, it has partnered with CertiK on a $50,000 USDT bug bounty program. The program is split into four tiers of critical, major, minor, and low. Security researchers who prepare accurate bug reports will be awarded via this program. The rewards they receive will be based on the severity of the threat that they help to identify. This will help Mutuum Finance to establish lasting relationships with the global security community. The protocol design The Mutuum Finance protocol is designed to support the growth of MUTM tokens directly. For instance, the team plans to use protocol profits to purchase MUTM tokens at market prices. That will create demand pressure on the tokens, contributing to their price increase. The protocol is designed to allow users to participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. Lenders deposit their assets into the smart contract pools to earn interest. Their interest payments are based on a pool’s utilization rate. As borrowers take a larger portion of the funds in the liquidity pools by depositing overcollateralized collateral, it pushes up the interest rates. That encourages borrowers to repay their loans, while incentivizing more lenders to deposit assets to benefit from the higher yields. The system is designed to ensure optimal capital utilization. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is poised to be one of the biggest gainers of 2025. With tokens currently selling at a 50% discount, this is one opportunity you do not want to miss.

This move is part of the main goal to establish Kazakhstan as a regional hub, including the recent “CryptoCity” pilot zone launched by President Tokayev. The idea of national crypto reserves is gaining global traction, with Texas and India considering similar strategies. On the corporate side, Michael Saylor’s Strategy expanded its Bitcoin holdings with a $531.9 million purchase, pushing its total to 597,325 BTC and increasing its year-to-date yield to nearly 20%. Meanwhile, BitMine Immersion Technologies raised $250 million to launch an Ethereum treasury, due to ETH’s growing role in stablecoin transactions. This reflects the trend of companies now diversifying into Ethereum. In fact, SharpLink Gaming and Bit Digital also pivoted toward ETH-based strategies to future-proof their digital asset reserves. Kazakhstan Eyes Crypto Reserve Kazakhstan is taking a big step toward integrating cryptocurrency into its national financial framework with plans to establish a state-managed crypto reserve. According to a Monday report from the government-run news agency Kazinform, the National Bank of Kazakhstan is actively studying the development of a crypto reserve, which aligns with international best practices. The proposed reserve will likely be funded through expropriated digital assets and revenue from state-operated crypto mining activities. Kazakhstan central bank’s response to the inquiry National Bank Chairman Timur Suleimenov acknowledged the inherent risks and volatility of cryptocurrencies but believes that centralized oversight will allow for better risk management and regulatory control. A document dated May 22, responding to a parliamentary inquiry, confirmed the central bank’s support for the reserve and suggested it could be managed by a subsidiary specializing in alternative investments. This move is part of Kazakhstan’s embrace of digital assets. In May, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev introduced plans for “CryptoCity,” which is a pilot zone where cryptocurrencies can be used to pay for goods and services. The initiative is part of a larger vision to transform Kazakhstan into a regional crypto hub. Kanysh Tuleushin, the country’s first vice minister of digital development, pointed out that streamlined regulation could make Kazakhstan a leading force in the Central Asian crypto space. However, the government is also increasing its enforcement efforts. Authorities cracked down on 36 illegal crypto exchanges in 2024 to help curb money laundering and improve financial oversight. The idea of state-run crypto reserves is gaining a lot of traction globally. These initiatives typically focus on Bitcoin as the preferred reserve asset. In India, Pradeep Bhandari of the ruling BJP party recently called for a Bitcoin reserve pilot and greater policy clarity. In the United States, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a bill to create the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve , following in the footsteps of the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve concept. Strategy Adds $531M in BTC Meanwhile, Michael Saylor’s Strategy continued to expand its BTC portfolio after buying 4,980 Bitcoin for $531.9 million during the week ending Sunday. According to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company paid an average of $106,801 per coin, as Bitcoin prices surged from around $101,000 on June 23 to above $108,000 by the end of the week. With this latest purchase, Strategy now holds a total of 597,325 BTC, which was acquired for approximately $42.4 billion at an average price of $70,982 per Bitcoin. The company’s year-to-date gain in Bitcoin climbed to 85,871 BTC, equivalent to roughly $9.5 billion, bringing it closer to the 2024 full-year gain of 140,538 BTC or $13 billion. Additionally, Strategy’s Bitcoin yield increased slightly to 19.7%, up 0.5%, as the firm targets a 25% YTD yield by the end of 2025. The quarter-to-date yield also ticked up 0.4% to reach 7.8%. Speculation surrounding a major BTC move was confirmed when blockchain analysts identified that Strategy transferred 7,383 BTC worth about $796 million to three new wallets. The transfer was reported by Lookonchain , and was likely for enhanced custody purposes. Historically, Strategy largely maintained a buy-and-hold approach, with only one known instance of selling 704 BTC in December of 2022 before quickly buying back more than it sold just two days later. Ahead of the official announcement, Saylor shared a clip from a 2020 interview with RealVision founder Raoul Pal, which centered around the company’s early conviction in Bitcoin. Saylor described how Strategy took a bold stance by going “irresponsibly long” on Bitcoin starting in August 2020. He explained a long-term vision, and stated that his investment was meant to benefit future generations and that selling wasn’t part of the plan. Saylor explained that even if Bitcoin were to increase a hundredfold, he might only consider borrowing against it rather than selling. BitMine Shifts to Ethereum Strategy Ethereum (ETH) is also picking up some steam as a reserve asset. Bitcoin mining firm BitMine Immersion Technologies announced a $250 million private placement to launch an Ethereum-focused corporate treasury. The deal involves the sale of 55,555,556 common shares at $4.50 each and is expected to close on Thursday, pending approval from the NYSE American. The raise was led by MOZAYYX and included high-profile participants like Founders Fund, Pantera, FalconX, Republic Digital, Kraken, Galaxy Digital, Digital Currency Group, Diametric Capital, Occam Crest Management, and Thomas Lee. Thomas Lee, who is the chairman of BitMine, compared the role of stablecoins in crypto to that of ChatGPT in AI, and suggested that Ethereum stands to benefit significantly from the rising use of stablecoins. Since most stablecoin transactions are conducted on Ethereum, Lee expects ETH to appreciate in value. This move comes amid the broader trend of corporate interest in Ethereum treasuries. Earlier this month, SharpLink Gaming bought 176,271 ETH for $463 million, making it the largest publicly traded holder of Ethereum. The purchase followed SharpLink’s May launch of its ETH treasury and the appointment of Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin as chairman of its board. BitMine previously focused on Bitcoin , but now describes itself as a company committed to both Bitcoin and Ethereum networks with a long-term accumulation strategy. According to BitcoinTreasuries.NET, BitMine currently holds 154 BTC valued at approximately $17 million, placing it 63rd among corporate Bitcoin treasuries . BitMine’s ranking among some of the top Bitcoin treasury companies ( Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) Other firms are also adjusting their crypto strategies. Bit Digital recently announced plans to exit Bitcoin mining and reallocate capital into Ethereum. The decision triggered a sharp market response, with Bit Digital shares falling by close to 19% over five days, including a 15% drop in just 24 hours.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|ETH|REGULATION|MINING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-01 05:45:30

However, in 2025, a new contender has been rapidly emerging, overshadowing the DOGE project. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has emerged as a leading alternative for DOGE investors looking for growth. Unlike the DOGE meme coin, which is powered by hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) runs on a solid base of utility. Its focus on utility is expected to drive reliable and sustainable growth for years to come. Let us examine why analysts expect MUTM tokens to be the best performer of 2025. Roaring success of the presale Its focus on utility has been an attractive value proposition for investors, and the MUTM presale has already raised over $11.3 million from around 12,550 unique buyers. That proves that the crypto world understands the massive potential that this project holds. Tokens are currently going for $0.03 in the current phase 5 of the presale, a 50% discount on the listing price of $0.06. However, this massive discount will not last forever; in the next phase of the presale, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. That will significantly reduce the expected discount. So far, 50% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 have been sold, which signals the seriousness with which presale buyers are taking this discount. If you want to capitalize on this massive discount, this is the time to act. Based on the current pace of the presale, where half the tokens for phase 5 have been sold, less than a month after they launched, analysts are very optimistic. They forecast that the price could rise 32x when they go live. Based on that forecast, a $1900 investment in the presale right now could grow to over $60,000. That is a massive return that could be even bigger since there is no upper cap on how much you can invest in the presale. Why analysts are so optimistic Besides the general investor enthusiasm that has pushed the presale to the current price, analysts have identified several factors that could push the MUTM token price to the moon. One of these is the expected beta version launch. Mutuum Finance plans to launch a beta version of the platform on the token listing day. This beta launch is specifically designed to coincide with the token listing to generate the most media impact. That will lead to massive interest in MUTM tokens, which will push up the price of the tokens. As the price increases, it will attract new buyers, which will support further price increases. The beta launch itself is expected to act as proof of concept, helping to demonstrate the full utility of Mutuum Finance. That is expected to inspire fence sitters to finally make up their minds and add MUTM to their portfolio. Mutuum Finance is already listed on CoinMarketCap. As such, it will provide a convenient platform for bargain hunters looking for projects on the rise. With over 350 million monthly visitors to CoinMarketCap, this could be a significant source of new capital for the project. Another important development working in its favor is the CertiK audit. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is CertiK audited and has a Token Scan Score of 95. So far, this has been a source of trust in the project and is expected to continue inspiring confidence in investors regarding the project. Consequently, it will ensure sustained momentum for MUTM tokens. The protocol design Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed as a decentralized non-custodial protocol where users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. The lenders deposit their assets into the protocol’s smart contract pools to earn interest. Borrowers can then deposit overcollateralized collateral into the same pools to access the liquidity. To support the upward price movement of MUTM tokens, the Mutuum Finance team plans to use protocol profits to purchase MUTM tokens off the open market. These purchases will be carefully timed to ensure they have maximum impact on the price. CertiK partnership Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has partnered with CertiK on a $50,000 USDT bug bounty program. In this program, security experts will receive rewards for helping to identify vulnerabilities in the ecosystem. The program will be split into four tiers, which are critical, major, minor, and low. It is expected to boost confidence in Mutuum Finance in the long term. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is your best option in 2025 The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale presents your best option for massive returns in 2025. With analysts forecasting 32x gains when the tokens go live, the current price of $0.03 presents the perfect entry point for smart investors. Do not be left out of this massive opportunity.

The news was disclosed in a June 30 filing reviewed by Bloomberg, which revealed that part of the equity sale, worth about $10 million, was transacted directly in Bitcoin ( BTC ) rather than U.S. dollars. Through the issuance of additional shares to private investors, American Bitcoin was able to raise $220 million for asset accumulation and mining expansion. The capital raise marks a high-profile entry into the crypto space for the Trump-linked entity and reflects growing institutional confidence in digital asset markets. This comes as political momentum builds in the U.S. for pro -crypto regulation. President Donald Trump continues to promote crypto-friendly policies during his administration. His sons, Eric and Donald Jr., have both been involved in multiple blockchain ventures since their father’s time in office.

As part of its launch, Hut 8 Corp. transferred its mining equipment to the new venture in exchange for an 80% equity stake. Hut 8, which operates mining sites in Alberta, New York, and Texas, plans to take American Bitcoin public via a merger with Gryphon Digital Mining Inc. Bitcoin mining, central to American Bitcoin’s strategy, involves using specialized equipment to verify transactions on the blockchain in exchange for new BTC rewards. The new capital will be used to scale both Bitcoin purchases and infrastructure to support mining activities at a larger scale. Hut 8 has also revealed plans to expand into Dubai. The company has filed paperwork with the Dubai International Financial Centre and is assembling a team there, although it said this move is unrelated to the American Bitcoin project. The capital raise puts American Bitcoin on track to become one of the better-funded mining ventures in the U.S., combining political visibility with an aggressive acquisition strategy. With a public listing in sight, it may soon join the growing number of Bitcoin-focused companies trading on U.S. markets.

The decision was confirmed on June 30 post on X by Lido, following a successful vote by holders of Lido DAO ( LDO ) tokens. The new system is set to launch on-chain on July 4. A dynamic timelock mechanism introduced by Dual Governance enables stETH holders to block or delay proposals approved by LDO holders if they disagree. The more stETH that is locked in opposition, the longer the delay. An additional timelock of 5 to 45 days is added to any proposal if at least 1% of the entire supply of stETH is locked in protest. When 10% opposition is reached, a “rage quit” is triggered, which completely halts governance activities until the opposing stakers have exited the protocol. https://twitter.com/lidofinance/status/1939742934003253656?s=46&t=nznXkss3debX8JIhNzHmzw The feature is intended to mitigate governance capture risks and ensure that Ethereum ( ETH ) stakers are not excluded from governance decisions that they disagree with. It resolves long-standing issues regarding the power disparity between those who actively stake ETH through Lido and those who hold LDO. You might also like: Maple Finance, Lido partner to unlock stablecoin credit lines According to Lido, the new system acts as both a signal of contention and a safety mechanism. This structure aims to prevent rushed or potentially harmful proposals from being executed without giving stakers time to respond. It also gives those who stake ETH through Lido a clearer path to exit if they disagree with the DAO’s direction. The design incorporates several safety measures as well, such as a Reseal Committee to control delays, a Tiebreaker Committee to break deadlocks, and an Emergency Committee to step in the event of a critical failure. The LDO token has not responded positively to the update. It has dropped 2% in the last day and 13% in the last month, indicating that the market is being cautious as the new system is implemented. To date, the Dual Governance framework marks one of the most advanced DAO structures introduced in decentralized finance. By aligning incentives between stakers and token holders, Lido hopes to create a more resilient and inclusive governance process for Ethereum staking.

In the last month alone, XRP has tested the same price level, around $2.31 to $2.32, three times, but each time it’s faced resistance and pulled back. Right now, this price zone has become a key hurdle for XRP to cross before aiming for higher targets. If XRP can hold above this $2.31–$2.32 range and stay strong, it could open the door to test $3 again in the near future. Beyond that, a break past $2.35 would be an important signal for a move toward $2.56 and higher. Can XRP Price Hit $30? One long-time XRP supporter recently shared their personal price opinion on social media, saying they believe XRP could eventually hit between $30 and $50. While they admitted this was just their opinion and not a prediction with any specific timeline, it shows the trust many XRP holders continue to have for the token’s long-term future. I usually don't predict XRP price but often get asked, so here it is FINALLY… Of course, like many, I hold XRP in hopes of price going up, so it would make sense to have an opinion.

Horizon, which recently announced its launch on X, has triggered an urgent response from Xrpl.to, the largest XRPL token tracker in the market. Xrpl.to advises XRP holders against using the Horizon application under any circumstances if they value the safety of their funds. This is not speculation but another alert from a trusted community member aimed at safeguarding users who may unknowingly compromise their wallets. Please do not use this #XRPL application unless you want to lose all your funds. If you have entered your seed, it is highly advisable that you get a new XRP account and transfer yourfunds. If you generated a wallet using this app, you should do the same. You’ve been warned. https://t.co/GTeybecOV0 — xrpl.to (@xrplto) June 29, 2025 Seed Phrase Security at Risk The core issue highlighted involves the handling of seed phrases, which are essential for accessing XRP wallets. Xrpl.to advises that anyone who has entered their seed into this application should immediately create a new XRP account and transfer their funds. The warning extends to those who may have generated new wallets using the application, stressing that these users should migrate their assets to safer wallets. This warning should be taken seriously as Xrpl.to is a reputable XRPL token tracking service widely used by the XRP community for reliable data and insights. Validator Issues Reinforced Warning Further strengthening the alert, Vet (@Vet_X0), a respected validator on the XRPL, provided critical advice in response. Vet stressed the importance of being extremely careful when handling XRP account seed phrases, emphasizing that the safest approach is to create new wallets rather than importing existing seeds. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Vet also warned against rushing into unfamiliar projects without due diligence. The validator emphasized the importance of asking questions, conducting thorough checks, and remaining vigilant, especially when real financial assets are at risk. Safeguarding Your Assets Vet and many other experts have warned the community against scammers and risky/fraudulent projects in the ecosystem, and this warning aligns closely with standard best practices in the crypto space, where poorly designed platforms and malicious actors remain a constant risk to those who are not cautious. While some voices within the XRP community suggest that the situation may not be as severe as it appears, the recommendation from both xrpl.to and Vet is clear. Although amendments like clawback may help with recovery in some cases, XRP cannot be clawed back , and the safest approach is to act conservatively when the security of funds is in question. For all XRP holders who have interacted with Horizon using their private keys or seed phrases, the recommended action is to move funds immediately to a fresh wallet. This step may be inconvenient, but it is far preferable to the potential loss of assets. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

If $2,200 Cracks, $1,160 May Be Coming",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-risk-2200-cracks-1160-may-be-coming/,"Ethereum currently has strong support at $2,200, but one analyst has pointed out that if the level fails, the next region to watch could be $1,160. On-Chain Data Shows Strong Ethereum Demand Zone Near $2,200 In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about where support lies for Ethereum based on on-chain data. In on-chain analysis, levels are considered as major support/resistance zones if they host the cost basis or acquisition level of a significant part of the ETH supply. The reason behind this lies in the fact that investors are more likely to show some kind of reaction when the retest of their break-even level takes place. This buying/selling is irrelevant to the wider market if only a few holders are having it tested at once, but the story can be different when the retest is of the cost basis of a large amount of them. Related Reading: Dogecoin Under Pressure: Only Top 10 Coin Where Loss-Taking Exceeds Profit Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows how the different price levels around the current Ethereum spot price are currently looking in terms of the amount of supply that was purchased at them. In the graph, the size of the dot corresponds to the amount of Ethereum supply contained within the associated price range. It would appear that, out of the ranges listed, the $2,218 to $2,396 levels currently have the largest dot, meaning that they host the most supply. More specifically, this range has the cost basis of 6.28 million addresses, who purchased a total of 67.2 million ETH at its levels. Given this fact, it’s possible that should a retest of the range occur, investors could show a strong reaction. But what kind of reaction would it be, buying or selling? Well, these investors are in profit right now and usually, such holders are more likely to double down on the asset during declines to their acquisition mark, as they may believe the same price level would turn out to be profitable again in the future. As such, the $2,218 to $2,396 range could end up acting as a strong support level for Ethereum. In the scenario that ETH falls below the lower end of the range around $2,200, however, it may have to rely on support elsewhere. Related Reading: XRP Down 3% After SEC Settlement Stalls, But Social Media Turns Bullish From the chart, it’s apparent that all the ranges below are much smaller in terms of supply. The next major support zone lies all the way down at $1,160, where 35.9 million addresses acquired 21.58 million tokens. Naturally, Ethereum doesn’t have to slip right through to this zone if $2,200 is lost, but if the data is to go by, it does suggest that the coin could have a harder time regaining footing below it. ETH Price Ethereum is holding above the on-chain demand zone for now as its price is floating around $2,475.

While most of the market remains quiet, a few altcoins like XRP are showing bullish signs. Alongside XRP, other projects like Chainlink, SEI, and SUI also have important updates lined up this month that could spark fresh price action. Here’s a look at four altcoins that could make headlines in July. XRP XRP has traded in a narrow range between $2 and $2.40 over the last three months but July could be a big month for the token. A technical pattern called a “symmetrical triangle” has formed on the XRP chart, and this often means a breakout is near. To confirm this, XRP will need to push past the $2.40 resistance level. Source: CoreCrypto For now, XRP sits at around $2.23, and experts are watching closely for a decisive move.

But while these two established altcoins are building momentum on the charts, one emerging presale—MAGACOIN FINANCE—is quietly gaining ground as a potential breakout leader this cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gaining Fast as Early-Stage Hype Builds MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of the most watched presale tokens of the year, with analysts projecting massive upside potential. While DOGE and XRP rely on price compression patterns and resistance breaks to move higher, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in its early growth phase. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE particularly compelling is the convergence of early momentum, viral community support, and predictions from top analysts who believe this could be 2025’s biggest altcoin surprise. With retail investors increasingly drawn to tokens that combine memetic power with speculative upside, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being seen as more than just a trend—it’s emerging as a strategic first pick in high-risk, high-reward portfolios. DOGE and XRP Show Compression Breakout Potential For Dogecoin, technical analysts are closely monitoring a symmetrical triangle that has formed after weeks of tightening price action. This pattern suggests a breakout is imminent. If DOGE breaks above the $0.22 resistance level—or falls below $0.16—the resulting move could stretch up to 60% in either direction. So far, DOGE has held support above $0.165 and shown higher lows, signaling strong trader confidence ahead of a potential bullish move. XRP is also flashing bullish indicators. A recent breakout above $2.20 was accompanied by a triple-volume surge, marking a clear shift in market sentiment. The token now sits within a long-term symmetrical triangle that has taken over 300 days to form. Technical analysts say this kind of extended buildup typically precedes powerful upside action—possibly toward the $5–$10 range if XRP maintains its current structure. Improved macro conditions, reduced geopolitical tensions, and broader stability across risk assets have created a favorable environment for these moves. Both DOGE and XRP are now riding a wave of renewed momentum—just as many retail traders re-enter the market in anticipation of Q3 volatility. The Stage Is Set for Q3 Surprises What ties these three assets together—Dogecoin, XRP, and MAGACOIN FINANCE—is timing. DOGE and XRP are nearing critical inflection points, supported by volume surges and long-formed technical setups. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting early believers looking for exponential returns before mainstream discovery. While Dogecoin and XRP may dominate headlines with breakout rallies, the one that truly stands out for investors seeking high-risk, high-reward opportunities is MAGACOIN FINANCE. Its low price entry point, rapid presale momentum, and projected upside make it a strategic first pick for 2025. With Q3 just around the corner, all eyes are on which altcoin will lead the charge—and MAGACOIN FINANCE is making a strong case to be that frontrunner.

This major update enables Ethereum-style smart contracts on the XRP Ledger, setting the stage for a wave of new dApps , wallets, and cross-chain bridges. The XRP EVM sidechain launch has been one of the most anticipated updates in the XRP ecosystem. It bridges XRP with the Ethereum ecosystem , boosting functionality for developers while drawing new capital and innovation to the network. This comes at a time when altcoins are gaining momentum, and XRP’s price action is aligning with broader bullish sentiment in the market. With all this positive news, Will XRP break past $3 in July ? XRP Price Forecast For July According to popular crypto analyst CasiTrades, XRP is currently following a bullish breakout structure he forecasted earlier. He notes that the XRP price has surged toward $2.30, with the next crucial step being a pullback to $2.25. “XRP needs to test $2.25 as new support, it’s the macro .382 Fib retracement . Hold that cleanly, and we’re headed for the next leg higher,” said Casi on X . This level marks a critical breakout confirmation. If XRP flips this zone into strong support, the next targets are clear. Ripple (XRP ) Momentum Still Intact: No Bearish Divergence Casi adds that technical indicators remain strong, with the RSI showing no bearish divergence on lower timeframes. This suggests that the breakout was not just hype; it was backed by genuine buying volume. If the RSI resets on a retest of $2.25, XRP could gather the strength for an even larger breakout, possibly toward its all-time highs. “Momentum is clean, no signs of weakness yet,” Casi added in a follow-up post . [post_titles_links postid=”477128″] How High Can XRP Price Go in July? If XRP holds the $2.25 zone, the next major resistance levels are at $2.69 and $3.04. Once those are cleared, analysts believe XRP could enter “blue skies”, a zone with minimal overhead resistance and massive upside potential. The Ripple vs SEC legal battle is finally winding down, with Ripple dropping its appeal. Meanwhile, XRP ETF rumors are circulating in the market, fueling further bullish sentiment.

Kiyosaki stated that Bitcoin's current price level seems “expensive” but that in the future, even today's prices will be considered “cheap”. Kiyosaki admitted that he started investing in Bitcoin late, and stated that he made his first BTC purchase at $6,000. The economist, who said that this price was expensive for him at the time, said that he regrets not buying more Bitcoin at that level today: “I bought my first Bitcoin for $6,000. It was expensive at the time. But now I wish I had bought more.” Related News: Tensions Escalate Between Donald Trump and Fed Chair Jerome Powell - Trump Sends Handwritten Letter - Here Are the Details Reminding that Bitcoin is trading at $107,000 today, Kiyosaki stated that he continues to buy despite this: “Today, my brain says again, ‘this is expensive.’ But I’m buying more. Because if and when Bitcoin reaches $1 million, I’ll say again, ‘I wish I had bought more.’” Giving a message to investors, Kiyosaki argued that those who can only buy one Satoshi (one 100 millionth of Bitcoin) will be happy with their decisions in the future: “Even if you can only afford one Satoshi today, I believe that five years from now you will say, ‘I wish I had bought more.’” Kiyosaki said he didn't know if Bitcoin would ever reach $1 million, but added: “All I know is this: When I look back at the Bitcoin I bought at $107,000, I'll say, 'Buying Bitcoin at that price was priceless.'” *This is not investment advice.

This action follows several months of discussions involving Bitwise, NYSE Arca, and regulatory officials. The Ethereum ETF initially received approval to hold Ethereum directly, but Bitwise later suggested incorporating staking . Staking allows Ethereum holders to lock up their tokens to assist in securing the blockchain. In return, they earn brand new tokens. SEC weighs risks as Bitwise pushes for staking in Ethereum ETF Staking is widely seen as a way to make some extra money. But regulators argue that allowing staking in an Ethereum ETF could increase those risks, and even raise conflicts of interest. The agency seeks to determine if staking in an ETH ETF could harm investors. Bitwise argues that staking could offer its ETF’s investor base additional income-generating opportunities . Nevertheless, the SEC maintains that any changes to the Ethereum ETF should protect investors and promote equitable trading. Officials have said they are wary that staking could leave the ETF at risk of manipulation or dishonest conduct. SEC opens public comment period on Ethereum ETF staking The SEC has invited public comments that will dictate the fate of staking in the Ethereum ETF. Increasing numbers of investors are looking to get more exposure to Ethereum without having to own the asset directly. The green light last year for spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs was a big step forward. Still, staking as part of an ETH ETF is a sensitive matter with the SEC. The commission has established a schedule for comments on the issue. Later, it will consider all the input it has received before it makes a final determination. In the meantime, the fund will operate as a regular spot ETH ETF. This result could impact how staking is treated in future ETFs. If it’s adopted, other asset managers could also seek staking options. Analysts raise odds to 95% for Solana, XRP, and Litecoin ETFs Analysts covering the crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) space have tipped a 95% chance for Solana, Litecoin, and XRP ETFs to be approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission this year. In an X post on Monday, Bloomberg’s ETF specialists Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart increased their odds for several altcoin spot exchange-traded funds. “We expect a wave of new ETFs in the second half of 2025,” said Syeffart. The pair tipped the odds for Solana, XRP, and Litecoin spot ETF approval at 95%, up from 90% . They gave the same odds for the approval of an ETF based on a basket or index of crypto assets. According to the analysts, the final SEC deadline for a decision on the three altcoin ETFs is in October, while a crypto basket ETF could be approved this week. Meanwhile, REX Osprey Solana Staking ETF is officially set to launch on Wednesday, becoming the first in the US to allow crypto staking. The product faced initial regulatory hurdles with the SEC, which objected after clearing its registration. The main issue was whether the ETF qualified as an investment company under securities laws. To gain approval, the issuers compromised by agreeing to invest at least 40% of assets in other ETPs, mostly domiciled outside the US. Meanwhile, the SEC is not yet ready to approve Ethereum staking, after issuing an official notice stating that it will initiate a new examination of the Ethereum ETF proposal.

The new yield-chasing crypto fund tracking Solana has been cleared for debut, according to Bloomberg, citing a person familiar with the matter. Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas explained that the fund has circumvented regulatory hurdles by investing 40% of its holdings in other Solana exchange-traded products. Solana Staking by Proxy The REX-Osprey product faced regulatory hurdles with the SEC, which initially objected after clearing an initial registration. The primary issue was whether the ETF qualified as an “investment company” under federal law. However, the issuers agreed to a compromise by investing at least 40% of assets in other ETFs, mostly domiciled outside the US. The lineup includes ETPs, which are typically classified as securities, that track Solana and staked Solana . “The move to allow ETFs that offer staking yield is a further step in the marriage we are seeing between public markets and the crypto economy,” Strahinja Savic, head of data and analytics at FRNT Financial, told Bloomberg. He added that it was another example of how the Trump Administration is “opening the door for crypto to become an integrated part of the US economy via public markets,” rather than a “pariah asset class” that was difficult for traditional investors to access. The launch follows other Solana ETFs like the Volatility Shares Solana ETF (SOLZ) and its leveraged fund, SOLT, which track futures and offer leveraged exposure. “Crypto ETF summer kicks off,” said ETF Store President Nate Geraci. SOL Price Reaction Solana prices jumped 5.3% in reaction to the news, climbing from an intraday low of $150 to top $158 in a matter of minutes. However, the momentum could not be maintained, and the asset retreated to $153 in the hours that followed. SOL has had a solid week with a 7% gain since the same time last week, as crypto markets and altcoins have shown recovery signs.

Investors continued to weigh the global impact of US tariff policies, with the 90-day reprieve set to expire next week. Gold climbed to around $3,320 per ounce on Tuesday, extending gains from the previous session, underpinned by a weaker US dollar. Japan ( NKY:IND ) fell 1.26% to below 40,100 while the broader Topix Index lost 0.5% to 2,840 on Tuesday, with Japanese shares snapping a five-day winning streak. The Japanese yen appreciated toward 143.5 per US dollar on Tuesday, reaching its highest level in over two weeks, even as renewed trade tensions with the US intensified. The au Jibun Bank Japan Manufacturing PMI was revised lower to 50.1 in June 2025, down from the preliminary estimate of 50.4 but up from May’s 49.4. On the domestic front, Japan’s latest Tankan survey showed a surprise uptick in business sentiment among large manufacturers in the second quarter, highlighting resilience amid growing external pressures. Japan’s consumer confidence index rose to 34.5 in June 2025, up from 32.8 in May and surpassing market forecasts of 33.6. Separately, President Donald Trump threatened fresh tariffs on Japan, criticizing the country’s reluctance to import American rice, and confirmed that the 25% tariff on Japanese auto imports would remain in place due to the persistent trade imbalance. The warning comes ahead of a July 9 deadline for resuming higher tariffs on various trade partners, including Japan. China ( SHCOMP ) rose 0.36% to around 3,448 while the Shenzhen Component lost 0.3% to 10,430 on Tuesday, with mainland stocks lacking clear direction despite a surprise rebound in manufacturing activity, and the offshore yuan held its recent gains to around 7.16 per dollar on Tuesday, hovering near its highest level since early November 2024. The Caixin China General Manufacturing PMI unexpectedly rose to 50.4 in June 2025, up from 48.3 in May—which had marked the steepest contraction since September 2022—and beating market forecasts of 49, supported by Beijing’s efforts to stabilize growth amid higher US tariffs. Hong Kong ( HSI ) market closed India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.05% to 83,777 in early trading on the first day of the new quarter, recovering from losses in the prior session, mainly supported by the tech sector. The HSBC India Manufacturing PMI stood at 58.4 in June 2025, matching flash data and marking the highest print since April 2024. However, traders remained cautious ahead of the July 9 deadline for trade negotiations with the US and potential tariffs by the Trump administration. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.05% to around 8,573 on Tuesday, extending gains from the previous session, despite growing uncertainty over US interest rate policy and a slowdown in Australia’s manufacturing sector. The Australian dollar weakened to around $0.656 on Tuesday, after touching over seven-month highs in the previous session. In Australia, the Manufacturing PMI dropped to 50.6 in June from 51.0 in the previous month—its lowest level since February. In the U.S., on Monday, all three major indexes ended higher as investors aimed to close out a volatile first half of 2025 with fresh record highs. Investors now look ahead to a series of US labor market reports during this holiday-shortened trading week, culminating in Thursday's non-farm payrolls' data, for more clues on the Fed’s policy path. U.S. stock futures held steady on Tuesday following a strong close to both the month and the quarter: Dow -0.07% ; S&P 500 -0.14% ; Nasdaq -0.16% .

This appearance is already drawing significant interest from crypto traders and XRP analysts. His remarks could carry weight beyond traditional markets, especially if they include any suggestion of a shift toward rate cuts. With the broader financial system still navigating high borrowing costs, a change in Powell’s tone could provide immediate relief for risk-on assets, including cryptocurrencies. Powell’s Stance and Trump’s Pressure The crypto community has closely followed Powell’s recent positioning. Despite pressure from President Donald Trump to begin easing rates, Powell has consistently held off on cuts , keeping monetary policy relatively tight. Reports recently circulated that Powell planned to resign . This news excited the crypto space as they expected Trump to appoint someone with a more crypto-friendly stance, like he did for the SEC . That development ultimately did not materialize, and Powell remains at the helm. However, his upcoming speech could still mark a turning point. Why Rate Cuts Matter for the Crypto Market Crypto analyst Steph (@Steph_iscrypto) emphasized the importance of Powell’s next statement, suggesting that if the Fed Chair hints at a rate cut, it could be the catalyst that sends XRP and the broader crypto market significantly higher. According to Steph, “Crypto & XRP will explode” if Powell indicates even a minor policy shift toward easing. BREAKING: FED CHAIR JEROME POWELL WILL SPEAK ON JULY 1 AT 09:30 AM ET. IF HE HINTS AT A RATE CUT, CRYPTO & #XRP WILL EXPLODE! pic.twitter.com/KbLxuyyR1C — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) June 28, 2025 The logic behind that view rests on the relationship between interest rates and investor appetite for alternative assets. When the Federal Reserve cuts rates, the cost of borrowing decreases, which typically boosts liquidity across markets. Investors often respond by moving capital into higher-risk, high-reward sectors, with crypto being a leading candidate. Lower rates also weaken the U.S. dollar’s relative purchasing power, making assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP more attractive as potential stores of value. What to Expect on July 1 XRP, in particular, has proven sensitive to macroeconomic policy cues. Its price activity often mirrors broader sentiment around regulatory clarity and economic conditions. While the token has been trading within a tight range in recent months, a shift in the Federal Reserve’s stance could act as a breakout trigger. The Fed has shown a more pro-crypto stance recently, as it removed reputational risk from its supervisory framework, indirectly encouraging more banks to engage with assets like XRP. If his July 1 speech includes hints at easing, the resulting environment could be particularly bullish for XRP, which already benefits from growing institutional interest and expanding use cases.

The move aims to boost foreign exchange liquidity and ease downward pressure on the won. The Bank of Korea said Monday that banks, securities firms and insurers involved in foreign exchange operations can now freely invest in so-called kimchi bonds. Ban Lifted to Stabilize Won, Boost Liquidity These instruments, issued in South Korea but denominated in currencies like the US dollar, had been restricted since 2011 to curb short-term external liabilities and prevent regulatory loopholes. Now, with South Koreans pouring nearly $42b into overseas stocks and stablecoins in the first quarter of 2025 alone, the government is adjusting course. The resulting strain on dollar reserves and growing FX imbalance have forced officials to rethink earlier controls. “We expect the measure to help alleviate the imbalance in foreign exchange supply and demand by improving foreign currency liquidity and easing downward pressure on the Korean won,” a central bank official said. South Korea Eyes Bond Revival to Boost Homegrown Capital Authorities also hope that the change will revitalize the kimchi bond market and support capital formation domestically. However, privately placed kimchi bonds will remain off-limits to prevent misuse of the system. The easing is one piece of a broader reform push. These reforms aim to stabilize the foreign exchange market and support Seoul’s goal of becoming a regional financial hub. In recent months, authorities have loosened hedging limits, relaxed rules on foreign currency lending, and expanded a dollar swap line with the National Pension Service. The shift reflects deeper changes taking place in the digital finance landscape. Earlier this month, the central bank paused its pilot project for a national digital currency, as stablecoins increasingly take center stage in South Korea’s financial strategy. The delay signals caution, even as President Lee Jae-myung pushes to broaden access to stablecoin issuance. South Korea has paused its CBDC pilot as President Lee pushes to expand stablecoin access, signaling a shift in the country’s digital currency priorities. #SouthKorea #Stablecoins https://t.co/cOMDOr0hFC — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 30, 2025 Together, the revival of kimchi bonds and the rethinking of CBDC plans reflect a recalibrated approach, one aimed at keeping pace with fast-changing market forces while maintaining financial stability.

Key Takeaways: Analysts see a 95% chance of Solana, XRP, and Litecoin ETFs being approved by the SEC this year. A crypto index ETF could gain approval as soon as this week, signaling broader institutional access to altcoins. The first US Solana staking ETF will launch Wednesday, but Ethereum staking ETF approvals remain delayed. In an X post on June 1 , ETF specialists Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart said they see a wave of new crypto ETFs hitting the market in the second half of 2025, lifting previous approval odds from 90% to near certainty for these three altcoins. The analysts also assigned 95% odds to the approval of an ETF tracking a basket of crypto assets, hinting at broader institutional access to altcoins. Crypto Index ETF Approval Could Arrive This Week: Bloomberg While the SEC’s final deadline for decisions on Solana, XRP, and Litecoin ETFs arrives in October, a crypto index ETF could secure approval as soon as this week, the pair noted. Other altcoins could also see ETF products soon, though with slightly lower odds. Balchunas and Seyffart forecast 90% approval chances for Dogecoin, Cardano, Polkadot, Hedera, and Avalanche spot ETFs, with SEC decisions expected by year-end. ETFs proposed by Canary Capital for Sui and Tron faced more uncertainty, with approval odds set at 60% and 50% respectively. Trying to figure out what could go into an SEC framework aside from CFTC approved futures we looked at a few potential data points. The entire note and our midyear outlook can be seen at this link for Bloomberg Terminal clients: https://t.co/7C0bO3oEI3 pic.twitter.com/Y9CcCdNAGF — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 30, 2025 Adding to the momentum, Bloomberg reported Monday that the REX Osprey Solana Staking ETF will officially launch on Wednesday, marking the first US-listed fund to incorporate crypto staking. The ETF cleared regulatory hurdles after issuers agreed to invest at least 40% of assets in other exchange-traded products, mainly based overseas, to address SEC concerns over its investment company status. Despite progress on altcoin ETFs, Ethereum staking remains on hold. On Monday, the SEC delayed its decision on whether Bitwise’s proposed spot Ether ETF could include staking, and similarly postponed a decision on the Osprey Bitcoin Trust’s listing and trading plans. 70 Crypto ETFs Waiting Approval In April, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas revealed that more than 70 cryptocurrency ETFs are currently awaiting review by the SEC. The lineup features a broad range of digital assets beyond Bitcoin, including XRP, Litecoin, Solana, Dogecoin, and various crypto derivatives. According to Balchunas, spot ETF applications for XRP and Solana are among the most popular in the current wave, with 10 institutions applying for XRP-based ETFs and six for Solana. As reported, digital asset investment funds pulled in $2.7 billion last week, capping an 11-week streak of inflows that now totals $16.9 billion. The bulk of the inflows came from the United States, accounting for $2.65 billion. Switzerland and Germany recorded modest additions of $23 million and $19.8 million, respectively, while Canada, Hong Kong, and Brazil posted small outflows. Bitcoin remained the primary magnet for capital, drawing $2.2 billion last week, a commanding 83% of total inflows, while short-Bitcoin products extended their year-to-date outflows to $12 million, signaling broad optimism for Bitcoin’s prospects. Ethereum followed with $429 million in inflows, boosting its yearly total to $2.9 billion, whereas Solana has attracted just $91 million so far this year, highlighting a significant gap in investor confidence.

Recall that FTX commenced the distribution of funds to eligible users on February 18, 2025, starting with small creditors with claims under $50,000. According to Kavuri, FTX paid creditors in this category (those entitled to claims under $50,000) 120% of their initial claim value. This indicates that creditors received a 20% premium on their original claim value. Afterward, FTX commenced the second round of repayments on May 30, 2025, distributing $5 billion to creditors with claims over $50,000. The exchange distributed the funds within three business days of May 30. However, creditors with claims exceeding $50,000 received only 72.5% of their initial claim value. Next Payment Schedule Notably, Kavuri has disclosed the next repayment date for the remaining 27.5% of claims to large creditors. According to him, the upcoming distribution is expected to take place in Q4 2025, specifically from October to December. Additionally, he suggested that the repayment schedule could be extended to 2026 or 2027. This repayment will ensure that creditors with claims exceeding $50,000 receive 100% of their claim. Besides the claim value, these large creditors are also entitled to post-petition interest, which totals 40% to 80%. https://twitter.com/sunil_trades/status/1939692898154369096FTX's Epic Collapse and Repayment EffortsThis ongoing repayment schedule comes more than two years after FTX's collapse in November 2022. The exchange declared bankruptcy, with key executives sentenced to several years in prison. Specifically, a federal court in New York sentenced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) to 25 years in prison due to his role in mismanaging users' funds, leading to the exchange’s downfall. The court subsequently sentenced other executives, including Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison and FTX Digital Markets CEO Ryan Salame, to two and seven-and-a-half-year jail terms, respectively. Since the epic failure of FTX, the exchange has been working to reimburse users, with repayments commencing earlier this year. Despite FTX’s efforts, many have criticized the disbursement process for valuing users’ claims at token prices as of the time of the bankruptcy filing in late 2022. It is worth noting that crypto prices have soared significantly ever since. For instance, Bitcoin, which traded around $20,000 in late 2022, has rallied more than 400% to over $100,000.",Market|Latest Crypto Exchanges News|Latest FTX News Market Updates,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|BTC|BUSINESS|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-07-01 07:08:45

He added that owning crypto is no longer a speculative position, but “failing to do so is.” The founder of the $300 billion investment advisory firm, Edelman Financial Engines, made the dramatic recommendation suggesting that aggressive investors should hold up to 40% of their assets in crypto, 25% for moderate, while conservative investors should allocate 10%. You need to plan on living past 100, and that means you need more than stocks and bonds. My new white paper explains why you’ll get to 100+ and why your portfolio should include 10% to 40% crypto.

Institutions Driving Markets Edelman’s recommendation comes as institutional adoption accelerates, with over $20 billion invested in spot Bitcoin ETFs by wealthy investors and institutions, and more than 70 crypto ETF proposals pending with the SEC. The finance guru also cited the Trump administration’s regulatory reversal, the growth of stablecoins, and basic supply-demand dynamics supporting his bullish outlook, even suggesting Bitcoin could reach $500,000. Institutional investors and corporations have been scooping up all of the Bitcoin that long-term holders have been selling, which is why prices have stagnated recently. However, “Bitcoin’s price appreciation isn’t speculation — it’s just supply and demand,” concluded Edelman.

The prominent financial advisor shared the take in a recent whitepaper for the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals ( DACFP). According to Edelman , who is also DACFP’s founder, the traditional investment model of 60/40 allocation to stock and bond is no longer useful. He attributed this to the massive technological advancements that have led to high longevity rates. Instead, he recommended that investors put their money in crypto while outlining the percentage to allocate based on their risk profiles. In Edelman’s opinion, aggressive investors should have 40% of their crypto investments, while conservative ones should have 10%. He said: “Conservative investors should now have a 10% crypto allocation. Moderate clients should place 25% of their portfolios in crypto, and aggressive clients should allocate 40% of their investments to crypto.” Interestingly, the veteran investor with 39 years of experience in the financial sector noted that investing in crypto is no longer a speculative trade. According to him, a passive market-weighted index of all asset classes would have 3% allocated to crypto, showing just how big the sector has become. Thus, anyone choosing to ignore the crypto sector is simply shorting it. Edelman bullish on crypto, says Bitcoin could reach $500,000 Meanwhile, Edelman made a bullish case for investors to allocate up to 40% of their portfolio to crypto. According to him, there is no reason anyone would choose to ignore an asset class that has outperformed the rest of the market for 15 consecutive years. In backing up his claim, he highlighted high-performing crypto assets and sectors, including the stablecoin sector. He noted that Tether’s massive $13 billion profits last year exceeded what several major US companies, including McDonald’s, BlackRock, IBM, and Ford, pulled in. Edelman’s summary of why everyone should invest in crypto (Source: DACFP) Beyond that, Edelman believes President Donald Trump’s win in 2024 has also set the stage for crypto’s good fortunes. According to him, the pro-crypto moves from the Trump administration and policy reversal from individuals and institutions are all signs that crypto is now a derisked investment. Unsurprisingly, the prominent financial advisor is particularly bullish on Bitcoin and has predicted it could be worth $500,000, noting that this is based on demand and supply. He noted that institutions’ massive accumulation of assets will continue to drive up their prices. He said: “There’s $750 trillion in global assets (stocks, bonds, real estate, gold, cash and collectibles). A mere 1% allocation would cause $7.5 trillion to flow into Bitcoin. That’s $377,000 per bitcoin. Add that to Bitcoin’s current price, and you get to about $500,000 per Bitcoin. It’s simple arithmetic.” Interestingly, Edelman highlighted how investors can get crypto exposure, from direct acquisition to equity proxies. His whitepaper also advises financial advisors to allocate part of their portfolio to crypto by including responses to clients’ common objections and criticizing advisors who do not recommend crypto to their customers. Reactions trail Edelman’s endorsement of crypto allocation Meanwhile, the whitepaper from Edelman has sparked a mixed but mostly positive reaction from experts. Bloomberg senior analyst Eric Balchunas described it as the biggest endorsement of crypto from TradFi since BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. According to him, this is because of Edelman’s status in the financial advisory community, where he is one of the most influential voices. He said: “This guy is Mr RIA. Manages $300b for 1.3 million clients. Tops the Barron’s list of America Advisors regularly.” Meanwhile, some in the crypto community believe that Edelman should have specified BTC as the asset to invest in rather than simply saying crypto. Balchunas noted that this should not be a cause for debate, as almost all investors, including Edelman, acknowledge that Bitcoin is the primary investment asset in the crypto sector. Interestingly, Bitwise European head of research André Dragosh does not agree that technological advancements killed the 60/40 model. Instead, he attributes it to rising inflation, noting that stocks and bonds underperform once inflation rises above 5%. However, he also recommended diversifying into hard assets such as Gold and Bitcoin.

At this point, while spot altcoin ETFs are expected to be approved in 2025, the first approval came for Solana (SOL). Accordingly, the CEO of Rex Shares, one of the issuer companies that applied for the spot Solana ETF, said that the REX-OSPREY Solana ETF will start trading in the US on Wednesday. While the latest development pushed the SOL price upwards, expectations for other altcoin ETFs in the market also increased. Litecoin (LTC) and XRP Are Next After Solana! At this point, analysts estimate that there is a 95% probability of LTC and XRP spot ETFs being approved in 2025. Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett shared on her X account the approval predictions of Bloomberg senior ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas for altcoin ETFs. Eleanor Terrett also noted that Balchunas and Seyffart had been correct in most of their predictions so far. According to Balchunas and Seyffart, the altcoins most likely to receive approval from the SEC after Solana are Litecoin and XRP. Accordingly, analysts estimate that there is a 95 percent chance that LTC and XRP will receive ETF approval in 2025. Seyffart wrote: “Here are mine and Eric Balchunas' latest predictions for spot crypto ETF approvals by the end of 2025.

The DOGE price today sits just beneath key resistance zones, with both structural compression and liquidity imbalances suggesting a potentially explosive setup in July. Dogecoin Price Prediction for July 2025 DOGE price prediction (Source: TradingView) The monthly structure on Dogecoin reflects a prolonged downtrend capped by repeated lower highs, with the price currently coiling just below a descending trendline. After a failed breakout attempt in early June near $0.215, DOGE retraced sharply and found support just above $0.150, a key demand zone reinforced by prior consolidation. This tightening price action inside a falling wedge is now aligned with a low-volume node between $0.165 and $0.175. If bulls reclaim this level early in July, the next upside target lies between $0.192 and $0.205. However, if DOGE breaks below $0.155 again, the price may revisit the broader demand zone between $0.138 and $0.127. From a higher timeframe perspective, the key market structure still favors sellers until a clean breakout above $0.200 is confirmed. … The post Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Prediction for July 2025 appeared first on Coin Edition .",Market|News|Price Analysis|Price Prediction|Dogecoin (DOGE),EN,0,0,DOGE|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coin Edition', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/7/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinquora,2025-07-01 07:20:24

That has helped to support the price of DOGE to its current level. However, even with a huge community, DOGE has never reached $1. One of the main reasons for this is that DOGE is inflationary, which means millions of new DOGE coins are minted daily. Another downside for DOGE is that it is a meme coin in its purest form, with no utility. Amid this disappointment, the crypto community has been turning to a new contender, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The project has a fixed supply and is currently in the presale phase. According to analysts, MUTM tokens could reach $1 faster than DOGE. Let us look at why analysts and investors are so confident about the future of DOGE. MUTM Could Rise To $1 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in the presale phase, where tokens are going for $0.03. The presale is currently in phase 5, where it has raised over $11.3 million from around 12,550 unique buyers. The current price of $0.03 is a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. In the next phase, the token price will rise by 16.67% to $0.035. Based on the planned listing price of $0.06, the current price is a 50% discount. That presents a unique opportunity for massive gains when the tokens go live. According to the most recent forecasts, the price of MUTM tokens could rise to $1, which would represent an increase of over 3200% based on the current price. There are many reasons why this could happen. One of them is the planned beta version launch of the platform on day one of the token listing. The beta version launch will drive up user interest in the platform, which will generate massive organic traffic on social media. As the word spreads, more people will check out the beta platform and rush to get their MUTM tokens. Another reason why MUTM tokens could rise to $1 is that the project is utility-based. This use case will keep attracting new users to the platform, raising revenue generation. The revenue will be used to purchase MUTM tokens off the open market, which will support the price growth. Additionally, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is CertiK audited. Utility coupled with the CertiK audit, where it has a Token Scan Score of 95, will play a major role in driving buyers towards MUTM tokens. All the factors combined will help to support the upward price growth of MUTM tokens in the long term. CertiK Partnership Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has recently entered a partnership with CertiK for the long-term security of the ecosystem. The partnership will be on a $50,000 USDT bug bounty program, which is an open invitation to the global security community to work with Mutuum Finance. The program is split into four tiers, which are critical, major, minor, and low. Depending on the level of vulnerability that a security expert helps to find, they will be compensated appropriately. Built On The Premise Of Utility Mutuum Finance (MUTM) allows users to participate as lenders or borrowers. The lenders deposit their assets into the protocol to earn interest, while borrowers deposit collateral to access the liquidity in the pools. To ensure the overall protection of liquidity in Mutuum Finance (MUTM), all loans must be overcollateralized. That means borrowers must deposit collateral that is worth more than the value of the assets they intend to access. All interest rates in the protocol are based on a pool’s utilization rate. As the utilization rate grows, the interest rate rises, which pushes borrowers to repay their loans. At the same time, it attracts new people into the protocol, seeking out higher yields. The result is that the ecosystem ensures optimal capital utilization. Price Discovery On The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Protocol Pricing on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is determined independently using Chainlink price feeds. These are a system of smart contracts, widely used in the DeFi sector to provide reliable and secure price data. That will ensure that users have access to verifiable pricing information. Besides the Chainlink price oracles, the protocol will implement a backup data source. Additionally, they will utilize time-weighted price averages when there is sufficient on-chain volume as a reference point. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Will Beat DOGE Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed to dominate the DeFi industry through innovation and a commitment to security. Its design will attract a massive user base, which will drive up demand for MUTM tokens. According to analysts, the price of MUTM tokens could rise over 32x when they go live. Coupled with the 50% discount on the tokens in the ongoing presale, this makes MUTM tokens a better buy than DOGE. If you are looking for sustainable growth in 2025 and beyond, make sure you have MUTM tokens in your portfolio.

If approved by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Circle’s “First National Digital Currency Bank” will operate as a federally regulated trust institution, the company announced on Monday. This move is part of Circle’s efforts to strengthen the infrastructure supporting the issuance and circulation of USDC, while also expanding its custodial services for institutional clients. National Trust Banks are not permitted to accept cash deposits or issue loans but can provide custody services and operate nationwide under OCC oversight, eliminating the need for state-based money transmitter licenses, according to law firm Davis Wright Tremaine. Circle Aligning with the Regulatory Clarity Circle’s pursuit of a federally regulated trust charter is also aimed at ensuring compliance with the proposed GENIUS Act, which passed the US Senate on June 17 and now awaits a House vote. This legislation, if enacted, would set standards for the issuance and management of dollar-backed payment stablecoins within the US. Jeremy Allaire, Circle’s co-founder and CEO, emphasized that the company is taking “proactive steps to further strengthen our USDC infrastructure” while aligning operations with the “emerging US regulation for the issuance and operation of dollar-denominated payment stablecoins.” National Trust Bank applications undergo a 30-day public comment period, with the OCC typically providing a decision within 120 days after receiving a complete application. Crypto Firms Show Growing Interest in Bank Charters Circle is not alone in seeking a national trust bank license under the OCC’s supervision. Eleanor Terrett, host of the “Crypto in America” podcast, highlighted that multiple crypto firms, including Fidelity’s digital currency division, are pursuing similar bank charter licenses. The company has reportedly been exploring this pathway since at least 2022, according to The Wall Street Journal, joining other crypto players like Anchorage Trust Company, which became Anchorage Digital Bank after receiving OCC approval in January 2021. Meanwhile, Circle Internet Group (CRCL) shares remained stable in the last trading session, with a slight increase of 0.48% to $181, as per Google Finance data. However, after-hours trading saw the stock dip by 1.30% to $178. The company’s stock made a notable entry on June 5, surging 167% during its debut session on the New York Stock Exchange, reflecting investor confidence as the company advances toward deeper regulatory alignment in the stablecoin market.

A wave of institutional optimism and renewed ETF speculation has sparked conversations around whether the long-anticipated $5 target is finally within reach. But while XRP prepares for a possible breakout, another name is rapidly climbing investor watchlists — MAGACOIN FINANCE. In what many are calling a shift in strategy, investors are increasingly positioning ahead of the next wave by combining exposure to legacy assets like XRP with early-stage tokens that show breakout potential. At the center of this trend is MAGACOIN FINANCE, a project that analysts say carries both narrative momentum and structural upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE Emerges as a Breakout Contender for 2026 While XRP captures headlines for its comeback potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly becoming a focal point for forward-looking investors. The token is structured with high-conviction appeal — leveraging scarcity-based mechanics, early-stage positioning, and mounting interest from analysts across major research hubs. Previous entry rounds have sold out instantly, and new participation continues to accelerate as early signs of breakout behavior emerge. Wallet activity, investor positioning, and research-driven sentiment all point to MAGACOIN FINANCE entering a pivotal phase of its growth trajectory. Rather than rely on trends or comparisons, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving out a distinct identity, backed by a setup that many are calling one of the most asymmetric opportunities of the year. The listing price has already been confirmed, and strategic accumulation is on the rise as institutional and retail investors begin locking in positions. XRP Gains Traction Amid ETF Rumors and Institutional Momentum XRP’s road over the past few years has been shaped by ongoing regulatory clarity and expanding use cases in cross-border payments. With the SEC dispute largely behind it and enterprise adoption on the rise, the asset is regaining attention from analysts and institutions alike. The possibility of a spot XRP ETF is adding fuel to the bullish case. Industry experts note that an ETF approval could dramatically shift capital inflows, boosting both volume and market positioning. This narrative has led analysts to revisit high-range targets, including the long-held projection of a move toward $5 — a milestone that once felt distant but is now back in the realm of possibility. Institutional interest, particularly from payment firms and tokenization platforms, continues to grow. These developments suggest that XRP’s accumulation phase may be evolving into a setup for long-term upside. Analysts See Multi-Layered Growth Potential Across Both Assets Analysts covering both XRP and MAGACOIN FINANCE highlight a key difference in investor psychology: XRP is now viewed as a large-cap with renewed upside following regulatory progress, while MAGACOIN FINANCE is seen as a high-upside asset still early in its market journey. The rotation into early-stage projects while maintaining exposure to larger market anchors is not new, but the current cycle appears to be rewarding those who move with conviction before wider awareness sets in. In this sense, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being tracked not as a speculative bet, but as a strategic position ahead of a potential surge. Final Thoughts: Positioning Ahead of the Next Cycle As the market gears up for what could be a watershed year in crypto, investors are busy positioning their portfolios around narrative, structure and timing. XRP is likely to undergo a strong upside potential in 2026 if an ETF happens. However, assets may grow quicker if they remain near areas of awareness where Easter-smart capital flows early. MAGACOIN FINANCE is now at the center of that conversation. Its confirmed structure parameters and analyst momentum continue to attract high-conviction interest. For those in tune with where the market is headed next, this is already clear.

This figure pushed the total to $16.9 billion. Interestingly, the mid-year momentum is similar to 2024, when inflows reached $18.3 billion by June’s end. CoinShares noted that continued investor interest is likely tied to a mix of increased geopolitical tensions and the current “uncertainty” around monetary policy, both of which are driving demand for digital assets. Bitcoin Dominates Digital Asset Inflows According to the latest edition of the ‘Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report ,’ Bitcoin captured 83% of total inflows in digital asset investment products last week, as it pulled in $2.2 billion amidst strong investor optimism. Short-Bitcoin products continued to see outflows, with $2.9 million exiting last week, which pushed year-to-date outflows to $12 million. This essentially indicated a positive sentiment around Bitcoin. Ethereum followed suit with $429 million in weekly inflows, as it catapulted its year-to-date total to $2.9 billion, owing to the ongoing bullish investor interest. XRP also secured $10.6 million last week, bringing its yearly inflows to $219 million. While Solana recorded $5.3 million in weekly inflows, its year-to-date tally remains at $91 million. Next up was Sui, which attracted $1.4 million in inflows last week, reaching $4.7 million so far this year. Chainlink and Cardano saw weekly minor inflows of $0.8 million and $0.7 million, respectively, which pushed their year-to-date totals to $24 million and $10 million. Multi-asset products added a modest $0.2 million last week, totaling $58 million in inflows for the year, while Litecoin’s YTD inflows stand at $5 million. Inflows last week were largely driven by the US, which recorded $2.65 billion, while Switzerland and Germany saw smaller inflows of $23 million and $19.8 million. Australia added $8.7 million. In contrast, Sweden saw outflows of $15.9 million, while Canada, Brazil, and Hong Kong recorded outflows of $13.6 million, $2.4 million, and $2.3 million, respectively. Following price rallies, Hong Kong has continued to experience outflows, which reached $132 million for June. Bitcoin Defies June Lull Bitcoin defied its usual June weakness with a last-minute rally, as it caught up to equities after Trump’s $4.5 trillion tax bill advanced in the Senate. According to QCP Capital’s note , the focus has now shifted to today’s vote, aiming for a July 4 deadline. On the institutional side of things, demand remains strong, with spot BTC ETFs seeing $2.2 billion in inflows. Strategy and Metaplanet continued steady accumulation, while leveraged longs increased as the leading crypto approached $108K. Ethereum and Solana rallied on optimism over potential ETH and SOL staking ETFs. However, options markets remain muted, risk reversals also appear to be flat, and implied volatility is near historical lows despite the bullish spot price action.

Today, two parallel events are converging on a single theme: the integration of traditional finance with blockchain technology. As tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) move from concept to implementation, and crypto-native ETFs edge closer to mainstream adoption, thought leaders, builders, regulators, and institutional players are gathering to explore what’s next. From tokenized treasuries to on-chain infrastructure and the evolution of compliant DeFi, today’s conversations promise to shape the future of both markets and protocols. We’ll be live-blogging the biggest insights, key announcements, and panel highlights — including deep dives into the ETF landscape, regulatory frameworks, and the growing impact of RWAs on global finance.

Analysts See Momentum Waning After 3-Month Surge,https://cryptonews.com/news/is-the-bitcoin-uptrend-over-analysts-see-momentum-waning-after-3-month-surge/,"The Bitcoin rally, which has lifted prices more than 40% since early April, may be running out of steam as analysts flag weakening momentum and rising profit-taking. Key Takeaways: Bitcoin’s rally momentum is fading as traders who bought below $80,000 take profits. Analysts say Bitcoin’s next move will depend on macro factors like Fed rate decisions. Despite short-term uncertainty, key support levels remain strong, and some experts see potential for a breakout. Bitfinex market strategists said Monday that for the first time during the recent uptrend, “momentum has begun to fade,” citing cooling spot volumes and a slowdown in taker buy pressure. The price of Bitcoin rose from $73,273 on April 9 to $107,380 at publication, but signs now point to possible consolidation or a local top rather than continued explosive gains. Profit-Taking Heats Up as Sub-$80K Bitcoin Buyers Cash Out Traders taking profits, particularly those who bought under $80,000, have intensified selling pressure, according to the analysts. They noted that Bitcoin’s next significant move hinges on macroeconomic drivers and institutional appetite, especially inflows into US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs. These ETFs have attracted net inflows of $4.63 billion over 14 straight trading sessions since June 9, with economist Timothy Peterson calling last week’s $2.2 billion in inflows “massive” and projecting a 70% chance of continued positive flows this week. Bitcoin consolidates between $100K–$110K, with dip buyers defending $98.7K and leverage low. History suggests what’s coming next: Q3 is typically BTC’s weakest quarter, with low volatility and slower moving markets. Will this time be different? https://t.co/pmYnTBWkcY pic.twitter.com/XDaqlp6zci — Bitfinex (@bitfinex) June 30, 2025 Attention is also turning to the Federal Reserve’s July 30 meeting, where markets currently assign a 19% chance of an interest rate cut, based on CME FedWatch data. Lower rates tend to be bullish for risk assets like Bitcoin, adding further weight to the Fed’s decision for short-term price direction. Despite near-term caution, analysts stressed that Bitcoin’s higher time frame structure remains intact, with key support levels holding firm. Meanwhile, some remain optimistic. For one, economist Donald Dean suggested Bitcoin is primed for a breakout following tight consolidation near recent highs. $BTCUSD $BTC Bitcoin – Getting Ready to Move Price Target: $130,981 Bitcoin is getting ready to move higher with tight consolidation at the volume shelf. Also, Cup and Handle. Next target is at the Golden Ratio $130k. pic.twitter.com/XrEA4eeH5b — Donald Dean (@donaldjdean) June 30, 2025 Likewise, Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards argued that selling by long-term holders has been a key factor suppressing prices, even as institutional interest surged after the launch of spot ETFs earlier this year. Bitcoin Adoption as Treasury Asset Finds Momentum As reported, over the past week, at least nine UK firms, from web design startups to mining businesses, have announced plans to buy Bitcoin or revealed recent purchases to add the cryptocurrency to their corporate treasuries. Among the UK firms, AI services provider Tao Alpha disclosed plans to raise £100 million after revealing a bitcoin treasury plan that triggered investor interest. Smarter Web Company, a small website design firm, saw its market value rocket from £4 million to over £1 billion in just two months after announcing its Bitcoin purchases in April, although shares have since cooled. In the US, Anthony Pompliano’s ProCap BTC acquired 3,724 Bitcoin for $386 million as part of plans to go public through an SPAC merger, while Japan’s Metaplanet raised $517.8 million on the first day of its ambitious “555 Million Plan,” which targets 210,000 Bitcoin by 2027.

The DoJ issued two indictments, an arrest, searches of 29 laptop farms across 16 states, and seizure of 29 bank accounts used to launder illicit funds. The agency said those schemes are part of efforts by the North Korean regime to generate revenue and be part of its cyberespionage activities. The probe follows separate cases in Georgia and Massachusetts that the Justice Department believes pose a threat because, in some cases, workers access sensitive and proprietary data from the American firms that hire them. FBI combats North Korea’s abuse of the U.S. IT industry Today, the FBI and @TheJusticeDept announced nationwide actions to disrupt North Korean schemes to defraud American companies through remote IT work, which included the arrest of a U.S. national who allegedly hosted a laptop farm for North Korean actors https://t.co/3IC28oaMFa pic.twitter.com/rsx0EPO0nu — FBI (@FBI) June 30, 2025 The agency seized 21 fraudulent websites belonging to shell companies created to dupe employers into believing that the workers they were hiring were associated with U.S. businesses. The FBI and Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) also seized about 200 computers and 17 web domains used to advance the scheme. Court documents alleged the workers, armed with stolen or fake identities, were dispatched by the North Korean government to find work as remote IT employees at American organizations, including Fortune 500 corporations. The firms were duped into believing that the hired workers were based in the U.S., when many were stationed in North Korea or China. The U.S. Treasury Department also issued an advisory about the tactic in 2022. “North Korean IT workers defraud American companies and steal the identities of private citizens, all in support of the North Korean regime. That is why the FBI and our partners continue to work together to disrupt infrastructure, seize revenue, indict overseas IT workers, and arrest their enablers in the United States.” – Brett Leatherman , Assistant Director of the FBI’s Cyber Division. Investigations found that the wages from the workers are directed to the North Korea weapons programs in violation of U.S. and United Nations sanctions. Some workers also accessed and stole confidential information from their employers, including export-controlled U.S. military technology and virtual currency. In one incident, the DOJ discovered that the workers used false identities to gain employment with an Atlanta, Georgia-based blockchain research and development company and stole digital assets worth roughly $900,000. The agency and FBI officials said that at least one of the organizations that had unknowingly contracted the illicit workers was a government contractor, but they said that anyone in the U.S. posting jobs for remote workers is at risk. DOJ indicts individuals involved in the fraud schemes The Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts and the National Security Division announced the arrest of U.S. national Zhenxing “Danny” Wang of New Jersey on five counts. Wang was charged with conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud, money laundering conspiracy, conspiracy to commit identity theft, and conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The second indictment was a three-count indictment against New Jersey resident Kehia “Tony” Wang for conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud, money laundering conspiracy, and conspiracy to commit identity theft. Court documents disclosed that the indictments include a multi-year fraud scheme by Wang and his co-conspirators to obtain remote IT work with U.S. companies that generated more than $5 million in revenue. The court also charged six Chinese nationals, including Jing Bin Huang, Baoyu Zhou, Tong Yuze, Yongzhe Xu, Ziyou Yuan, and Zhenbang Zhou. Two Taiwanese nationals, Mengting Liu and Enchia Liu, were also indicted for their roles in the scheme. The DOJ revealed that Kejia Wang, Zhenxing Wang, and four other U.S. facilitators had received at least $690,000 in total from the IT workers. The report also cited a third five-count money laundering and wire fraud indictment from the Northern District of Georgia that charged four North Korean nationals with the theft and subsequent laundering of digital assets from two companies, one in Georgia and one in Serbia. The State Department is offering rewards of up to $5 million for information leading to the disruption of financial mechanisms of individuals engaged in certain activities that support North Korea.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Pepeto fuses meme culture with real-world crypto tools, making it a serious rival to Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and PEPE this year. Table of Contents Pepeto sets a new standard for memecoins Dogecoin: The original facing new rivals Shiba Inu: Still evolving in a crowded market PEPE: Pure meme power, but what’s next? Why Pepeto could be 2025’s best bet About Pepeto In 2025, memecoins are still evolving, driven by internet culture, community loyalty, and rapid speculation. While older projects defend their territory, a new contender is making waves. Pepeto, a fresh face in the memecoin arena, is capturing attention thanks to its blend of humor and real-world usefulness. Unlike most of its predecessors, Pepeto isn’t just riding hype. It’s built to provide practical solutions for traders while embracing the playful spirit that made memecoins famous in the first place. Pepeto sets a new standard for memecoins Pepeto isn’t here for quick fame. It was created to go beyond fleeting trends and deliver substance. Its mission is clear: combine meme energy with decentralized finance tools that matter. At the core is a zero-fee swap platform designed to make memecoin trading faster and more affordable. Alongside this, the project plans to roll out a dedicated memecoin exchange and cross-chain bridge system so tokens can move freely between networks. Together, these features tackle real problems like high transaction costs, delays, and limited liquidity. The team also promises transparency and a focus on community, prioritizing lasting impact over speculation. So far, Pepeto has raised over $5.5 million in presale funding. The token is still affordably priced at $0.000000137, giving early investors a chance to secure positions before listings on major exchanges. Dogecoin: The original facing new rivals Dogecoin ( DOGE ) remains the pioneer of memecoins. Launched in 2013 as a lighthearted take on Bitcoin, it grew into a real digital asset. It saw peak popularity when Elon Musk declared it “the people’s crypto,” fueling a global buying frenzy. Dogecoin is accepted by some merchants and easily traded, but its development has mostly stagnated. It lacks advanced features like smart contracts or DeFi support. Though it still has a dedicated fanbase, newer tokens offering more utility could chip away at Dogecoin’s dominance. Shiba Inu: Still evolving in a crowded market Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) made headlines in 2020 as the self-proclaimed “Doge killer.” But it quickly evolved beyond memes, launching ShibaSwap, NFTs, and its own Layer 2 solution, Shibarium. With supporting tokens like Bone and Leash, Shiba Inu has established a broad ecosystem appealing to DeFi users and meme fans alike. In 2025, SHIB stays relevant thanks to steady updates and big exchange support. Still, as fresh projects like Pepeto mix meme culture with practical tools, Shiba Inu faces new challenges to hold its share of attention. PEPE: Pure meme power, but what’s next? PEPE came roaring into the scene as a tribute to the famous Pepe the Frog meme. Unlike SHIB and Pepeto, it prided itself on zero utility, just meme energy. That approach paid off early, driving its market cap over $1.6 billion in 2023. Yet without a roadmap or tools to keep investors engaged, PEPE may have trouble maintaining momentum. It’s a cultural icon, but serious investors might look elsewhere for projects with staying power. Why Pepeto could be 2025’s best bet Pepeto is building a space where fun meets real functionality. With no-fee trading, cross-chain swaps, and a community-driven exchange, it offers something few memecoins have: real utility. For investors who want both culture and substance, Pepeto is quickly becoming a standout choice. Low entry prices and strong presale interest make this an early opportunity worth watching before broader adoption kicks in. About Pepeto Pepeto is a next-generation cryptocurrency blending memecoin excitement with real-world applications. Its ecosystem includes a zero-fee exchange, a cross-chain bridge for seamless token swaps, and staking rewards designed to support long-term growth.

In a June 30 X post, Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas shared updated approval forecasts for several altcoin ETF proposals under SEC review. The revised figures come as filings gain momentum and engagement between issuers and the regulatory watchdog picks up, boosting chances of approvals in the second half of the year. Still top of the list are Solana ( SOL ), Litecoin ( LTC ), and XRP ( XRP ), now each given a 95% chance of approval, up from 90% for SOL and LTC, and 85% for XRP in the previous update . Dogecoin ( DOGE ) also saw its odds jump from 80% to 95%, as positive signals continue between issuers like Bitwise and the SEC. https://twitter.com/jseyff/status/1939795594148540610?s=12 Cardano ( ADA ), Polkadot ( DOT ), Avalanche ( AVAX ), and Hedera ( HBAR ) are now all at 90%, up from earlier estimates around 75% to 80%. The boost adds fresh momentum for the tokens, despite recent delays from the regulatory commission clouding the approval timeline. You might also like: XRP, SOL ETFs face SEC delay, but approval hopes remain SUI’s ( SUI ) odds remain unchanged at 60%, weighed down by uncertainty around its regulatory classification and the absence of CFTC-regulated futures. Tron ( TRX ) shot up to 50% from its previous “not applicable,” though its review isn’t expected until 2026. Meanwhile, a new entrant has joined the list. PENGU ( PENGU ) made its debut with a 50% approval estimate, following a June 26 filing by the CBOE to list and trade a fund tied to the token. The proposal seeks the SEC’s approval for a Canary PENGU ETF, which would hold both the PENGU token and Pudgy Penguins NFTs, potentially marking the first ETF proposal to combine a memecoin and NFT collection. PENGU’s listing aligns with analyst expectations that a memecoin-focused ETF era could emerge in 2026. The SEC has acknowledged most of the altcoin-based ETF filings, with final decisions expected through late 2025. Many of the top contenders are viewed as commodities, have CFTC-regulated futures and strong backing from major issuers, factors that have typically boosted approval odds in the past.

47162843,https://crypto.news/?p=14393203,1751355851,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/47162843.jpeg,Will Solana price rally after the launch of its first spot ETF?,https://crypto.news/will-solana-price-rally-after-the-launch-of-its-first-spot-etf/,"Solana experienced a short-lived rally following confirmation that the first-ever Solana ETF featuring staking capabilities is scheduled to launch on July 2, 2025. According to data from crypto.news, Solana ( SOL ) surged nearly 6% to an intraday high of $158.30 on Monday before paring gains and settling around $152.60 at press time. Despite the retracement, the token remains approximately 44% above its year-to-date low, with a current market capitalization exceeding $81.6 billion. SOL’s rally was driven by renewed investor hype surrounding the upcoming exchange-traded fund launch set to go live tomorrow. The product, branded as the REX-Osprey SOL + Staking ETF , will be the first in the U.S. to offer on-chain staking rewards alongside spot price exposure. It marks a notable departure from previous crypto ETFs that have largely excluded staking features due to regulatory and structural constraints. However, the early excitement faded quickly as investors began to temper their expectations about how successful the new Solana ETF might be. A key reason for this skepticism is the relatively small size of Grayscale’s Solana Trust (GSOL), which has been around for over 43 months but only manages about $75 million in assets, a stark contrast to Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) which had amassed $10 billion in assets just a month before the spot Ethereum ETF launched in July 2024. You might also like: Pump.fun 2.0 and Moonshot Create square off in UX-driven Solana meme arms race Traders seem increasingly uncertain, as derivatives data also points to weakening momentum for the sixth-largest crypto asset by market cap. Solana’s perpetual futures market on Hyperliquid reveals a cautious stance among traders. While long positions slightly outweigh shorts in volume, the profit lies with the bears; that is, shorts are currently up by over $6.71 million, while longs are collectively down more than $707,000. Source: Nansen This disparity suggests that many longs bought in during the ETF hype and are now underwater, reinforcing a cautious near-term outlook. Further, the market cap of stablecoins on the Solana network has fallen from $13 billion in April to around $10.5 billion as of press time, indicating a notable decline in on-chain liquidity and reduced demand for transactional activity within the ecosystem. On top of that, despite the recent hype surrounding Solana memecoins, the network’s revenue has declined by over 90% since January. All these factors could likely continue to weigh on Solana’s performance despite the ETF news. Solana price analysis On the 1-day/USDT chart, Solana (SOL) is pulling back toward the descending trendline it broke earlier, the same level that sparked today’s rally. If it falls back below this line, it could signal a trend reversal and bring back bearish momentum. SOL price, 50-day SMA and RSI chart — July 1 | Source: crypto.news Price action has also slipped below the 50-day simple moving average, a commonly observed dynamic support level. This breakdown signals fading short-term strength and adds to the bearish technical outlook. The Relative Strength Index, which initially rose to 55 after the ETF news broke, has fallen back to 51 at the time of writing, indicating that the initial buying pressure has faded. Given these technical signals, SOL appears poised to retest support at $143.10, which aligns with the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level. A decisive break below this level could open the path toward deeper downside, with the next key support resting at $126.48, its local low from last month. A bearish overhang for SOL investors is that over $585 million worth of SOL will be unstaked in the next two months, which could potentially increase selling pressure and weigh further on price performance. Still, in a market where perception often outweighs fundamentals, strong day-one flows into REX-Osprey SOL + Staking ETF could override technical weakness and drive renewed accumulation.

The network involved teams in Spain, France, Estonia, as well as the USA. Europol cracked down on a network spreading crypto-related investment fraud. The scammers operated in Spain, France, Estonia, as well as the USA. Law enforcement arranged a series of arrests at the end of June. ‘ To carry out their fraudulent activities, the leaders of the criminal network allegedly used a net of associates spread around the world to raise funds through cash withdrawals, bank transfers, and crypto-transfers, ’ Europol said in a statement . The Spanish Guardia Civil acted with aid from Europol and law enforcement authorities from Estonia, France, and the USA, to arrest five members of a criminal network linked to investment fraud. The law enforcement performed three searches and arrests on the Canary Islands, and two in Madrid. Europol cracks down on aggressive crypto marketing The recent round of scams was not the usual crypto-native operation. Instead, a network of representatives used phone, email and direct persuasion to sell seemingly lucrative crypto investments. Based on Europol reports, the network had laundered EUR 460M (around $540M) from illicit profits, defrauding over 5,000 victims from the entire world. The network has been under investigation since 2023, as Europol’s financial crime experts assisted Spanish authorities. On the day of the arrests, a crypto specialist was deployed to Spain to assist national investigators. For now, Europol has not provided on-chain data for the type of fraud. The criminal network may have used banking in Hong Kong as well, using payment gateways and user accounts in different names, as well as crypto exchanges to transfer and launder funds. Europe becomes the target for confidence scams While the EU has been relatively favorable for crypto users, scams rely on outsiders who are naive about risks. The current fraud ring is part of the trend for using AI to facilitate the scams. Some of the investment solicitations included personal fraud and gaining the confidence of victims. Similar scams have robbed investors of up to $5.5B on a global scale. Solicitations included deepfakes and advertising promising outsized crypto returns. Spanish authorities are involved in this type of operations for the second time, after breaking up a crime ring in April. The fraud also involved fake platforms that even showed returns and increasing balances. The victims were unable to withdraw their funds, however, or were asked for additional deposits to release the balance. European authorities have warned against trusting the promises for outsized returns, especially if there is a promise of guaranteed earnings. Crypto and stablecoins have been used in some fraud cases, although victims were also solicited to send money via bank accounts, or even through cash withdrawals. European investors have been targeted with investment solicitations even without mentioning cryptocurrencies. Previously, Europol cracked down on fake investments involving renewable energy. The fraud rings use sophisticated research to target their victims with offers. Users have also been persuaded to transfer large sums of money, with solicitations of lucrative renewable energy contracts, entirely unrelated to crypto assets. Most of the rings were discovered after individual complaints and significant personal losses.

On-chain analysis reveals significant PEPE whale activity, notably from the market-maker Cumberland, transferring approximately 386 billion PEPE (≈$3.45 million) off exchanges between June 24–25. This strategic accumulation contrasts sharply with smaller retail holders selling at losses, highlighting the tense dynamics shaping current market trends. Meanwhile, Dogecoin (DOGE), the stalwart of meme coin s, remains relatively stable at around $0.16–$0.17, despite recent downward pressures amounting to nearly a 10% monthly decline. However, technical analysts are spotting bullish signals—whale accumulation, positive funding rates, and emerging bullish flags—which suggest DOGE may soon experience a substantial price rebound. Adding excitement, Psy’s CEO recently introduced a pilot DOGE–Solana bridge, potentially revitalizing network utility and investor enthusiasm. Influencer Ben Armstrong (BitBoy Crypto) has underscored DOGE’s consolidation as a bullish indicator, emphasizing continued retail-driven momentum. Interestingly, Elon Musk’s recent low-profile approach on X (formerly Twitter) has indirectly intensified discussions, with cryptic comments sustaining public intrigue. Listings, Bridges & Ecosystem Evolution Beyond pure market speculation, infrastructure developments are significant. Dogecoin’s proposed bridge to Solana represents a substantial shift toward practical use, potentially altering meme coin narratives from entertainment to utility-focused assets. On exchanges, PEPE remains highly active, particularly on Binance, where daily volumes exceed $170 million in PEPE/USDT trades, solidifying its liquidity and relevance. Technically, analysts view PEPE at a crucial juncture, citing divergence in open interest and pivotal support zones as possible precursors to dramatic price movements. Conversely, Dogecoin’s developing bullish flag, backed by steady whale accumulation and robust market indicators, suggests potential for significant upward momentum if current conditions persist.

According to CertiK’s latest Hack3d report shared with crypto.news, compromised wallets accounted for the largest share of losses, totalling over $1.7 billion across 34 incidents. Phishing attacks followed, siphoning more than $410 million in 132 cases, while code vulnerabilities led to losses exceeding $283 million across 114 incidents. Exit scams and price manipulation were less frequent during this period but were still notable, resulting in combined losses of nearly $20 million. Access control exploits accounted for $42 million in damages. Notably, total losses in the first six months of 2025 have already surpassed the $2.42 billion recorded for all of 2024. After adjusting for returned and frozen funds, net losses stand at $2.29 billion, exceeding last year’s adjusted total of $1.98 billion. A significant portion of this year’s losses, roughly 72%, or $1.78 billion, stemmed from two large-scale incidents, the Bybit hack in Q1 and the Cetus protocol exploit in Q2. Excluding these, H1 losses would have stood at around $690 million.

While the pace of attacks slowed significantly in the second quarter, several major incidents still contributed to substantial losses. Phishing was the most widespread attack vector in Q2, accounting for over $395 million in losses across 52 incidents. Code vulnerabilities and access control weaknesses followed, resulting in losses of $235.7 million and $36.1 million, respectively. Wallet compromises, which had dominated Q1, caused $112 million in losses from 9 incidents in Q2. While the Bybit breach remained the most damaging incident of the year, Q2 saw several other high-value breaches involving protocol exploits and infrastructure compromises. These included the $225.6 million exploit of Cetus, the $89.1 million hack of Iran’s Nobitex exchange, and a $16.1 million attack on ALEX Lab. Other incidents involving Bitopro, Cork Protocol , KiloEx , and zkSync-based projects were primarily the result of smart contract flaws, infrastructure breaches, or compromised wallets. Ethereum was the most targeted blockchain, suffering losses of more than $1.58 billion across 164 incidents, while Bitcoin came in second, with over $373 million lost across 10 incidents. CertiK noted that $187 million in stolen funds were returned in the first half of the year, bringing the adjusted total losses to just over $2.28 billion. Of this, $180 million was recovered in Q2 alone. As previously reported by crypto.news, a separate mid-year analysis by blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs estimated $2.1 billion in crypto losses across 75 incidents during the same period, with the majority linked to infrastructure-level breaches such as private key thefts and front-end hijacks.

Hidden among the ocean of digital currencies, three lesser-known tokens are catching their eye. These under-the-radar picks could be primed for rapid growth. Explore which coins are on their radar and why they might be the next big thing in the crypto market. Jito Price Snapshot: Short-Term Gains Amid Long-Term Decline Last month, Jito showed steady gains with a +3.50% price increase, while the past week added another +2.14% to the mix. Over the last six months, the coin experienced a significant decline of about -27.77%, marking a long-term downtrend despite recent short-term improvements. Price fluctuations were evident as the range moved between $1.35 and $2.11, reflecting both quick recoveries and persistent weakness over time. At the current stage, the price sits between a tested support at $1.06 and an immediate resistance level at $2.56, with a broader range that extends to a second resistance at $3.32 and a second support at $0.30. The RSI at 52.96 indicates balanced sentiment, while the momentum indicator at -0.029 adds a slight bearish note. Traders might consider buying near $1.06 and look for a possible bounce, while a drop below this level could trigger a deeper sell-off. A breakthrough above $2.56 could open the door toward $3.32. The coin is currently in a consolidation phase that requires careful observation around these key levels. AB Coin Surge: Massive Gains Amid Key Price Milestones AB performance over the past month shows a remarkable leap with an 83.01% gain, while the half-year statistics reveal an astounding 8974.27% increase. The week-to-week rise of 5.65% adds to a vivid picture of strong upward momentum. Price action has spread from a range of $0.0043 to $0.0116, setting the stage for dynamic market responses. The numbers point to accelerated growth and strong investor sentiment, reflected in substantial price progress over both monthly and half-year time frames. The current market setup revolves around key price markers that guide trading decisions. Trading is occurring between a support level at $0.0004 and nearest resistance at $0.015, with a secondary resistance around $0.0223. Technical indicators show moderate balance with an RSI of 57.16 and a Momentum Indicator of 0.001. Bulls are in play, but caution is advised near resistance. Traders could consider entering long positions if the price holds near resistance or utilize tight stops if it slips toward support, making strategic moves in this bullish phase. Mantle Price Behavior and Key Levels Overview Data from the past month shows a decline of approximately 15% while the half-year performance has decreased by close to 46%. These price drops indicate a consistent downturn characterized by weakening sentiment and reduced buying interest. This erosion of value marks recent times as particularly challenging for the coin, reflecting broader market sentiments and investor reluctance. Currently, Mantle trades in a range between $0.61 and $0.79. Immediate resistance is observed at $0.90, with support near $0.54. Additional levels include $1.08 to the upside and $0.36 on the downside. Indicators such as a relative strength index near 41.84, along with negative momentum, suggest moderate bearish control. The absence of a clear trend presents opportunities for cautious trading, with an emphasis on monitoring the support boundary for potential reversals. A breach of resistance may signal upward movement, highlighting the importance of clearer directional cues before making any commitments. Conclusion JTO , AB , and MNT have shown potential for growth in June. These coins have caught the attention of top investors. Their new features and promising use cases set them apart from others. Monitoring these coins could be beneficial for those looking for future gains. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

According to the data, the network has experienced an extraordinary increase from 42,000 to over 600,000 active receiving addresses. Xaif describes this as a historic on-chain spike that has never been observed before in the history of the XRP Ledger. Xaif characterized this event as an “XRP network explosion,” indicating a substantial shift in network usage and activity. The chart accompanying the tweet, sourced from CryptoQuant, visually demonstrates the sharp and sudden growth in receiving accounts. This spike, coupled with volatility in the 7-day simple moving average (SMA) of receiving addresses, reflects the rapid fluctuation in activity over a short period. XRP NETWORK EXPLOSION! From 42K 600K+ active receiving addresses on the #XRPLedger Historic on-chain spike like NEVER before. $XRP is gearing up. Are you ready? pic.twitter.com/Fl1q6CHnuq — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) June 29, 2025 Market Price Movement Amid the Surge Despite the massive increase in network activity, XRP’s price response has been relatively muted. According to the latest data from CoinMarketCap cited in the tweet, XRP is currently trading at $2.21. This represents a 1.44% increase in the past 24 hours and a 9.87% rise over the past week. The price movement, while positive, does not appear to correlate directly with the scale of the on-chain activity spike. The CryptoQuant chart further illustrates that while the number of active receiving addresses experienced extreme growth, the XRP price remained within a narrow trading range and did not exhibit a breakout move matching the magnitude of the address growth. Community Reactions Raise Critical Observations The dramatic increase in active receiving wallets has led to varied interpretations within the crypto community. X user ghostpacket.IOAT expressed skepticism regarding the nature of this growth. The user suggested that the spike could be attributed to airdrop farming rather than representing genuine organic network growth. Ghostpacket.IOAT referenced historical precedents where similar spikes in wallet activity occurred on platforms like FTX before their collapse. Another user, George Fotion, voiced his criticism by questioning the price performance of XRP in light of the network activity surge. In his comment, he expressed frustration, stating that the price is doing “nothing” despite the on-chain metrics showing such a significant movement. He further criticized the situation using harsh language aimed at figures promoting XRP . The CryptoQuant chart provided supports the assertion that the magnitude of the spike is abnormal compared to previous network activity patterns. At its peak, the number of receiving accounts surpassed 600,000, contrasting sharply with the baseline of around 42,000 before the spike. This level of activity is unprecedented for the XRP Ledger within the timeframe displayed. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

With some familiar names losing momentum and others gaining fresh attention, many are asking if it’s time to rebalance their portfolios. Cardano and Solana still have strong ecosystems. However, technical concerns and market pressure have raised new questions. Meanwhile, XRP is pushing forward with major upgrades, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is generating serious interest from investors chasing returns. Let’s break down what’s happening with each project and whether a move makes sense now. 1.Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is On Everyone’s Radar MAGACOIN FINANCE is making waves in Q3 2025. Already being touted as one of the year’s hottest drops, the token has already sold out in early stages rapidly, with demand increasing on multiple fronts. Unlike most altcoins, MAGACOIN FINANCE has a strong foundation backing its growth. The token has a capped supply of 170 billion, but this limits potential future dilution. This shortage is one of the main reasons analysts are calling it one of the most undervalued crypto assets of the day. A rigorous audit by HashEx provides investors with assurance, but there are no venture capital unlocks looming over the token. Institutional interest is growing. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s direct, politically themed branding is drawing huge support. Analysts say it’s not just about hype—it’s about the fundamentals. From transparency to security, the project checks key boxes. With an open roadmap and increasing investor demand, MAGACOIN FINANCE is shaping up to be this year’s breakout coin. 2. What’s Happening with Cardano? The Cardano ecosystem continues to grow with new tech advancements. In June 2025, Input Output Global revealed a new L2 architecture that would further enhance scalability even beyond the existing solution. This is a long-term initiative to optimize performance and developer freedom. In order to offset volatility, the Cardano Foundation has put some of its $100 million treasury into Bitcoin and stablecoins. It’s an obvious attempt to leverage maximum risk and enhance cross-chain accessibility. Wrapped ADA (cbADA) has just gone live on Coinbase’s Base network, improving its DeFi compatibility and cross-chain support. Cardano price sentiment remains neutral, however. Some analysts see a rebound to $0.70–$1.20 in early 2026. Others warn that failing to reclaim key support levels could push ADA down to $0.32. These conflicting forecasts raise concerns and fuel the “is Cardano dead?” discussion. Cardano price chart 3. Where Does Solana Stand? Solana remains one of the crypto space’s fastest chains. Processing as many as 65,000 transactions per second at low costs, it’s a DeFi and NFT powerhouse. CME Futures institutional trading reached an all-time high in June as significant players demonstrated robust demand. But the revenue tale of the chain is complicated. More than 75% of its recent revenues are tied to meme-coin trading. That can reverse quickly, particularly if social media mania cools down. BAY Miner’s new AI-powered cloud mining service includes Solana, boosting infrastructure growth. But technical charts show weakness. A head-and-shoulders pattern and a dip below the 200-day moving average are warning signs. Unless SOL climbs back to $147–$150 and flips those levels into support, the path to $165–$175 remains uncertain. 4. Why XRP is Gaining Traction Again XRP is seeing new attention following the version 2.5.0 upgrade to its ledger. Key features include: TokenEscrow : Adds flexibility for trustline tokens. Batching : Combines multiple transactions for better efficiency. Permissioned DEXs : Adds access controls, useful for institutional compliance. These changes were front and center at Ripple’s 2025 Apex summit. Ripple is now focused on use cases like tokenized treasuries and stablecoins for big institutions. Political stability in the Middle East, along with Bitcoin’s consistent price, is supporting XRP’s momentum. Analysts believe a push toward $2.30 is possible. But if XRP closes below $2, it could revisit the $1.70–$1.80 range. The Verdict: Should You Move? Both Cardano and Solana have strong histories but also their own challenges. Cardano’s upgrade roadmap is a very good but slow one. Solana’s near-term risks are above average given technical breakdowns and dependence on trends. XRP is coming back to life in a meaningful way thanks to some smart upgrades and increasing institutional use cases. It’s maintaining support and may pump up higher if the market momentum persists. But now MAGACOIN FINANCE is where investor interest is pouring in. The capped supply, guaranteed audit, and increasing demand all indicate high return potential. It’s leading this cycle boldly, energetically, and clearly. For those looking for growth in Q3 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE is a smarter play.

CertiK recorded 344 on-chain incidents between January and June. Wallet breaches accounted for $1.7 billion in just 34 cases, while phishing scams caused $410 million across 132 incidents. The largest exploit occurred in February when Bybit lost $1.5 billion in a wallet breach involving staked ETH. In May, Cetus Protocol was exploited for $225 million via a smart contract bug, although $162 million was later recovered by Sui validators. Ethereum Targeted Most; Code Bugs Surge Ethereum was the most attacked blockchain, with 175 incidents leading to $1.6 billion in losses. Smart contract vulnerabilities alone caused $229 million in May, up sharply from just $5 million in April. CertiK also flagged an increase in physical attacks, with 32 cases involving violence, kidnappings, and ransom attempts. France saw the most incidents, including an attempted kidnapping involving the family of Paymium’s CEO. [post_titles_links postid=”476963″] Funds Recovered, But Risks Mount Approximately $187 million was recovered through whitehat efforts, law enforcement, and exchange cooperation. However, with attacks becoming more complex and violent, stronger security practices are urgently needed. A key vulnerability remains poor private key management. Keys are often stored insecurely, unencrypted, or controlled by one person, making them easy targets for hackers. This single point of failure has contributed to billions in losses and remains one of the crypto industry’s biggest risks.

Just as AI is reshaping financial markets and data analysis, it’s now revolutionizing how code is written and managed. A significant leap in this evolution comes from Cursor, the company behind the popular AI coding editor, which has just unveiled a groundbreaking Cursor web app designed to empower developers by allowing them to manage powerful AI coding agents directly from their browser. What are AI Coding Agents and How Do They Work? For those immersed in the world of technology, the concept of artificial intelligence taking on increasingly complex tasks is no longer a futuristic dream but a present reality. AI coding agents are sophisticated AI systems designed to understand natural language requests and autonomously perform coding tasks. Unlike traditional tools that merely assist, these agents can initiate, execute, and even complete coding assignments without constant human supervision. Cursor first introduced these powerful ‘background agents’ in May, allowing them to tackle coding challenges independently. Imagine assigning a task like “write a new user authentication feature” or “fix the bug in the payment gateway” to an AI, and it begins working on it in the background. This capability significantly reduces manual effort and accelerates the development cycle, a critical factor in the fast-paced tech environment that often mirrors the agility seen in crypto projects. Unlocking New Possibilities with the Cursor Web App The launch of the Cursor web app marks a pivotal moment for developers. Moving beyond its integrated development environment (IDE), Cursor is making its advanced AI tools more accessible than ever. This new web application allows users to interact with and manage their network of coding agents directly from any browser, whether on a desktop or mobile device. This means you can send natural language requests to your background agents, monitor their progress, and even merge completed code changes into your codebase, all without needing to open your traditional IDE. This flexibility is a game-changer for developers who are constantly on the go or need to quickly check on tasks. The convenience of a browser-based interface ensures that the power of AI-driven coding is always at your fingertips, streamlining workflows and enhancing collaboration across development teams. Boosting Developer Productivity: The Cursor Advantage One of the primary goals of integrating AI into development workflows is to dramatically boost developer productivity . Cursor’s new web app and its existing integrations are meticulously designed to achieve this. Andrew Milich, Cursor’s head of product engineering, emphasized that these innovations aim to “remove the friction” from the development process. By enabling users to assign tasks via Slack (tagging @Cursor, similar to Cognition’s Devin) or the new web app, developers can offload initial passes on coding tasks to AI agents. If an agent encounters a roadblock, the user can seamlessly transition into the IDE to take over precisely where the agent left off. This hybrid approach ensures that human oversight and creativity remain paramount while leveraging AI for repetitive or time-consuming tasks. The ability to view agent progress and code changes via unique shareable links further enhances team collaboration, ensuring everyone is on the same page. The Future of AI Software Development The advancements by Cursor are a strong indicator of the transformative direction of AI software development . While Cursor isn’t the first to introduce AI coding agents, the company has prioritized building robust, practical tools rather than “demo-ware” – a common pitfall for early AI products that often fail to deliver on their promises in real-world scenarios. This cautious yet innovative approach reflects a growing confidence in the maturity of AI reasoning models. Michael Truell, Anysphere CEO, has a bold vision for the future, predicting that AI coding agents will handle at least 20% of a software engineer’s work by 2026. This isn’t about replacing engineers but augmenting their capabilities, freeing them to focus on more complex problem-solving, architectural design, and innovative thinking. The integration of AI into every stage of the software lifecycle promises a future where development is faster, more efficient, and less prone to errors. Embracing Automated Coding for Efficiency The push towards automated coding solutions is gaining significant momentum, driven by the need for faster development cycles and higher code quality. Cursor’s success story underscores this trend: Anysphere recently announced that Cursor has surpassed $500 million in annualized recurring revenue and is now utilized by over half of the Fortune 500, including industry giants like NVIDIA, Uber, and Adobe. This widespread adoption is a testament to the tangible benefits automated coding agents bring to large-scale operations. To further capitalize on this growth and meet diverse user needs, Anysphere has also introduced a $200-per-month Pro tier, building on its existing $20-per-month Pro plan. It’s important to note that while the web app and background agents are available to customers on these paid tiers, users on Cursor’s free tier currently do not have access to these advanced features. This tiered approach allows Cursor to provide specialized tools for professional development teams seeking peak efficiency and advanced automation. Conclusion: The Dawn of a New Development Era The launch of Cursor’s web app for managing AI coding agents is more than just a new product; it’s a significant milestone in the evolution of software development. By making powerful AI tools accessible directly through a browser, Cursor is breaking down barriers and empowering developers with unprecedented flexibility and efficiency. As AI reasoning models continue to advance, we can expect these intelligent agents to play an even more critical role in streamlining workflows, accelerating innovation, and ultimately, redefining what’s possible in the world of code. The future of development is here, and it’s intelligent, integrated, and incredibly productive.

Trump wrote: “Elon Musk knew, long before he so strongly endorsed me for President, that I was strongly against the EV Mandate. It is ridiculous, and was always a major part of my campaign.” He then said electric cars might be fine, but people shouldn’t be forced to buy them, and he called out Elon for benefiting from what he said are record-breaking government handouts. Trump also suggested that if the money stopped, Elon would have to shut everything down—rockets, satellites, electric vehicles—and head back to South Africa. He ended the rant by throwing in a jab at DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency, saying, “Perhaps we should have DOGE take a good, hard, look at this? Big money to be saved!” That hit hard because DOGE was Elon’s own idea, created with the goal of cutting $1 trillion in wasteful government spending. Now Trump wants to use it to investigate the very man who launched it. Meanwhile, the Tesla stock has plunged by 5.8% in premarket trading as reaction to the two men having a public spat yet again. Elon threatens Republicans supporting Trump’s debt bill A few hours before Trump’s post, Elon took to X to post a threat to every Republican in Congress who supports Trump’s latest tax and spending bill. He wrote : “Every member of Congress who campaigned on reducing government spending and then immediately voted for the biggest debt increase in history should hang their head in shame! And they will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth.” That message was posted just as the Senate was getting ready to vote on Trump’s proposed legislation. The bill is 940 pages long and includes a $5 trillion increase to the debt ceiling while slashing federal aid programs. The vote is part of a procedural process known as vote-a-rama, a chaotic session where lawmakers race through dozens of amendments. The session started on Monday morning and kept going for over 18 hours into Tuesday without a final vote. $3.3 trillion price tag deepens GOP split The Congressional Budget Office released its estimate on Sunday, placing the cost of the Senate version of Trump’s bill at $3.3 trillion. That’s $800 billion more than the House version passed last month. It would bring the total US national debt up from $36.2 trillion. Some Republicans say the CBO numbers are inflated and that continuing current policy shouldn’t count as new spending, but that hasn’t calmed the markets. Global bondholders are already pulling back from US Treasuries, sensing instability. Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told the Senate the bill would “steal people’s healthcare, jack up their electricity bill to pay for tax breaks for billionaires.” John Thune fired back by defending the tax cuts as help for families and small businesses, and he said Medicaid spending was growing too fast, claiming the bill included reforms to make it more sustainable. Elon wasn’t done. In a separate post, he said, “America is going bankrupt extremely quickly, but everyone seems to be whistling past the graveyard.” He said the Defense Department’s budget is already over $1 trillion a year, and now interest payments on the national debt are also past $1 trillion, and rising. “We have to reduce the spending,” he wrote. He also said the debt ceiling is the only tool left that can actually force the government to cut fraud and waste, adding, “That’s why the debt ceiling legislation exists!” The Senate already voted 51-49 to open debate on the bill late Saturday. The proposal covers tax cuts, border security, immigration, and increased military funding. Trump wants the whole thing signed and sealed before the July 4 holiday, according to his staff. And if Elon keeps pushing, it looks like the White House may push back even harder. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Just as blockchain reshapes finance, artificial intelligence is now profoundly transforming education. Google, a titan in the tech world, is making a monumental leap into this arena, integrating its powerful Google AI tools, particularly Gemini, deeply into the classroom. This isn’t just an incremental update; it’s a strategic move to redefine how students learn and teachers teach, embracing the potential of AI to create more personalized and engaging learning experiences. How Google AI is Reshaping Learning Environments The landscape of education is rapidly evolving, with artificial intelligence emerging as a central force. Google’s recent announcement at the ISTE edtech conference marks a significant push to embed its Google AI and other AI-powered tools deeper into the academic world. This initiative introduces over 30 new AI tools specifically designed for educators, a dedicated Gemini app for educational purposes, and expanded access to collaborative platforms like Google Vids. This bold step comes at a time when educators globally are grappling with the pervasive influence of AI. Tools like AI chatbots are already commonplace, with many students turning to them for homework assistance or even completion. Higher education institutions, too, are wrestling with the efficacy of plagiarism detectors against AI-generated content. Amidst this disruption, Google is forging ahead, emphasizing “responsible AI” as a catalyst for “more engaging and personalized learning experiences,” always in conjunction with human-led teaching. This commitment underscores a vision where technology augments, rather than replaces, the crucial role of educators. Unleashing the Power of Gemini for Educators and Students At the heart of Google’s educational revolution is Gemini , its advanced AI suite. Following its initial announcement last year, the Gemini AI suite for educators is now freely accessible to all Google Workspace for Education accounts. This includes a robust set of over 30 new features tailored to streamline teaching processes. Teachers can leverage Gemini to brainstorm innovative ideas, generate comprehensive lesson plans, and personalize content to meet the diverse needs of their students, all powered by sophisticated AI technology. Beyond basic assistance, Google is rolling out tools that promise to transform how students interact with learning materials. In the coming months, educators will gain the ability to create interactive study guides using Notebook LM, an AI research tool that integrates seamlessly with existing classroom materials. Perhaps one of the most intriguing innovations is the introduction of “Gems.” These are custom versions of the Gemini AI, designed to function as specialized AI experts. Students can interact with Gems to receive extra support or gain a deeper understanding of specific subjects. This feature cleverly redirects a common student behavior – asking an AI chatbot for explanations – back to Google’s controlled environment, where the AI is specifically trained on the teacher’s own classroom content, ensuring relevance and accuracy. Enhancing the Education Experience with Advanced Tools Google’s commitment to transforming learning extends beyond Gemini . The company is significantly expanding access to Google Vids, its AI-powered video creation tool, making it available to all Google Workspace for Education users. This empowers teachers to produce engaging instructional videos, while students can utilize Vids for creative assignments like book reports or project presentations. Furthermore, the “Read Along in Classroom” tool will soon offer students real-time support from an AI-powered reading buddy, enhancing literacy development. The updates also focus on practical classroom management and data security. Google is introducing new features to track student progress against learning standards and skills, providing valuable analytics on performance and engagement. Crucially, there are enhanced measures to better secure Gemini user data and information within Gmail, alongside improved controls over who can access AI tools like Gemini and Notebook LM. Google Meet waiting rooms will also see better management options. Complementing these software enhancements, Google is rolling out a series of updates for managed Chromebooks and a new teaching mode called Class Tools. This mode allows teachers to connect directly with students via Google Classroom, sharing content like videos, articles, slides, and quizzes directly to their screens. These tools can adapt to a student’s language needs and are designed to minimize distractions by restricting browsing to specific tabs, keeping students focused on their learning journey. Navigating the Future Classroom: Benefits and Challenges The integration of powerful AI in the classroom brings forth a myriad of benefits, promising a more dynamic and effective learning environment. However, it also introduces a new set of challenges that educators, administrators, and policymakers must carefully navigate. Benefits of AI in the Classroom: Personalized Learning Paths: AI can adapt content and pace to individual student needs, ensuring each learner receives tailored support. Enhanced Efficiency for Educators: Teachers can automate administrative tasks, content creation, and even basic student support, freeing up time for more impactful human interaction. Increased Accessibility: AI tools can provide support for students with diverse learning styles or special needs, including language adaptation and real-time assistance. Engaging Content Creation: Tools like Google Vids empower both teachers and students to create dynamic, multimedia-rich learning materials. Data-Driven Insights: Analytics on student performance and engagement allow for more informed pedagogical decisions and early intervention. Challenges of AI in the Classroom: Ethical Considerations: Concerns around data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the potential for over-reliance on AI need careful addressing. Digital Divide: Ensuring equitable access to necessary technology and internet connectivity for all students remains a critical hurdle. Teacher Training: Educators require comprehensive training not just on how to use AI tools, but also on how to integrate them effectively and ethically into their teaching methodologies. Authenticity of Work: The rise of AI chatbots raises questions about academic integrity and the need for new assessment methods that go beyond rote memorization. Human Connection: While AI can personalize learning, it’s vital to ensure it doesn’t diminish the irreplaceable value of human interaction, mentorship, and social learning. Google’s emphasis on “responsible AI” attempts to mitigate some of these challenges, but ongoing dialogue and adaptation will be crucial for successful implementation. The Broader Impact on EdTech and Beyond Google’s strategic investment in AI for education signals a major shift within the broader EdTech landscape. By making its powerful Gemini tools freely available to Google Workspace for Education accounts, Google is positioning itself as a dominant force, potentially setting new standards for AI integration in schools. This move will undoubtedly pressure other educational technology providers to accelerate their own AI development and adoption strategies. The ripple effects extend beyond direct competitors. The focus on AI-powered personalization, automated content generation, and intelligent tutoring systems reflects a growing trend towards more adaptive and responsive learning environments. This could foster a new wave of innovation among startups specializing in niche AI applications for education, while also challenging established players to rethink their offerings. The future of EdTech appears increasingly intertwined with advanced AI capabilities, pushing towards a paradigm where learning is not just about content delivery, but about intelligent, adaptive, and highly personalized engagement. Conclusion Google’s comprehensive embrace of AI in the classroom, spearheaded by its potent Gemini tools, represents a pivotal moment for education. By offering educators and students a suite of sophisticated yet accessible AI-powered resources, Google aims to foster more engaging, personalized, and efficient learning experiences. While the challenges of integrating such transformative technology are significant – ranging from ethical considerations to ensuring equitable access – Google’s commitment to “responsible AI” provides a foundational framework. As AI continues to evolve, its thoughtful integration into education holds the promise of unlocking unprecedented opportunities for learners worldwide, preparing them for a future increasingly shaped by intelligent technologies. This is not merely an upgrade; it’s a bold step towards a truly intelligent classroom.

At this point, Trump-linked company American Bitcoin has raised $220 million to purchase Bitcoin and mining equipment. American Bitcoin, a Bitcoin mining company backed by two sons of US President Donald Trump, has raised $220 million to purchase BTC and BTC mining equipment, Bloomberg reported. The financing comes after the company issued and sold more than 11 million new shares to private investors last Friday. Approximately $10 million worth of shares were sold for Bitcoin instead of dollars, at an exchange rate of $104,000 per Bitcoin. “The Company intends to use the proceeds to fund its strategic and Bitcoin accumulation objectives, which may include, but are not limited to, the purchase of Bitcoin and mining equipment.” American Bitcoin was co-founded by Eric Trump and fellow Bitcoin miner Hut8. Meanwhile, American Bitcoin is aiming to list on the Nasdaq through an all-stock merger with Gryphon Digital Mining, a mining company listed on the Nasdaq. Existing shareholders such as Eric Trump, his brother Donald Trump Jr. (co-founder), and mining company Hut 8 will retain 98% of the shares in the new entity. *This is not investment advice.

Although Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe Coin (PEPE) continue to dominate the headlines, their high-flying days may have already passed. Investors who came in at the early level made fortunes, but investors who come in today may not enjoy immediate returns. That is why a new meme coin, Little Pepe (LILPEPE), is turning heads, with a projected return of 21,839% from its current price. SHIB and PEPE Growth May Be Slowing Shiba Inu rose to fame with a strong community and aggressive marketing. It added utility via ShibaSwap and its own Layer-2 network. However, despite such developments, the token price has not changed significantly over the past few months. Its huge supply also does not encourage rapid growth, more so among those new buyers who dream of making life-changing gains with small investments. Pepe Coin offered fast action and viral appeal in early 2023, quickly climbing into the top meme coins by market cap. However, after its initial surge, it has struggled to regain momentum. With no strong utility or long-term development plan, PEPE is now seen by many as a short-lived rally rather than a sustainable investment. Little Pepe Offers Something New Little Pepe (LILPEPE) takes the cultural influence of meme culture and mixes it with the practical application of blockchain. LILPEPE is built with a fast, low-fee Layer-2 network that delivers a smoother user experience. It also has plans to introduce a Meme Launchpad that will enable developers to launch their own tokens within the ecosystem directly. Its tokenomics are open to the community. The presale will consist of 26.5 percent of the total supply of 100 billion. Investors can participate with Ethereum, USDT, and even credit or debit cards, and the process is convenient to both seasoned crypto users and newbies. The token is in its third stage of presale at a price of $0.0012, having 93.57% completion. The next stage will be priced at $0.0013, showing the success of the presale. Early buyers have another reason to get excited. A $777,000 giveaway is now live, where ten winners will receive $77,000 worth of LILPEPE each. This promotion is drawing massive attention and expanding the token’s user base rapidly. Conclusion While SHIB and PEPE have already made headlines and fortunes, their potential for high returns has become limited. In contrast, Little Pepe is still in its early stages and backed by real utility, strong community features, and viral momentum. With price predictions pointing to a possible 21,839% return from current levels, LILPEPE could be the breakout story of 2025. Those who act early may secure life-changing gains while the rest of the market catches up.

Despite the decline, some analysts on X cite strong demand, potential accumulation by large investors, and bullish technical patterns to envision a possible breakout. Fasten Your Seat Belts Several well-known cryptocurrencies have witnessed substantial price increases over the past week. However, Pi Network’s PI is among the few in the red zone, plunging by 8% within that timeframe and currently trading well below $0.50. Moreover, certain important factors suggest that investors should prepare for volatility in the following days. According to Piscan, a major token unlock is scheduled for this week, with a record 19.2 million PI expected to be released on July 4 . This will mark the largest single-day unlock to date. The amount of freed tokens will remain high until mid-July, after which the pace is expected to slow down. PI Token Unlocks, Source: Piscan The development will allow people to sell coins they have been waiting for a long time. While it doesn’t guarantee widespread selling, it does increase the likelihood of downward price pressure. Bulls Will be Bulls The aforementioned factors might point to a further correction, but many X users remain optimistic that PI’s price could experience a major resurgence soon. The one using the moniker Woody Lightyear thinks the asset is preparing for “a big pump.” He provided a quick recap of PI’s price performance around Pi2Day (June 28), highlighting that the token had been trading around the $0.50 range. “The market maker and a few large Investors pumped and dumped a few days ago. Unexpectedly, after Pi2Day update, PI coins started flowing back from exchanges to the ecosystem for staking and other engagements. They misjudged the situation and are trying to buy back the Pi they dumped by pressing the price down to buy low. But the demand keeps increasing at the $0.5 range,” he added. For their part, MoonBitz pointed out certain bullish elements such as the formation of a double bottom holding, a wedge pattern tightening, and the launch of a Pi AI Studio to predict “a possible breakout.” The post Major Pi Network (PI) Warning for This Week: Largest Daily Unlock Scheduled for July 4th appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Pi Network (PI),EN,0,0,TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-07-01 09:23:12

In addition to these altcoins, a basket ETF composed of multiple crypto assets is also expected to be approved soon. Meanwhile, the US is set to launch its first-ever staked crypto ETF—the REX-Osprey Solana and Staking ETF—this week. It will offer exposure to spot Solana with staking rewards. Solana’s price jumped on the news, and its DeFi ecosystem continues to outpace Ethereum in DEX volume. At the same time, crypto ETPs saw $2.7 billion in inflows last week, bringing the H1 total to $17.8 billion. Bitcoin ETPs led the charge, while XRP also showed strong momentum despite still pending US ETF approval. CoinShares data showed that BlackRock dominated issuer inflows. Good Approval Odds for Solana, XRP and LTC ETFs Analysts at Bloomberg raised the odds of approval for several highly anticipated crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). They now forecast a 95% chance that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will greenlight spot ETFs for Solana, XRP, and Litecoin by the end of the year. This is an increase from the previous 90% estimate, which means that there is growing optimism in the ETF research community that other crypto investment products will soon be available to US investors. The update came from Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, who said in a post on X that they expect a ”wave of new ETFs” in the second half of 2025. Alongside individual altcoins, they also predict a 95% approval likelihood for a spot ETF based on a basket or index of crypto assets—potentially arriving as early as this week. Other altcoins like Dogecoin, Cardano, Polkadot, Hedera, and Avalanche also received a bullish 90% approval forecast, with their decisions expected in the fourth quarter. However, analysts assigned more cautious odds to ETFs based on Sui and Tron, estimating their chances at 60% and 50%, respectively. Unfortunately, the SEC continues to drag its feet on Ethereum-related products. On Monday, it postponed its decision on whether the Bitwise spot Ether ETF would be allowed to include staking. The regulator also delayed a separate ruling on the approval of the Osprey Bitcoin Trust for listing and trading. This proves that there is still some caution and regulatory hesitancy around certain crypto investment structures. First US Staked Crypto ETF Launches This Week Despite its delays with ETH products, the United States is still about to see the launch of its first-ever staked crypto ETF. Scheduled for debut on Wednesday, the REX-Osprey Solana and Staking ETF will provide investors with direct exposure to spot Solana (SOL) while also offering the opportunity to earn yield through staking. This unique combination is seen as a potential catalyst for even more institutional involvement in crypto investment products. The ETF's issuer, REX Shares, confirmed the launch just days after early reports hinted at its imminent arrival. The product is turning heads not only for being the first staked crypto ETF in the U., but also for navigating the very complex regulatory landscape. Initially, the SEC expressed concerns about the ETF’s C-Corporation structure, and suggested that it conflicted with existing ETF rules. However, after REX submitted an updated prospectus and made key adjustments, the SEC provided positive feedback, which then allowed the product to move forward. This development followed a May ruling by the SEC affirming that staking does not violate existing securities laws, although the agency still delayed decisions on other staking-related ETFs and altcoin funds. The REX-Osprey ETF could therefore serve as a benchmark for future products seeking similar structures. On the day of the ETF announcement, Solana’s price saw a good boost by climbing 6% to around $158 and pushing its seven-day gain to over 12%. Despite the upward momentum, SOL is still 48% below its all-time high from January. Still, with a market cap of $83.5 billion, Solana is now the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by valuation. SOL’s price action over the past week (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Solana's rising prominence is also reflected in its performance in the decentralized exchange (DEX) space. Recent data shows that Solana-based DEX volumes surpassed those of Ethereum, with platforms like Raydium, Pump.fun, and Orca leading the charge. This surge in DeFi activity, combined with the launch of a staking-enabled ETF, sheds some light on Solana’s growing influence in the crypto ecosystem. It also suggests that a new chapter of institutional and retail engagement may be unfolding. Crypto ETP Inflows Hit $17.8 Billion in H1 2025 Overall, cryptocurrency investment products continued their impressive momentum last week, with global exchange-traded products (ETPs) attracting $2.7 billion in new inflows. This was their 11th consecutive week of positive movement. The sustained streak pushed total net inflows for the first half of 2025 to $17.8 billion, according to a new report from digital asset manager CoinShares. Although slightly lower than the $18.3 billion that was recorded during the same period in 2024, the figure represents a resilient performance despite market fluctuations. Weekly crypto flows (Source: CoinShares ) Bitcoin investment products dominated the space by contributing $14.9 billion, or close to 84% of all inflows for the year-to-date period. In just the past week, Bitcoin ETPs brought in $2.2 billion, accounting for 83% of total inflows. Ethereum ETPs followed with a more modest but still impressive $429 million in weekly inflows, bringing their half-year total to $2.9 billion, or 16.3% of all inflows so far this year. Flows per asset (Source: CoinShares ) XRP also maintained its position among the top performers by recording $10.6 million in inflows last week and $219 million for the first half of the year. XRP’s strong showing is especially major when considering that spot XRP ETFs are still pending approval in the United States. However, Canada already moved forward, and launched these products on June 18, offering investors a regulated way to get exposure to the asset. From an issuer perspective, BlackRock emerged as the clear leader after pulling in over $17 billion in inflows during the first six months of 2025. This represents 96% of all new capital entering crypto ETPs over that time period. ProShares and Fidelity trailed with $526 million and $246 million, respectively, while Grayscale Investments saw nearly $1.7 billion in net outflows. The CoinShares report came as Bitcoin experienced a slight pullback , dipping just below $108,000 after a week-long rally that took it from around $101,000 on June 23 to nearly $107,800. Despite minor corrections, the continued inflows into crypto ETPs indicate robust investor confidence in digital assets.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,SOL|XRP|LTC|TRADING|BTC,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-01 09:30:00

If you are looking forward to the next big gainer in the upcoming bull run, now is the time to start searching. You need to identify a promising project like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that can have a competitive edge for sustained gains. If you are looking to make 100% or more gains in the upcoming bull run, here are the two main options you should closely watch and consider including in your crypto portfolio. Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin (BTC) recently hit a new all-time high of over $111,0000. All signs indicate that it is due for a massive pump in the next bull run. One reason for this optimistic forecast is growing institutional adoption. For instance, the US recently passed the GENIUS Act. Before that, Trump signed an executive order authorizing the creation of a Bitcoin Reserve. With all these positive developments around BTC, including greater legal clarity, the next bull run could see BTC gain 100%. However, it is worth noting that BTC is already trading at the top of its pricing. As such, a 100% gain may not come soon enough for most people. While you could hold on for years to come, there is a better option in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) A Deep Dive Into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in phase 5 of its presale, where tokens are going for $0.03. The current price represents a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. So far, over $11.3 million has been raised in the presale from around 12,550 unique buyers. The token price is set to increase by 16.67% in the upcoming phase 6 to $0.035. One reason why analysts are so confident of 100% gains for MUTM tokens is the planned listing price of $0.06. Based on that listing price, purchasing MUTM tokens already guarantees you a 100% return. In the upcoming phase 6, that return will dip to 71.43%. So far, investors have taken that calculation into consideration, buying up 50% of the tokens set aside for phase 5, barely a month after they went live. As such, analysts predict that MUTM tokens could rise more than 100%. Their predictions point to gains of 2300%. One reason why analysts are so optimistic about the future price of MUTM tokens is that the whole project is built on utility. Unlike meme coins, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed to support the continuous price increase of the native MUTM tokens. One unique design feature of this project is the buyback program. In this program, Mutuum Finance will use protocol profits to buy MUTM tokens off the open market. That will lead to huge price increases over time. Best of all, since the protocol has so much utility built into it, protocol profits are expected to keep rising over time. Bug Bounty Program Another reason why investors project such massive gains for MUTM tokens is the recent $50,000 USDT bug bounty program. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team has partnered with CertiK on this program. It will offer incentives to get the global security community to help maintain the safety of the ecosystem. The program will be split into four tiers, which are critical, major, minor, and low. Depending on the potential impact of a vulnerability, the team will share out a reward of the appropriate size. The Mutuum Finance Protocol Mutuum Finance is a decentralized noncustodial protocol where users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. As lenders, they deposit their assets into the protocol for the chance to receive interest on their deposits. Borrowers can deposit overcollateralized collateral into the protocol to access these funds. Interest rates for both lenders and borrowers are based on the pool utilization rate. For instance, when a lender deposits $10,000 USDC in a pool, the utilization rate could increase, pushing the yield to 12%. In such a case, the lender will earn $1,200 on their deposit per year. That presents an easy way to make passive income that does not require one to engage in complex trading strategies. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Is The Top Crypto For Massive Returns While there are several crypto coins that could rise 100% or more in the next bull run, MUTM tokens offer the best possibility for massive returns. Analysts forecast a modest increase of 23x in returns when they go live. To be part of this massive opportunity, all you need to do is add MUTM tokens to your portfolio by participating in the ongoing presale.

Congress is currently deliberating a federal proposal to impose an AI moratorium , potentially banning states and local governments from regulating AI for five years. This move, reminiscent of debates around digital asset regulation, has sparked intense discussion among tech leaders, policymakers, and consumer advocates alike. The Proposed AI Moratorium : What’s on the Table? A federal proposal that would prohibit states and local governments from regulating AI for half a decade could soon become law. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) and other lawmakers are working to include this provision in a major GOP budget bill, which the Senate is voting on this Monday, ahead of a critical July 4 deadline. This measure, initially conceived to ban states from enforcing any laws or regulations on AI models, systems, or automated decision systems for a decade, has seen revisions. Over the weekend, Senator Cruz and Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) agreed to shorten the pause on state-based AI regulation to five years. The updated language attempts to exempt laws addressing child sexual abuse materials, children’s online safety, and an individual’s rights to their name, likeness, voice, and image. However, a crucial caveat states that such laws must not place an “undue or disproportionate burden” on AI systems. Legal experts are uncertain how this would impact existing or future state AI laws , creating a cloud of ambiguity over their enforceability. Fueling AI Innovation or Stifling Progress? Proponents of the federal AI moratorium, including prominent figures like OpenAI’s Sam Altman, Anduril’s Palmer Luckey, and a16z’s Marc Andreessen, argue that a fragmented approach to AI regulation across states would hinder American AI innovation . They contend that a “patchwork” of diverse state laws would make it excessively difficult for AI companies to operate and scale, especially at a time when the global race to dominate AI, particularly against China, is intensifying. The argument is that a unified federal approach, even if it means a temporary pause on state action, would provide the necessary clarity and freedom for AI developers to innovate rapidly without navigating a labyrinth of differing local rules. This perspective emphasizes speed and competitiveness on the international stage as paramount. Safeguarding Consumer Protection : The Case Against Federal Preemption Critics of the proposed moratorium argue that it would severely undermine consumer protection and accountability in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. This group includes most Democrats, many Republicans, Anthropic’s CEO Dario Amodei, labor groups, AI safety nonprofits, and consumer rights advocates. They warn that this provision would block states from passing vital laws designed to protect citizens from AI harms, effectively allowing powerful AI firms to operate with minimal oversight. The moratorium threatens to preempt state AI laws that have already been enacted. For example, California’s AB 2013 requires companies to disclose the data used to train AI systems, offering transparency to consumers. Similarly, Tennessee’s ELVIS Act protects musicians and creators from AI-generated impersonations, a direct response to emerging AI harms. Public Citizen has compiled a database revealing numerous AI-related laws across states that could be nullified, many of which address specific harms like deceptive AI-generated media used to influence elections, a concern shared by states like Alabama, Arizona, California, Delaware, Hawaii, Indiana, Montana, and Texas. Furthermore, several noteworthy AI safety bills awaiting signature, such as New York’s RAISE Act, which would mandate large AI labs nationwide to publish thorough safety reports, are also at risk. Opponents argue that allowing a federal vacuum in regulation for five years leaves consumers vulnerable to unchecked AI development. The Fiscal Leverage: How Funding Ties Into State AI Laws Getting the AI moratorium into a budget bill has required some creative legislative maneuvering. Budget bill provisions typically need a direct fiscal impact. To meet this requirement, Senator Cruz revised the proposal in June to make compliance with the AI moratorium a condition for states to receive funds from the $42 billion Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (BEAD) program. This strategic move leverages federal funding as an incentive for states to adhere to the federal AI pause. Cruz released another revision last week, claiming it ties the requirement only to a new $500 million in BEAD funding included in the bill—a separate, additional pot of money. However, a closer examination of the revised text suggests the language also threatens to pull already obligated broadband funding from states that do not comply. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) previously criticized Cruz’s original language, stating it “forces states receiving BEAD funding to choose between expanding broadband or protecting consumers from AI harms for ten years.” This fiscal pressure adds another layer of complexity to the debate. What’s Next for AI Regulation in Congress? As of Monday, the Senate is engaged in a “vote-a-rama”—a series of rapid votes on the budget bill’s numerous amendments. The new language agreed upon by Cruz and Blackburn will be part of a broader amendment that Republicans are expected to pass along party lines. Senators will also likely vote on a Democrat-backed amendment aimed at stripping the entire AI moratorium section from the bill. The outcome of these votes will determine the immediate future of AI regulation in the U.S. The debate extends beyond Capitol Hill. Chris Lehane, chief global affairs officer at OpenAI, stated that the “current patchwork approach to regulating AI isn’t working and will continue to worsen if we stay on this path.” He warned of “serious implications” for the U.S. in the AI dominance race against China, even quoting Vladimir Putin on the importance of AI leadership. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman echoed these sentiments, expressing concern that a state-by-state patchwork would be “a real mess and very difficult to offer services under.” Altman also questioned whether policymakers could keep pace with rapidly evolving AI technology to craft effective regulations. The Public’s Stance on Consumer Protection While proponents of the moratorium advocate for a “light touch” approach to AI governance, public sentiment appears to lean differently. A recent Pew Research survey found that most Americans desire more AI regulation . Approximately 60% of U.S. adults and 56% of AI experts are more concerned that the U.S. government won’t go far enough in regulating AI than they are about over-regulation. Americans also largely lack confidence in the government’s ability to regulate AI effectively and remain skeptical of industry efforts around responsible AI. This public desire for stronger oversight stands in contrast to the proposed federal pause on state action. The Case Against Preemption: Why States Matter “The patchwork argument is something that we have heard since the beginning of consumer advocacy time,” Emily Peterson-Cassin, corporate power director at internet activist group Demand Progress, told Bitcoin World. “But the fact is that companies comply with different state regulations all the time. The most powerful companies in the world? Yes. Yes, you can.” This counter-argument suggests that large tech companies are well-equipped to navigate varying state laws, as they do in other industries. Opponents and cynics argue that the AI moratorium is less about fostering innovation and more about sidestepping oversight. While many states have passed AI regulations, Congress, known for its slow pace, has yet to pass any comprehensive federal AI laws. “If the federal government wants to pass strong AI safety legislation, and then preempt the states’ ability to do that, I’d be the first to be very excited about that,” said Nathan Calvin, VP of state affairs at the nonprofit Encode. “Instead, [the AI moratorium] takes away all leverage, and any ability, to force AI companies to come to the negotiating table.” Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, a vocal critic, stated in an opinion piece for The New York Times that “a 10-year moratorium is far too blunt an instrument.” He emphasized AI’s rapid advancement, predicting fundamental changes within two years. Amodei argued that without a clear federal plan, a moratorium would result in the worst outcome: no state action and no national policy. He suggested that instead of prescribing product release methods, the government should collaborate with AI companies to establish transparency standards for practices and model capabilities. The opposition isn’t limited to Democrats. Republicans like Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) are concerned about states’ rights and are working with Democrats to remove the provision. Senator Blackburn, despite her involvement in the amendment, has also criticized the provision, advocating for states’ ability to protect citizens and creative industries. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) even threatened to oppose the entire budget if the moratorium remains. A Critical Juncture for AI Governance The debate over the federal AI moratorium represents a critical juncture for AI governance in the United States. It pits the desire for rapid AI innovation and global competitiveness against the fundamental need for consumer protection and robust oversight. The outcome of the Senate’s vote-a-rama will not only shape the regulatory landscape for artificial intelligence for the next five years but also set a precedent for how federal and state governments interact in regulating rapidly evolving technologies. As the digital world continues its relentless march forward, finding a balanced approach that fosters innovation while safeguarding the public remains the paramount challenge.

Arkham Intelligence detected the transaction on June 30, involving 0.185 BTC sent to the address that holds approximately $117 billion in dormant Bitcoin. The transfer represents the second-largest donation to Satoshi’s address since February, when another user sent $200,000 following a Binance withdrawal. Arkham analysts suspect the latest transaction was either an accidental exchange withdrawal or a deliberate tribute from “ an OG Bitcoiner giving back ” to honor Bitcoin’s enigmatic founder. Source: Arkham Intelligence Historical data reveals a pattern of periodic donations to Satoshi’s addresses, with transfers ranging from $7,140 to $1.17 million over recent years. Most large transfers appear to be connected to exchange withdrawals, suggesting possible user errors rather than intentional gifts, although the motivations behind these transactions remain unclear. Satoshi’s wallet now contains the equivalent of $117 billion in Bitcoin across multiple addresses, all of which have remained untouched since the creator’s disappearance in 2011. Source: Arkham Intelligence Any movement from these addresses would likely trigger massive market volatility and intense global attention. Exchange Withdrawals Drive Mysterious Donation Pattern The latest $20,000 transfer follows a documented pattern of substantial Bitcoin donations to Satoshi Nakamoto’s addresses, with most large transactions appearing linked to cryptocurrency exchange operations. Arkham’s analysis suggests the recent transfer likely originated from an exchange or crypto service withdrawal, consistent with previous high-value donations. February’s $200,000 transfer originated from a personal wallet after the sender withdrew funds from Binance. Source: Arkham Intelligence The pattern suggests either systematic user errors during withdrawal processes or deliberate tribute payments by early Bitcoin adopters, despite Nakamoto’s 14-year absence from public communications. Historical transfer data shows significant variations in donation amounts and timing. A $1.17 million transfer occurred one year ago from address bc1***6v2, representing the largest single donation on record. This was followed by smaller amounts, including $67,790 two years ago and $41,670 three years ago. Early Bitcoin era miners have significantly reduced their selling activity, with 2025 sales dropping to just 150 BTC compared to 10,000 BTC sold in the previous year. Some analysts interpret these donations as a sign of community support for the Satoshi-era miners who helped establish Bitcoin’s initial network security. Identity Speculation Intensifies Amid Legal Battles The mystery surrounding Satoshi Nakamoto’s identity has intensified dramatically as multiple investigations, documentaries, and legal proceedings attempt to uncover the identity of Bitcoin’s creator. Recent speculation has centered on Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey , with researchers citing circumstantial evidence, including timing coincidences and connections to the cypherpunk movement. Sean Murray’s research highlighted alleged connections between Dorsey and Nakamoto, including shared interests in cryptography and references to sailors in early Bitcoin code. VanEck’s Matthew Sigel described the evidence as “ compelling and worthy of further scrutiny ,” although critics dismissed the claims as speculative without concrete proof. In the spirit of full disclosure, intellectual honesty, posterity's judgment, and rigorous debate, I would like to share my strong belief: I have become personally convinced that Jack Dorsey – CEO of Square and founder of X – is Bitcoin’s founder Satoshi Nakamoto. This is my… https://t.co/ufLhdoZEzw pic.twitter.com/kY5y3fFpby — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) February 18, 2025 At the same time, Craig Wright’s fraudulent claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto reached a definitive conclusion with his conviction for contempt of court. Judge James Mellor sentenced Wright to one year in prison , suspended for two years, after finding “overwhelming” evidence he is not Bitcoin’s creator. Legal pressure on government agencies has also escalated, with crypto lawyer James Murphy filing Freedom of Information Act lawsuits against the Department of Homeland Security. Murphy seeks documents related to claims that DHS identified and interviewed Satoshi Nakamoto in California, though the agency has never confirmed these allegations. Most interestingly, HBO filmmaker Cullen Hoback’s documentary named Canadian Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd as the creator of Bitcoin, prompting Todd to go into hiding for safety reasons. However, despite all the exciting efforts to identify Bitcoin’s creator, it has sparked controversy within the cryptocurrency community, with many questioning the ethics of attempting to expose Satoshi’s identity. HBO's documentary Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery has stirred controversy by suggesting that early Bitcoin developer @peterktodd is Satoshi Nakamoto, a claim Todd swiftly denied on social media. #SatoshiNakamoto #Bitcoin #MoneyElectric https://t.co/m7EThxd1he — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 9, 2024 Multiple attempts to identify Bitcoin’s creator have focused on prominent cypherpunks, including Nick Szabo, Hal Finney, and Len Sassaman.

Missed HPC revenue guidance, and shifting GPU market dynamics, made me less optimistic about long-term prospects later last year. A recent 75 million share offering and questionable capital allocation strategy further cloud the investment outlook, making me cautious on BTBT now. The company wants to spin out its HPC/AI subsidiary WhiteFiber via IPO. I believe shareholders would benefit from such a move. Bit Digital ( BTBT ) is one of the stocks I've covered the most for Seeking Alpha in recent years. It's also one of the few stocks that I have labeled with a 'strong buy' tag in the past. That strong buy call came last June and was predicated on the assumption that Bit Digital was a strong buyout candidate in a market that was seeing Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining stocks shift operations to HPC businesses. Bit Digital was one of the first companies to do this and to date is still one of the most successful examples of such a pivot. BTBT Calls (Seeking Alpha) More recently, I've soured a bit on the company's long-term prospects after annualized HPC revenue guidance was missed last year, market dynamics for GPU as-a-service models began to change , and Bit Digital embarked on a capital allocation strategy that I found to be questionable in my most recent piece from March. Subsequent to my March piece, we have another quarter of corporate performance and a recent capital raise to assess. Q1-25 Earnings The quarter ended-March was a fairly transformative one for Bit Digital. Not only did the company see a significant 17.4% reduction in top line revenue year over year, but the company's revenue from its Digital Asset Mining segment plummeted by 64.5% from Q1-24: Revenue Q1-25 Q1-24 YoY Digital Asset Mining $7,776,963 $21,891,760 -64.5% Cloud Services $14,842,286 $8,069,584 83.9% Colocation Services $1,644,663 $0 ETH Staking $560,641 $325,746 72.1% Other $280,567 $99,748 181.3% Total Revenue $25,105,120 $30,386,838 -17.4% Source: Bit Digital, Form 10-Q In spite of 84% year-over-year growth in revenue from Cloud Services, Bit Digital simply couldn't overcome the decline from mining to produce a positive year-over-year gain in the top line figure. For context, mining made up just 31% of Bit Digital's total revenue in Q1-25. That segment accounted for 72% of revenue in Q1-24 and 54% during the full year 2024. The decline in revenue from mining has been well telegraphed for several months. The company even stopped releasing monthly production numbers early in the year. Profit Margin Q1-25 Q1-24 YoY Digital Asset Mining 21.3% 40.7% -47.8% Cloud Services 59.0% 60.9% -3.1% Colocation Services 66.8% ETH Staking 94.2% 95.0% -0.8% Source: Bit Digital, Form 10-Q It certainly isn't a surprise to see the margin from mining collapse by 48% year over year. Q1-24 was the last full quarter of pre-halving Bitcoin production. CEO Sam Tabar has steadfastly opposed a hash-growth at any cost philosophy, and I think the transformation we're currently seeing in the company's business is proof of that. Still, there are concerns going forward. For instance, despite producing 59% gross margins in Q1-25, Bit Digital's Cloud Service revenue is still well below the $100 million annualized run rate that was expected by the end of last year. Operating income Q1-25 Q1-24 Total Revenue $25,105,120 $30,386,838 Opex Sans Digital Asset Gain/Loss -$28,268,205 -$28,960,381 Operating Income -$3,163,085 $1,426,457 Source: Bit Digital, Form 10-Q - Author's calculation Essentially, every public Bitcoin miner utilizes FASB accounting rules that allow the companies to show unrealized gains in the digital assets that they hold as income (or losses). Stripping that out from Bit Digital's report, we can see that the company flipped from positive operating income in Q1-24 to negative in Q1-25. This should be alleviated in the future as Bitcoin mining becomes a less significant driver of both COGS and revenue. That said, the company's recent capital allocation moves have been substantial. A Massive Wager On Ethereum Prior to releasing Q1 earnings, we already knew that Bit Digital was beginning to position as more of an Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) proxy than a Bitcoin proxy. The company held $91.3 million in ETH and $78.8 million in BTC at the end of January. Two months later, those figures were dramatically different: Digital Assets Quantity Cost Basis Fair Value BTC 417.6 $25,456,846 $34,474,294 ETH 24,434.20 $59,917,193 $44,556,466 Total digital assets held as of March 31, 2025 $85,374,039 $79,030,760 Source: Bit Digital, Form 10-Q At the end of January, ETH had a market value of $3,300 per coin. By the end of March, that price had been nearly cut in half, down to $1,800 per coin. This is what I said at the end of my March BTBT piece: This may be a spicy take, but if I were CEO Sam Tabar, I would completely abandon the ETH staking business entirely. There are two reasons for this. First, ETH has been a total drag on the company's digital asset value and I laid that out in the section above. That could certainly turn around, but that's far from a sure thing. The bigger issue is really simple; if Bit Digital can't rely on capital appreciation from ETH the way it can from BTC, then it would almost certainly be more beneficial for the company to deploy that capital differently. Last summer, the company had sold BTC and swapped it to ETH - that turned out to be a horrific decision with the benefit of hindsight. During Q1-25, the company sold even more BTC and hung on to its ETH. CEO Sam Tabar from the conference call: we also sold approximately $32 million worth of Bitcoin holdings during the quarter to help fund growth while managing our use of equity issuance . We did not sell any ETH during the quarter, but transferred 3,400 into an internally managed fund, which we do not count as treasury holdings. I've bolded part of the quote above because I think this is important. Leadership has openly acknowledged the poor optics associated with the size of the company's ATM relative to the market capitalization of BTBT stock. Given this, I find it strange that Bit Digital opted to raise capital through shareholder dilution to buy even more ETH. Capital Allocation & WhiteFiber IPO On June 26th, Bit Digital announced the pricing of $150 million equity raise at $2 per share for 75 million new shares of BTBT stock. Notably, the company's stock had closed at $2.35 per share the prior session. Thus, the offering came at a 15% discount to the market value of the stock just one day earlier. After underwriter fees, the company receives $142.5 million, with use of proceeds going toward purchasing ETH. It's hard for me to view this favorably for three reasons. Bit Digital just sold Digital Assets to fund growth rather than issuing equity, only to turn around just a couple months later and issue equity to buy Digital Assets. It's a rather striking 180. While the company's ETH staking is its best business segment by gross margin, the revenue from the segment is by far the smallest of four dis-aggregated business lines. Furthermore, the staking business may not be intense from an opex standpoint, but it does tie up a considerable amount of capital for a very small percentage of top line revenue. This move essentially triples down on a capital allocation strategy that hasn't been working. Namely, allowing Bit Digital's equity valuation to be dependent on a risk asset that has weak sentiment and arguably deteriorating fundamentals. All while the company wants to raise through an active ATM. In the prospectus, Bit Digital expressed conviction in the Ethereum ecosystem and specifically mentioned legislation around stablecoins in the US as cause for optimism: Given increased regulatory clarity, including the recently passed GENIUS Act, we view ETH as a digitally native store of value and foundational infrastructure for decentralized applications and stablecoins. Accordingly, we intend to grow our ETH position over time, supported by staking rewards. Looking past the fact that the GENIUS Act has actually not been passed yet by the House of Representatives, I see it as a risky move to further tie the valuation of the company to an asset that Bit Digital can't ultimately control rather than focusing on raising that capital to fund growth of WhiteFiber. On the latter, it's very interesting to me that Bit Digital is trying to spin out WhiteFiber. As a wholly owned subsidiary of Bit Digital, WhiteFiber submitted a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a proposed IPO. Share count and pricing of such an IPO have yet to be determined. But this would seem to be an attempt to get the same kind of value on its data center business that the market is currently giving companies like Core Scientific ( CORZ ) or IREN Limited ( IREN ) - each of which actually had less HPC/AI revenue than Bit Digital in Q1 yet continue to trade a much larger forward sales multiples than that of BTBT: Data by YCharts To some degree, I suspect the lack of apparent HPC respect for BTBT relative to peers is due to the company having such a large allocation to ETH. For those who would rather see Bit Digital focus capital on scaling cloud services, these ETH purchases are perhaps frustrating. But in the event WhiteFiber does IPO and is successfully spun out of BTBT, holding BTBT is perhaps warranted. Valuation And Assets Per the offering prospectus, there would be an estimated 283.5 million BTBT common shares outstanding following completion of the offering. By my math, that dilutes the current holder base by roughly 36%. And at a $2.19 share close on June 30th, Bit Digital has an implied valuation of $621 million at that 283.5 million shares count. Following the $150 million capital raise, Bit Digital will have about $204 million in ETH, $45 million in BTC, $297 million in non-current assets, and $99 million in combined cash and 'other current assets' as of Q1-25. Short of an absolute collapse in the price of Ethereum, stock price downside from here should be somewhat limited, provided the company doesn't continue to aggressively dilute. Closing Summary I think a WhiteFiber IPO would be a good thing for both Bit Digital and Bit Digital shareholders. It will allow the market to pick between two very different business models currently operated by one parent company. Given the substantial rallies we've seen from stocks like CoreWeave, Core Scientific, and IREN Limited on the proposed buyout of Core Scientific by CoreWeave, there's no reason Bit Digital shouldn't benefit from spinning out its HPC/AI subsidiary - especially given the segment revenue its doing relative to some of those other stocks mentioned. Having said all of this, I'm a bit concerned about Bit Digital's Ethereum reliance. Despite being well off its coin price highs, Ethereum is far from cheap on a circulating P/F ratio. A re-rating lower in ETH would severely impact Bit Digital's stock valuation. I'll reiterate the 'hold.'",ETH-USD|BTBT,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|BTC|MINING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-07-01 09:34:42

Kim Kwang Jin, Kang Tae Bok, Jong Pong Ju, and Chang Nam Il were indicted on charges of wire fraud and money laundering for infiltrating blockchain firms and stealing cryptocurrency, a recent press release from the DOJ noted. The four North Korean nationals, operating under false identities, were able to secure remote employment at blockchain companies in the U.S. and Serbia, gaining privileged access to digital assets, which they later exploited for illicit financial gain. Roughly $1 million stolen According to authorities, between 2020 and 2022, Kim and Jong posed as remote IT developers for an Atlanta-based blockchain startup and a Serbian token company. To conceal their North Korean nationality, they submitted fabricated and stolen identification documents, including documents bearing the identities of real individuals. Prosecutors said the fraudulent materials enabled them to bypass background checks and gain the trust of their employers. Once embedded within these firms, the defendants gained access to sensitive infrastructure and cryptocurrency assets. In February 2022, Jong reportedly siphoned off $175,000 in crypto from his employer’s systems. The following month, Kim allegedly modified the smart contract source code to steal approximately $740,000. The stolen funds were then funnelled through mixing services and transferred to exchange accounts held by Kang and Chang, who operated under Malaysian aliases and used fraudulent identity documents to open those accounts. The start of the multi-year campaign can be traced back to 2019 when the group relocated to the United Arab Emirates to coordinate operations. By late 2020, Kim Kwang Jin used the stolen identity of a US citizen, referred to as P.S., to get hired as a remote developer at a blockchain firm based in Atlanta. Around the same time, Jong Pong Ju, using the alias “Bryan Cho,” secured a similar role at a Serbian token company. After gaining the company’s trust, Jong recommended a new candidate, “Peter Xiao,” for another developer role. The company accepted the referral and hired him, unaware that “Peter Xiao” was actually Chang Nam Il, another North Korean operative. This step-by-step recruitment allowed multiple members of the group to embed themselves within the target companies, increasing their access and control over internal systems. DOJ officials said the charges are part of the department’s broader DPRK RevGen: Domestic Enabler Initiative, launched in 2024 to disrupt North Korea’s revenue-generating cyber operations and target those aiding them within the US Federal agents also conducted related operations in recent months, including raids across 16 states that resulted in the seizure of nearly 30 financial accounts, 200 computers, and over 20 fraudulent websites tied to DPRK-linked IT workers. Authorities said these so-called “laptop farms” helped North Korean operatives appear to be working from US locations, further legitimizing their employment profiles. North Korean hackers are a major threat to crypto North Korean hackers have been responsible for stealing over $3 billion in cryptocurrency in recent years, according to estimates from US federal agencies and independent cybersecurity researchers. Earlier this year, the US, Japan, and South Korea released a joint statement urging blockchain firms to review hiring practices and monitor for social engineering tactics used by North Korean actors. Despite ongoing sanctions, North Korea has continued to exploit the remote work ecosystem to bypass financial restrictions and channel funds into weapons development. The US Treasury has estimated that DPRK IT workers collectively generate hundreds of millions of dollars each year, with up to 90% of wages seized by the regime.

The latest announcement from Meta AI signals a profound reorientation of its efforts, aiming for nothing less than artificial superintelligence. This strategic pivot by Mark Zuckerberg has significant implications, not just for the future of AI development , but potentially for the entire digital economy, including how we interact with and secure our digital assets. Meta AI’s Ambitious Restructuring: What Does It Mean? In a move that underscores its commitment to leading the frontier of artificial intelligence, Meta has officially restructured its various AI initiatives under a new, unified division: Meta Superintelligence Labs . This significant organizational change, revealed in an internal memo, consolidates all of Meta’s AI teams into a single powerhouse unit. The primary objective is clear: to accelerate the pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and ultimately, superintelligence. This restructuring isn’t merely an internal shuffle; it represents a bold declaration of intent from one of the world’s largest technology companies. By centralizing its AI resources, Meta aims to foster greater collaboration, streamline research and development, and expedite the creation of advanced AI systems that could redefine human-computer interaction. Leading the Charge: Who Heads Meta Superintelligence Labs? The success of such an ambitious undertaking hinges on strong leadership, and Meta has brought in key figures to steer Meta Superintelligence Labs . Alexandr Wang, the visionary former CEO of data labeling startup Scale AI, has been appointed as the chief AI officer for this new group. Wang’s expertise in data infrastructure and AI training will be pivotal in building the foundational capabilities required for superintelligence. Partnering with Wang is Nat Friedman, the former CEO of GitHub, who will oversee Meta’s AI products and applied research. This combination of leadership, blending deep technical expertise with product-oriented vision, suggests a comprehensive approach to not only research groundbreaking AI but also integrate it into Meta’s vast ecosystem of platforms and services. Their aim is to ensure that the advanced AI development from the labs translates into tangible products and experiences for users. Mark Zuckerberg’s Aggressive Strategy in the AGI Race Mark Zuckerberg has been transparent about his ambition to lead the AGI Race . This latest restructuring is a culmination of several aggressive moves aimed at securing Meta’s position at the forefront of AI innovation. Zuckerberg’s strategy involves two key pillars: Strategic Acquisitions and Investments: Earlier this month, Meta made a substantial investment of $14.3 billion in Scale AI. This investment was not just financial; it also facilitated the onboarding of Alexandr Wang, a critical talent for the new Superintelligence Labs. Such large-scale investments demonstrate Meta’s willingness to commit significant resources to its AI goals. Talent Acquisition: Beyond company acquisitions, Meta has actively lured top AI researchers from competitors. The report indicates that Meta has successfully recruited 11 new AI researchers. Notably, this includes Pei Sun, a principal researcher from Google DeepMind, and Joel Pobar, an engineer from Anthropic. These hires are crucial as they bring diverse expertise and cutting-edge knowledge from leading AI labs directly into Meta’s new unit. This aggressive talent acquisition strategy reflects the competitive nature of the AI landscape. Companies are not just vying for technological breakthroughs but also for the human capital capable of achieving them. Zuckerberg’s direct involvement in securing these talents underscores the strategic importance of AI development to Meta’s long-term vision. Understanding AI Development: From Current Models to Superintelligence The term “superintelligence” might sound like science fiction, but it represents the ultimate goal of many AI research efforts. To understand Meta’s ambition, it helps to differentiate between various stages of AI: AI Stage Description Examples Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) AI designed for specific tasks. Excels in its narrow domain but lacks broader understanding. Voice assistants (Siri, Alexa), recommendation algorithms, spam filters. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) AI with human-level cognitive abilities across a wide range of tasks. Can learn, understand, and apply knowledge like a human. Currently theoretical; a major research goal for many leading AI labs. Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) AI that surpasses human intelligence in virtually every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom, and social skills. Highly theoretical; Meta’s stated long-term objective for Superintelligence Labs. Meta’s establishment of Superintelligence Labs signifies a direct leap towards the most advanced forms of AI. While the path to AGI and ASI is fraught with challenges, including ethical considerations, computational demands, and theoretical hurdles, Meta is clearly positioning itself to be a frontrunner in this transformative journey. The investment in talent and infrastructure reflects a belief that these stages are not just possible but inevitable, and that being a leader in this domain is critical for future technological dominance. What Are the Implications of This AI Development for the Digital World and the AGI Race? Meta’s intensified focus on AI development , particularly towards superintelligence, carries significant implications for the broader digital ecosystem. For the cryptocurrency and blockchain communities, these developments could manifest in several ways: Enhanced Security and Efficiency: Advanced AI could revolutionize cryptographic methods, enhance blockchain network security, and optimize transaction processing, leading to more robust and efficient decentralized systems. New Digital Asset Applications: Superintelligent AI could power sophisticated decentralized applications (dApps), create more intelligent smart contracts, and enable novel forms of digital ownership and interaction within metaverses. Economic and Social Shifts: The emergence of highly capable AI could accelerate automation, redefine labor markets, and shift economic power structures. Understanding these dynamics will be crucial for adapting digital asset strategies. Ethical and Governance Challenges: As AI becomes more powerful, questions of bias, control, and accountability become paramount. The crypto community, with its emphasis on decentralization and transparency, might play a role in shaping ethical AI governance models. This push by Meta highlights the accelerating pace of technological change in the AGI Race . The interplay between advanced AI and decentralized technologies will likely define the next era of the internet, demanding continuous adaptation and innovation from all stakeholders. Conclusion: Meta’s Bold Leap into the Future of AI Meta’s restructuring of its AI unit under the new Superintelligence Labs marks a pivotal moment in the company’s history and the broader landscape of artificial intelligence. With Mark Zuckerberg at the helm, aggressively acquiring top talent and investing substantial capital, Meta is unequivocally signaling its intent to lead the charge in the AGI Race and beyond. The creation of Superintelligence Labs, led by industry stalwarts like Alexandr Wang and Nat Friedman, positions Meta AI to make significant strides in AI development . While the journey to artificial superintelligence is complex and filled with both promise and potential pitfalls, Meta’s strategic commitment underscores the transformative power of AI. This development is not just about building smarter machines; it’s about shaping the very future of digital interaction, commerce, and human potential, impacting everything from how we work to how we engage with decentralized digital assets.

He claims that tens of millions of dollars have been funneled through the stablecoin with little to no intervention from the issuer. However, he also went on to hit Ripple’s RLUSD over its user base. This comes in when the USDC stablecoin issuer recently applied to establish a national trust bank in the United States in order to oversee its reserve. Circle had a successful initial public offering (IPO) in June, as the company was valued at around $18 billion. Ripple inflates RLUSD adoption? In a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter), ZachXBT accused Circle of turning a blind eye to illicit flows, calling it “a crime super cycle where no one cares.” The On-chain sleuth stated that USDC is being widely used by North Korean IT workers to receive payments and claimed that recent related transactions reached tens of millions of dollars. ZachXBT criticized the stablecoin issuer for claiming to be “compliant” while taking no action to freeze or monitor the funds. Amid the controversy, one XRP supporter suggested switching to Ripple’s new stablecoin RLUSD as a potentially safer alternative. ZachXBT pushed back, stating: “I trust Circle, Paxos, or Tether infinitely more than Ripple.” He mentioned that, unlike Circle or Tether, which at least have a base of organic users, Ripple has a history of “misrepresenting paid partnerships to make it appear like adoption.” They all at least have organic users whereas Ripple does not and theirs comes from misrepresenting paid partnerships to make it appear like adoption. — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) July 1, 2025 When asked why he was still defending USDC despite its alleged links to North Korea, ZachXBT reiterated his position in a post . He asserted that RLUSD is “asset-backed and issued by a so-called trusted American powerhouse,” but ultimately lacks credibility due to what he characterizes as Ripple’s artificial growth tactics. The issue ties into broader geopolitical concerns as North Korea’s Lazarus Group, a state-sponsored hacking unit, has been linked to numerous high-profile crypto heists. As crypto adoption grows, G7 countries have increasingly prioritized coordinated action against North Korean cyber operations. The debate unfolds when Circle’s CRCL stock faces mounting selling pressure. It is down 28% over the past week. Market watchers are closely eyeing how regulators respond to Circle’s ambitions to become a licensed US bank. CRCL traded at a price of $181.29 in the last session. USDT and USDC dominate stablecoin scene The stablecoin market is on a surge, smashing $263 billion mark in cap and a 24 hour trading volume of over $62.4 billion. Tether’s USDT is leading the tally while holding a market cap of more than $157 billion. Circle’s USDC stands second in the tally with a cap of over $61 billion. Ripple’s RLUSD can be seen way in the tally as it is still in its initial phase of booming. RLUSD holds a market cap of around $455 million, which looks like a tiny number in front of the leaders. However, its native coin, XRP, has gained much in recent times due to a partial win in the lawsuit against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). XRP price remained up by 3% over the past 30 days. XRP is trading at an average price of $2.20 at the press time. Its 24 hour trading volume is up by 116% to stand at $4.12 billion.

Price action has failed multiple breakout attempts above the $0.63–$0.66 zone, which aligns with the trendline resistance from early May. Repeated breakdowns from lower highs indicate persistent seller dominance, with each rebound facing steep rejections near supply zones. Currently, PI is testing the lower boundary of a longer-term demand region between $0.46 and $0.49. This level held as short-term support during multiple retracements in June. A close below this zone could initiate a deeper pullback toward $0.40 or even $0.36, while any bullish reversal would first need to clear $0.53 and then $0.60.

This follows a sharp rise in digital asset trading, which hit a record RM13.9 billion ($2.9 billion) in 2024, more than double the volume recorded in 2023. According to the consultation paper released by the commission, the proposed updates aim to reduce time-to-market for new tokens while enhancing governance, investor protection, and platform resilience. Public Consultation: Enhancing the Digital Asset Exchange (DAX) Framework Consultation is open 30 June – 11 August 2025. Full media release: https://t.co/uQPeQadh7B Consultation Paper: https://t.co/AGXjbEamRW Questions? Email us at aFINity@seccom.com.my pic.twitter.com/FyQiY5UWFe — SC Malaysia (@SecComMalaysia) June 30, 2025 Notably, Malaysia’s digital asset market has grown significantly since the DAX framework was introduced in 2019. The surge in trading volume in 2024 was linked to growing interest from both retail investors and institutional participants. The SC also highlighted increasing involvement from traditional capital market intermediaries, who are gaining exposure to crypto assets through direct investment and fund-based channels. Malaysia Proposes Faster Listings with Eligibility Criteria Among Other Reforms Under the proposed reforms, certain tokens may be listed on regulated DAX platforms without first securing the SC’s approval. This change would only apply to digital assets that meet predefined eligibility standards. According to the regulator, it seeks to cut down regulatory delays and allow exchanges to respond more quickly to market demand. At the same time, DAX operators would bear greater responsibility for ensuring that listed assets comply with legal and risk requirements. The SC also plans to introduce enhanced governance obligations. DAX operators would be required to segregate client assets from their own operational funds. This move seeks to prevent misuse and bolster trust among users. SC also noted that operational control standards would also be upgraded to reflect the unique risks of trading digital assets. This includes more stringent oversight of internal processes and improved risk management systems. Another key aspect of the proposal is raising financial thresholds for licensed DAX operators. The SC said the changes are intended to reinforce the operational and financial resilience of exchanges. Stronger capital requirements would help ensure that platforms can withstand market shocks and fulfill obligations to clients. The regulator believes this will boost investor confidence and contribute to a more stable trading environment. Malaysia Ramps Up Crypto Reform Efforts Amid Surge in Mining-Linked Power Theft and Regulatory Gaps The consultation period runs from June 30 to August 11, 2025 and notably, these proposed changes form part of the SC’s broader strategy to keep Malaysia’s digital asset ecosystem competitive and secure. The consultation comes amid wider government efforts to position Malaysia at the forefront of responsible fintech innovation. In March 2025, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) announced plans to explore asset tokenization and digital asset technologies. Malaysia's central bank will explore asset tokenization and digital assets, collaborating with the private sector on potential use cases for tokenized deposits and CBDCs. #BankNegaraMalaysia #CBDC https://t.co/FAnsrg2yY6 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 24, 2025 This will focus on collaboration with the private sector and use cases such as tokenized deposits and CBDCs, as outlined in its 2022-2026 financial sector blueprint. Despite its progressive stance, the central bank cautioned that cryptocurrencies are still not legal tender due to their risks. This cautious approach was echoed in the SC’s recent enforcement actions, which targeted unlicensed foreign crypto exchanges such as Bybit and Huobi Global for operating without registration. Malaysia has directed @Bybit_Official to disable its website and mobile applications in the country, citing enforcement actions against the exchange. #Bybit #Malaysia https://t.co/RfuIef4vLE — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 30, 2024 Continuous crypto regulations in Malaysia is understandable as crypto scams and theft surge.

Dekabank, which is owned by Sparkassen, has been chosen to manage this new crypto service through the Sparkasse app, according to a Bloomberg report. The German Savings Banks Association (DSGV) stated that the Savings Banks Finance Group will offer “reliable access to a regulated crypto offering.” The DSGV also noted that the crypto service addresses existing demand and is covered under the European Union’s MiCA regulatory framework for crypto, which became effective in December. As more financial firms embrace crypto, early-stage projects such as Bitcoin Pepe are expected to benefit. The project is continuing strength in its presale. Shifting stance on Crypto in German banking Previously, Sparkassen executives had dismissed crypto-related services due to concerns about volatility and risk. The banking group also restricted crypto purchases for all customers in 2015. Despite this shift in direction, the DSGV reportedly emphasized that its “position remains clear, cryptocurrencies are highly speculative investments.” It was also stated that there would be no advertising for the new service, and customers would be informed about potential risks, including “potential for total loss.” Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe encompasses over 50 million customers and 500 companies, including more than 370 savings banks, with total aggregated assets under management exceeding 2.5 trillion euros ($2.9 trillion). Filipp Bolotov, founder and CEO of ERA Labs, commented on Sparkassen’s move into crypto, calling it a “big move for mainstream adoption.” Similarly, Kyle Chasse, a crypto venture capitalist and founder of Master Ventures, remarked that “banks are catching up.” Other German banks have also begun integrating crypto services. In September 2024, Germany’s second-largest financial institution, DZ Bank, partnered with Boerse Stuttgart Digital for a crypto service pilot. It planned to introduce trading and custody services to its network of 700 cooperative banks following an initial testing phase. Additionally, Germany’s largest federal bank, Landesbank Baden-Württemberg, announced in April of the previous year that it would offer crypto custody solutions to institutional clients in collaboration with Bitpanda, an Austria-based crypto exchange. Bitcoin Pepe makes new waves in crypto Bitcoin Pepe is establishing a unique position within the cryptocurrency market by integrating viral appeal with infrastructure development. This project operates as a Layer 2 solution, leveraging Bitcoin’s underlying security while aiming for scalability comparable to networks like Solana. This strategy differentiates it from many meme-centric cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin Pepe, noted as the first meme-focused Layer 2 solution built on Bitcoin, is also expanding its reach through strategic partnerships. These collaborations span various sectors, including gaming, content creation, decentralized finance (DeFi), and fair launch infrastructure. The objective of these partnerships is to cultivate an ecosystem where the BPEP token offers cross-chain utility and cultural relevance. Such alliances are intended to boost visibility and adoption, reflecting growing support for the PEP-20 token standard from both institutional entities and the wider community. The project’s infrastructure-focused approach appears to be attracting investor interest, with its ongoing presale having already secured over $16.2 million. Further contributing to its momentum are confirmed listings on the MEXC and BitMart exchanges. The project team is scheduled to make the final listing announcement on July 31st.

Meanwhile, the broader cryptocurrency market is also reflecting the uncertainty as the majority of altcoins are trading in the red with some charting a lot bigger declines than others. Bitcoin Price Waits for News The deep involvement of corporate Bitcoin buyers and institutions has surely played a major role in its price increase over the past year but it’s also the reason why the crypto market has been largely correlated to traditional ones. A few years ago, literally nobody cared about metrics such as CPI, PMI, and whatnot, but now every crypto trader has them on their watchlist. As such, today is also shaping up to be a volatile experience with a few important economic events on the calendar. First, Jerome Powell will speak in the afternoon, followed by data for job openings, PMI, and ISM manufacturing – all indicators that shape policymaking, especially when gauging the strenght of the local economy. That said, Bitocin’s price is down about 1% on the day and is currently trading at around $106,500 after having tested $109,000 yesterday. It’s interesting to see if the bulls have it in them to push bakc towards the upper boundary of the recent trading range or if the bears will send the price back below $105K. Source: TradingView Altcoins in Red, Some More Than Others As you can clearly see in the heatmap below, the altcoins are also not having a great day. This is, perhaps, to be expected – Bitcoin’s dominance over the market has been rising gradually over the past many months and whenever BTC slips, altcoins crash. The past 24 hours have hardly been a crash, though, but it’s clear that most of them are charting more considerable declines. This is especially true for TKX, ARB, SPX6900, SEI, and others, that are down between 8% and 15% on the day. Believe it or not, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is today’s best performer, gaining more than 6%.

On Monday, Malaysia’s Securities Commission has released a consultation paper proposing significant updates to its regulations for digital asset exchanges (DAX). Key changes include permitting certain digital assets to be listed on DAX platforms without the SC’s prior approval, provided they satisfy set eligibility criteria. The regulator also plans stricter governance and operational requirements for exchange operators, such as mandatory segregation of client assets and higher financial thresholds. The SC is collecting public feedback on the proposals from stakeholders across the industry, including issuers, exchanges, financial institutions, and legal professionals. The consultation period will run from June 30 to August 11. You might also like: Malaysia’s Securities Commission cracks down on Bybit for operating without registration The proposed reforms build on the SC’s earlier efforts to tighten oversight of the digital asset industry and ensure market integrity. They follow a series of enforcement actions against unlicensed crypto exchanges operating in Malaysia without the regulator’s Recognised Market Operator (RMO) status, as required under the Capital Markets and Services Act 2007. In December last year, the SC took action against Bybit and its chief executive, ordering them to cease all operations and marketing in Malaysia for running an unlicensed digital asset platform. In 2023, the SC ordered Huobi Global to cease operations in Malaysia for failing to register as an RMO. The proposed DAX reforms also come at a time of significant growth in Malaysia’s digital asset sector since the introduction of the DAX framework in 2019. In 2024, trading volumes soared to a record RM13.9 billion ($2.9 billion), more than doubling compared to the previous year. According to the SC, there has been increased participation from institutional investors and traditional capital market intermediaries, both through direct investments and fund-based exposure.

According to data from crypto.news, Arbitrum ( ARB ) fell over 13% over the past 24 hours, trading at $0.32 while its market cap was seated at $1.61 billion. ARB’s price tumbled shortly after U.S.-based trading platform Robinhood confirmed its highly anticipated partnership with Arbitrum during an event it was hosting in Cannes. The collaboration will see the Layer-2 network project build the Robinhood Chain, a blockchain infrastructure that will reportedly enable EU-based users to trade U.S. equities onchain. Much of the news had already been priced in by investors after Robinhood teased the announcement on June 29, revealing that one of its top executives and A.J. Warner, CSO of Offchain Labs , the developers behind Arbitrum, would appear together on a panel during yesterday’s event. You might also like: Will Solana price rally after the launch of its first spot ETF? ARB initially surged 46% to $0.38 within eight hours of the teaser, but has since dropped nearly 16%, suggesting a textbook “sell-the-news” event, where traders front-run expected bullish news and then exit positions post-announcement to lock in profits. According to Nansen, the sharp downturn may have been accelerated by heavy selling from verified public figures and influencers. Their cumulative ARB holdings dropped by 95.8% in the past day, now standing at just 784 tokens. Such moves are often perceived by retail traders as bearish signals, reinforcing broader sell pressure. Source: Nansen These conditions have yet to ease, as Nansen data also shows that ARB exchange balances have increased by 17% over the past week, indicating continued inflows to trading platforms likely intended for selling. ARB price analysis On the 4-hour/USDT chart, Arbitrum (ARB) is showing multiple bearish technical signals that point to a likely continuation of its downward trajectory. The 50-day Simple Moving Average appears to be on the verge of crossing below the 200-day SMA, a formation commonly referred to as a “death cross.” Such a pattern is widely regarded by traders as a strong bearish indicator, often preceding extended periods of price weakness. ARB 50-day and 200-day SMA chart — July 1 | Source: crypto.news Momentum indicators further support the bearish outlook. The MACD line has crossed below the signal line, typically interpreted as a sell signal that reflects waning bullish momentum. In addition, the Chaikin Money Flow index has dropped sharply from 0.45 to 0.08, which signals a significant reduction in buying pressure and a possible shift toward net capital outflows. ARB MACD and CMF chart — July 1 | Source: crypto.news Given these confluences, ARB is likely to continue its decline toward the immediate support level at $0.31.

According to ZachXBT, North Korean IT workers have been using USDC ( USDC ) to move millions in illicit payments. The on-chain analyst’s comments came in response to Circle’s recent filing for a national trust bank charter, which would authorize the firm to manage the reserves backing USD Coin. ZachXBT criticized Circle ’s handling of the situation, alleging that despite the scale and visibility of the fund flows, the company has taken no steps to curb the activity or freeze any of the wallets involved. “They currently do nothing to detect / freeze the activity while boasting about compliance,” he wrote. Circle / USDC is the primary infra used by DPRK IT workers to facilitate payments. They currently do NOTHNG to detect / freeze the activity while boasting about compliance.

This is a tactic that has become widely flagged by security experts as one of the group’s latest methods for stealing funds and information. ZachXBT claimed to have identified high eight-figure volumes flowing through these wallets recently, most of it in USDC.

Earlier this year, the firm went public under the same compliance narrative and earned praise for setting a positive regulatory precedent within the industry. Circle’s reported failure to take action also contrasts sharply with how Tether and other stablecoin issuers have responded in similar cases, freezing wallets and blocking suspicious fund movements. While the issuer has yet to publicly deny or acknowledge the allegations, the reports of allowing sanctioned actors to operate unchecked deal a major blow to its reputation. crypto.news reached out to Circle for comment but has yet to receive a response as of press time.

According to a press release sent to crypto.news, the crypto card is available directly through the Bitget Wallet app and supports real-time payments through on-chain swaps and deposit features. It allows users to make payments directly through digital wallets at more than 150 merchants worldwide that accept Mastercard payments. The new crypto cards will first be released in select regions, starting with the United Kingdom and the European Union . The firms plan to expand its utility to parts of Latin America , Australia and New Zealand in the next few months following its launch. Making use of the payment giant’s “Digital First” feature, users can apply for digital cards and receive theirs within minutes. Once the request is approved, the card will be added to their mobile wallets , ready for use at physical and online merchants. Supported by Mastercard-licensed issuer, Immersve, transactions are settled on-chain by directly converting crypto into fiat.

Pepe (PEPE) was among the hardest hit, falling 18% over the week and 8.22% in 24 hours, dropping to $0.0000092—erasing gains from its May high of $0.0000167. This re-added a zero to its price, signaling weakening investor confidence. Despite the bearish trend, technical indicators show that a relief rally may be possible if PEPE breaks above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. With a market cap of $3.71 billion and $765 million in 24-hour trading volume, PEPE remains vulnerable unless sentiment shifts. Traders who chased short-term surges are now grappling with deep losses and a lack of utility behind their tokens. It’s a cycle the market has seen before—but this time, it’s driving smarter money toward platforms that offer real financial mechanisms, passive income, and sustainable token models. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently in Phase 5 of its presale at $0.03 per token, is gaining attention for delivering exactly what most meme coins lack: utility and yield. With over $11.3 million already raised and more than 12,600 holders, this early-stage DeFi project is creating meaningful opportunities for users to lend, borrow, and earn. It’s more than just a platform—it’s a system built to support advanced use cases, including meme coin lending through a unique Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model. While PEPE holders are watching red candles, early MUTM backers are preparing for real-world lending use, Layer-2 speed, and a beta launch that will coincide with token listing. Lend PEPE, Earn MUTM: Where Memes Meet Mechanism Unlike traditional protocols that ignore volatile tokens, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating dedicated lanes for high-risk assets like Pepe (PEPE), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Shiba Inu (SHIB) through its upcoming P2P lending engine. Users will be able to list meme tokens as collateral and negotiate custom loan terms with lenders—setting rates, durations, and collateral ratios on a case-by-case basis. This functionality allows traders to unlock capital without dumping their tokens, preserving exposure while gaining liquidity. This P2P approach will exist alongside a more traditional Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending model. In this setup, users can deposit stablecoins like USDT into smart contracts and receive mtTokens such as mtUSDT in return. These mtTokens will accrue interest based on pool usage and can even be staked to earn additional protocol dividends. For example, someone who deposits $10,000 in USDT and receives mtUSDT could see that grow by over $1,500 in a year if pool utilization drives APY around 15%. Meanwhile, borrowers using the P2C route will be able to access loans backed by Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), or ChainLink (LINK)—enabling flexible, overcollateralized borrowing with adjustable interest terms. The protocol will ensure risk management through liquidation safeguards. A borrower who posts $1,000 worth of ETH, for instance, will be able to borrow up to 75% of that value (depending on LTV ratio). If the collateral’s value drops below a required threshold, the loan will be liquidated to protect the pool and prevent bad debt. Early Whales Move In as $100K Giveaway and Layer-2 Upgrade Build Momentum Large wallets are already signaling confidence. On-chain activity shows one user moving $90,000 worth of ETH into MUTM, anticipating a rerating once Phase 6 begins and the price increases. At the current $0.03 token price, a $9,000 investment would grow to $180,000 with a 20x surge—a target analysts consider realistic given the project’s growth trajectory and upcoming tokenomics rollout. Part of what’s accelerating interest is the protocol’s Layer-2 architecture. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being built to operate with lower fees and faster speeds, solving two of DeFi’s biggest issues: transaction cost and congestion. This makes it ideal not just for long-term holders, but also for high-frequency lenders and borrowers seeking efficient access to liquidity. The team’s roadmap also includes the launch of a beta version by the time the token goes live. This roll-out will introduce the protocol’s decentralized stablecoin—an overcollateralized asset designed to hold its peg via algorithmic interest rate controls and smart contract mint/burn mechanics. This feature will further enhance treasury reliability, offering even more lending stability. Adding to the excitement, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is running a $100,000 giveaway to reward early believers. Ten winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens—an incentive designed to spotlight users who are helping shape the platform’s launch. The project’s CertiK audit, with a 95.00 Token Scan Score and 77 Skynet Score, further affirms its credibility. Backed by over 10,000 Twitter followers and robust on-chain engagement, this DeFi newcomer isn’t chasing hype—it’s building a system. And as PEPE and other meme coins continue to bleed value, more investors are shifting to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) not out of fear, but conviction.

BitMine Immersion Technologies (NYSE American: BMNR) on 30 June priced a $250 million private placement of 55,555,556 new shares at $4.50 each and appointed Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee as chairman. The company’s SEC filing and press release make the purpose explicit: all net proceeds will be used to acquire and stake ether, a move management likens to Michael Saylor’s now-legendary Bitcoin strategy at MicroStrategy. Tom Lee Goes Full MicroStrategy On Ethereum Speaking hours later on CNBC’s Squawk Box, Lee framed the pivot as a logical response to the explosive growth of stablecoins, most of which settle on Ethereum. “Stablecoins, which is the ChatGPT of crypto, because it’s viral adoption by consumers, businesses, banks and now even Visa,” he said, underscoring why a treasury heavy in ETH could become strategically indispensable. Ethereum’s proof-of-stake design means that large holders who validate blocks “secure the fidelity of stablecoins,” Lee continued. “When Goldman issues a stablecoin and JP Morgan [issues] it on Ethereum as a layer-one blockchain, they’re going to want to secure it by staking Ethereum.” Related Reading: Top Analyst Predicts Major Ethereum Rally Toward $4,000 As Shorts Hit All-Time Highs Lee tied the long-term upside to macro numbers the US Treasury itself has started to cite. Stablecoins today hover around $250 billion; Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently suggested the figure could hit $2 trillion—a potential ten-fold expansion that, in Lee’s words, would “insure dollar dominance.” Because Ethereum already underpins more than half of stable-value tokens, a multi-trillion-dollar stablecoin market would translate directly into rising transaction fees for the network and, by extension, higher staking rewards for BitMine’s planned validator clusters. The private-placement syndicate reads like a who’s-who roster from both TradFi and crypto: MOZAYYX led the round, joined by Founders Fund, Pantera, FalconX, Republic Digital, Kraken, Galaxy Digital, Digital Currency Group, Diametric Capital and Occam Crest. Closing is expected on or about 3 July, subject to NYSE American approval. BitMine, headquartered in Las Vegas, will immediately deploy the ETH position into staking, giving the miner a yield-bearing balance-sheet asset while reinforcing Ethereum’s security budget. “One of the key performance metrics for BitMine going forward is to increase the value of ETH held per share,” chief executive Jonathan Bates said in the statement. For investors, the comparison with MicroStrategy is unavoidable but imperfect. Saylor’s company amassed bitcoin under a proof-of-work regime that offers no native yield; BitMine’s ether can generate income through both staking rewards and potential capital-markets transactions collateralized by those staked coins. Related Reading: Strong Ethereum Accumulation Detected: LTH Buying Heavy During June Consolidation Yet both strategies share a central bet: that a scarce digital asset sitting at the core of global finance will appreciate faster than cash alternatives on a corporate balance sheet. Whether BitMine achieves MicroStrategy-level returns will depend on execution, regulatory clarity for staking, and—most of all—Ethereum’s price path. What is clear, however, is that corporate treasuries are beginning to see ether not merely as “gas” for decentralized applications but as a strategic reserve asset in its own right. From a market-structure vantage, the new treasury model could translate into meaningful price torque for Ether if it scales. MicroStrategy’s serial purchases have now absorbed nearly 600,000 BTC—around 2.8 percent of the 21 million-coin cap—and coincided with Bitcoin’s ascent from roughly $11,000 in August 2020, when the company made its first buy, to more than $107,000 today, a near-ten-fold move. BitMine’s opening salvo—$250 million, or about 100,000 ETH at current prices—represents barely 0.08 percent of Ethereum’s 122 million-coin supply, yet roughly 28 percent of that supply is already locked in staking contracts while net issuance has turned negative post-EIP-1559, shrinking the freely tradable float. If even a handful of additional balance sheets emulate this “ETH-as-reserve” playbook, the resulting demand shock could replicate the supply-squeeze dynamics that propelled Bitcoin into six-figure territory. At press time, Ether traded at $2,459.

Many in the XRP community had hoped this would signal the end of the legal battle, but experts now say that a final resolution could still take several weeks, or even longer. However, following the news of Ripple dropping the case , XRP gained 5% jump, while as of now it is down again, as there is still no clarity if the SEC will also drop the appeal. While the community has high hopes from the SEC dropping the case, the lawyer says there is more to the story. Here’s the latest update on the much awaited Ripple vs SEC case . Appeal Dismissal Process Not Instant Former SEC attorney Marc Fagel has clarified that the process for officially dismissing the SEC’s appeal is not immediate. The SEC first needs to vote internally to proceed with the dismissal. After that, both Ripple and the SEC must submit the necessary paperwork to formally dismiss their respective appeals. Only once these steps are completed will the district court’s earlier ruling fully go into effect. This procedural backlog means the outcome of the case is still pending, and there is currently no confirmed timeline. While there’s a chance the process could be expedited, Fagel suggested that “several weeks” is a more realistic expectation. Ripple Community Pins Hope on July 3 Meeting Adding to the speculation, an upcoming closed-door SEC meeting scheduled for July 3 has stirred fresh hopes within the XRP community. Some believe this meeting could mark a turning point, potentially leading to the final dismissal of the case against Ripple. [post_titles_links postid=”477159″] The meeting’s agenda includes case resolutions, which has fueled optimism that the SEC might vote to close the Ripple case during this session. However, experts familiar with SEC procedures have cautioned that such meetings are routine and occur weekly, meaning it’s unlikely to be a special session focused solely on the Ripple lawsuit. What’s Next for XRP Price? Despite the legal uncertainty, XRP’s market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic. Traders and investors are keeping a close watch on any signs of closure, especially since legal clarity could have a major impact on the asset’s long-term price action. In the meantime, the XRP community continues to wait for formal updates from both Ripple and the SEC, with hopes that a resolution will finally bring an end to one of crypto’s longest-running legal battles.

Wall Street Giant Tom Lee Speaks Assertively!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/historic-ethereum-eth-decision-comes-from-bitcoin-mining-company-wall-street-giant-tom-lee-speaks-assertively/,"While altcoins are also prominent in institutional acceptance after Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH) is leading in this regard. While Ethereum accumulation has also increased after BTC recently, the last move at this point came from Bitcoin miner BitMine Immersion Technologies. According to official statements, US-based Bitcoin mining company BitMine announced that it has made Ethereum the primary reserve asset. At this point, BitMine stated that it has gone to the capital increase path and will raise $250 million and will purchase Ethereum. The company also added that Tom Lee, a well-known Wall Street analyst, has been elected chairman of the board. The company stated that the capital increase was carried out under the leadership of MOZAYYX with the participation of a high-level investor group including Founders Fund, Pantera, FalconX, Republic Digital, Kraken, Galaxy Digital, DCG and Thomas Lee. Stablecoins are the “ChatGPT” of cryptocurrencies, said BitMine President Thomas Lee, adding that he expects Ethereum to follow suit. “Ethereum is the blockchain on which most stablecoin payments are made, so ETH should benefit from this growth,” Lee said. Tom Lee stated that BitMine will follow a strategy similar to MicroStrategy’s “BTC Yield” measure of Bitcoin per share. The company added that it will monitor the value of ETH held per share of the company as a key performance metric. BitMine’s move comes after SharpLink Gaming’s ETH moves, which is on its way to becoming Etheruem’s MicroStrategy. With its recent ETH purchases, SharpLink Gaming has become the world’s largest public ETH holder. Related News: Ethereum's MicroStrategy is Born!

Price prediction for 2025 suggests a potential high of $32. Long-term forecasts indicate LINK could reach $195 by 2030. Chainlink has emerged as a game-changing decentralized oracle network, enabling smart contracts to connect seamlessly with real-world data, APIs, and traditional financial systems. As the crypto market evolves, Chainlink’s role continues to expand—especially with its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) gaining traction. Its native token, LINK, not only powers the ecosystem but has also caught the attention of investors and analysts. With LINK price showing signs of a potential breakout and strong on-chain fundamentals backing its rise, the big question remains: Can LINK coin price hit $50 in 2025? Let’s dive into this detailed Chainlink price prediction 2025–2030 to find out.

The end of June showed bullish reawakening in the short term as LINK price seeks a retest of the $18 neckline. This retest is essential for sustaining its upward momentum. The price is currently trying to stabilize around the $13 mark, and a successful break above the $18 level could signal a bullish trend. But if $13 breaks, then it might pull back to $10. LINK Price Prediction 2025 In 2025, Chainlink (LINK) started the year on a downward path, but by April, the tide began to turn. Early in the month, LINK began its recovery from a low of $10.067. By May, it had formed a bullish rounded bottom pattern, with a crucial neckline set at $18. However, since mid-May, LINK has faced challenges in maintaining its position near this neckline. By the third week of June, it pulled back toward the support level of the rounded bottom, which coincides with a multi-year support zone around $11. In the final week of June, LINK’s price began to rise again, attempting to hold steady near the key $13 mark. If bullish momentum continues, LINK could aim to retest the neckline at $18 in July. For this price advance to sustain itself in the long term, LINK must break above and close daily above the $18 neckline. Such a move could signal a potential upward trend, increasing the chances of retesting the $24 resistance level in Q3 and Q4. This area is supported by a high-volume profile from earlier in the year. If LINK manages to surpass the $24 mark, projections for late 2025 suggest that the token could soar as high as $32.

The announcement has already sparked market momentum, with $SOL surging over the past 24 hours to a high of $159.24, signaling growing investor confidence ahead of the ETF debut. The excitement could also spill over into crypto presales like Snorter Token ($SNORT), a native Ethereum token that features a bridge to Solana, potentially gaining traction as interest in Solana-based assets heats up. Rex-Osprey Solana ETF Effectively Approved, More ETFs Coming Soon REX Shares announced on X today that the ‘first-ever staking crypto ETF in the US’ is coming on Wednesday. This will provide investors with direct exposure to $SOL while also offering staking rewards. In May, the company, along with Osprey Funds, sent a proposal to the SEC for a Solana and an Ethereum ETF with staking rewards. Rex-Osprey received a response on Friday with the SEC providing no further comments. This effectively approves the organization’s application. Aside from Rex-Osprey, there are at least nine other similar filings at the SEC. If approved, these should drive up Solana’s value even further. $SOL Goes Up with the Rex-Osprey Solana ETF News Solana’s native token saw a flurry of activity in the past 24 hours, thanks to the news. It’s been up by 0.84% during the period and around 2% in the last seven days. Launched in 2020, Solana has been the unofficial home of the best meme coins with its low transaction fees and high throughput. Get Ready for the New Wave of Meme Coins with Snorter Token ($SNORT) With increased interest in Solana could come an influx of new meme coins. This should make finding legitimate and promising coins even more challenging. Snorter Bot can help you sniff out the top new cryptocurrencies well ahead of other bots and whales.
