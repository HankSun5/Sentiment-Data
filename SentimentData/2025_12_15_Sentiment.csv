The initial funding round was a resounding success, reaching its cap in less than two weeks and securing $500,000 in capital. This intense demand has carried over directly into Phase 2, which has already generated $800,000 through the sale of 13 million tokens. With the current allocation nearing its limit, market observers anticipate the start of Phase 3 is imminent, marking a critical transition for early participants looking to maximize their entry position. Ripple Secures Banking Charter while GeeFi Delivers Real Utility Ripple recently obtained conditional OCC approval for a national trust bank, positioning its RLUSD stablecoin as a benchmark for compliance. While Ripple solidifies its institutional framework, GeeFi is capturing retail attention by prioritizing tangible utility and user autonomy. At the heart of the ecosystem lies a non-custodial decentralized exchange (DEX), designed to ensure traders retain absolute authority over their private keys. This architecture eliminates third-party risks, providing a secure environment where asset ownership remains strictly with the user. Beyond trading, GeeFi is bridging the gap between digital assets and daily commerce through its upcoming Crypto Cards. Endorsed by payment leaders VISA and Mastercard, these cards allow holders to spend their crypto holdings at millions of locations globally, effortlessly converting digital wealth into purchasing power. Supporting this ecosystem is the GEE token’s deflationary structure. A systematic burn mechanism continuously removes tokens from circulation, creating inherent scarcity that is engineered to drive long-term value as the platform attracts more users. A Financial Structure Built for Aggressive Growth The economic incentives embedded in the GeeFi presale are drawing significant capital from across the crypto landscape. During the current Phase 2, GEE tokens are available at the highly accessible price of $0.06. This entry point offers a stark advantage compared to the confirmed listing price of $0.40, guaranteeing early supporters a 667% gain the moment the token hits public exchanges. The long-term outlook is even more compelling. With analysts projecting a future valuation of $2 per token, a $1,600 allocation today could expand to $60,000, representing a massive 3,233% ROI. The market’s response has been overwhelming. Having already sold over 13 million tokens and raised $800,000 in Phase 2 alone, buying pressure is accelerating rapidly. This strong momentum has led experts to predict that the current phase will conclude ahead of schedule. Fueling this excitement are persistent reports of upcoming listings on top-tier centralized exchanges. Such events historically serve as powerful catalysts for price appreciation, further validating the project’s trajectory and potential for substantial market impact. Maximize Holdings with High-Yield Staking Rewards GeeFi provides investors with more than just asset appreciation; it offers a robust mechanism for generating consistent passive income via its staking program. Accessed through the user-friendly GeeFi Wallet, the system features multiple tiers to accommodate various strategies. A flexible, no-lock tier delivers a solid 10% APR for those needing liquidity. For investors willing to commit for fixed durations, the returns increase significantly: 15% APR for one month, 22% APR for three months, and an exceptional 55% APR for a twelve-month term. Additionally, the platform incentivizes growth through a referral program, granting a 5% bonus on contributions made via personal links. The Window for Early Entry Is Closing Rapidly GeeFi is distinguishing itself as a high-potential contender in the crypto space, backed by concrete utility and a strategic financial model. This presale represents a fleeting chance to secure a stake in a rapidly expanding ecosystem before it gains widespread mainstream recognition. As Phase 2 races toward its hard cap and the inevitable price hike of Phase 3 looms, the optimal moment to act is right now. The combination of guaranteed listing profits and substantial staking rewards is creating an urgent atmosphere, compelling decisive investors to lock in their positions before this unique opportunity expires.

55789973,https://timestabloid.com/?p=92329,1765746314,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Updated XRP Ranking Ladder: See Your Category Among Holders,https://timestabloid.com/updated-xrp-ranking-ladder-see-your-category-among-holders/,"In cryptocurrency, true perspective often extends beyond price charts and market swings. While headlines highlight sudden rallies or corrections, long-term holders frequently gauge their progress by ownership and relative positioning within the network. For XRP investors, a recently highlighted ranking framework has reignited discussions about how balances translate into status within the community. This simple yet insightful lens allows holders to reflect on their place in a rapidly evolving ecosystem. XRP Update shared this framework in a post on X, providing a clear categorization of wallets based on token quantity. The ranking assigns labels that range from entry-level holders to major accumulators, helping investors understand their standing relative to the broader XRP Ledger. By emphasizing quantity rather than market value, the post offers a perspective often overlooked during volatile trading periods. Mapping the XRP Holder Landscape XRP’s distribution is far from uniform. On-chain data shows that while millions of wallets exist, only a small fraction hold significant balances. Large holders, often referred to as whales, control substantial portions of circulating XRP, while the majority maintain smaller positions. Every time I see this $XRP ranking ladder, it reminds me how fortunate I am Big Whale = 100K+ XRP Whale = 50K+ XRP Shark = 10K+ XRP Dolphin = 5K+ XRP Fish = 1K+ XRP Octopus = 500+ XRP Crab = 200+ XRP Shrimp = 100+ XRP Worm = 1+ XRP Tag your rank! — XRP Update (@XrpUdate) December 13, 2025 This uneven distribution is common in major cryptocurrencies but takes on particular significance for XRP given its high liquidity, extensive adoption, and historical price fluctuations. Understanding where one sits on the ranking ladder provides context . It illustrates that even mid-tier balances are more impactful than many holders realize, offering insight into potential market dynamics and accumulation trends without relying solely on price action. The Structure of the XRP Ranking Ladder The ladder categorizes holders symbolically, starting with the smallest balances and progressing to the most substantial. Entry-level participants occupy the lower tiers, while whales dominate the top levels with six-figure XRP holdings and above. This symbolic framework resonates deeply within the community, transforming raw token numbers into a shared cultural reference. Importantly, the ladder does not confer influence over XRP Ledger governance or market control. Instead, it functions as a social and psychological benchmark. Recognizing one’s position can reinforce patience, long-term strategy, and confidence in a network historically shaped by regulatory uncertainty and macroeconomic fluctuations. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Impact and Perspective The ranking ladder has struck a chord because it reframes accumulation as a measure of progress rather than mere speculation. Many holders acquired XRP gradually, often during periods of low activity or market stagnation. By seeing their balances contextualized within the broader ecosystem, they gain perspective on both relative scarcity and personal achievement. Even smaller positions can place investors ahead of a significant portion of wallets worldwide, highlighting the value of incremental accumulation. This approach encourages holders to focus on long-term positioning rather than reacting to short-term market noise. Ownership as a Lens Beyond Price XRP Update’s post underscores the importance of perspective in a market dominated by volatility. By focusing on ownership tiers, the ladder emphasizes network participation and relative standing over headline-driven price swings. For holders, this provides a grounding framework, reminding them that in cryptocurrency, progress is measured not just in dollar terms but in position, patience, and strategic accumulation. As XRP continues to expand with growing institutional adoption and regulatory clarity, understanding one’s place within the holder base may become increasingly relevant, both psychologically and strategically. The ranking ladder, while symbolic, offers a valuable tool for seeing the bigger picture. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

37365,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=129511,1765746444,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37365.jpeg,Flow coin price prediction 2025-2031: Is FLOW a good investment?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/flow-coin-price-prediction/,"Key takeaways: Flow coin price prediction for 2025 could reach a maximum value of $ 0.7975. By 2028, FLOW could reach a maximum price of $1.77. In 2031, FLOW will range between $3.39 to $4.14. Flow coin, the native token of the Flow blockchain created by Dapper Labs, is essential for powering decentralized applications (dApps) and digital assets. Flow aims to provide a high-performance, user-friendly platform that tackles scalability without sacrificing decentralization. Its unique architecture allows developers to build secure and efficient smart contracts. FLOW, its native token, has several key uses within the ecosystem, including paying transaction fees, staking, and participating in network governance. The growing number of dApps and users on the platform drives demand for Flow coin, influencing FLOW’s price movements. Given Flow coin’s strong fundamentals and growing support levels in the ecosystem, the question arises: how high can FLOW go? What will FLOW price be in 2025? Overview Cryptocurrency Flow Token FLOW Price $0.1904 Market Cap $310.66M Trading Volume $6.46M Circulating Supply 1.628B FLOW All-time High $46.16 (April 05, 2021) All-time Low $0.157 (Oct 10, 2025) 24-hour High $0.1982 24-hour Low $0.1886 Flow coin technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 7.84% (High) 50-Day SMA $0.2485 14-Day RSI 29.48 (Oversold) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 21 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 9/30 (30%) 200-Day SMA $0.3577 Flow coin (FLOW) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown FLOW is trending down with no confirmed reversal signals yet. Remaining below $0.200 keeps sellers firmly in control. The next key downside zones are located at $0.185 and $0.170, should pressure persist. Flow coin 1-day price analysis On the price chart for December 14, FLOW is trading around $0.191, printing another red daily candle and extending the short-term downtrend. The price is firmly below the middle Bollinger Band, near $0.220, with the lower band, around $0.194, already breached intraday, signaling expanding downside volatility rather than compression. FLOWUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The sequence of lower highs since early December remains intact, and the inability to reclaim even minor pullback levels confirms sellers are in control. The RSI is hovering near 28–35, entering oversold territory but without divergence, which implies weakness rather than imminent reversal. Meanwhile, the MACD remains negative with widening bearish histogram bars, reinforcing that momentum continues to accelerate downward instead of stabilizing. As long as FLOW holds below $0.205–$0.210, the daily structure favors continuation toward $0.180, with $0.170 becoming a realistic downside extension if panic selling emerges. Flow coin 4-hour price analysis On the 4-hour timeframe, FLOW trades around $0.190, clearly below the Alligator averages clustered between $0.194 and $0.200, a classic sign of a trending bearish phase. Every minor bounce over the last two days has been capped beneath the red and blue moving averages, confirming dynamic resistance and a lack of bullish participation. FLOWUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The MACD remains below zero with flat-to-negative momentum, showing no bullish crossover attempts, while OBV continues to trend lower toward -79M, highlighting sustained capital outflows rather than consolidation. Structurally, the market is grinding lower in a controlled descent, which is often more dangerous than sharp sell-offs, as it leaves little room for reactive bounces. Unless FLOW reclaims $0.200 on strong volume, the 4-hour structure points toward a retest of $0.185, followed by $0.175 if support fails cleanly. FLOW technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.2744 SELL SMA 5 $0.2477 SELL SMA 10 $0.2321 SELL SMA 21 $0.2302 SELL SMA 50 $0.2485 SELL SMA 100 $0.3001 SELL SMA 200 $0.3577 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.2317 SELL EMA 5 $0.2491 SELL EMA 10 $0.2857 SELL EMA 21 $0.3265 SELL EMA 50 $0.3562 SELL EMA 100 $0.3726 SELL EMA 200 $0.4158 SELL What to expect from Flow? Both timeframes indicate that FLOW remains weak and continues to trend downward. Oversold conditions may trigger brief bounces, but without a reclaim of $0.210–$0.220, those moves are likely to be short-lived. Is FLOW a good investment? Flow coin has potential as an investment due to its strong partnerships with major brands and its focus on powering decentralized applications, especially in the NFT and gaming spaces. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant volatility and risks, so investors should carefully consider market conditions and risk tolerance before investing. Will FLOW reach $1? The $1 price mark is within range, having reached that level in early December 2024. Renewed buyer interest could push FLOW to $1 and above in the coming months. Will FLOW reach $5? This level has not been achieved since February 2022. For FLOW to recapture the $5 levels, significant cash inflows will be required. Can FLOW reach $50? FLOW has previously reached an all-time high (ATH) of $46.16, so reaching $50 is achievable. However, a significant bull run and tangible ecosystem updates are required to achieve this feat, as the coin is currently 98% below its ATH. Is Flow a good blockchain? Flow is a solid blockchain, especially for gaming and NFTs. It is designed for scalability, fast transactions, and low fees. The network’s unique multi-role architecture improves efficiency without compromising decentralization. However, it faces fierce competition, and adoption levels are not as high as those of Ethereum and Solana. Does FLOW have a good long-term future? Projections suggest substantial growth over the coming years, with a potential peak of $3-$4 by 2031. This positive outlook reflects a strong potential for sustained value appreciation and continued market relevance.

Growth is now expected to run five to ten times faster over the next ten years, and every company that relies on heavy data loads feels the pressure. Higher demand means higher costs and tighter access, and no one in corporate America wants to get caught paying for power they cannot secure or cannot afford. That fear is now pushing Big Tech and blue-chip firms into the world of energy trading. Big Tech is building trading desk to manage rising load from AI infrastructure Meta, Microsoft, and Apple all received federal approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Council to buy and sell wholesale electricity as they try to handle the massive load coming from AI systems and new data centers. Late November brought a new twist when Disney posted a listing for an energy trader to purchase and schedule electricity for its operations. Rob Gramlich from Grid Strategies said a company with big demand or supply faces clear market exposure, adding that a trading desk is one way to limit that exposure. His warning lands as utilities push stricter rules. When demand was low, companies had looser deals, but now utilities want buyers to commit to fixed quantities even if their real use ends up lower. Tech companies planning a data center might expect to use 2 gigawatts, according to Cryptopolitan’s analysis. The utility may only agree if the firm pays for 1.5 gigawatts upfront. If actual use hits only 1 gigawatt, that firm is stuck paying for an extra 500 megawatts. A trader inside that company can take that leftover power to the open market and sell it to another buyer to cover the loss. That move matters because electricity prices have climbed. Government numbers show average prices in September were 7% higher than the year before. Natural gas, a key factor in power pricing, jumped more than 60% from the same period last year. Higher prices give companies like Microsoft and Disney a reason to sign long-term power contracts to lock in predictable rates. The idea works a bit like Starbucks fixing its coffee bean costs through futures contracts. Traders can also act fast day-to-day, selling small excess volumes or buying extra supply when needed to balance the load. Disney’s listing said the trader will handle short-term load forecasts, hourly and daily electricity purchases, and longer-term power purchase deals. Corporate hiring expands as firms add energy market teams This push is not new for Apple or Microsoft. Apple has been allowed to trade wholesale electricity since 2016, and Microsoft since 2021. Meta is the latest to get authorization. Microsoft told Yahoo Finance it may need to sell part of its added grid supply as it is produced. Meta said trading lets the company deal with the market more directly and gives it more flexibility. Apple did not respond. Hiring is growing across the industry. Google is hiring for energy market development roles. Oracle wants energy risk managers. Digital Realty, which builds data centers, added roles focused on sourcing new power deals and procurement. Disney’s new trader will sit inside Reedy Creek Energy Services, the group that runs the electric grid for the district around Walt Disney World. Disney did not comment. The strategy comes with real risk. A company could lock in a price only to see the market drop, leaving it stuck with a higher bill. But firms want more control, not less. Gramlich said a company already exposed to the market is not adding extra danger by trading. He said trading could even reduce risk. Corporate America seems ready to take that gamble as AI pushes data demand higher every month.

The mood was already shaky because of new fears over a global supply glut and rising tension between the United States and Venezuela after Washington seized a tanker. The pressure grew after crude settled lower on Friday, closing the week with a 4% drop as oversupply worries and talk of a possible Russia-Ukraine peace deal muted any reaction to the U.S. move off Venezuela’s coast. Saudi Arabia felt it the most, because the country’s main index crashed for a second day, dropping 1.2% to 10,589, with every sector flashing red. Al Rajhi Bank, the world’s biggest Islamic lender, slipped 1.3%, and Saudi Basic Industries Corp pulled back 1.2%. The hit crossed industries, finance, and communications with no pockets of relief. Traders watched the selloff grow as markets priced in weaker oil levels and slower flows of cash across the region. Gulf indexes react to pressure Ashraf Al Mamari, chief executive of Oman’s state energy group OQ, said the company is speaking with new partners after SABIC walked away from its petrochemical project in Duqm. He said OQ wants to keep the plan moving and is reviewing options with groups that recently showed interest. Qatar’s benchmark index broke its four-day winning streak and ended 0.4% lower at 10,855, with every component in the red. Qatar National Bank, the region’s top lender, lost 0.8%, and Industries Qatar also slipped 0.8%. Kuwait’s index inched up 0.1% to 9,715, while Bahrain dipped 0.1% to 2,056. Oman rose 0.1% to 5,956, helped by steady moves in local names. Outside the Gulf, Egypt moved the other way. The EGX30 added 0.1% to 42,065, helped by a 15.3% jump in Raya Holding and a 2.1% rise in Telecom Egypt, which had forecast high-single-digit revenue growth and an EBITDA margin in the low-40s range under its 2026 view. Still though, trade stayed cautious across the board with no strong rebound signals as investors tried to size the effect of oversupply worries. The seizure of the tanker added stress to an already thin market, and talk of a possible peace path between Russia and Ukraine pushed crude lower even further.

Market commentators suggest that one $0.035 token is gathering momentum because of its clear roadmap and rapid adoption curve. Early investor sentiment indicates that this project could form one of the most promising multi-year growth paths in the sector, with projections in a bullish scenario showing up to 850% upside potential. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has moved through its presale with steady demand and rising visibility. The token began at $0.01 in early 2025 and has climbed to $0.035. This reflects more than 250% growth driven by consistent buying rather than short-term spikes. The project has raised $19.30M, onboarded 18,400 holders, and sold 820M tokens so far. Out of the 4B total supply, 1.82B tokens are allocated to the presale. Analysts say this wide distribution helps support long-term liquidity once the protocol is live. Mutuum Finance is building a lending platform centered on predictable rules and real yield. Users will be able to supply assets, borrow with LTV limits and operate inside a system designed to reward long-term participation. These fundamentals are one reason investors are watching MUTM more closely as 2026 approaches. V1 Launch and the Buy-and-Distribute Model Mutuum Finance confirmed through its official X announcement that the V1 testnet launch is scheduled for Q4 2025 on the Sepolia network. V1 will include the mtToken system, the Liquidity Pool, the Liquidator Bot and the Debt Token. ETH and USDT will be the first supported assets. Analysts say having a clear launch window builds confidence among traders searching for the best crypto to buy now before the new utility goes live. mtTokens are one of the most important mechanics in the protocol. When users supply assets, mtTokens rise in redeemable value as borrowers repay interest. This creates a predictable APY tied to actual activity. Analysts believe this structure is crucial for a developing DeFi protocol because it encourages stable liquidity and reduces reliance on speculative volume. The buy-and-distribute model adds another long-term catalyst. A portion of fees will be used to buy MUTM from the market. MUTM purchased on the open market is redistributed to users who stake mtTokens in the safety module. Market commentators say this creates steady buying pressure and helps support token value during expansion phases. Because of these core mechanics, some analysts point to the possibility of strong price movement once borrowing activity begins. In a bullish scenario, projections show that MUTM could climb several times above its current level as V1 adoption grows and the buy-and-distribute system becomes active. Layer-2 Expansion and Oracle Infrastructure Mutuum Finance also plans to introduce a stablecoin backed by interest generated inside the protocol, according to the official roadmap. Analysts say this improves liquidity, supports lending cycles and gives the protocol an internal asset designed for predictable borrowing. A stablecoin backed by real interest, not inflation, provides long-term stability and helps reduce volatility across the system. Layer-2 expansion is another long-term catalyst. Moving to L2 networks will reduce transaction fees and increase network speed. Lending protocols depend on low-cost interactions to support high volumes of borrowing. Analysts believe this upgrade will make Mutuum Finance more competitive as activity grows. The protocol also plans to use Chainlink oracles, fallback feeds and aggregated pricing systems to ensure accurate, reliable valuations for collateral and liquidations. This helps prevent liquidation errors and builds trust as the platform scales. With these components combined, analysts outline a second long-term price prediction. In favorable conditions, projections show that MUTM could rise several hundred percent above its post-launch level. Some models even suggest the possibility of up to 850% growth if stablecoin usage and L2 expansion attract large borrowing demand. These views are based on multi-year adoption patterns seen in previous successful DeFi systems. Security, Bounties and User Activity Security is a major reason investors are paying attention. Mutuum Finance completed its CertiK audit with a 90/100 Token Scan score, which analysts consider strong for a protocol still in early development. Halborn Security is performing an additional audit on the finalized code. To strengthen protection, the team introduced a $50K bug bounty, encouraging developers to find vulnerabilities before the testnet window opens. User engagement is supported by a 24-hour leaderboard that rewards the top daily contributor with $500 in MUTM. Card payments are available with no limits, making it easier for first-time users to join without exchange transfers. Analysts say steady buyer activity during the presale reflects increasing confidence, especially as Phase 6 moves closer to full completion. Mutuum Finance has become a focus among investors watching crypto predictions and top cryptocurrencies for long-term growth. With V1 approaching, stablecoin development underway and oracle upgrades planned, many analysts view MUTM as one of the strongest early-stage DeFi opportunities heading into 2026 and 2027.

The central bank is widely expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points to 0.75% at its December 18-19 meeting, a level not seen since 1995 and a clear signal that Japan is continuing its exit from ultra-loose monetary policy. This upcoming event is causing a few conversations among crypto traders because similar policy moves from Japan have repeatedly coincided with the start of Bitcoin price crashes. Japan’s Rate Hikes And The Repeating Bitcoin Sell-Off Pattern Crypto market observers have been quick to highlight an uncomfortable pattern relating to Bitcoin and the BOJ . Each time the bank has raised rates since 2024, Bitcoin’s price action has experienced a deep and relatively fast correction. For example, March 2024 saw Bitcoin fall by about 23% following Japan’s first rate hike since 2007. A similar rate spike move in July was followed by a drop of around 26%, while the January 2025 hike preceded a steeper decline of more than 30%. Crypto analyst 0xNobler expressed concern, noting that if this historical trend repeats itself, Bitcoin could be headed below the $70,000 level shortly after the upcoming December decision. The chart he shared illustrates how each rate hike has aligned with a local market top, followed by a pronounced leg lower. The consistency of these moves has turned what might otherwise be dismissed as coincidence into a data point many traders are now taking seriously. Japan’s interest rate The pressure extends beyond reactions by the crypto industry alone. Japan is the largest foreign holder of US government debt, and any tightening from the Bank of Japan reverberates across global liquidity markets. Higher Japanese rates strengthen the yen, and this, in turn, reduces excess capital that might otherwise flow into risk assets. Echoing this view, another crypto commentator known as AndrewBTC pointed to Bitcoin’s repeated 20% to 31% declines following each BOJ hike since 2024. He warned that another rate increase in December could produce a similar outcome and also identified $70,000 as the possible downside target if the pattern repeats itself. Bitcoin/US Dollar. Source: @cryptoctlt On X Bitcoin Above Long-Term Support: Not Everyone Is Bearish Despite the growing anxiety towards the Bank of Japan’s rate increase, the outlook for Bitcoin is not universally negative. For instance, analyst Ted Pillows pointed out that Bitcoin is currently interacting with its monthly EMA-21, a level that has always acted as a launchpad in prior cycles. Based on this structure, Pillows predicted that Bitcoin could still surge to between the $100,000 and $105,000 range in the near term before there’s another price dump. As the December meeting approaches, Bitcoin finds itself caught between a troubling pattern and a resilient technical support. Whether Japan’s next rate hike leads to another immediate sell-off or allows for a temporary upside push may define how Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market close out the year.

XRP whales —those holding massive amounts of the cryptocurrency—are actively accumulating more tokens despite the short-term price decline. This unexpected behavior suggests seasoned investors see opportunity where others see only risk. Why Are XRP Whales Buying During a Downtrend? CryptoQuant contributor CW8900 recently highlighted this intriguing pattern. According to their analysis, whale addresses have been actively trading and accumulating XRP during its recent downtrend. This isn’t random behavior—it’s a typical pattern observed during market bottom formations. When large investors accumulate during price declines, they often anticipate future rebounds. Think of it this way: while retail investors might panic-sell during downturns, institutional and whale investors frequently use these periods to build positions at discounted prices. Their substantial capital allows them to influence market dynamics significantly. The Technical Indicator Confirming Whale Activity Beyond whale watching, another technical metric supports the accumulation thesis. The 90-day XRP spot taker cumulative volume delta (CVD) indicator has recently shifted to a buy-dominant phase. Let’s break down what this means: CVD measures the difference between buying and selling volumes A positive CVD indicates more buying pressure than selling The 90-day timeframe provides a medium-term perspective When this indicator turns positive while prices are declining, it often signals that informed investors are accumulating assets against the prevailing market sentiment. This divergence between price action and volume metrics can precede trend reversals. What Does This Mean for XRP’s Future Price? The crucial question for every investor is: when might XRP transition from accumulation to rebound? According to the analysis, if the current trend of whale accumulation and positive CVD persists, XRP could establish a solid bottom before entering a rebound phase. However, it’s essential to understand that accumulation phases can last weeks or even months. XRP whales aren’t necessarily timing the exact bottom but rather building positions in a price range they consider undervalued. Their actions create support levels that can prevent further dramatic declines. How Retail Investors Can Interpret Whale Movements While following whale activity can provide valuable insights, retail investors should approach this information cautiously. Consider these points: Whale accumulation doesn’t guarantee immediate price appreciation Market conditions can change based on broader cryptocurrency trends Regulatory developments continue to impact XRP specifically Diversification remains crucial for risk management The current activity among XRP whales suggests confidence in the asset’s long-term potential despite short-term challenges. This doesn’t mean retail investors should blindly follow, but it does provide context for the current market dynamics. The Bottom Line: Patience Amidst Accumulation The simultaneous occurrence of whale accumulation and a buy-dominant CVD indicator creates a compelling narrative for XRP. While short-term price action remains volatile, these signals suggest underlying strength that could manifest once market sentiment improves. Remember, cryptocurrency markets move in cycles. The current phase of XRP whales accumulating during price declines fits historical patterns where informed investors position themselves before broader market recognition. Whether this leads to the anticipated rebound depends on multiple factors, but the signals warrant attention from serious market participants. Frequently Asked Questions What are XRP whales? XRP whales are individuals or entities holding substantial amounts of XRP cryptocurrency, typically enough to influence market prices through their trading activities. How can I track whale activity? You can monitor whale movements through blockchain analysis platforms like CryptoQuant, Etherscan for Ethereum-based tokens, or specialized cryptocurrency tracking services that highlight large transactions. Does whale accumulation always lead to price increases? Not always. While whale accumulation often precedes price rebounds, market conditions, regulatory news, and broader economic factors can override whale influence. It’s one signal among many to consider. What is the Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) indicator? CVD measures the difference between buying and selling volumes over a specific period. A positive CVD indicates net buying pressure, while negative shows selling pressure. Should I buy XRP because whales are accumulating? Whale activity should inform your research but not dictate your investment decisions. Always conduct your own analysis, consider your risk tolerance, and diversify your portfolio. How long do accumulation phases typically last? Accumulation phases vary widely—they can last from several weeks to multiple months, depending on market conditions and the assets involved.

In its latest post, the firm said stablecoins processed an estimated $46 trillion in transaction volume last year, and even surpassing major payment networks. But connecting digital dollars to existing financial rails remains an unresolved issue. Major Crypto Themes For 2026 According to the report, new startups are building on- and off-ramps that link stablecoins with local payment systems, QR-based regional networks, real-time settlement rails, and merchant tools, enabling digital dollars to circulate more easily in everyday payments. A16z said these integrations could support new use cases such as instant cross-border payroll and direct merchant acceptance without bank accounts. The report also pointed to growing interest among banks, fintech firms, and asset managers in bringing traditional assets on-chain, but said many tokenization efforts still replicate existing financial structures. It spoke about synthetic instruments such as perpetual futures as easier to implement and capable of deeper liquidity, adding that “perpification versus tokenization” will remain an important question as more assets come on-chain. Stablecoin issuance also grew in 2025, and A16z predicted that 2026 would see more on-chain origination of credit products rather than off-chain issuance later converted into tokens. The firm said banks continue to rely on legacy core systems built decades ago and argued that stablecoins, tokenized deposits, tokenized treasuries, and on-chain bonds allow institutions to launch new products without replacing aging infrastructure. In its outlook on automation, the report said a shift toward intent-based systems and AI agents will require payments that move at internet speed, supported by programmable settlement tools such as x402. This could turn value transfer into a native network function rather than a separate operational layer. Prediction Markets, DeFi, and LLM Oracles The report also predicted broader access to wealth-management tools as tokenized assets, stablecoins, and DeFi allocation mechanisms enable faster portfolio adjustments, including access to private market assets traditionally limited to institutional investors. On identity, A16z said non-human agents now outnumber human employees in financial services and argued that cryptographically signed credentials, described as “Know Your Agent,” will be required for agents to transact. The report said AI systems are increasingly used for research tasks and predicted that multi-agent workflows will need attribution and compensation mechanisms that blockchain systems could support. A16z believes that the rise of AI agents has disrupted the economic model of the open web by extracting information without supporting ad-based revenue, and added that real-time usage-based compensation systems, potentially using crypto micropayments, may be needed. On privacy, the venture fund said chains with built-in confidentiality could gain stronger network effects because moving between private and public environments risks metadata exposure. The report also predicted increased focus on decentralized, quantum-resistant messaging networks and described “secrets-as-a-service” as a needed framework for enforcing data-access rules on-chain. The report said recent DeFi exploits show that current security practices remain largely case-by-case, and that the sector will need to shift toward proving system-wide properties and enforcing them at runtime. It also noted that prediction markets are expected to list many more contracts, which could raise questions about how to determine outcomes, and new decentralized governance mechanisms and LLM-based oracles will be proposed to help resolve contested events.

This isn’t science fiction—it’s a real debate shaking the cryptocurrency community right now. The quantum threat to Satoshi’s BTC has become one of the most heated discussions in crypto circles, dividing experts and investors alike. Let’s explore what’s really at stake. What Exactly Is the Quantum Threat to Satoshi’s BTC? The core concern revolves around quantum computers potentially breaking the cryptographic security protecting early Bitcoin addresses. According to on-chain analyst Willy Woo, approximately four million BTC held in addresses using the Pay-to-Public-Key (P2PK) standard could be vulnerable. However, the quantum threat to Satoshi’s BTC specifically targets those legendary untouched coins mined during Bitcoin’s earliest days. YouTuber Josh Otten sparked recent discussions by suggesting such a breach could crash Bitcoin’s price to just $3. While this sounds extreme, it highlights how seriously some community members take this potential vulnerability. The quantum threat to Satoshi’s BTC isn’t just about technical security—it’s about market psychology and the very foundation of Bitcoin’s value proposition. Why Is This Debate So Polarizing? The cryptocurrency community remains deeply divided on this issue. On one side, technical experts like Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream, argue we have decades before quantum computers pose a realistic threat. He emphasizes that post-quantum cryptography already exists, giving the Bitcoin network ample time to implement necessary upgrades. However, other voices sound more urgent alarms. James Check, lead on-chain analyst at Glassnode, focuses on psychological risks rather than technical ones. He believes any movement of Satoshi’s coins would: Severely damage market sentiment Trigger immediate price collapse Create impossible consensus challenges for preemptive measures The quantum threat to Satoshi’s BTC therefore represents a perfect storm of technical vulnerability and market psychology. Could Bitcoin Survive a Quantum Attack? Interestingly, most experts agree Bitcoin would likely survive even if the quantum threat to Satoshi’s BTC became reality. Willy Woo notes that while price would plummet initially, original long-term holders might buy during the sharp decline, providing market support. The network itself—the blockchain, the mining protocol, the transaction verification system—would remain intact. What makes the quantum threat to Satoshi’s BTC particularly challenging is the community’s inability to agree on preventive measures. As James Check pointed out, reaching consensus about what to do with these legendary holdings is virtually impossible. This creates a unique vulnerability where technical solutions exist but political will doesn’t. What Are the Real Timelines and Solutions? Let’s separate science fiction from reality. Current quantum computers lack the processing power to break Bitcoin’s cryptography. Most estimates suggest we’re 10-30 years away from that capability. During that time, several protective measures could be implemented: Post-quantum cryptography upgrades to the Bitcoin protocol Address migration initiatives for vulnerable P2PK holdings Community education about quantum-resistant practices Layer-2 solutions with enhanced quantum security The quantum threat to Satoshi’s BTC serves as an important reminder that cryptocurrency security must evolve continuously. While the immediate risk appears low, the discussion pushes developers to create more resilient systems. Conclusion: Vigilance Without Panic The quantum threat to Satoshi’s BTC represents one of cryptocurrency’s most fascinating dilemmas. It combines legendary early Bitcoin history with cutting-edge technological risks and profound market psychology questions. While experts debate timelines and probabilities, one thing remains clear: the Bitcoin community must balance vigilance against potential threats with confidence in the network’s adaptability. Rather than fearing the quantum threat to Satoshi’s BTC, we should view it as motivation for continued innovation. The same adaptive spirit that created Bitcoin can surely protect it from future challenges. Frequently Asked Questions What makes Satoshi’s Bitcoin vulnerable to quantum attacks? Satoshi’s early coins use the Pay-to-Public-Key (P2PK) transaction format, which could theoretically be vulnerable to quantum computers that can derive private keys from public addresses. How soon could quantum computers break Bitcoin’s security? Most experts estimate 10-30 years before quantum computers develop sufficient power. The timeline remains uncertain and depends on quantum computing advancements. Would Bitcoin’s price really crash to $3 if Satoshi’s coins moved? While some predictions are extreme, most analysts agree any movement of Satoshi’s holdings would cause significant price volatility due to psychological impact rather than supply changes. Can Bitcoin upgrade to be quantum-resistant? Yes, post-quantum cryptography solutions already exist and could be implemented through a Bitcoin protocol upgrade when necessary. What should Bitcoin holders do about quantum threats? Regular users should ensure they use modern address formats (like SegWit or Taproot) and stay informed about protocol developments. No immediate action is needed for most holders. Are other cryptocurrencies vulnerable to quantum attacks? Most blockchain networks using similar cryptographic methods face comparable theoretical risks, though implementation details vary between different cryptocurrencies.

The project’s first stage concluded with remarkable efficiency, selling out its 10 million token supply and raising $500,000 in just over a week. This initial velocity has only increased, pushing the total funds raised past the $1 million mark, with support from a rapidly growing community of over 2,400 holders . As a decentralized ecosystem focused on financial autonomy, GeeFi’s mission is attracting considerable attention. Industry experts are now predicting that Phase 3 may sell out in less than 10 days , fueled by credible talk of listings on major exchanges. Avalanche Expands While GeeFi Focuses on Core Utility The Layer-1 sector continues to evolve, with established players like Avalanche making headlines. Avalanche has recently been included in Bitwise’s crypto index ETF and is expanding its presence in the Middle East, alongside rising adoption of real-world assets on its network. While AVAX works to secure institutional adoption, GeeFi is capturing investor interest by delivering a complete, user-centric financial ecosystem that is available today. The cornerstone of the platform is the GeeFi Wallet , a non-custodial application that ensures users maintain full control over their private keys, a critical security feature. The wallet is already live on Android , with an iOS version expected shortly. The ecosystem also includes an integrated Decentralized Exchange (DEX) that supports over 14 networks , facilitating efficient asset swaps across different blockchains. The upcoming GeeFi Crypto Card will further bridge the gap between digital assets and everyday commerce through the VISA and Mastercard payment networks. An Unmissable Entry Point with Phase 2 Pricing The GeeFi presale is structured to provide significant returns to its early supporters. In the current Phase 2 , tokens are available for just $0.06 each. This entry price is drawing strong demand, as the confirmed listing price of $0.40 secures an immediate 667% ROI for presale investors at launch. The potential for wealth creation is notable: a $1,200 investment could appreciate to $40,000 if the GEE token reaches a $2 valuation , delivering a 3,233% return . With Phase 2 already over 80% sold out , representing $800,000 raised from 13 million tokens sold, the opportunity to buy at this price is quickly disappearing. Generate High-Yield Passive Income Through Staking GeeFi offers more than just the potential for capital gains; it is designed to provide holders with a steady stream of passive income. The platform features some of the most attractive staking rewards in the industry, including a high-yield 55% APR for users who lock their GEE tokens for one year. For those who prefer shorter terms, GeeFi offers 22% APR for a three-month lock and 15% APR for one month. In a standout offering, the platform also allows for flexible staking with up to 10% APR without any lock-up period, combining yield with instant asset access. The referral program adds another layer of rewards, giving users a 5% bonus in GEE tokens for each purchase made through their unique referral link. This model incentivizes community-driven growth and rewards early advocates. Seize the Opportunity to Invest in a Potential 100x Project Every market cycle produces a few projects that deliver exceptional returns, and GeeFi shows all the characteristics of being a leader in this cycle. Its strong presale performance, combined with a suite of functional products, distinguishes it from speculative assets. Financial analysts are increasingly identifying it as a 100x gem , noting its solid fundamentals and extraordinary ROI potential. The presale offers the last chance to acquire tokens at an introductory price before they launch on major exchanges, where the value could increase substantially. With Phase 2 almost complete, the window for action is closing fast.

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World, Bitcoin is currently trading at $87,985.77 on the Binance USDT market. This sudden dip has sent ripples through the investment community, prompting questions about the stability of the recent rally and the factors at play. What’s Behind the Sudden BTC Price Drop? Market movements are rarely simple. Therefore, understanding the context is crucial. This decline in the BTC price could be linked to several concurrent factors. For instance, broader market sentiment often influences cryptocurrency. Moreover, technical resistance levels can trigger sell-offs when approached. Key potential drivers include: Profit-Taking: After a significant upward trend, investors often secure gains, creating selling pressure. Macro-Economic Signals: Shifts in traditional finance, like interest rate fears, can impact crypto asset appetite. Market Liquidity: Thin order books on certain exchanges can amplify price swings in either direction. Is This a Major Correction or a Minor Blip? For traders and long-term holders alike, the scale of the move matters. A drop below $88,000 is psychologically significant, but it’s essential to zoom out. Historically, Bitcoin has experienced much larger volatility. The current BTC price action may represent a healthy market correction. This process shakes out short-term speculators and can establish a stronger foundation for the next leg up. However, monitoring key support levels is vital for risk management. Actionable Insights for Navigating BTC Price Volatility Reacting emotionally to price swings is a common mistake. Instead, a strategic approach is far more effective. Here are practical steps to consider when the BTC price exhibits volatility: Review Your Strategy: Does this change your long-term thesis? If not, avoid panic selling. Dollar-Cost Average (DCA): For buyers, price dips can be opportunities to accumulate assets at a lower average cost. Set Clear Limits: Use stop-loss and take-profit orders to automate decisions and remove emotion from trading. Diversify: Ensure your portfolio isn’t overexposed to any single asset’s price movement. The Bigger Picture for Bitcoin’s Value While daily price action grabs headlines, the fundamental narrative for Bitcoin remains robust. Adoption by institutions continues, network security is at all-time highs, and its role as a digital store of value persists. This recent adjustment in the BTC price is a reminder that the path to mainstream adoption is non-linear. It is characterized by rapid advances and periodic consolidations. In conclusion, the dip below $88,000 is a significant market event that warrants attention. However, it should be viewed through the lens of Bitcoin’s volatile history and strong fundamentals. For informed participants, these moments test conviction and present defined opportunities. The key is to separate short-term noise from the long-term signal. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Why did the BTC price fall below $88,000? The drop is likely due to a combination of profit-taking by traders after a rally, reactions to broader economic conditions, and technical selling at key resistance levels. Should I sell my Bitcoin now? Selling based on a single day’s price movement is rarely advisable. Your decision should align with your original investment strategy, risk tolerance, and long-term outlook on Bitcoin’s fundamentals. Could the BTC price go lower? Yes, cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile. The price could test lower support levels. It’s important to be prepared for further fluctuations in either direction. Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? For investors using a Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) strategy, price dips are often considered opportunities to buy at a lower average price. However, this depends on your individual financial goals. How does this affect the overall crypto market? Bitcoin often sets the trend for the wider cryptocurrency market. A significant drop in BTC price can lead to correlated declines in altcoins, as market sentiment becomes cautious. Where can I reliably track the BTC price? Use reputable data aggregators and major exchanges like CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, or the trading pages of established platforms like Binance for real-time and accurate price information.

A major financial institution just delivered a sobering forecast. According to a recent report from UK investment bank Barclays, the crypto market outlook for 2024 remains bearish without significant new catalysts to drive demand. This analysis points to a stark reality check for investors hoping for a quick rebound. What’s Behind Barclays’ Bearish Crypto Market Outlook? Barclays points to concrete data showing a market cooling off. The bank’s year-end report highlights a sharp decline in spot trading volumes on major platforms like Coinbase and Robinhood. More importantly, they note a significant drop in participation from retail investors, the group that often fuels major bull runs. This lack of broad, enthusiastic buying pressure is a core reason for their cautious crypto market outlook . Are Institutional Pilots Enough to Spark Growth? You might wonder about big names like BlackRock exploring tokenization. Barclays addresses this directly. While these pilots are important long-term experiments, the bank believes they are currently “too early to have a meaningful market impact.” In other words, don’t expect these projects to single-handedly reverse the current crypto market outlook in the short term. Structural growth, they argue, appears limited for now. What Could Change the Crypto Market Outlook? Barclays isn’t forecasting doom forever. Their report identifies specific potential catalysts that could revive demand and alter the gloomy crypto market outlook . These are major, market-shaking events that could bring in a wave of new capital and confidence. The approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States. This would provide a regulated, accessible gateway for traditional investors. The election of a pro-crypto U.S. president in November 2024. This could lead to more favorable regulations and policies. Without such clear triggers, Barclays suggests the market may continue to drift or face downward pressure. Key Takeaways for Crypto Investors This report serves as a crucial reminder for market participants. It emphasizes that sustainable rallies need more than hope; they require tangible drivers. For investors, this crypto market outlook suggests a period of heightened caution and selectivity. The era of easy, broad-based gains may be on pause. The focus should shift to fundamental developments, regulatory news, and real-world adoption metrics rather than speculative momentum. In conclusion, Barclays paints a picture of a cryptocurrency market at a crossroads. The current crypto market outlook is one of waiting, where patience may be more valuable than aggression. The next major move will likely depend on a concrete, institutional-grade event that rebuilds trust and opens the financial floodgates. Until then, the market may remain in a holding pattern, testing the resolve of its participants. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Does Barclays think the crypto market will crash? A: Barclays’ report describes a bearish outlook, meaning they expect limited growth or continued pressure, not necessarily a catastrophic crash. They highlight a lack of positive catalysts rather than predicting a collapse. Q: What is the main reason for their negative view? A: The primary reason is a sharp decline in retail investor demand and trading activity, which has removed a key source of buying pressure from the market. Q: Is all institutional activity irrelevant right now? A: No. Barclays acknowledges pilots by firms like BlackRock but classifies them as long-term developments that are too early to impact prices significantly in the immediate future. Q: Should I sell all my crypto based on this report? A: This report is one analysis. Investment decisions should be based on your own research, risk tolerance, and long-term strategy. Barclays’ view is a factor to consider, not a sole instruction. Q: What’s the most hopeful sign they mention? A: The potential approval of a U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF is highlighted as a major catalyst that could dramatically improve market sentiment and inflow of capital. Q: Does this report only talk about Bitcoin? A> While Bitcoin is a major focus, especially regarding an ETF, the analysis pertains to the broader cryptocurrency market, citing trading volumes on multi-asset platforms.

As the cryptocurrency community understands better than most, trust in digital systems is paramount, and this incident reveals alarming vulnerabilities in AI-powered news dissemination that could have real-world consequences. Grok AI’s Critical Factual Errors in Breaking News The Bondi Beach shooting on December 14, 2025, was a real tragedy that required accurate reporting. Instead, Grok AI demonstrated how quickly artificial intelligence can amplify false information during developing situations. The chatbot made multiple critical errors that went beyond simple mistakes, including misidentifying the hero who disarmed a gunman and questioning the authenticity of video evidence. How Grok Spread Bondi Beach Shooting Misinformation Grok’s errors weren’t minor oversights—they were substantial fabrications that could have impacted public understanding of a serious event. The chatbot incorrectly identified 43-year-old Ahmed al Ahmed, the actual bystander who bravely disarmed one of the gunmen, as someone else entirely. In one particularly egregious post, Grok claimed the man in a photo was an Israeli hostage, while in another, it brought up completely irrelevant information about the Israeli army’s treatment of Palestinians. Even more concerning was Grok’s creation of a fictional hero. The chatbot claimed that a “43-year-old IT professional and senior solutions architect” named Edward Crabtree was the one who actually disarmed the gunman. This person appears to be entirely fabricated, with the supposed source being a largely non-functional news site that may itself be AI-generated. Grok’s False Claim Actual Fact Potential Impact Edward Crabtree disarmed gunman Ahmed al Ahmed disarmed gunman Erases real hero’s actions Video showed Cyclone Alfred Video showed actual shooting Questions evidence authenticity Man in photo was Israeli hostage Man was local bystander Creates false political narrative The xAI Response and Correction Process Grok did eventually correct some of its mistakes, but the damage was already done. The chatbot acknowledged that “misunderstanding arises from viral posts that mistakenly identified him as Edward Crabtree, possibly due to a reporting error or a joke referencing a fictional character.” This raises serious questions about xAI’s verification processes and the fundamental reliability of AI chatbots in breaking news situations. Consider these critical issues with AI-powered news dissemination: Speed vs. Accuracy: AI chatbots prioritize rapid response over fact-checking Source Verification: Grok apparently couldn’t distinguish between legitimate news sources and AI-generated content farms Context Understanding: The chatbot failed to understand the seriousness of a mass shooting event Correction Mechanisms: Corrections come too late after misinformation has already spread Why This AI Chatbot Failure Matters for Digital Trust For the cryptocurrency community, this incident should sound alarm bells. We’ve built entire financial systems on the foundation of trust in digital information and verification processes. When an AI chatbot from a high-profile company like xAI, backed by Elon Musk, can’t reliably report basic facts about a major news event, it undermines confidence in all AI systems. The Bondi Beach shooting misinformation reveals several dangerous patterns: AI systems can create entirely fictional narratives from thin air Once misinformation spreads, corrections rarely reach everyone who saw the original false claims Users may trust AI outputs because they come from “official” sources The line between human error and AI hallucination becomes dangerously blurred FAQs: Understanding the Grok AI Misinformation Incident What is Grok AI? Grok is an AI chatbot developed by xAI , Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company. It has been integrated into Musk’s social media platform X (formerly Twitter). Who is Elon Musk? Elon Musk is a technology entrepreneur and investor known for founding companies like Tesla , SpaceX , and now xAI. He acquired Twitter in 2022 and rebranded it as X. What happened at Bondi Beach? On December 14, 2025, a mass shooting occurred at Bondi Beach in Australia. A bystander named Ahmed al Ahmed disarmed one of the gunmen, an act of bravery that Grok AI initially misreported. How did Grok get the facts wrong? Grok made multiple errors including misidentifying the hero, questioning video authenticity, and creating a fictional character named Edward Crabtree who supposedly disarmed the gunman. Has Grok corrected its mistakes? Yes, Grok has corrected some posts, but the corrections came after the misinformation had already spread across the platform. The Dangerous Reality of AI-Powered Information Systems This incident serves as a stark warning about the limitations of current AI technology in handling real-world information. As we’ve seen in cryptocurrency markets, misinformation can have immediate and severe consequences. When AI systems that millions of people trust for information can’t distinguish fact from fiction during critical events, we’re facing a fundamental crisis in our information ecosystem. The Bondi Beach shooting misinformation reveals that even sophisticated AI systems from major companies lack the judgment, context awareness, and verification capabilities needed for responsible news dissemination. For a technology community that understands the importance of trust and verification in digital systems, this should be particularly concerning.

55796006,644913,1765756834,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55796006.jpeg,Bitcoin Makes The Cut As Brazil’s Largest Private Bank Issues 2026 Guidance,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-makes-the-cut-as-brazils-largest-private-bank-issues-2026-guidance/,"According to Itaú Asset Management, Brazil’s largest private bank, investors should consider holding 1%–3% of their portfolios in Bitcoin starting in 2026. The recommendation came in a research outlook released this week and frames Bitcoin as a small, complementary holding rather than a main bet. Itaú Backs Small Bitcoin Positions The bank’s note points to Bitcoin’s low correlation with many traditional assets and to currency risks that hit local investors hard this year. Itaú also moved to build the infrastructure behind that view: in September 2025 it created a dedicated crypto division and named former Hashdex executive João Marco Braga da Cunha to lead the team. That new unit sits alongside the bank’s existing products and is meant to help clients access regulated crypto tools. Access Through Local Products Brazilian savers can already reach Bitcoin via products tied to Itaú. The bank is part of the team that launched the IT Now Bloomberg Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, known by its ticker BITI11, which began trading on November 10, 2022. The ETF gives investors a spot-like route to Bitcoin inside the local market, and it sits alongside unit trusts and pension products that offer crypto exposure. Small But Existing Crypto Footprint Itaú says its regulated crypto suite manages roughly R$850 million across several funds and ETFs , a modest amount compared with its wider business but still a clear signal of product readiness. The bank’s asset arm is large: it manages more than 1 trillion reais for clients, which helps explain why its guidance on allocations draws wide attention. Market Context And Timing Itaú’s move arrives after a year in which currency swings amplified losses for some Brazilian holders of foreign assets. That reality appears to be part of the math behind recommending a 1%–3% position — a small buffer for those worried about local-currency shocks, not a bet meant to replace stocks or bonds. The bank frames the position as a disciplined, long-term allocation, not a short-term trade. What This Means For Investors For ordinary investors the guidance is simple to read: keep exposure small and controlled. A 1% position will hardly change a diversified portfolio on its own, while 3% is still within what many institutions have called a “satellite” slot. Based on reports, Itaú expects to offer more choices — from low-volatility wrappers to riskier strategies — through the new unit as demand grows.

The widely watched Crypto Fear & Greed Index has just dropped to a mere 16, solidifying a state of extreme fear among investors. This critical gauge of market psychology is flashing a bright red warning sign, but what does it truly mean for Bitcoin, altcoins, and your investment strategy? Let’s decode the fear. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Telling Us? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, provided by Alternative.me, is more than just a number. It’s a composite snapshot of investor emotion. A score of 16, down five points from the previous day, places the market firmly in ‘Extreme Fear’ territory. This index operates on a simple scale: 0 represents maximum fear, while 100 signifies extreme greed. The current reading suggests a market dominated by panic, uncertainty, and selling pressure. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? This sentiment indicator isn’t based on guesswork. It synthesizes data from multiple sources to create a holistic view. Understanding its components helps explain why the score is so low: Volatility (25%): Sharp price swings, especially downward, increase fear. Market Volume (25%): High volume during downturns signals panic selling. Social Media (15%): The tone and volume of discussions on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys (15%): Direct polls of market participant sentiment. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): A shift towards Bitcoin can signal a ‘flight to safety’. Google Trends (10%): Search volume for terms like ‘Bitcoin crash’. The current low score across these metrics paints a clear picture of a nervous and retreating market. Is Extreme Fear a Bad Sign for Crypto Investors? While a low Crypto Fear & Greed Index score feels alarming, seasoned investors often view it through a different lens. Historically, periods of extreme fear have frequently preceded major market bottoms and buying opportunities. This contrarian perspective is rooted in the idea that when everyone is fearful, assets may be undervalued. However, this is not a guaranteed buy signal. Extreme fear can also precede further declines if negative fundamentals persist. Therefore, the index is best used as a tool for context, not a crystal ball. Actionable Insights in a Fear-Driven Market Navigating a market with a Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 16 requires a calm and strategic approach. Here are some actionable steps: Do Not Panic Sell: Emotional selling at lows often locks in losses. Review Your Portfolio: Assess the fundamentals of your holdings. Has anything changed? Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): This strategy involves investing fixed amounts regularly, buying more when prices are low. Secure Your Assets: Ensure your cryptocurrencies are in a secure wallet, not on an exchange. Use the Time to Research: Market downturns are an excellent opportunity to study projects without FOMO. The Bottom Line on Today’s Crypto Sentiment The Crypto Fear & Greed Index hitting 16 is a significant marker of collective market psychology. It confirms the challenging environment but also serves as a reminder of crypto’s cyclical nature. Markets move from fear to greed and back again. While the short-term path may be rocky, understanding this sentiment gauge empowers you to make decisions based on data, not emotion. The extreme fear reading today could be the foundation for the next phase of the market cycle. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index of 16 mean? A: A score of 16 indicates ‘Extreme Fear’ in the cryptocurrency market. It suggests investors are predominantly pessimistic, which is often associated with selling pressure and high volatility. Q: Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a reliable buy or sell signal? A: It is a sentiment indicator, not a direct trading signal. While extreme fear can signal a potential buying zone for contrarians, it does not guarantee an immediate price reversal. Always combine it with fundamental and technical analysis. Q: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? A: The index is updated daily, typically once per day, reflecting the most recent market data and social sentiment. Q: Should I sell my crypto if the index shows extreme fear? A> Not necessarily. Selling during extreme fear often means selling at a loss. It’s crucial to assess your investment thesis, risk tolerance, and the long-term fundamentals of your assets rather than reacting solely to sentiment. Q: Where can I check the current Crypto Fear & Greed Index score? A: The index is publicly available on websites like Alternative.me. Many major cryptocurrency news and data platforms also feature it. Did this breakdown of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index help you understand the market’s mood?

Growing concerns over advancements in quantum computing have sparked urgent discussion across the cryptocurrency world about one of Bitcoin’s most intriguing and high‑stakes vulnerabilities: the safety of Satoshi Nakamoto’s estimated 1.1 million BTC hoard and other legacy holdings. This discussion initially began when Josh Otten, a satirist, documentarian, and YouTuber with over one million subscribers, shared a post with his subscribers demonstrating a price chart that expressed the drastic drop of Bitcoin to $3.00. At this point, Otten proposed that this situation could occur if a powerful quantum computer were to be employed in the robbery of Satoshi Nakamoto’s 1 million BTC and then sold. The crypto community raises concerns about the impacts of quantum computing In a statement , Willy Woo, a renowned, long-term Bitcoin investor and pioneer in on-chain analysis , mentioned that, “Many early investors would take advantage of the sudden drop. The Bitcoin network would endure; most coins aren’t at immediate risk.” However, Woo highlighted that about 4 million BTC are currently kept in pay-to-public-key (P2PK) addresses, including Satoshi’s holdings . According to the long-term bitcoin investor, these addresses indicate the complete public key on the blockchain in the event of transactions, making them vulnerable to quantum attacks. Meanwhile, several analysts also weighed in on the topic of discussion. They argued that when the full public key of a Bitcoin wallet is shown on the blockchain, it exposes these wallets to risk for future quantum attacks. In the event of an adequately sophisticated quantum computer, the analysts noted that such a computer could likely obtain the private key from the public key in the future. This move will effectively occur when the full public key of a BTC wallet is present on the blockchain. Contrastingly, sources mention that the latest types of BTC wallet addresses include better safeguards against quantum attacks. This is because they do not illustrate complete public keys on-chain. Notably, if the public key maintains anonymity, then a quantum computer will not be able to establish the matching private key from these details. On the other hand, the cryptocurrency communities, particularly those supporting Bitcoin, have raised concerns about how quantum computing might impact BTC and the encryption that underpins cryptocurrencies. Some expressed the belief that quantum computing could pose significant challenges to the industry. Adam Back asserts that Bitcoin will be a victim of a quantum threat in the future Adam Back, a renowned British cryptographer and cypherpunk widely known as the inventor of Hashcash and as the co-founder and CEO of Blockstream, a leading Bitcoin infrastructure firm, recently asserted that BTC will not encounter a threat from quantum for the next 20 to 40 years. Back argued that there is sufficient time to adopt post-quantum cryptography standards before the development of a powerful quantum computer that will have the capability to break current encryption and weaken cybersecurity measures. It is worth noting that these standards already exist. Considering the intense nature of the situation, market analyst James Check commented that quantum computing does not pose a threat to the technology adopted in the Bitcoin ecosystem, as cryptocurrency users will likely shift to quantum-resistant addresses before the release of a practical quantum computer. Check further explained that the real threat from quantum computing lies more in its likely effects on the market price of BTC. He also noted that there is no way the Bitcoin community will decide to freeze Satoshi’s coins before a quantum computer can access his wallets and ensure that those coins are back into circulation.

A startling development emerged as the market opened: a massive CME Bitcoin futures gap of over $2,000. This isn’t just a minor blip—it’s a significant event that seasoned traders watch closely. Let’s break down what this gap means, why it happens, and the potential implications for your trading strategy this week. What Exactly Is This CME Bitcoin Futures Gap? The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), where institutional players trade Bitcoin futures, closed on Friday at $90,610. When it reopened on Monday, the price had jumped down to start at $88,575. This created a void, or ‘gap,’ of approximately $2,035 on the price chart. Unlike the 24/7 Bitcoin spot market, the CME takes a weekend break. Therefore, any major price movement in the spot market over Saturday and Sunday is not reflected in the futures price until Monday’s opening bell. This disconnect is the root cause of the CME Bitcoin futures gap phenomenon. Why Should Every Crypto Trader Care About Gaps? Gaps are more than just empty spaces on a chart; they are zones of potential price action. Many traders operate on the theory that markets have a tendency to ‘fill’ these gaps. This means the price may eventually return to trade through the price level where the gap formed. Here’s why this matters for your portfolio: Predictive Signal: A gap can indicate strong momentum from the weekend carrying into the new week. Liquidity Pools: Gaps often represent areas where a high volume of stop-loss or limit orders may be clustered. Institutional Sentiment: Since CME is a regulated venue for big players, its gaps can reflect institutional positioning and sentiment shifts. Therefore, the appearance of a substantial CME Bitcoin futures gap immediately becomes a key technical level for analysts to watch. Will This $2K Gap Fill? Analyzing the Possibilities The critical question on every trader’s mind is simple: will the price move back up to $90,610 to close this gap? There is no guaranteed answer, but historical patterns provide clues. Gaps on significant exchanges like the CME often act as magnets for price. However, filling can happen quickly, take weeks, or in some cases, not occur at all if a powerful new trend is established. Monitoring spot market volume and broader crypto news is essential to gauge the likelihood. A sudden surge in buying pressure could see the futures price rally to fill this CME Bitcoin futures gap rapidly. Actionable Insights for Navigating Futures Gaps Knowing about the gap is one thing; knowing what to do is another. Here are practical steps you can take: Mark Your Chart: Clearly highlight the gap zone between ~$88,575 and ~$90,610 on your trading platform. Watch for Confirmation: Don’t trade on the gap alone. Look for confirming signals like increased volume or a break of key support/resistance levels near the gap area. Manage Risk: If you choose to trade a potential gap fill, use strict stop-loss orders. The market may move away from the gap instead of towards it. Remember, while the CME Bitcoin futures gap is a valuable tool, it should be one part of a comprehensive analysis that includes fundamentals and market structure. The Bottom Line: A Signal, Not a Crystal Ball This week’s $2,035 gap in CME Bitcoin futures is a stark reminder of the crypto market’s relentless, 24/7 nature. It highlights the disconnect between traditional finance hours and the digital asset world. For the alert trader, it provides a clear technical level to watch. Whether the gap fills swiftly or remains open will offer valuable insights into market strength and trader psychology in the days ahead. Stay vigilant, use sound risk management, and let this gap inform—not dictate—your trading decisions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What causes a CME Bitcoin futures gap? Gaps form because the CME futures market is closed on weekends, while the Bitcoin spot market trades continuously. If the spot price moves significantly between Friday’s CME close and Monday’s open, a gap appears on the futures chart. Do all CME gaps eventually get filled? Not all gaps fill, but many do. It’s a common market phenomenon where price is often drawn back to an area of previous imbalance. However, it is not a guaranteed rule and should not be traded in isolation. How long does it usually take for a gap to fill? There is no set timeframe. A gap can fill within hours, days, weeks, or even longer. It depends on prevailing market trends, volume, and news events. Should I immediately trade to profit from a gap? Caution is advised. While gaps present a potential opportunity, trading them requires a strategy and risk management. It’s better to wait for price action confirmation near the gap levels before entering a trade. Is a down gap (like this one) bearish? A down gap suggests selling pressure over the weekend, which can be a short-term bearish signal. However, the subsequent action to fill (or not fill) the gap is more important for determining the overall direction. Do gaps occur on other crypto futures exchanges? Yes, but they are most notable on regulated, traditional market hours exchanges like the CME. Exchanges that trade 24/7 may have smaller gaps or price jumps, but not in the same defined way.

The third week of December brings a packed calendar of central bank speeches and crucial economic data releases that could significantly impact digital asset markets. Whether you’re trading Bitcoin, Ethereum, or altcoins, these events create volatility and opportunity that smart traders can’t afford to ignore. Why Should Crypto Investors Care About Global Macroeconomic Events? You might wonder why traditional economic data matters for decentralized digital assets. The answer lies in market psychology and institutional adoption. Major global macroeconomic events influence investor sentiment, risk appetite, and capital flows. When central banks make decisions or economic data surprises, it affects everything from the US dollar’s strength to bond yields—both of which have become increasingly correlated with cryptocurrency prices as institutional money enters the space. December 16: The Week’s Critical Opening Act The action begins early on Monday with two significant events. First, at 5:30 a.m. UTC, Federal Open Market Committee member John Williams speaks. His comments could provide clues about future monetary policy direction. More importantly, at 1:30 p.m. UTC, we get the U.S. November Non-Farm Payrolls release. This employment data is a key indicator of economic health and influences Federal Reserve decisions. Why does this matter for crypto? Strong employment data might suggest continued Fed tightening, potentially pressuring risk assets. Conversely, weaker numbers could boost expectations for rate cuts, potentially supporting cryptocurrency markets. Therefore, monitoring these global macroeconomic events helps you anticipate market movements. December 17-18: Central Bank Focus Intensifies Tuesday brings Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller’s speech at 3:15 a.m. UTC. His views on inflation and interest rates carry significant weight. Then Wednesday becomes particularly busy with multiple important developments: 7:30 a.m. UTC: FOMC member Raphael Bostic speaks 9:00 p.m. UTC: Bank of England interest rate decision 1:30 p.m. UTC: U.S. November Consumer Price Index (CPI) release The CPI data is arguably the week’s most critical global macroeconomic event for cryptocurrency markets. Inflation numbers directly influence Federal Reserve policy, which affects liquidity conditions and investor risk tolerance. Higher-than-expected inflation could trigger selloffs across risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. December 19: Asian Market Influence Takes Center Stage The week concludes with the Bank of Japan’s interest rate decision at 3:00 a.m. UTC. While Japan’s monetary policy might seem distant from crypto markets, it affects global liquidity and the yen’s value—factors that increasingly influence cryptocurrency trading pairs and international capital flows. This completes a week of diverse global macroeconomic events spanning multiple continents and central banks. Actionable Insights for Crypto Traders How can you use this information practically? First, mark these events on your trading calendar. Second, understand that volatility often increases around these announcements. Consider these strategies: Reduce leverage before major data releases Watch for correlated movements in traditional markets Pay attention to the US dollar index (DXY) reactions Monitor Bitcoin’s correlation with traditional risk assets Remember, while cryptocurrencies operate on different fundamentals than traditional assets, they don’t exist in a vacuum. The interconnected nature of modern finance means these global macroeconomic events create ripples that reach even decentralized markets. Conclusion: Navigating December’s Economic Crosscurrents The third week of December presents a concentrated series of global macroeconomic events that could shape market sentiment heading into the new year. For cryptocurrency participants, this represents both challenge and opportunity. By staying informed about central bank communications and economic data, you position yourself to make more informed decisions in volatile markets. The key is recognizing that in today’s interconnected financial ecosystem, traditional economic indicators increasingly influence digital asset prices through institutional participation and shifting risk appetites. Frequently Asked Questions Why do cryptocurrency prices react to traditional economic data? Cryptocurrency markets have become increasingly correlated with traditional risk assets as institutional investors enter the space. Economic data influences monetary policy, which affects liquidity conditions and investor risk tolerance—factors that impact all risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Which economic indicator matters most for crypto traders? The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) typically has the most significant immediate impact because it directly influences Federal Reserve policy decisions. However, employment data and central bank speeches also provide important clues about future monetary policy direction. Should I adjust my crypto trading strategy around these events? Yes, prudent traders often reduce leverage and position sizes before major economic announcements due to increased volatility. Some traders also watch for patterns in how cryptocurrencies react to specific types of economic data to inform future decisions. How quickly do crypto markets react to economic data releases? Reactions are typically immediate, often within minutes of data releases. However, sometimes the full impact takes hours to materialize as markets digest the information and consider implications for future policy. Do all cryptocurrencies react the same way to economic news? Generally, Bitcoin and major cryptocurrencies show stronger reactions than smaller altcoins, though there are exceptions. Bitcoin often acts as a bellwether, with other digital assets following its lead during periods of macroeconomic-driven volatility. Where can I find reliable economic calendars for crypto trading? Many cryptocurrency exchanges and financial websites provide economic calendars. Look for ones that highlight events likely to impact digital assets specifically, not just traditional markets.

The platform excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens to provide a pure measure of speculative momentum. When 75% of these altcoins outperform Bitcoin, we enter what traders call an altcoin season, marked by a reading closer to 100. Currently, with the index at just 20, the message is clear: Bitcoin continues to dominate the crypto landscape. This reading suggests that only a small fraction of major altcoins have managed to outpace Bitcoin’s performance in recent months. Understanding this metric helps investors make informed decisions about asset allocation and timing. Why Should You Care About This 20 Reading? A low Altcoin Season Index reading carries several important implications for cryptocurrency investors. First, it indicates that capital remains concentrated in Bitcoin rather than flowing into alternative cryptocurrencies. This concentration often happens during periods of market uncertainty or when investors seek perceived safety in the original cryptocurrency. Second, the current reading suggests that: Bitcoin dominance remains strong in the market structure Most altcoins are struggling to gain independent momentum Risk appetite for alternative cryptocurrencies may be limited The market may be waiting for a catalyst to shift sentiment How Can You Use This Information Strategically? Smart investors don’t just watch the Altcoin Season Index—they use it to inform their strategy. When the index reads this low, it might signal several potential approaches. Some traders view this as an accumulation opportunity for promising altcoins that have underperformed. Others see it as confirmation to maintain higher Bitcoin allocations until conditions change. Historical patterns show that extreme readings often precede market shifts. While the current Altcoin Season Index suggests caution for altcoin investors, it also provides valuable context for understanding market cycles. Monitoring this indicator alongside other metrics can help you time entry and exit points more effectively. What Triggers a Shift in the Altcoin Season Index? Several factors can cause the Altcoin Season Index to climb from current levels. Major developments in blockchain technology, regulatory clarity for specific projects, or breakthrough applications can drive capital into altcoins. Additionally, when Bitcoin’s price stabilizes or consolidates, investors often seek higher returns in alternative cryptocurrencies. The index typically moves gradually rather than abruptly. A sustained period of altcoin outperformance is needed to push the reading toward 75, the threshold for a confirmed altcoin season. This makes the current reading of 20 particularly significant—it shows how far the market would need to move to enter true altcoin season territory. Key Takeaways for Crypto Investors The Altcoin Season Index at 20 delivers a clear message about current market conditions. Bitcoin continues to command investor attention and capital, while most altcoins struggle to keep pace. This doesn’t mean altcoins lack potential—it simply reflects where we are in the current market cycle. Successful investors use indicators like the Altcoin Season Index as one tool among many. They combine this data with fundamental analysis, technical indicators, and market sentiment to make balanced decisions. Remember that market conditions can change rapidly, and today’s reading of 20 could be tomorrow’s opportunity. Frequently Asked Questions What does an Altcoin Season Index of 20 mean? An Altcoin Season Index reading of 20 indicates that only about 20% of top altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. This suggests strong Bitcoin dominance and weak altcoin performance relative to the market leader. How often does CoinMarketCap update the Altcoin Season Index? CoinMarketCap typically updates market indices regularly, but the exact frequency can vary. The index calculation uses rolling 90-day performance data, so it reflects sustained trends rather than daily fluctuations. Should I avoid altcoins when the index is this low? Not necessarily. Some investors use low Altcoin Season Index readings as contrarian indicators or accumulation opportunities. However, it does suggest exercising caution and conducting thorough research before making significant altcoin investments. What level indicates a true altcoin season? A true altcoin season is generally indicated when the Altcoin Season Index reaches 75 or higher. This means at least 75% of top altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the preceding 90-day period. Can the index predict future price movements? While the Altcoin Season Index reflects past performance, many traders use it as one indicator among many to gauge market sentiment and potential trend changes. It shouldn’t be used alone for prediction but as part of a comprehensive analysis. Does this index include all cryptocurrencies? The index focuses on the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens. This provides a cleaner measure of speculative altcoin performance against Bitcoin. Share This Market Insight Found this analysis of the Altcoin Season Index helpful?

Market commentators suggest that while SOL slows near $150, a smaller altcoin priced at $0.035 is rapidly gaining attention as buyers push Phase 6 toward 99% completion. Early investor sentiment indicates that capital may be shifting from established assets toward early-stage tokens with stronger upside potential. Solana (SOL) Solana was once one of the fastest-growing assets in the market. It surged from low levels into a multibillion-dollar market cap during its breakout cycle. Its speed, broad ecosystem and early visibility helped SOL become one of the most recognized Layer 1 assets. Today the chart is telling a different story. SOL is now trading below $150 and faces repeated rejection near key resistance zones. Analysts tracking crypto charts say that while Solana still has strong fundamentals, its size now slows performance. Large market caps require massive inflows to generate strong gains. Solana’s early surge gave it huge visibility, but it also raised expectations that the current market conditions cannot easily match. Some analysts point out that trend strength is fading. Breakout attempts are weaker and volume does not support fast moves. This is why many traders believe SOL’s upside going into 2026 may remain limited unless a major catalyst arrives. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a rotation target for investors searching for earlier-stage alternatives. The project is building a lending and borrowing protocol designed to reward suppliers with predictable yield and give borrowers flexible access to credit. The system works through two coordinated markets. In the supply market, users deposit assets into a liquidity pool and receive mtTokens. These mtTokens grow in redeemable value as interest enters the protocol. A user who supplies ETH receives mtETH and later redeems it for a higher amount of ETH as borrowing activity increases. In the loan market, borrowers post collateral, choose loan terms and interact with rate models shaped by utilization and LTV limits. The presale has shown strong demand. MUTM began at $0.01 in early 2025 and now trades at $0.035, marking a rise of more than 250%. The project has raised $19.30M, attracted 18,500 holders and sold 820M tokens. Out of the 4B total supply, 1.82B tokens are allocated to the presale. Phase 6 is now close to 99% completion, and users following top cryptocurrencies say this acceleration reflects growing confidence in the project’s long-term vision. Price Predictions: SOL vs MUTM When comparing price outlooks, analysts highlight the different positions of these two assets. Solana’s Weak Price Forecast Solana is a mature asset with deep liquidity, broad recognition and a large market cap. These strengths also limit its growth potential in the short term. Some analysts predict that SOL may only deliver mild gains going into 2026. In a bullish scenario, projections show a small x increase at best. The main challenge is scale. Large-cap assets require billions in capital to move aggressively. Solana’s resistance levels around $150 and $160 make it harder for the token to repeat the explosive moves from its early cycle. Mutuum Finance’s Stronger Outlook Mutuum Finance enters from the opposite direction. It is priced low, demand is rising and Phase 6 is almost sold out. Analysts say these early-stage conditions give MUTM more flexibility for growth. The token’s mechanics also support long-term expansion. mtTokens increase as borrowing grows. The buy-and-distribute model adds steady buying pressure because MUTM purchased on the open market is redistributed to users who stake mtTokens in the safety module. Early analyst models show the potential for MUTM to rise several times above its current level if adoption picks up during the testnet stage. The upcoming launch price of $0.06 already places Phase 1 participants near a 500% position. As long as market conditions improve and borrowing activity rises, additional gains become possible. Some analysts believe MUTM may deliver a far stronger run than SOL during the next cycle because early-stage tokens do not require huge inflows to move. Leaderboard and Whale Accumulation Security progress has been a major factor supporting interest in Mutuum Finance. The project completed its CertiK audit with a 90/100 Token Scan score. Halborn Security is reviewing the finalized code and the team launched a $50K bug bounty to find vulnerabilities before V1 goes live. Analysts say these steps help MUTM stand out from many early-stage projects that delay audits until later. Community activity has also grown. The 24-hour leaderboard rewards the top daily contributor with $500 in MUTM, which keeps engagement strong throughout the presale. Card payments are available, making it easy for new users to enter without exchange transfers. Solana’s growth outlook is limited by size and resistance levels. Mutuum Finance is entering the opposite phase. It is growing fast, attracting more holders and completing Phase 6 at a rapid pace. With mtToken utility, strong audits, clear V1 timing and rising user participation, analysts believe MUTM could outperform many larger assets during the next crypto cycle.

The crypto titan now holds over 2 million ASTER tokens, a disclosure that has sparked intense discussion and analysis. What does this mean for the Changpeng Zhao ASTER connection and the token’s future? Let’s dive into the details and implications of this high-profile crypto move. What Is Changpeng Zhao’s ASTER Position? Changpeng Zhao took to social media platform X to make his holdings public. He shared a transaction screenshot showing a total of 2,090,598.14 ASTER tokens. According to the data, his average acquisition price was $0.913 per token. This transparent move from a figure of his stature is uncommon and immediately places a spotlight on the ASTER project. This follows an earlier hint from CZ on November 2nd, where he first shared part of his transaction history. The full revelation confirms a significant, deliberate allocation of personal capital. For investors and observers, a Changpeng Zhao ASTER investment of this scale acts as a powerful signal in the often-opaque crypto markets. Why Does CZ’s ASTER Investment Matter? When a former exchange CEO of a global platform invests millions into a specific asset, the market pays attention. This move goes beyond simple speculation. It suggests a calculated belief in the project’s fundamentals or future utility. Here are the key reasons this news is significant: Credibility Boost: CZ’s reputation brings immediate attention and a layer of credibility to the ASTER project. Market Sentiment: Large, public investments from known figures can influence retail investor sentiment and trading volume. Narrative Shift: It shifts the conversation around ASTER from being just another token to one with notable backer confidence. The Changpeng Zhao ASTER disclosure is therefore not just a portfolio update; it’s a market event. It prompts a deeper look into what ASTER offers that attracted such a substantial commitment. What Challenges Come With This Spotlight? While the attention is largely positive, it introduces new dynamics for the ASTER ecosystem. The token’s price may experience heightened volatility based on CZ’s future statements or market movements. Furthermore, the project’s team may face increased scrutiny and pressure to deliver on its roadmap. For everyday investors, the key takeaway is to conduct independent research. The Changpeng Zhao ASTER news is a compelling data point, but it should not be the sole reason for an investment decision. Understanding the token’s use case, technology, and team is crucial. Actionable Insights from CZ’s Crypto Move What can we learn from this situation? First, transparency from major figures can be a powerful tool for building trust. Second, it highlights the importance of tracking smart money movements in crypto. Finally, it reminds us that even the most experienced players are actively searching for and backing new opportunities beyond the largest blue-chip assets. The Changpeng Zhao ASTER story is a masterclass in market signaling. For the savvy observer, it underscores the value of monitoring the investment behaviors of industry leaders, as they often have access to deeper research and insights. Conclusion: A Vote of Confidence in the Crypto Ecosystem Changpeng Zhao’s decision to publicly hold over 2 million ASTER tokens is a stunning endorsement. It demonstrates his ongoing engagement with the crypto space and his willingness to back specific projects post-Binance. This move likely fuels further interest in ASTER and serves as a reminder that innovation in cryptocurrency continues to attract capital and confidence from its most influential pioneers. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How many ASTER tokens does Changpeng Zhao own? Changpeng Zhao has publicly disclosed that he holds 2,090,598.14 ASTER tokens. At what price did CZ buy ASTER? According to the transaction history he shared, his average acquisition price was $0.913 per ASTER token. Why did CZ make his ASTER investment public? While his exact motive isn’t known, such transparency can build trust, influence market sentiment, and show personal belief in a project’s potential. Does CZ’s investment mean ASTER is a guaranteed success? No. While it’s a strong positive signal, all cryptocurrency investments carry risk. Investors should always do their own research (DYOR). What is the ASTER token? ASTER is a cryptocurrency token. For specific details on its use case and technology, please refer to the project’s official documentation and website.

Starting in 2027, the UK will formally regulate crypto as financial products, bringing them under the strict oversight of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). This decision marks the end of the ‘Wild West’ era for digital assets in Britain and signals a new chapter of legitimacy and security. But what does this mean for you as an investor, a business owner, or simply someone watching the future of finance unfold? Let’s break down this transformative UK crypto regulation and its far-reaching implications. What Does the New UK Crypto Regulation Actually Mean? The core of the announcement is straightforward: cryptocurrencies will no longer exist in a regulatory gray area. From 2027, they will be treated with the same seriousness as stocks, bonds, and other traditional financial instruments. The Treasury, led by Chancellor Rachel Reeves, has made it clear that this is a strategic step to cement the UK’s position as a global financial hub in the digital age. Therefore, any firm dealing with crypto assets that falls under anti-money laundering laws must register with the FCA. This move directly addresses years of concern over inadequate consumer protection, where crypto investments lacked the safety nets of regulated markets. Why is the UK Taking This Step Now? The government’s rationale is built on three key pillars: protection, innovation, and leadership. First, the primary driver is consumer protection . Previously, if something went wrong with a crypto investment, consumers had very limited recourse. By bringing crypto into the ‘regulatory perimeter,’ the FCA can enforce rules that prevent fraud, ensure transparency, and mandate fair practices. Second, Chancellor Reeves emphasizes that clear rules are meant to encourage, not stifle, innovation . Businesses and investors often hesitate to commit significant resources to uncertain environments. This new UK crypto regulation framework provides the legal certainty needed for long-term planning and investment. Finally, it’s about global competition. As other financial centers like the EU and parts of Asia establish their own crypto rules, the UK is positioning itself to attract blockchain businesses and capital by offering a robust yet clear regulatory landscape. Key Changes and Immediate Impacts of the Regulation So, what will change on the ground when 2027 arrives? The new rules will introduce several critical requirements for crypto firms operating in the UK: Mandatory FCA Registration: Crypto businesses must be authorized, ensuring they meet strict operational standards. Enhanced Consumer Redress: Investors gain access to official complaint channels and potential compensation schemes, similar to traditional finance. Strict Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Checks: Firms will need to implement rigorous ‘Know Your Customer’ (KYC) procedures to prevent illicit finance. Transparency and Disclosure: Companies will be required to provide clear, non-misleading information about the risks and nature of crypto products. This structured approach aims to filter out bad actors while providing a safe runway for legitimate companies to grow. For the average person, buying Bitcoin or Ethereum will feel more like buying a share—a process backed by defined rules and protections. What Are the Potential Challenges Ahead? While the intent is positive, implementing such a sweeping UK crypto regulation is not without hurdles. One major challenge is the sheer diversity of crypto assets. Regulating a stablecoin like USDC is very different from regulating a volatile meme coin or a complex DeFi protocol. The FCA will need to create a nuanced framework that can adapt to this fast-evolving technology. Another concern is the potential for over-regulation. The crypto industry thrives on permissionless innovation. If the rules are too burdensome, they could push talented developers and entrepreneurs to more lenient jurisdictions. The UK’s success will hinge on striking a delicate balance between safety and innovation. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Crypto in Britain The UK’s plan to regulate crypto as financial products is a defining moment. It represents a mature acknowledgment that digital assets are here to stay and must be integrated responsibly into the financial system. This move promises greater security for consumers and clearer rules for businesses, potentially unleashing a new wave of institutional investment. However, its ultimate success will depend on thoughtful execution that protects users without smothering the innovative spirit at the heart of the crypto revolution. The journey to 2027 will be one to watch closely, as it will shape not just the UK’s financial future, but offer a blueprint for other nations navigating the same path. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: When does the new UK crypto regulation start? A: The new regulatory framework is scheduled to come into effect starting in 2027. Q: Which body will oversee crypto regulation? A: The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will be the primary regulator for cryptocurrencies, treating them as financial products. Q: Will this make buying crypto in the UK safer? A: Yes, that is a primary goal. The regulations aim to provide consumer protections similar to those in traditional finance, including transparency rules and recourse for disputes. Q: Do all crypto companies have to register? A: Yes, any crypto firm operating in the UK that is subject to anti-money laundering laws will be required to register with the FCA. Q: Could this regulation hurt crypto innovation in the UK? A: The government states the goal is to encourage innovation by providing legal clarity. However, if the rules are too restrictive, some businesses may choose to operate elsewhere. The balance will be key. Q: How does this compare to crypto regulation in other countries? A: It places the UK alongside other major economies like the EU (with its MiCA framework) in creating a comprehensive regulatory system, moving beyond the more fragmented approach seen in places like the United States.

55797176,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=245304,1765761611,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crucial Stand: Fed Chair Candidate Hassett Vows to Resist White House Pressure,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/fed-chair-candidate-resists-pressure/,"BitcoinWorld Crucial Stand: Fed Chair Candidate Hassett Vows to Resist White House Pressure In a statement with significant implications for financial markets and cryptocurrency investors, Kevin Hassett has made a crucial declaration about Federal Reserve independence. As a potential Fed chair candidate , Hassett’s commitment to resisting political pressure could shape monetary policy for years to come. This development matters because the Fed’s decisions directly influence inflation, interest rates, and ultimately, the investment landscape for both traditional and digital assets. Why Does This Fed Chair Candidate’s Stance Matter? Kevin Hassett currently serves as Director of the White House National Economic Council, placing him in a unique position regarding Federal Reserve leadership. During a recent interview with CBS’s Face the Nation, this potential Fed chair candidate emphasized that he would not yield to attempts from President Donald Trump or any administration official to influence central bank policy. His statement comes at a critical time when markets are particularly sensitive to signals about monetary policy direction. The Federal Reserve’s independence represents a cornerstone of modern economic stability. When Hassett states he would maintain this independence, he’s essentially promising to base decisions on economic data rather than political considerations. For cryptocurrency investors, this matters because: Interest rate decisions directly impact investment flows Monetary policy transparency creates predictable market conditions Inflation management affects the value of both fiat and digital currencies How Would This Fed Chair Candidate Protect Central Bank Independence? Hassett outlined his approach clearly during the interview. He emphasized that the Federal Reserve’s role requires building consensus among the Board of Governors and Federal Open Market Committee members regarding interest rate direction. Importantly, he stated this process must occur under the Fed Chair’s leadership without external interference. This potential Fed chair candidate understands that political pressure on central banks typically follows a predictable pattern. Administrations often prefer lower interest rates to stimulate economic growth, especially during election years. However, maintaining independence sometimes requires making unpopular decisions that serve long-term economic health rather than short-term political goals. What Challenges Would This Fed Chair Candidate Face? Resisting White House pressure represents no simple task for any Fed chair candidate , particularly one with current administration ties. Hassett would need to navigate several significant challenges: Balancing relationships with former colleagues in the administration Maintaining credibility with financial markets and international partners Communicating decisions transparently to prevent market uncertainty Managing expectations during economic transitions or crises Historical examples demonstrate how difficult this balance can be. Previous Fed chairs have faced similar pressures during various administrations, with some managing independence more successfully than others. The cryptocurrency market, being particularly sensitive to monetary policy signals, would closely watch how any new Fed leadership handles these pressures. What Does This Mean for Cryptocurrency Investors? The stance taken by this potential Fed chair candidate carries specific implications for digital asset markets. A truly independent Federal Reserve typically means: More predictable monetary policy based on economic indicators Reduced political uncertainty in interest rate decisions Greater institutional confidence in the financial system Clearer signals about inflation and currency valuation Cryptocurrency markets have increasingly correlated with traditional financial markets in recent years. Therefore, Federal Reserve decisions about interest rates and quantitative easing directly impact investment flows into and out of digital assets. When the Fed maintains clear, independent policies, investors can make more informed decisions about portfolio allocation between traditional and cryptocurrency investments. Actionable Insights for Monitoring This Development As this Fed chair candidate situation develops, cryptocurrency investors should consider several monitoring strategies: Watch confirmation hearings for specific policy statements Monitor market reactions to Fed appointment announcements Review historical patterns of Fed independence during different administrations Consider portfolio adjustments based on likely monetary policy directions Remember that Federal Reserve leadership transitions typically create short-term market volatility followed by longer-term adjustments as policies become clearer. The commitment to independence expressed by this potential Fed chair candidate suggests continuity in current approaches to monetary policy, but investors should remain attentive to confirmation processes and early policy statements. Conclusion: A Crucial Moment for Monetary Policy Independence Kevin Hassett’s declaration as a potential Fed chair candidate represents more than just political positioning—it signals a commitment to maintaining the institutional integrity that underpins global financial stability. His vow to resist White House pressure acknowledges the delicate balance between economic stewardship and political reality. For cryptocurrency markets that thrive on transparency and predictability, this stance offers reassurance that monetary policy decisions will continue to be based on economic fundamentals rather than political considerations. As the selection process continues, investors should watch how this commitment to independence translates into specific policy approaches that will shape both traditional and digital asset markets for years to come. Frequently Asked Questions Who is Kevin Hassett? Kevin Hassett serves as Director of the White House National Economic Council and is considered a potential candidate for the next Federal Reserve Chair position. He previously chaired the Council of Economic Advisers and has extensive experience in economic policy. Why is Federal Reserve independence important? Federal Reserve independence allows the central bank to make monetary policy decisions based on economic data rather than political pressure. This independence helps maintain price stability, control inflation, and support sustainable economic growth without short-term political interference. How does Fed policy affect cryptocurrency markets? Federal Reserve decisions on interest rates and monetary supply directly influence investment flows, inflation expectations, and currency values. Since cryptocurrency markets increasingly correlate with traditional markets, Fed policy affects investor sentiment and capital allocation toward digital assets. What challenges would a Fed chair face in maintaining independence? A Federal Reserve Chair must balance relationships with the administration that appointed them while making sometimes unpopular decisions that serve long-term economic health. They must maintain credibility with financial markets, communicate decisions clearly, and resist pressure for politically convenient but economically unsound policies. How can investors monitor Fed leadership developments? Investors should watch confirmation hearings for policy statements, monitor market reactions to appointment news, review historical patterns of Fed independence, and consider how different leadership approaches might affect their investment strategies across both traditional and digital assets. What historical examples show Fed chairs resisting political pressure? Historical examples include Paul Volcker’s fight against inflation in the early 1980s despite political opposition, and Alan Greenspan’s maintenance of independence during multiple administrations. More recently, Jerome Powell has faced pressure regarding interest rate decisions while attempting to maintain policy independence.

In a major move for mainstream adoption, the popular Solana wallet, Phantom, has announced plans to launch a debit card in the United States. This Phantom debit card promises to seamlessly connect the digital asset world with your everyday financial life, offering a powerful new tool for millions of users. What Does the Phantom Debit Card Actually Do? Phantom revealed its plans via a post on X (formerly Twitter), signaling a significant expansion beyond its core wallet functionality. The card is designed to act as a direct bridge between your cryptocurrency holdings and the traditional financial system. After completing a standard identity verification process (KYC), users will be able to obtain the physical or virtual card. The primary services enabled by this card are crucial for practical crypto use: Fiat On-Ramps: Easily convert your US dollars into cryptocurrency directly within the Phantom ecosystem. Fiat Off-Ramps: Instantly convert your crypto assets into spendable fiat currency loaded onto the card. Bank Account Transfers: Move funds between your traditional bank account and your Phantom card with ease. Why is This Phantom Debit Card a Game-Changer? For years, a major hurdle for crypto adoption has been the friction between holding digital assets and using them for daily expenses. This move by Phantom directly tackles that challenge. Instead of navigating multiple exchanges and waiting for bank transfers, users can theoretically manage everything from a single, familiar interface. Imagine paying for groceries, filling your gas tank, or shopping online directly with the value of your SOL or other supported tokens. The Phantom debit card aims to make that a seamless reality, effectively turning your wallet into a hybrid bank account. This represents a substantial step toward the “crypto as usable currency” vision that many in the space advocate for. What Are the Potential Benefits and Considerations? The benefits of this integration are compelling. It offers unparalleled convenience, reduces the steps needed to spend crypto, and could enhance financial inclusion for those more engaged with digital assets than traditional banking. Furthermore, it strengthens Phantom’s position as a comprehensive financial hub rather than just a storage tool. However, users should also be mindful of common considerations with crypto cards: Fees: Details on transaction, conversion, or monthly fees have not yet been disclosed. Supported Assets: It’s unclear which specific cryptocurrencies will be spendable via the card initially. Regulatory Compliance: The required identity verification aligns with US regulations but is a step some decentralized purists may dislike. How Does This Shape the Future of Crypto Wallets? Phantom’s announcement is part of a broader trend of wallets evolving into super-apps. The launch of a Phantom debit card signals that the competition is no longer just about security and token support; it’s about full-stack financial utility. This pressures other wallet providers to innovate similarly or risk losing users to platforms that offer these integrated banking services. For the average American crypto user, the future looks increasingly convenient. The wall between decentralized finance (DeFi) and everyday commerce is getting thinner, and tools like this card are the sledgehammer making it happen. Conclusion: A Major Step Toward Mainstream Crypto Utility The impending launch of the Phantom debit card in the US is more than just a new product; it’s a statement. It signifies a maturation of the crypto industry where usability and real-world application take center stage. By bridging the gap between digital assets and the point-of-sale, Phantom is not just simplifying transactions—it’s actively working to make cryptocurrency a practical part of millions of daily financial lives. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: When will the Phantom debit card be available? A1: Phantom has announced the plan but has not yet released a specific public launch date. Stay tuned to their official channels for updates. Q2: Will I need to complete KYC to get the card? A2: Yes, identity verification will be a required step to obtain and use the Phantom debit card, in compliance with US financial regulations. Q3: Can I use the card anywhere? A3: While specific details are pending, it is expected to function like a standard debit card, usable anywhere that accepts Visa or Mastercard (depending on its network). Q4: What cryptocurrencies can I spend with the card? A4: The full list of supported assets has not been finalized. It will likely support major assets like SOL and possibly others in the Phantom ecosystem. Q5: Are there any geographic restrictions? A5: The initial launch is specifically for users in the United States. Expansion to other regions may follow. Q6: How is this different from other crypto debit cards? A6: Its key differentiator is deep integration directly within the Phantom wallet app, potentially offering a smoother user experience for existing Phantom users.

55797445,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=245312,1765762211,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revealed: Why Tether’s $1.1 Billion Juventus Acquisition Bid Was Rejected,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/tether-juventus-acquisition-bid-rejected/,"BitcoinWorld Revealed: Why Tether’s $1.1 Billion Juventus Acquisition Bid Was Rejected In a stunning move that bridges the worlds of high finance, cryptocurrency, and elite sports, stablecoin issuer Tether made a colossal play for Italian football giant Juventus. However, the club’s century-old controlling shareholder delivered a firm and unanimous rejection. This Tether Juventus acquisition attempt marks a pivotal moment, highlighting both the ambitious reach of crypto firms and the formidable barriers to traditional sports ownership. What Was Tether’s Juventus Acquisition Offer? According to reports from Cointelegraph, Tether proposed a takeover bid valuing the entire club at approximately €1 billion, or about $1.1 billion. The offer broke down to €2.66 per share. This bold move targeted one of the most iconic brands in global football, a club with a massive international fanbase and a storied history in Serie A. The proposed Tether Juventus acquisition immediately raised eyebrows across financial and sporting circles. Why Did Exor Reject the Bid? The rejection was swift and decisive. On December 14, Exor, the holding company of the Agnelli family, issued an official statement. Its board unanimously turned down Tether’s proposal. Exor is no ordinary shareholder; it controls a dominant 65.4% stake in Juventus and has been the club’s guiding force for over 100 years. This legacy creates a high barrier for any external takeover. Key reasons for the rejection likely include: Legacy and Control: The Agnelli family views Juventus as a core part of its identity, not just a financial asset. Strategic Vision: The club is in the midst of a long-term sporting and financial rebuilding project. Regulatory Scrutiny: Linking a major football institution to a cryptocurrency firm could invite complex regulatory challenges. What Does This Mean for Crypto in Sports? This failed Tether Juventus acquisition is a landmark case study. While cryptocurrency companies have successfully entered sports through sponsorships and fan tokens, direct ownership of a top-tier club is a different challenge entirely. Tether’s attempt shows the sector’s growing confidence and capital. However, the rejection underscores that deep-rooted, traditional institutions are not easily swayed by crypto wealth alone. The deal’s collapse signals that for crypto firms, the path to major sports ownership may require more than just a compelling financial offer. The Bigger Picture: Challenges and Future Prospects This event forces us to ask a critical question: Are traditional football dynasties ready for crypto ownership? The answer, for now, appears mixed. On one hand, clubs constantly seek new revenue streams and global engagement, areas where crypto and blockchain offer innovative solutions. On the other hand, the volatility and regulatory uncertainty surrounding crypto assets pose significant risks to a club’s stability and reputation. Therefore, future attempts may focus on minority stakes or partnerships rather than outright acquisition. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Both Worlds The rejected Tether Juventus acquisition bid is more than a simple business news item. It is a defining moment at the intersection of two powerful industries. It demonstrates the aggressive expansion strategy of leading crypto entities while simultaneously revealing the resilience of traditional sports governance. For fans and investors, it serves as a clear reminder that in the high-stakes game of football club ownership, history, legacy, and long-term vision can outweigh even the most substantial financial proposal. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: How much was Tether’s bid for Juventus? A1: Tether’s acquisition offer valued Juventus at approximately €1 billion, or about $1.1 billion US dollars. Q2: Who currently owns Juventus Football Club? A2: The majority owner is Exor, the holding company of Italy’s Agnelli family, which controls a 65.4% stake in the club. Q3: Why would Tether want to buy a football club? A3: Acquiring a globally recognized brand like Juventus offers immense marketing value, mainstream legitimacy, and a platform to integrate crypto-based fan engagement and payment solutions. Q4: Has any cryptocurrency company successfully bought a major sports team? A4: While there have been investments and sponsorships, a full acquisition of a top-tier football club of Juventus’s stature by a pure-play crypto firm has not yet occurred. This rejection highlights the significant hurdles. Q5: What is Exor, and why is its decision so important? A5: Exor is a major investment company controlled by the Agnelli family. Its unanimous rejection is crucial because it holds the controlling stake, effectively making the final decision on any sale. Q6: Could Tether or another crypto firm try again in the future? A6: While possible, any future attempt would likely need to address the concerns of legacy, control, and long-term strategy that led to this rejection, potentially through a different structure like a minority investment.

Leading the charge is LayerZero (ZRO), unlocking tokens worth a staggering $37.8 million. This event can create pivotal moments for prices and portfolio strategies. Let’s break down what’s happening and why it matters for your investments. What Are Token Unlocks and Why Do They Matter? In simple terms, a token unlock is when previously locked or vested cryptocurrency tokens become available for trading. Teams often lock tokens for founders, early investors, and developers to align long-term incentives. However, when these token unlocks occur, the sudden increase in circulating supply can potentially put downward pressure on the token’s price if selling ensues. Therefore, tracking these events is a crucial part of market analysis. Which Major Projects Are Unlocking Tokens This Week? According to data from Tokenomist, several prominent blockchain projects have scheduled releases from December 15 to December 21. Here is the breakdown of the major token unlocks : December 15: Starknet (STRK) unlocks 127M tokens ($13.2M), Sei (SEI) unlocks 55.56M tokens ($6.93M). December 16: Arbitrum (ARB) unlocks 92.65M tokens ($19M). December 20: LayerZero (ZRO) unlocks 25.71M tokens ($37.79M), Lista DAO (LISTA) unlocks 33.44M tokens ($5.34M). This cumulative event represents a major test of market absorption and investor sentiment. Why Is the ZRO Token Unlock So Significant? LayerZero’s (ZRO) release stands out for two key reasons. First, its $37.8 million value is the largest single unlock by dollar amount this week. Second, the 25.71 million tokens represent 6.79% of its current circulating supply—a notably high percentage. This larger relative supply increase means the ZRO token unlock has a higher potential to influence its market price compared to others, making it the week’s most watched event. How Should Investors Navigate Token Unlock Events? Facing a major token unlock doesn’t automatically mean you should sell. However, it does call for a strategic review. Consider the project’s fundamentals, overall market conditions, and historical price action around past unlocks. Some projects weather these events well if demand remains strong. The key is to avoid panic and make informed decisions based on data, not fear. Conclusion: Stay Informed, Stay Strategic This week’s slate of token unlocks , led by ZRO’s substantial release, highlights the importance of understanding tokenomics. While unlocks can introduce volatility, they are a normal part of the crypto lifecycle for maturing projects. By monitoring these events and analyzing the context, you can better position your portfolio to manage risk and identify potential opportunities that arise from market movements. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a token unlock? A token unlock is when previously restricted cryptocurrency tokens are released into the circulating supply, often for team members, advisors, or early investors, making them available for trading. Do token unlocks always cause the price to drop? Not always. While increased selling pressure can lead to price drops, the impact depends on overall market demand, the project’s health, and whether recipients decide to hold or sell their newly unlocked tokens. How can I find out about upcoming token unlocks? You can use crypto analytics platforms and calendars like Token Unlocks, CoinMarketCap, or dedicated services like Tokenomist to track scheduled vesting events. Is the ZRO unlock the biggest this week? Yes, in terms of total dollar value released ($37.8 million), the LayerZero (ZRO) token unlock is the largest single event scheduled for this week. What percentage of supply is ARB unlocking? Arbitrum (ARB) is unlocking 92.65 million tokens, which represents 1.9% of its current circulating supply. Should I sell my tokens before an unlock event? There is no one-size-fits-all answer. It depends on your investment thesis, risk tolerance, and analysis of the specific project. Some investors choose to reduce exposure before large unlocks, while others see it as a buying opportunity if the price dips.

The ruling Democratic Party prepares to block the Bank of Korea’s controversial proposals for a national won stablecoin . This confrontation could reshape how digital assets operate in one of Asia’s most active crypto markets. Why Is South Korea’s Won Stablecoin Plan Sparking Conflict? According to reports from Yonhap Infomax, the Democratic Party’s Digital Asset Task Force will reject two key central bank demands. First, they oppose limiting won stablecoin issuance to bank-led consortiums where banks maintain over 51% control. Second, they plan to discard the proposal for a policy council requiring unanimous decisions. This legislation represents the second phase of South Korea’s Digital Asset Basic Act. The central bank’s approach emphasizes strict control, while the ruling party favors more open market participation. This fundamental disagreement creates uncertainty for investors and blockchain companies awaiting clear regulatory frameworks. What Are the Core Issues in the Stablecoin Debate? The conflict centers on who controls digital currency issuance and governance. The Bank of Korea prefers traditional financial institutions leading the won stablecoin ecosystem. However, the ruling party’s task force believes this approach stifles innovation and competition. Key points of contention include: Issuance Control: Should only bank-dominated consortiums create won-pegged stablecoins? Governance Power: Should a policy council have veto authority through unanimous voting? Market Access: How can South Korea balance financial stability with technological innovation? This debate matters because South Korea represents a major cryptocurrency market. Their regulatory decisions often influence other Asian economies considering similar digital currency frameworks. How Will This Impact South Korea’s Crypto Future? The political resistance suggests South Korea may adopt a more progressive stance than initially expected. Rather than replicating traditional banking structures for the won stablecoin , the country might embrace broader participation from fintech companies and blockchain startups. This development comes as global stablecoin regulation evolves rapidly. Other nations watch how South Korea navigates this complex balance between innovation and control. The outcome could either accelerate or hinder the country’s position in the digital economy race. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts, this political clash demonstrates how democratic processes shape technological adoption. The ruling party’s intervention shows that multiple stakeholders influence won stablecoin development, not just financial authorities. What Can We Learn From This Regulatory Standoff? South Korea’s experience offers valuable insights for other countries developing digital currency policies. The tension between centralized control and decentralized innovation appears universal. However, each nation must find its own balance based on local economic conditions and political dynamics. The won stablecoin debate highlights several important considerations: Traditional financial institutions often seek to maintain dominance in new digital systems Political parties increasingly recognize cryptocurrency’s economic importance Regulatory frameworks require compromise between stability and innovation As the Digital Asset Basic Act progresses, stakeholders should monitor how this conflict resolves. The final legislation will signal whether South Korea prioritizes financial conservatism or technological advancement in its won stablecoin approach. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Digital Currency Regulation South Korea stands at a cryptocurrency crossroads. The ruling party’s opposition to the central bank’s won stablecoin plan represents more than bureaucratic disagreement—it reflects fundamental questions about money, power, and innovation in the digital age. This political clash will determine whether South Korea’s digital currency future remains anchored in traditional banking or embraces broader technological possibilities. Frequently Asked Questions What is a won stablecoin? A won stablecoin is a cryptocurrency pegged to the value of South Korea’s national currency. It combines blockchain technology with price stability for everyday transactions and digital asset trading. Why does the Bank of Korea want bank-led consortiums? The central bank believes traditional financial institutions ensure greater stability and regulatory compliance. They worry that less regulated entities might create systemic risks in the financial system. What alternatives might the ruling party propose? While specific alternatives aren’t detailed in reports, the task force likely favors allowing fintech companies, blockchain platforms, and possibly non-bank financial institutions to participate in stablecoin issuance under appropriate regulations. How will this affect cryptocurrency trading in South Korea? The regulatory uncertainty might cause temporary hesitation among investors and exchanges. However, clearer regulations—even if delayed—typically benefit markets long-term by reducing legal ambiguity. When will the Digital Asset Basic Act be finalized? The legislation process continues with no confirmed timeline. Political negotiations between the ruling party, opposition, and government agencies will determine the final version and implementation schedule. Could this conflict delay South Korea’s digital currency development? Yes, political disagreements often slow legislative processes. However, thorough debate might produce better-balanced regulations that serve both stability and innovation goals. Found this analysis helpful?

A recent transaction has captured significant attention: a wallet address linked to Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin executed a sale of three different tokens. According to blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain, this activity resulted in the acquisition of $16,796 USDC. This event naturally leads to questions about market sentiment and potential implications. What Did the Vitalik Buterin-Linked Address Sell? The reported transaction, which occurred approximately five hours before the Lookonchain alert, involved three distinct assets. The address sold 1,400 UNI tokens, the governance token for the Uniswap decentralized exchange, for about $7,480. It also sold 10,000 Kyber Network Crystal (KNC) tokens, worth roughly $2,470. Finally, the sale included a substantial 40 trillion DINU tokens. This diverse portfolio move by an address connected to Vitalik Buterin sells crypto assets is a notable data point for analysts. Why Does a Vitalik Buterin Crypto Sale Matter? Transactions associated with high-profile founders like Vitalik Buterin are often scrutinized for signals. While individual sales are common and don’t necessarily reflect a founder’s broader outlook, they can influence retail investor perception. Therefore, understanding the context is crucial. Market Sentiment Gauge: Some traders view such sales as a potential indicator of profit-taking or a shift in asset allocation. Project Spotlight: The sale brings temporary attention to UNI, KNC, and DINU, potentially affecting their short-term trading volume. Reminder of On-Chain Transparency: This news highlights how blockchain data is public and constantly analyzed by firms like Lookonchain. It’s important to remember that the transaction might be routine portfolio management. However, the event where Vitalik Buterin sells crypto still provides a real-world case study in on-chain analytics and market reaction. Should You React When Founders Sell Crypto? Seeing a founder sell can be unsettling for token holders. However, a measured approach is wise. Large wallets, including those of founders, need liquidity for various reasons—from personal finances to funding new ventures or charitable donations. A single sale is rarely a definitive bearish signal for the underlying technology of a project like Ethereum. Instead of reacting impulsively, consider it one piece of a much larger puzzle. The core takeaway is that the action of a Vitalik Buterin sells crypto event should be analyzed, not feared. Key Takeaways and Actionable Insights This news offers several lessons for crypto participants. First, always verify information. The term “linked to” requires checking the source’s credibility. Second, use tools like Etherscan or analytics platforms to understand transaction contexts yourself. Finally, maintain a long-term perspective focused on technology and adoption, not isolated transactions. The fact that a Vitalik Buterin sells crypto story makes headlines shows the market’s maturity level and its focus on influential figures. In summary, the sale of UNI, KNC, and DINU by a Vitalik Buterin-associated address is a fascinating snapshot of the transparent, data-driven nature of crypto markets. It underscores the importance of on-chain intelligence while reminding investors to interpret such events with context and caution, not emotion. The enduring story remains Ethereum’s development and ecosystem growth, not any single transaction. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Does this mean Vitalik Buterin is losing faith in Ethereum? A: Not at all. This was a sale of other ecosystem tokens (UNI, KNC, DINU), not ETH. Founders often diversify or rebalance portfolios for numerous personal and financial reasons unrelated to their core project’s faith. Q2: How do we know the address is really linked to Vitalik Buterin? A: Blockchain analytics firms like Lookonchain track known wallets of public figures. These links are established through past verifiable transactions, public donations, or self-identification. However, it’s always good practice to review the evidence presented. Q3: Will this sale cause the price of UNI or KNC to drop? A: The sale was relatively small in the grand context of these tokens’ total market liquidity. While it may cause minor short-term volatility or social media discussion, a single sale of this size is unlikely to dictate long-term price trends. Q4: What is DINU? A: DINU is a meme token on the Ethereum blockchain. The sale of 40 trillion units highlights the vast supply of some meme coins, where transactions involve huge nominal numbers but relatively modest dollar values. Q5: Should I sell my tokens if a founder sells? A: Making investment decisions based solely on mimicking a founder’s single transaction is not a sound strategy. Conduct your own research based on the project’s fundamentals, roadmap, and your investment goals. Q6: Where can I track such on-chain transactions myself? A: You can use blockchain explorers like Etherscan for Ethereum to view any public address. For more sophisticated analysis and alerts on notable wallets, platforms like Lookonchain, Nansen, and Arkham Intelligence provide tools and dashboards.

Following their arrival in the city, sources close to the situation mentioned that what drew these crypto titans to Abu Dhabi was the rapid spread of news that significant investors were in the city during the crypto conference. According to the news, it was speculated that representatives from a $330 billion sovereign wealth fund were circulating, but it appeared to be challenging to locate them. Michael Saylor travels to the UAE seeking significant investors Following speculation that it is difficult to trace individuals from the $330 billion sovereign wealth fund, crypto executives rushed to the capital city and largest emirate of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). At this time, they moved from one conference to another, sharing details about private dinners featuring prominent personalities and seeking connections to members of the royal family. As they continued to exercise this practice, sources noted that Michael Saylor, the founder, former CEO, and current Executive Chairman of Strategy, was part of this group. He was spotted during the Bitcoin MENA conference . When reporters reached out to him to comment on this claim, Saylor stated that the stock price of his firm had drastically declined by more than half since midyear. Therefore, to address this issue, he explained that he had presented his strategy to gain more digital currency using various financial tools to hundreds of investors, including those from sovereign wealth funds. To get in touch with them, he had to travel via the Gulf. Some of the efforts Saylor implemented were to share a presentation with interested parties that described Strategy as a rocket fueled by Bitcoin, targeting a “$20 Trillion Idea.” Meanwhile, the president of Metaplanet, a Japanese hotel operator that established itself as a Bitcoin investor and has also faced a significant drop in stock prices, revealed on stage that the firm is seeking to raise funds via a new preferred-share project known as “MARS.” Other potential investors identified included Dominari Holdings, the investment bank frequently preferred by the Trump family, and the investment and securities division of South Korea’s Hanwha Group. Notably, Hanwha publicly stated its intention to make Abu Dhabi a key hub as it advances into cryptocurrency products. Crypto community raises concerns about the current market declines The current declines in the crypto market have caught many by surprise. Earlier, several believed that US President Donald Trump’s stance on crypto would significantly boost the industry, leading to considerable profits and faster adoption. While stock markets based in the US reportedly remained close to record highs, Bitcoin slowed down in October. This was after the sell-offs of several markets impacted traders and exchanges. Moreover, the plans Trump has set for cryptocurrency legislation have encountered criticism, as some Democratic lawmakers have slowed the progress of a new bill intended to establish regulations for the digital currency market. However, despite these challenges, individuals in the UAE have demonstrated an increased interest in the crypto sector. Get seen where it counts.

The BTC price has decisively broken through the $89,000 barrier, trading at $89,019.14 on the Binance USDT market. This surge isn’t just a number; it’s a powerful signal of renewed bullish momentum that has the entire digital asset space buzzing. What’s fueling this impressive climb, and is this the start of a new leg up for the world’s premier cryptocurrency? Let’s dive in. What’s Driving the Current BTC Price Surge? Several converging factors are likely contributing to Bitcoin’s strong performance. First, institutional adoption continues to build steadily, with more traditional finance firms exploring Bitcoin ETFs and treasury allocations. This creates a consistent base of demand. Second, macroeconomic conditions, such as concerns about inflation, often lead investors to seek assets perceived as stores of value. Moreover, positive network developments and growing mainstream acceptance are bolstering long-term confidence. Therefore, the current BTC price action reflects a combination of technical breakout and fundamental strength. Key Levels and Market Sentiment to Watch Breaking $89,000 is psychologically significant. Traders are now watching key resistance and support levels closely. Next Resistance: The $90,000 and $92,000 levels are the immediate hurdles. A clean break above these could open the path to previous all-time highs. Important Support: On the downside, the $86,500 and $84,000 zones must hold to maintain the bullish structure. Market Sentiment: The ‘fear and greed index’ often swings with such moves. Currently, sentiment is likely shifting towards greed, which requires cautious optimism. Understanding these levels helps you grasp the potential roadmap for the BTC price in the coming days. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Whether you’re a seasoned trader or a long-term holder, this move offers lessons. For holders, this is a validation of the ‘HODL’ strategy during volatility. For active traders, managing risk is paramount—consider setting stop-losses to protect profits. Furthermore, diversifying your portfolio beyond just Bitcoin can mitigate risk during sharp market moves. Remember, chasing a rally can be dangerous; always have a clear strategy based on your financial goals, not just the exciting BTC price chart. The Bigger Picture: What Does This Mean for Crypto? Bitcoin often acts as a tide that lifts all boats. A strong BTC price typically boosts sentiment across the altcoin market. This rally could attract new capital into the ecosystem, funding innovation in DeFi, NFTs, and Web3. However, it also brings increased regulatory scrutiny. The key takeaway is that Bitcoin’s health is intrinsically linked to the broader digital asset landscape. Its success paves the way for wider adoption and technological progress. In summary, Bitcoin’s breach of $89,000 is a pivotal moment fueled by institutional interest, macroeconomic trends, and solid market structure. While the short-term path may see volatility, this achievement reinforces Bitcoin’s dominant role in the financial future. The journey highlights the importance of staying informed and disciplined, regardless of where the BTC price goes next. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why did the BTC price jump above $89,000? A: The rally is likely due to a mix of increased institutional buying, positive market sentiment, and Bitcoin’s technical breakout from previous consolidation levels. Q2: Is it too late to buy Bitcoin now? A: “Timing the market” is extremely difficult. Most experts advise a strategy of dollar-cost averaging (investing a fixed amount regularly) rather than trying to buy at the exact bottom. Q3: Could the BTC price drop back down suddenly? A> Yes, cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility. Sharp corrections can follow strong rallies, so investors should be prepared for price swings and never invest more than they can afford to lose. Q4: How does Bitcoin’s price affect other cryptocurrencies? A: Bitcoin is the market leader. When its price rises strongly, it often creates positive sentiment that flows into major altcoins like Ethereum and Solana, though the correlation isn’t always perfect. Q5: Where is the safest place to track the real-time BTC price? A: Reputable cryptocurrency data aggregators like CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, or the charts on major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase provide reliable, real-time price information. Q6: What’s the next major target if Bitcoin holds above $89,000? A> The next significant psychological and technical resistance levels are at $90,000 and then the previous all-time high near $92,000-$93,000. Found this analysis of the surging BTC price helpful?

The platform confirmed a $2.7 million hack stemming from a critical flaw in its price feed system. This incident puts the spotlight back on one of DeFi’s most persistent challenges: oracle security. What Exactly Happened in the Aevo Hack? The Aevo hack was not a breach of its core trading engine. Instead, attackers found a weakness during an upgrade to the platform’s oracle—the external data source that provides real-time price information. By manipulating this price data, the exploiter created false market conditions to drain funds from specific contracts. Aevo’s team quickly clarified that its main Layer 2 exchange remained unaffected, but the damage to its reputation and user trust is significant. Why Are Oracle Vulnerabilities So Dangerous? Oracles act as bridges between blockchains and the outside world. When they fail or are manipulated, the consequences can be severe. This Aevo hack demonstrates a classic ‘oracle attack’ vector: Price Manipulation: Feeding incorrect asset prices to smart contracts. Liquidation Exploits: Triggering unfair liquidations of user positions. Arbitrage Loopholes: Creating artificial price differences to siphon funds. Therefore, securing these data feeds is paramount for any DeFi protocol’s survival. How Did Aevo Respond to the Security Breach? Transparency is crucial after a security incident. Aevo’s response included several key actions: Immediately pausing affected services to prevent further losses. Launching a full investigation into the oracle vulnerability . Communicating clearly that user funds on the main exchange were safe. Working with security firms to patch the flaw and prevent recurrence. This proactive approach helps maintain user confidence during a crisis. What Does This Mean for DeFi Security? The Aevo hack is more than an isolated event; it’s a lesson for the entire industry. While decentralized systems remove intermediaries, they introduce new technical risks. Oracle reliability remains a top concern. However, the incident also shows progress—the exploit was contained to a specific subsystem, preventing a total collapse. The future of DeFi depends on building more robust, attack-resistant oracle networks. Key Takeaways from the Aevo Exploit This event offers clear insights for both developers and users: For Projects: Security upgrades require extreme caution. Test oracle changes extensively in isolated environments before mainnet deployment. For Users: Understand that while main platforms may be secure, auxiliary contracts and features can carry hidden risks. For the Industry: Continuous auditing and bug bounty programs are non-negotiable for safeguarding assets. In conclusion, the $2.7 million Aevo hack serves as a costly but valuable stress test. It highlights the critical importance of oracle security in the DeFi stack. While the financial loss is substantial, the fact that the core exchange remained operational demonstrates layered security architecture can limit damage. The relentless pursuit of stronger, more decentralized oracles will define the next chapter of decentralized finance’s evolution. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Were my funds on the main Aevo exchange safe during the hack? A: Yes. Aevo confirmed the oracle vulnerability and subsequent hack only affected a specific subsystem. The main Layer 2 exchange and user funds there were not compromised. Q: What is an oracle in cryptocurrency? A: An oracle is a service that feeds external, real-world data (like asset prices) onto a blockchain so smart contracts can use it to execute agreements. It’s a critical link between off-chain and on-chain information. Q: Has Aevo recovered the stolen funds? A: As of the latest reports, the stolen $2.7 million has not been recovered. The team is investigating the incident and working with security partners. Recovery of funds in such exploits is often very difficult. Q: Should I avoid using Aevo after this hack? A: The decision is personal. The platform has been transparent about the incident, which was limited in scope. However, users should always conduct their own research and assess their risk tolerance when using any DeFi protocol. Q: How can DeFi platforms prevent future oracle hacks? A> Prevention involves using multiple, decentralized oracle networks, implementing time-delays for critical price updates, conducting rigorous smart contract audits, and running comprehensive bug bounty programs to find vulnerabilities before attackers do.

Data reveals that Matrixport, a major player in digital asset services, has executed a substantial withdrawal of ASTER tokens from the world’s largest exchange. This action, involving millions of dollars, raises immediate questions about market strategy and the future trajectory of the ASTER token. Let’s break down exactly what happened and why this Matrixport withdraws ASTER event matters to you. What Does the Matrixport ASTER Withdrawal Mean? According to on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain, a wallet address starting with 0x7BB8—widely associated with Matrixport—withdrew exactly 3 million ASTER tokens from Binance approximately 13 hours ago. At current market prices, this haul is valued at a staggering $2.84 million. This is not a routine transfer; it’s a major movement of capital that signals intent. When a large institutional service provider like Matrixport makes such a move, it often precedes a strategic shift, whether that’s for custody, staking, or preparing for future market activity. Therefore, this transaction is a powerful piece of market intelligence. It provides a clear, on-chain signal of institutional behavior that retail traders can use to inform their own decisions. The sheer size of the withdrawal suggests strong conviction. Why Should You Care About This Transaction? You might wonder why a single wallet activity deserves a headline. The reason is context and influence. Matrixport is not just any wallet holder; it’s a trusted gateway for billions in crypto assets. Its actions are closely watched. This specific event where Matrixport withdraws ASTER from a central exchange like Binance can have several implications: Reduced Selling Pressure: Moving tokens off an exchange typically means they are not immediately available for sale, which can be a bullish signal for the token’s price. Institutional Confidence: A large, unilateral purchase and withdrawal often indicates a long-term holding strategy, suggesting underlying confidence in the asset. Market Sentiment Indicator: Such moves can influence retail trader sentiment, potentially leading to increased buying activity or reduced selling. How Can You Track These Market-Moving Signals? The beauty of blockchain is its transparency. Anyone can follow the money. Platforms like Lookonchain, Etherscan, and others provide real-time data on whale wallets and institutional movements. By monitoring these flows, you gain an edge. For instance, seeing that Matrixport withdraws ASTER allows you to ask the right questions: Is this part of a larger trend? Are other institutions following suit? This data turns speculation into informed analysis. Moreover, understanding these flows helps demystify market volatility. A sudden price pump or dump often has a clear on-chain catalyst, like a massive exchange inflow or outflow. By learning to read these signals, you become a more proactive and less reactive participant in the crypto market. What’s the Future for ASTER After This Move? While no one can predict prices with certainty, major withdrawals create a tangible shift in token economics. With a significant chunk of circulating supply now potentially in cold storage, the available liquid supply on exchanges decreases. This can lead to increased price volatility, especially if demand remains steady or increases. The key is to watch for follow-up activity. Will Matrixport make further withdrawals? Will other large holders mirror this action? The Matrixport withdraws ASTER event is a definitive chapter in the token’s story. It marks a point where institutional hands are strengthening their hold. For the ASTER project, this can be seen as a vote of confidence from a sophisticated player in the crypto financial services space. Conclusion: Decoding the Whale’s Move In conclusion, the withdrawal of $2.84 million in ASTER by Matrixport from Binance is far more than a simple transaction. It is a strategic market signal that highlights the growing maturity of crypto markets, where institutional moves provide valuable, transparent insights. This action underscores the importance of on-chain analytics for every crypto enthusiast. By paying attention to when a giant like Matrixport withdraws ASTER , you align your perspective with the market’s most influential players, turning public blockchain data into your personal financial radar. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is Matrixport? A1: Matrixport is a leading cryptocurrency financial services platform offering trading, lending, custody, and investment products primarily to institutional and sophisticated investors. Q2: Why would Matrixport withdraw ASTER from Binance? A2: Common reasons include moving tokens to secure cold storage for long-term custody, preparing them for staking or participation in network governance, or simply consolidating assets away from exchange risk. Q3: Is a large withdrawal always a bullish sign? A3: While often interpreted as bullish because it reduces immediate sell-side liquidity, context is key. It’s essential to consider overall market conditions, the token’s fundamentals, and any related news. Q4: How can I track similar large transactions? A4: You can use blockchain explorers like Etherscan for Ethereum-based tokens (like ASTER) or dedicated analytics platforms like Lookonchain, Nansen, or Arkham Intelligence that track and label whale wallets. Q5: What is ASTER? A5: ASTER is a cryptocurrency token. For precise details on its use case, technology, and project goals, please refer to the official ASTER project documentation and website. Q6: Does this mean the price of ASTER will go up? A6: A single transaction does not guarantee price direction. It is a significant data point suggesting reduced readily available supply, which can be a positive factor, but price is influenced by many variables including overall market sentiment, project developments, and broader economic factors.

It has mushroomed as a group of international borrowers, and investors take advantage of favorable funding conditions, a strengthening yuan, and positive policy signals from Beijing to issue dim sum bonds . Offshore yuan bonds are sold for a total of some 870 billion yuan ($123 billion) this year — exceeding the full-year figure for 2023. The milestone marked the eighth consecutive year of growth, according to compiled data, and reflects the market’s shift from a narrow funding source to a major contributor to global capital flows. Momentum has steadily increased this year, as issuers rushed to capitalize on low borrowing costs. Yet, at the same time, investors have been looking beyond dollar assets in search of diversification as the world remains unsettled amid a cascade of global trade wars, while shifting currency movements dictate where to invest and what not. Issuers lock in long-term funding as yuan confidence grows China’s low interest rates have been a primary driver of the issuance boom. Borrowers have been able to obtain offshore yuan debt at a significantly lower cost than funding in any of the world’s major currencies, prompting both Chinese and foreign issuers to enter the market. The strain has been felt most acutely on long-dated bonds. This year has seen a record 152 dim sum bonds with maturities of at least 10 years being sold, nearly double the number issued at this time last year. The trend suggests increased confidence in the long-term stability and appeal of the yuan as a reserve currency. A handful of high-profile issuers have helped drag the market to new lows. Singaporean sovereign wealth fund investor Temasek Holdings, global insurer Chubb Ltd., and Chinese technology giant Tencent Holdings have all sold 30-year yuan-denominated bonds. This maturity was rare in the dim sum market. Their involvement has boosted investor confidence and widened the market’s audience. Rate differentials in favor of the yuan remain. The 10-year government bond yield in China is approximately 1.84%, significantly lower than the roughly 4.16 percent yield on comparable US Treasuries. Many issuers are keen to lock in these low rates, and economists say they are betting that China’s economic prospects will improve over the next several years, making financing costs less attractive than they are now for at least some time to come. Dollar weakness and policy support fuel sustained demand Movements in currencies have further stoked demand for offshore yuan bonds. The yuan has appreciated over the year, as the US dollar fell about 3.9% against the Chinese currency through the beginning of 2025, breaking a three-year streak in which it had risen. This has led investors to reposition their portfolios and add more yuan-denominated assets. China’s companies are also scrambling to restructure their debt. Firms grappling with elevated US interest rates are attempting to roll over dollar-denominated liabilities by borrowing in yuan. The move reduces borrowing costs and insulates from fluctuations in the currency exchange rate. Yet while this may no longer be the case, Chinese firms remain highly indebted in foreign currency. The world’s outstanding US dollar-denominated bonds total approximately $750 billion; roughly one-third of these are due for repayment over the next two years. Additionally, the necessity to refinance that debt is generating a steady demand for offshore yuan issuance as well. New sovereign and quasi-sovereign borrowers have also been lured into the market. Offshore yuan bonds were issued this year by Indonesia and the Development Bank of Kazakhstan, diversifying issuers and giving the yuan a more prominent role in cross-border finance. In July, the People’s Bank of China and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority expanded the Southbound Bond Connect program to include non-bank financial institutions, such as fund managers, insurers, and securities companies. Regulators are also considering more investment quotas, which could help encourage demand and liquidity. There remain challenges, including thin trading and a lack of hedging options such as cross-currency swaps. Still, stronger policy support, stronger issuer confidence, and a worldwide search for substitutes for dollar assets are generating the conditions for further growth, analysts say.

New analysis from a seasoned crypto fund founder suggests your patience may be about to pay off. According to Jack Yi, founder of LD Capital, on-chain data is flashing a compelling signal for Ethereum spot buys . He points to sustained accumulation by large holders, known as ‘whales,’ as a key indicator that the current price range presents a strategic entry point. This perspective cuts through the market noise, focusing on a fundamental principle: managing risk while seeking asymmetric reward. What Does Ethereum Whale Activity Really Tell Us? Jack Yi’s statement on X highlights a critical on-chain trend. Whale addresses—wallets holding substantial amounts of ETH—are not selling. Instead, they are continuously accumulating. This behavior is a powerful data point. Whales typically possess more information, resources, and a longer-term vision than the average investor. When they buy consistently during a specific price range, it often suggests they perceive more upside than downside. Therefore, their actions can provide a valuable context for considering your own Ethereum spot buys . Is Now the Right Time for Spot Ethereum Purchases? Yi argues that the current environment is particularly suitable for spot accumulation. His reasoning hinges on a classic investment framework: risk versus reward. He suggests the potential for significant price decline from current levels is limited, while the potential for future gains remains substantial, or “unlimited.” This creates a favorable asymmetric opportunity. For investors, this means conducting Ethereum spot buys now could position you well for the next market cycle, with a managed level of risk. Let’s break down the core benefits of aligning with whale activity for spot accumulation: Risk Management: Buying at levels where large, informed investors are also accumulating can provide a psychological and strategic safety net. Long-Term Alignment: Whale accumulation often signals a multi-month or multi-year outlook, encouraging a patient investment strategy. Reduced Volatility Impact: Spot purchases, unlike leveraged positions, allow you to hold through market fluctuations without the risk of liquidation. How to Approach Ethereum Investing with a Risk-First Mindset Yi emphasizes that the core of investing isn’t just about picking winners—it’s about risk management. Before executing any Ethereum spot buys , assess your personal risk-to-reward ratio. Ask yourself key questions: What portion of my portfolio does this represent? What is my time horizon? What price level would invalidate my thesis? By answering these, you move from speculative trading to strategic investing. The goal is to make decisions where the potential reward justifies the risk you are taking, a principle clearly reflected in the current whale behavior. Actionable Insights for Your Crypto Portfolio Seeing whale accumulation is one thing; acting on it wisely is another. Here is a simple framework to consider: Verify the Data: Use reputable on-chain analytics platforms to observe wallet trends for yourself. Dollar-Cost Average (DCA): Instead of a single large purchase, consider spreading your Ethereum spot buys over time to average your entry price. Secure Your Assets: If you’re buying for the long term, move your ETH from the exchange to a private, secure wallet. Revisit Your Plan: Set clear goals for your investment and avoid making emotional decisions based on short-term price moves. In conclusion, the convergence of on-chain whale accumulation and a strong risk-reward argument presents a compelling case for Ethereum. While no indicator is foolproof, following the smart money during periods of accumulation has historically been a sound strategy. By focusing on spot purchases and disciplined risk management, as highlighted by LD Capital’s founder, investors can navigate the market with greater confidence. The current moment may well be a strategic window to build a position alongside the market’s most significant players. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are ‘whale addresses’ in cryptocurrency? Whale addresses are cryptocurrency wallets that hold a very large amount of a specific asset, like Ethereum. Their transactions can significantly influence market sentiment and price due to the size of their holdings. Why is whale accumulation considered a bullish signal? Sustained accumulation by whales suggests that large, often well-informed investors believe the asset is undervalued or has strong future prospects. They are willing to commit capital, indicating confidence that outweighs the fear of further price drops. What is the difference between spot buying and trading with leverage? Spot buying means purchasing and owning the actual asset (e.g., ETH) with the full amount of capital. Trading with leverage involves borrowing funds to amplify potential gains (and losses), which carries significantly higher risk, including liquidation. How can I check Ethereum on-chain data for myself? You can use blockchain explorers and analytics websites like Etherscan, Glassnode, or Nansen to view wallet activity, transaction flows, and other on-chain metrics related to Ethereum. Does whale activity guarantee the price will go up? No single indicator guarantees price movement. Whale accumulation is a strong positive signal, but it should be considered alongside broader market trends, project fundamentals, and macroeconomic factors. What does ‘asymmetric risk-reward’ mean? It describes a situation where the potential upside of an investment is far greater than the potential downside. In this context, it means the probability and scale of future gains for Ethereum are perceived to be much larger than the risk of further losses from current levels.

According to fresh analysis, a sharp plunge in Bitcoin exchange flows has created a dangerous liquidity crunch that could trigger sudden volatility. This isn’t just minor market noise—it’s a significant red flag that every trader needs to understand. What Are Bitcoin Exchange Flows and Why Do They Matter? Bitcoin exchange flows simply measure how much BTC moves between different trading platforms. Think of it as the bloodstream of the cryptocurrency market. High, healthy flows mean smooth arbitrage, deep order books, and price stability. However, analysis from XWIN Research Japan, a contributor to CryptoQuant, shows this vital metric has turned dangerously low. The key indicator here is the Bitcoin Inter-Flow Pulse (IFP). When this pulse weakens and turns red, it signals that liquidity between exchanges is drying up. This creates a fragile environment where even small trades can have oversized impacts on price. Why Is This Plunge in Bitcoin Exchange Flows a Red Flag? The current situation presents a perfect storm of concerning factors. First, Bitcoin reserves on exchanges are already at historic lows. While this limited sellable supply can prop prices up temporarily, it creates a dangerously thin market. Increased Volatility Risk: Thin order books mean less cushion against price moves Slippage Spikes: Larger trades face worse execution prices Leverage Vulnerability: High leverage positions become extremely risky The analyst notes that past instances of the IFP turning red have consistently preceded sharp corrections or sudden price swings. The market becomes like a dry forest—just one spark could start a major move. How Does This Affect Your Bitcoin Trading Strategy? Understanding these Bitcoin exchange flows gives you crucial insight into market health. When liquidity between platforms dries up, several practical consequences emerge for traders. Market efficiency suffers first. Normally, arbitrageurs quickly balance prices across exchanges. With reduced Bitcoin exchange flows, price discrepancies can persist longer and grow wider. This means you might see different BTC prices on different platforms simultaneously. More importantly, your risk management needs adjustment. The analysis specifically warns that leveraged positions become particularly vulnerable in this environment. Until liquidity recovers through increased Bitcoin exchange flows, the market remains sensitive to smaller trades that can trigger cascading liquidations. What Can Trigger Recovery in Bitcoin Exchange Flows? Market participants often wonder what signals to watch for improvement. Recovery typically requires one or more of these developments: Increased institutional movement between custody and trading venues Return of arbitrage activity as price discrepancies become attractive General market confidence returning, encouraging capital movement Resolution of external factors that may be causing capital hesitation Monitoring the IFP indicator provides an early warning system. When Bitcoin exchange flows begin recovering, the red warning should transition back to healthier levels, indicating reduced immediate volatility risk. Actionable Insights From the Bitcoin Exchange Flows Warning This analysis isn’t just theoretical—it provides practical guidance for navigating current market conditions. Here’s what you should consider: First, reassess your position sizing. With heightened volatility risk, smaller positions provide better protection against sudden moves. Second, pay closer attention to order book depth before executing trades. Third, if using leverage, consider reducing it until Bitcoin exchange flows show recovery. Remember that while this warning signals danger, it doesn’t predict direction. The plunge in Bitcoin exchange flows indicates vulnerability to sudden moves in either direction. Your strategy should account for this increased uncertainty. Conclusion: Navigating the Bitcoin Liquidity Crunch The plunge in Bitcoin exchange flows serves as a critical market health check. While surface price action might appear stable, the underlying liquidity tells a different story. This red flag warns of heightened volatility risk, especially for leveraged positions. By understanding these dynamics, you can adjust your strategy accordingly—prioritizing risk management over aggressive positioning until the market’s bloodstream flows more freely again. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly are Bitcoin exchange flows? Bitcoin exchange flows measure the volume of BTC moving between different cryptocurrency trading platforms. They indicate how actively capital circulates within the ecosystem. Why do low Bitcoin exchange flows increase volatility? Low flows create thin order books and reduce market depth. This means smaller trades can move prices more significantly, and arbitrage between exchanges becomes less efficient at balancing prices. How can I monitor Bitcoin exchange flows myself? Platforms like CryptoQuant provide on-chain metrics including exchange flow indicators. The Inter-Flow Pulse (IFP) specifically tracks this metric and signals when it reaches concerning levels. Does this mean Bitcoin’s price will definitely crash? Not necessarily. The warning indicates increased vulnerability to volatility, which could mean sharp moves in either direction. It signals market fragility rather than predicting a specific price direction. How long do these liquidity crunches typically last? Duration varies based on market conditions. Recovery depends on factors like returning trader confidence, institutional movement, and resolution of any external market pressures. Should I avoid trading Bitcoin during this period? Not necessarily, but you should adjust your approach. Consider smaller position sizes, reduced leverage, and closer attention to order book depth before executing trades.

According to CryptoQuant CEO Ju Ki-young, the answer might be simpler than you think. In a recent announcement about their new AI-powered Analyst Consensus Index, Ju emphasized that holding positions represents a rational strategy when market direction becomes unclear. This perspective comes from sophisticated analysis of 246 market experts, suggesting that sometimes the best action is deliberate inaction. Why Is Holding Positions a Smart Move Right Now? CryptoQuant’s new Analyst Consensus Index provides compelling evidence for maintaining current investment strategies. Developed using Claude AI and data from 246 analysts, this tool successfully predicted major market movements through backtesting over five years. It anticipated the 2022 bear market, identified the 2023 rebound, and signaled the current market correction. When sophisticated tools and expert consensus point toward uncertainty, holding positions allows investors to avoid emotional decisions that often lead to buying high and selling low. The current market presents what Ju describes as a “neutral and uncertain” environment. During such periods, investors face several common pitfalls: Reacting to short-term volatility with panic selling Chasing fleeting market narratives without conviction Abandoning long-term strategies due to temporary discomfort Overtrading in search of certainty that doesn’t exist Ju believes that maintaining conviction and holding positions helps investors navigate these challenges more effectively than constantly adjusting portfolios based on market noise. What Does the Analyst Consensus Index Reveal? The development of CryptoQuant’s new analytical tool represents a significant advancement in market intelligence. By aggregating insights from 246 analysts through Claude AI, the index creates a more reliable picture of market sentiment than individual opinions can provide. This collective wisdom has demonstrated impressive predictive power, suggesting that when experts collectively signal uncertainty, maintaining existing positions becomes particularly strategic. Consider how this approach differs from common investor behavior. Many market participants constantly seek clear signals about when to buy or sell, but sophisticated analysis suggests that during transitional periods, the most rational approach involves patience. The index’s successful track record in identifying major market turns provides empirical support for the strategy of holding positions when direction becomes ambiguous. How Can Investors Implement This Strategy Effectively? Successfully holding positions requires more than simply doing nothing. It involves deliberate decision-making and emotional discipline. First, investors should distinguish between uncertainty caused by normal market cycles versus fundamental changes in their investment thesis. The current environment, according to CryptoQuant’s analysis, represents the former—a period of neutral positioning before the next clear trend emerges. Practical implementation involves several key considerations: Review your original investment thesis: Has anything fundamentally changed? Assess your risk tolerance: Can you withstand current volatility? Evaluate portfolio allocation: Does it still align with your goals? Establish clear criteria for change: What would prompt you to adjust positions? By approaching holding positions as an active strategy rather than passive inaction, investors can maintain confidence during uncertain periods. The Psychological Advantage of Holding During Uncertainty Market uncertainty creates psychological pressure that often leads to poor decisions. The fear of missing opportunities or the anxiety of potential losses can trigger reactive trading that undermines long-term results. Ju Ki-young’s recommendation to maintain conviction addresses this psychological dimension directly. When investors commit to holding positions as a deliberate strategy, they transform uncertainty from a source of anxiety into an expected market condition. This psychological shift provides several advantages. It reduces transaction costs from unnecessary trading, minimizes tax implications from frequent realization of gains or losses, and allows investments more time to compound. Perhaps most importantly, it helps investors avoid the common pattern of selling during corrections only to buy back at higher prices during the subsequent recovery. Conclusion: Patience as Strategic Advantage In cryptocurrency markets characterized by volatility and uncertainty, sophisticated analysis suggests that patience often outperforms activity. CryptoQuant’s Analyst Consensus Index and Ju Ki-young’s insights remind investors that sometimes the most rational strategy involves maintaining conviction and holding positions . This approach aligns with historical market patterns where periods of consolidation and uncertainty typically precede new trends. By embracing this perspective, investors can navigate current market conditions with greater confidence and discipline. Remember that successful investing involves weathering inevitable periods of uncertainty. The tools and insights now available through advanced analytics like CryptoQuant’s index provide empirical support for strategies that might feel counterintuitive during turbulent times. When expert consensus points toward neutral conditions, maintaining your positions may represent the most sophisticated approach available. Frequently Asked Questions What is the Analyst Consensus Index mentioned in the article? The Analyst Consensus Index is a new tool developed by CryptoQuant using Claude AI. It aggregates and analyzes data from 246 cryptocurrency market analysts to create a consensus view of market conditions and potential trends. How does holding positions differ from simply doing nothing? Holding positions is an active investment strategy based on conviction and analysis, while doing nothing is passive inaction. The former involves deliberate decision-making to maintain investments despite uncertainty, while the latter may indicate indecision or neglect. What time period did CryptoQuant backtest their index? CryptoQuant backtested their Analyst Consensus Index over the past five years. During this period, the index successfully predicted the 2022 bear market, the 2023 rebound, and the current market correction. Is holding positions advisable in all market conditions? No, holding positions is specifically recommended during neutral and uncertain market conditions where clear trends haven’t emerged. During strong bull or bear markets with clear direction, different strategies might be more appropriate. How many analysts contribute to the Consensus Index? The index incorporates data from 246 cryptocurrency market analysts, providing a broad and diverse perspective on market conditions and potential trends. What should prompt an investor to stop holding positions? Investors should consider adjusting their positions if their original investment thesis fundamentally changes, if their risk tolerance has shifted, or if clear market trends emerge that contradict their current strategy.

This dramatic event highlights the extreme volatility and high-risk nature of leveraged trading. If you’re holding futures positions, understanding these numbers is crucial for managing your risk. What Do These Massive Crypto Futures Liquidations Mean? When we talk about crypto futures liquidations , we’re referring to the forced closure of leveraged positions by exchanges. This happens when a trader’s collateral falls below the required maintenance margin. Essentially, it’s a safety mechanism that triggers automatic selling, often amplifying market moves. The past 24 hours saw this mechanism fire on all cylinders, creating a cascade of selling pressure. Therefore, a liquidation event of this scale is a clear signal of heightened market stress. It indicates that a significant number of traders were caught on the wrong side of a price swing, using excessive leverage. Let’s break down which assets were hit the hardest. Which Cryptocurrencies Faced the Biggest Blow? The liquidation data reveals a clear hierarchy of pain. The figures show a concentrated sell-off in major assets, with long positions bearing the overwhelming brunt of the losses. Bitcoin (BTC): The king of crypto led the liquidation tally with a staggering $108 million wiped out. A crushing 86.3% of these were long positions, meaning traders betting on a price increase were decimated. Ethereum (ETH): Following closely, Ethereum saw $62.43 million in liquidations. Similar to Bitcoin, the majority (71.66%) were longs, showing a broad-based downturn across the market’s top two assets. Solana (SOL): The high-performance blockchain token wasn’t spared, experiencing $13.77 million in liquidations. Remarkably, 89.15% of these were long positions, indicating an exceptionally painful squeeze for SOL bulls. This pattern confirms a sharp, market-wide correction that punished optimistic leverage. But why does this matter to the average investor or trader? Why Should You Care About Futures Market Liquidation? Even if you don’t trade futures, these crypto futures liquidations impact you. They act as a volatility accelerant. A large wave of forced selling can drive prices down faster and further than organic selling would, potentially creating buying opportunities or signaling a deeper correction. Moreover, monitoring liquidation levels is a key risk management tool. High liquidation volumes often cluster near local market tops or bottoms, providing clues about trader sentiment and potential exhaustion points. For savvy market participants, this data is an essential part of the puzzle. How Can Traders Navigate This Volatile Landscape? Surviving and thriving in an environment prone to sudden crypto futures liquidations requires discipline. First, always use stop-loss orders to define your risk before entering a trade. Second, employ sensible leverage; high leverage is the fastest path to a liquidation. Third, keep an eye on aggregate market data, like funding rates and open interest, to gauge when extreme sentiment might be brewing. Remember, the market’s primary job is to transfer wealth from the impatient to the patient. Events like this $184 million liquidation cleanse are a stark reminder of that principle. Conclusion: A Harsh Reminder of Market Forces The recent $184 million in crypto futures liquidations serves as a powerful lesson. It underscores the non-negotiable importance of risk management in cryptocurrency trading. While futures can amplify gains, they can just as swiftly erase capital. The data shows a market resetting over-leveraged positions, a necessary, if painful, process for long-term health. Moving forward, traders should view such volatility not just as a threat, but as an inherent feature of the market to be understood and respected. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What exactly is a liquidation in crypto futures trading? A: A liquidation is the forced closure of a leveraged futures position by an exchange. It occurs when a trader’s losses deplete their initial margin (collateral) to a level where they can no longer maintain the position, triggering an automatic market order to close it. Q: Why were mostly long positions liquidated? A> The data indicates the market price dropped significantly. Long positions profit when prices rise, so a sharp decline causes losses. When these losses exceed the margin held, the long positions get liquidated. Q: Do liquidations cause the price to drop further? A: Yes, they often can. Liquidations result in market sell orders being executed automatically. A large cluster of these sell orders at once can create additional downward pressure on the price, potentially leading to a cascade or “liquidation waterfall.” Q: How can I check current liquidation levels? A: Several cryptocurrency data websites like Coinglass, Bybit, and Binance provide real-time and historical liquidation data across multiple exchanges, allowing you to monitor market stress levels. Q: Is spot trading safer than futures regarding liquidations? A: Yes, fundamentally. In spot trading, you own the asset outright. Your loss is limited to the asset’s value going to zero, but you cannot be forcibly liquidated for holding it. Futures involve borrowed capital (leverage), which introduces liquidation risk. Q: What’s the difference between a partial and a full liquidation? A: A full liquidation closes the entire position. Some exchanges may perform a partial liquidation first, closing just enough of the position to bring the margin back above the maintenance level, allowing the remainder to stay open.

The investigation reveals that government-backed COVID debt relief reached borrowers who maintained significant crypto holdings , raising serious questions about the allocation of public funds during the pandemic crisis. What Did the South Korean Audit Actually Find? The Board of Audit and Inspection conducted a regular audit of the Korea Asset Management Corporation (KAMCO), uncovering troubling patterns in COVID-19 relief distribution. Their examination revealed that not all recipients of principal forgiveness truly needed financial assistance. Specifically, the audit identified 1,944 borrowers among 32,703 recipients who demonstrated 100% repayment ability yet still received debt forgiveness. These individuals collectively obtained 84 billion won ($60.8 million) in principal reductions they arguably didn’t need. How Significant Were the Crypto Holdings? The most eye-opening discovery involved cryptocurrency assets. Among recipients who received substantial forgiveness (over 30 million won), auditors found 269 individuals holding more than 10 million won in virtual assets at the end of last year. These borrowers with substantial crypto holdings received a total of 22.5 billion won ($16.3 million) in principal reductions. The audit highlighted extreme cases that illustrate the problem: One borrower received 120 million won ($87,000) in COVID debt relief in July The same individual held 430 million won ($311,000) in cryptocurrency assets by year-end This represents a clear mismatch between relief received and financial capability Why Does This Matter for Future Relief Programs? This audit reveals critical flaws in how South Korea implemented its pandemic assistance. The findings suggest that screening processes failed to identify financially capable individuals, allowing public funds to benefit those who could have repaid their debts. The presence of substantial crypto holdings among relief recipients indicates that traditional financial assessments might not capture modern wealth storage methods. Cryptocurrency assets, while volatile, represent significant financial resources that should factor into eligibility determinations. What Are the Broader Implications? This situation extends beyond South Korea, offering lessons for governments worldwide. Emergency relief programs require robust verification systems that account for all forms of wealth, including digital assets. The audit findings highlight several important considerations: Transparency matters: Public trust erodes when relief funds reach those who don’t need them Modern wealth assessment: Financial evaluations must include cryptocurrency and digital assets Accountability systems: Regular audits ensure program integrity and proper fund allocation The South Korean case demonstrates how COVID debt relief programs, while essential during emergencies, require careful design and continuous oversight. When individuals with substantial crypto holdings receive public assistance meant for the financially vulnerable, it undermines the program’s purpose and public confidence. What Should Governments Learn From This? This audit provides valuable insights for future crisis response. First, eligibility criteria must evolve with changing financial landscapes, including cryptocurrency ownership. Second, real-time monitoring and verification systems can prevent similar situations. Finally, transparency about relief distribution builds public trust during emergencies. The discovery that COVID debt relief reached borrowers with significant crypto holdings serves as a cautionary tale. It reminds us that well-intentioned programs require sophisticated implementation to ensure they help those truly in need. Frequently Asked Questions How many borrowers with crypto holdings received COVID debt relief in South Korea? The audit identified 269 borrowers who received over 30 million won in debt forgiveness while holding more than 10 million won in virtual assets at year-end 2023. What was the total amount forgiven to these crypto-holding borrowers? These individuals collectively received 22.5 billion won ($16.3 million) in principal reductions through the COVID-19 relief program. Which organization conducted the audit of COVID debt relief distribution? The Board of Audit and Inspection performed a regular audit of the Korea Asset Management Corporation (KAMCO), which administered the relief program. What percentage of relief recipients were deemed fully capable of repayment? Approximately 6% of recipients (1,944 out of 32,703) showed 100% repayment ability yet still received principal forgiveness. How does this affect public trust in government relief programs? Such findings can significantly undermine public confidence, as they suggest relief funds may not reach those most in need, potentially affecting future program participation and support. What changes might result from this audit discovery? The findings will likely prompt reforms in eligibility screening, including better assessment of all asset types (including cryptocurrency) and improved verification processes for future relief programs.

Decentralized AI and blockchain developer IQ launched it in partnership with Frax Finance. The goal is clear: to create a trustworthy, liquid representation of the South Korean won for digital asset transactions. How Does This Benefit Investors and Institutions? The primary advantage is access. Through Frax Finance’s existing frxUSD infrastructure, users gain robust KRW-USD settlement rails. This is crucial for several reasons: Reduced Friction: Direct on-chain conversion between KRW and USD stablecoins minimizes traditional banking delays. Regulatory Clarity: Building for the GENIUS bill framework aims to pre-empt compliance issues, offering peace of mind. Institutional Gateway: It provides a formalized, infrastructure-heavy path for larger entities to engage with Korean markets. Therefore, this isn’t just a technical integration; it’s a bridge for capital. What Are the Future Plans for KRWQ Liquidity? The team behind KRWQ has announced ambitious plans to boost its utility. A key initiative is the creation of new, deep liquidity pools. These pools will receive direct support from both Frax Finance and IQ, ensuring they are well-capitalized and efficient. For traders and liquidity providers, this means better pricing and lower slippage when moving in and out of KRWQ. Moreover, it signals long-term commitment from major players in the DeFi space, enhancing the stablecoin’s credibility and adoption potential. Why Is This Integration a Game-Changer?

55801853,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=878325,1765770464,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/55801853.jpeg,Chinese EV makers are using deep discounts to gain market share in Thailand,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/chinese-ev-makers-slash-prices-in-thailand/,"Chinese electric carmakers are entering Thailand with aggressive discounts, exporting a price-cutting strategy honed in their highly competitive home market to Southeast Asia. As local demand wanes, Thailand has become a vital new growth market for carmakers as they gravitate towards cash-strapped consumers trying to upgrade their rides and companies that can squeeze more cars onto congested roads. The deals are significant as each manufacturer seeks to bring in clients. BYD slashed the price of its Seal electric sedan by as much as 38% in October. It pledged that if prices were to fall again this year for certain models, the brand would offer cover. SAIC Motor also followed the trend, reducing the price of its MG4 electric hatchback by approximately 27%. Chery Automobile’s Jaecoo J5 has received nearly 20,000 orders, despite a two-month delivery wait associated with its promotional pricing feature. Dealers have reported an increase in customer traffic. “I’ve never been so busy,” said Thawee Chongkavanit, who operates a BYD s howroom in Bangkok. The sales effect is a pay-off strategy. In both October and November, EV deliveries increased by more than 20%, contributing to the step-wise shift away from Japanese brands, which have long dominated Thailand’s automotive market. Discounts boost sales but deepen industry risks Price cuts have stimulated demand, but they are also uncovering underlying market tensions. Auto companies are slashing prices to clear inventory and achieve production goals associated with government incentives, but that short-term surge is laden with long-term risks. Many buyers are putting off purchases, expecting discounts to follow. Krisda Utamote, a senior adviser at the Electric Vehicle Association of Thailand, said that the repeated reductions were damaging to the market. He added that the price cuts instilled fear among buyers, particularly as production outstripped demand and tighter auto-loan rules complicated financing. Some dealers report that cars are being sold at cost—or even at a loss—to preserve sales volumes, and after-sales service isn’t a priority for the long haul as manufacturers focus on meeting targets. Consumers are venting their frustration online, claiming the cars lose as much as a fifth of their value after a month, or that the loan outlay for buying a new car tops the cost. Supreeya Watcharakorn, a 31-year-old marketing officer in Bangkok, said that she was considering switching to an EV but was hesitant, as prices might drop even further, so she was waiting. Subsidies push Chinese EV makers to grow fast The main engines of the boom were Thailand’s massive EV subsidies, established in 2022, aimed at promoting local production and adoption of electric vehicles. Incentives can rise to up to 150,000 baht per vehicle, if automakers produce at least three cars locally for every two bought abroad. A separate program, running until 2027, offers rebates of up to 100,000 baht for EVs priced below 2 million baht and equipped with larger batteries. Companies that fall short of production goals must repay the subsidies, resulting in high pressure to ramp up operations as quickly as possible. The Chinese will drive the expansion. BYD’s Thai plant is capable of producing as many as 150,000 vehicles a year, Changan could produce up to 100,000, and Chery about 80,000. EV makers are predicted to collectively manufacture around 30,000 vehicles locally in the last months of the year. Their fast growth has helped Chinese brands gain share. Japanese automakers, such as Toyota and Honda, meanwhile, lag in the market, producing few fully electric models and missing out on critical subsidies. Unlike in China, where authorities have fought off aggressive discounting, Thai regulators have largely allowed the trend to continue. And pressure is unlikely to ease as production quotas rise and subsidies decrease annually. Analysts say that once they hit their targets, prices can stabilize; however, competition can be fierce, and there is a risk of even lower prices lasting longer. The EV industry in Thailand is accelerating, driven by ambitious Chinese manufacturers, supportive state policies, and price cuts. A measure of its sustainability will be the industry’s most important test in the months to come.

The country now possesses over 7,500 BTC, currently valued at approximately $671 million. This positions the Central American nation as one of the world’s most significant national holders of cryptocurrency. But what does this massive accumulation mean for El Salvador’s economy and the broader crypto landscape? How Did El Salvador’s Bitcoin Holdings Reach This Milestone? El Salvador made history in September 2021 by becoming the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. Since that groundbreaking decision, the government has consistently added to its reserves through various methods. The current total of 7,501 BTC represents both strategic purchases and citizen adoption through the government’s Chivo wallet initiative. President Nayib Bukele has been transparent about the country’s accumulation strategy, often announcing purchases on social media. The government buys Bitcoin during market dips, following a dollar-cost averaging approach. This method helps mitigate volatility while steadily growing the national treasury’s digital asset portfolio. What Are the Strategic Benefits of These Holdings? El Salvador’s substantial Bitcoin holdings serve multiple strategic purposes for the developing nation. First, they provide a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. Second, they position the country at the forefront of financial innovation. Third, the holdings generate international attention and potential investment. The benefits extend beyond mere asset accumulation: Financial Sovereignty: Reducing dependence on traditional international banking systems Remittance Revolution: Creating cheaper, faster channels for citizens abroad to send money home Tourism Boost: Attracting crypto enthusiasts and investors curious about the real-world experiment Technological Infrastructure: Forcing rapid development of digital payment systems nationwide What Challenges Does El Salvador Face with This Strategy? Despite the impressive accumulation, El Salvador’s Bitcoin strategy faces significant challenges. The cryptocurrency’s notorious volatility means the portfolio’s value fluctuates dramatically. International financial institutions like the IMF have expressed concerns about financial stability risks. Additionally, technological adoption barriers persist among some segments of the population. The government addresses these challenges through education initiatives and infrastructure development. Bitcoin Beach communities demonstrate real-world usage, while geothermal Bitcoin mining taps into renewable volcanic energy. These practical applications help normalize cryptocurrency in everyday Salvadoran life. How Do These Holdings Compare Globally? While 7,500 BTC represents a substantial national reserve, it’s important to contextualize this achievement. MicroStrategy, a publicly traded company, holds significantly more Bitcoin. However, as a national treasury asset, El Salvador’s holdings are unprecedented. No other country has made such a substantial, public commitment to Bitcoin as a reserve asset. The closest comparisons come from corporate treasuries rather than nations. This unique position gives El Salvador disproportionate influence in cryptocurrency discussions despite its small size. Other developing nations watch closely, considering whether to follow a similar path toward digital asset adoption. What’s Next for El Salvador’s Bitcoin Journey? The road ahead for El Salvador’s Bitcoin holdings involves both opportunity and uncertainty. The government plans to issue Bitcoin-backed bonds to fund further development. Volcano-powered mining operations continue expanding. Most importantly, the country serves as a living laboratory for national cryptocurrency adoption. Success depends on several factors: Bitcoin’s long-term price trajectory International regulatory developments Domestic adoption rates among citizens and businesses Technological infrastructure reliability El Salvador’s bold experiment demonstrates that national Bitcoin strategies can move beyond theory into practice. The growing holdings represent more than just digital assets—they symbolize a fundamental rethinking of monetary sovereignty in the digital age. Frequently Asked Questions How does El Salvador acquire its Bitcoin? El Salvador purchases Bitcoin through government funds, accepts it as tax payment, and mines it using geothermal volcanic energy. President Bukele often announces strategic purchases during market downturns. Can Salvadorans use Bitcoin for everyday purchases? Yes, businesses nationwide must accept Bitcoin as payment under the legal tender law. The government’s Chivo wallet facilitates transactions, though USD remains widely used alongside cryptocurrency. What happens if Bitcoin’s price crashes significantly? The government employs a dollar-cost averaging strategy to mitigate volatility. While portfolio value fluctuates, the long-term strategy focuses on accumulation rather than short-term price movements. Are other countries following El Salvador’s example? Several nations have expressed interest, but none have fully adopted Bitcoin as legal tender. Central African Republic briefly followed but reversed course. Many developing nations watch El Salvador’s experiment closely. How do Salvadorans feel about the Bitcoin law? Opinions vary. Younger, tech-savvy citizens and those receiving remittances appreciate the benefits. Older generations and those with limited digital access have been slower to adopt the technology. What percentage of El Salvador’s reserves is in Bitcoin? While exact percentages aren’t publicly disclosed, $671 million represents a significant portion of the country’s foreign reserves, especially considering its developing economy status. El Salvador’s pioneering journey with Bitcoin continues to captivate the financial world.

Digital assets will be regulated similar to other financial products under the legislation, the finance ministry said in a statement. Reuters reported Monday that Britain is moving to formally regulate crypto from October 2027. The move would provide “clear rules of the road” and keep “dodgy actors” out of the market, said Chancellor Rachel Reeves. She added that the rules will hand “strong consumer protections.” “Bringing crypto into the regulatory perimeter is a crucial step in securing the UK’s position as a world-leading financial centre in the digital age,” the Chancellor noted. The European Union introduced a similar legislation (MiCA) one year ago, while the US is progressing with its own set of rules for crypto regulation. Britain seeks to collaborate with the US to foster crypto regulation and innovation through the “ Transatlantic Taskforce ”. The UK will introduce a draft bill into Parliament later today. Crypto Regulation Under FCA Supervision The new set of rules would place crypto firms, including exchanges and digital wallets, under the purview of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). This means the crypto services are regulated in the same way as other financial products, including by being subject to transparency standards, The Guardian reported . Lucy Rigby, the minister for the City of London, said that these new rules “will give firms the clarity and consistency they need to plan for the long term.” Besides, recent data from the financial regulator shows around 12% of UK adults hold some form of cryptocurrency, a figure that has risen steadily in recent years. As a result, the UK formally recognized Bitcoin and crypto assets as legal property under a new Act of Parliament. Under the law, digital assets can be owned, inherited, and recovered. Regulator, Bank to Finalize Own Rules by End 2026 Separately, the UK FCA is planning rules for trading and market abuse, custody and issuance. Additionally, the Bank of England last month unveiled its proposals for regulating stablecoins . Both the BoE and the FCA have promised to finalize their rules by end-2026, the Reuters report added. The crypto regulatory rulebook plans come at a time when crypto has suffered from market turbulence and several digital asset scams recently. The amount of money lost to investment scams by UK crypto consumers has leapt 55% in a year, per official UK banking industry data . Separately, ministers are also drawing up plans to ban crypto political donations, raising red flags about their unverifiable origin and ownership.

Equity futures pointed to losses for Australian, Hong Kong and Japanese benchmarks in early trading after US stocks slumped on Friday. A downbeat sales outlook from Broadcom rattled confidence in the artificial intelligence trade and pushed the S&P 500 lower by about 1%, reinforcing concerns that heavy AI spending may not translate into profits as quickly as investors once expected. Market snapshot Bitcoin : $89,293, down 1.1% Ether : $3,111, down 0.3% XRP : $2.00, down 1.4% Total crypto market cap: $3.13 trillion, down 0.9% Tech Valuation Fears Weigh On Global Sentiment As Asia Faces Added Pressure Global risk sentiment has been fading as traders question whether tech stocks, which have climbed roughly 300% since the current bull market began three years ago and driven global indices to record highs, can continue to justify rich valuations and aggressive AI budgets. Asian markets, which have outperformed global peers this year, look especially exposed given the region’s dependence on manufacturing the chips and hardware that power the technology boom. MSCI’s broad gauge of Asia Pacific equities outside Japan fell about 1%, with South Korea, often seen as a bellwether for AI exuberance, dropping more than 2% in Monday trade. Equity index futures for major US benchmarks shifted between small gains and losses in Asian hours, after Wall Street ended Friday with technology shares leading the retreat. The choppy tone in futures trading reflected uncertainty over how much more earnings downgrades could pressure high-multiple growth names into year-end. Softer Dollar And Rate Cut Bets Offer Support, But Crypto Eyes Tech Led Risk Swings President Donald Trump added another layer to the macro discussion, saying the new Federal Reserve chair will want interest rates to fall. The dollar recorded its longest run of weekly losses since August last week as markets firmed up bets on two Fed rate cuts in 2026, one more than the central bank itself is currently signalling. For crypto traders, that mix of softer dollar momentum and growing expectations of future rate cuts would usually be a tailwind, but the immediate focus has shifted back to equity volatility and the durability of the AI trade. With tech now central to both stock indices and digital asset narratives, any wobble in earnings can spill quickly across risk markets.

That’s the staggering reality for stablecoin adoption , which new analysis suggests is achieving viral, ChatGPT-like momentum. According to data from Token Terminal, these digital assets pegged to stable values are being embraced at an unprecedented rate by everyone from everyday users to major institutions. This isn’t just growth; it’s a financial paradigm shift happening in real-time. What Does “ChatGPT-Like” Stablecoin Adoption Really Mean? When analysts compare stablecoin adoption to ChatGPT, they’re highlighting a specific type of explosive growth. ChatGPT reached 100 million users in just two months, a feat that took other platforms years. Similarly, stablecoins are moving beyond niche crypto circles and into mainstream use at a breakneck speed. Token Terminal’s report emphasizes this viral spread across four key pillars: consumers, businesses, banks, and governments. Each group is finding unique utility, from cross-border payments for individuals to treasury management for corporations. Why Is Stablecoin Adoption Accelerating So Quickly? The driver behind this rapid stablecoin adoption is a powerful combination of utility and necessity. In a world of volatile cryptocurrencies and slow traditional banking, stablecoins offer a compelling solution. Let’s break down the key benefits fueling this fire: Speed and Low Cost: Transferring value across borders happens in minutes for pennies, not days for high fees. Accessibility: They provide a digital dollar equivalent for people in countries with unstable local currencies. Programmability: Smart contracts can automate payments, payroll, and more, creating efficiency for businesses. 24/7 Availability: Unlike traditional finance, the blockchain network never closes. This utility is creating a network effect. As more people and businesses use stablecoins, their value and acceptance grow, attracting even more users—a classic viral adoption loop. The Global Race: Who Leads in Stablecoin Adoption? Here’s where the analogy gets even more interesting. Just as the United States took a dominant early lead in the AI race with tools like ChatGPT, it is also aggressively pursuing leadership in the stablecoin adoption sector. American-based companies issue the largest stablecoins by market cap, and U.S. regulators are actively working to establish frameworks to govern them. However, this is a global race. Other nations and regions are developing their own digital currency strategies, recognizing that whoever sets the standards for this technology may shape the future of money. What Are the Challenges to Widespread Stablecoin Adoption? Despite the optimistic pace, the path to full stablecoin adoption isn’t without hurdles. Regulatory uncertainty remains the single biggest challenge. Governments worldwide are grappling with how to classify and oversee these assets—are they securities, commodities, or a new category? Furthermore, concerns about the reserves backing stablecoins and their potential systemic risk to financial markets need clear answers. For the average user, understanding how to safely acquire, store, and use stablecoins also presents a learning curve that must be addressed for truly mass adoption. The Future of Money: What’s Next for Stablecoins? The viral stablecoin adoption trend highlighted by Token Terminal points toward a future where digital dollars on blockchain are as common as email. We can expect deeper integration with traditional finance, more sophisticated regulatory clarity, and innovative use cases we haven’t yet imagined. The convergence of stablecoins with other technologies like AI for automated finance could redefine economic participation on a global scale. In conclusion, the comparison to ChatGPT’s viral growth is apt and revealing. Stablecoins are not a distant future concept; they are a present-day financial tool experiencing hyper-adoption. Their ability to provide stability, speed, and access is resonating across the spectrum of the global economy. While regulatory and technical challenges persist, the momentum is undeniable. The race to define the next era of digital value transfer is on, and stablecoins are currently its fastest-moving vehicle. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What exactly is a stablecoin? A: A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to have a stable value, typically pegged to a reserve asset like the US dollar or gold. This minimizes the price volatility common in other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Q: How is stablecoin adoption “viral” like ChatGPT? A: The term “viral” refers to the speed and pattern of adoption. Just as ChatGPT’s user base exploded in a matter of months by solving a clear need, stablecoins are seeing rapid, exponential uptake across diverse user groups (consumers, businesses) because they solve real-world financial friction points. Q: Are stablecoins safe to use? A: Safety depends on the specific stablecoin. It’s crucial to research the issuer, understand what assets back the coin (its reserves), and use reputable platforms for transactions. Regulatory oversight is still evolving, so user diligence is important. Q: Why does the US have a dominant position in stablecoins? A: Major stablecoins like USDC and USDT are issued by companies based in or closely tied to the United States. Furthermore, the U.S. financial system’s global influence and the ongoing development of a regulatory framework contribute to this leading position. Q: Can I use stablecoins for everyday purchases? A> Yes, adoption is growing. An increasing number of online merchants, payment processors, and even some physical stores accept payments via stablecoins, especially for cross-border transactions where they offer significant advantages. Q: What’s the biggest barrier to stablecoin adoption? A> Clear and consistent global regulation is the largest hurdle. Uncertainty about how governments will treat stablecoins creates hesitation among large institutions and some users. Once clearer rules are established, adoption could accelerate even further.

This dramatic shift is happening even as Bitcoin’s price continues its climb, potentially signaling a major change in market sentiment. Let’s dive into what this means for you and the future of BTC. What Do the Latest Binance Bitcoin Inflow Numbers Show? CryptoQuant contributor Darkfost recently highlighted a critical trend. The volume of Bitcoin entering the Binance exchange in large, single transactions has sharply declined. Specifically, the annual average inflow for these 1+ BTC transactions now sits at roughly 6,500 BTC. This is the lowest point we’ve seen in six years. For context, higher Binance Bitcoin inflows from large wallets often indicate that whales are preparing to sell. Therefore, a drop suggests the opposite: reduced intent to sell on the world’s largest crypto exchange. Why Are Falling Inflows a Bullish Signal? This trend is particularly significant because it contradicts the price action. Typically, you might expect large holders to move coins to exchanges to take profits during a price rally. The fact that Binance Bitcoin inflows are drying up while prices rise points to a market with stronger hands. Here are the key implications: Easing Selling Pressure: Fewer large BTC moving to Binance means less immediate supply is available to hit the market. Holder Confidence: Large investors appear to be holding their assets, anticipating further price appreciation. Market Maturation: This behavior resembles periods of accumulation, where investors hold through volatility. How Does This Compare to Previous Market Cycles? To understand the potential impact, we can look back. The last time Binance Bitcoin inflows for large transactions were this low was in 2018, which was a bear market bottom followed by a multi-year buildup. While history doesn’t repeat exactly, it often rhymes. This current low inflow level, coupled with a rising price, could indicate we are in a phase where long-term conviction is outweighing short-term profit-taking. This creates a foundation for a more sustainable bull run, as the market isn’t being flooded with sell orders from major players. What Actionable Insights Can Traders Take From This? Data is only powerful if you know how to use it. The slump in large Binance Bitcoin inflows is one piece of the puzzle, not the entire picture. However, it provides a crucial on-chain signal. For traders and investors, this suggests that the underlying selling pressure from whales may be weaker than expected. It reinforces a strategy of holding through pullbacks, as the core cohort of large holders seems to be doing the same. Always combine this with other indicators like overall exchange balances and macroeconomic factors for a complete view. Conclusion: A Quiet Shift in Market Dynamics In summary, the sharp decline in large Binance Bitcoin inflows to a six-year low is a profoundly optimistic signal hidden in plain sight. It tells a story of holder strength and a potential reduction in major sell-side liquidity. While caution is always wise in crypto markets, this on-chain metric provides a compelling reason for optimism about Bitcoin’s price stability and future growth potential. The whales appear to be holding tight, and that’s a narrative every investor should pay attention to. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are Binance Bitcoin inflows? A1: Binance Bitcoin inflows refer to the amount of Bitcoin being transferred into wallets controlled by the Binance exchange. Tracking large transactions (1+ BTC) helps analysts gauge the selling intentions of major holders. Q2: Why is a low inflow level considered bullish? A2: Low inflows suggest large holders are not depositing Bitcoin to sell on the exchange. This reduces immediate selling pressure, which can be a bullish sign for the price as supply on the market decreases. Q3: Who is Darkfost and what is CryptoQuant? A3: Darkfost is a contributor to CryptoQuant, a leading platform for on-chain cryptocurrency data and analytics. They provide metrics that help understand market behavior beyond just price charts. Q4: Does this mean the price of Bitcoin will definitely go up? A4: Not definitely. While low Binance Bitcoin inflows are a positive on-chain signal, price is influenced by many factors like regulations, macroeconomics, and adoption. This data should be used alongside other analysis. Q5: Should I buy Bitcoin based solely on this information? A5: No. This is one useful indicator, but you should never make investment decisions based on a single data point. Always conduct your own thorough research, consider your risk tolerance, and potentially consult a financial advisor. Q6: How often is this inflow data updated? A6: Platforms like CryptoQuant update on-chain data, including exchange inflows, in near real-time. Traders often monitor these metrics daily to spot changing trends.

Nansen CEO’s Dire 2030 Warning Shakes Crypto Community,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ethereum-obsolete-nansen-ceo-warning/,"BitcoinWorld Ethereum Obsolete? Nansen CEO’s Dire 2030 Warning Shakes Crypto Community A stark warning from a top analytics CEO is sending shockwaves through the crypto world. Alex Svanevik, CEO of blockchain data platform Nansen, has issued a dire prediction: Ethereum could become obsolete by 2030 . His critique isn’t about technology alone but targets the community’s mindset, suggesting a dangerous complacency could be Ethereum’s downfall. Why is the Nansen CEO sounding the alarm on Ethereum? In a recent post on X, Alex Svanevik highlighted a troubling pattern. When presented with data showing Ethereum falling behind competitors in key growth metrics, the community’s common response is dismissal. Svanevik observed that people often label the data as “unreliable” or quickly pivot to citing Ethereum’s still-strong Total Value Locked (TVL) as a counter-argument. This defensive posture, he argues, prevents honest assessment and necessary action. The Looming Threat: Could Ethereum Really Become Obsolete? The core of Svanevik’s argument is that innovation waits for no one. While Ethereum pioneered smart contracts and decentralized finance, newer blockchains are emerging with significant advantages. The risk of Ethereum becoming obsolete stems from several converging challenges: Scalability and Speed: Despite upgrades, high transaction fees and network congestion persist, pushing users to faster, cheaper alternatives. Community Complacency: Relying on past success and brand recognition without aggressively solving current user pain points. Competitive Innovation: Rival networks are aggressively capturing market share in areas like decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN) and consumer applications by offering superior user experience. Therefore, the path to avoiding obsolescence requires more than technical roadmaps; it demands a cultural shift toward data-driven problem-solving. What Must Change to Prevent Ethereum’s Obsolescence? Svanevik’s warning is a call for vigilance. For Ethereum to remain the dominant smart contract platform, the community must adopt a new attitude. This involves moving beyond defense and embracing constructive criticism. Key actionable insights include: Confront Data Head-On: Stop dismissing unfavorable metrics. Use them as a diagnostic tool to identify and fix weaknesses. Prioritize User Experience: Beyond developer appeal, focus on making applications cheap and seamless for the end-user. Accelerate Roadmap Execution: The pace of implementation for scalability solutions must meet the market’s demand. Moreover, the community’s strength—its size and history—could be its Achilles’ heel if it breeds inertia. The clock is ticking toward 2030. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for the Ethereum Ecosystem Alex Svanevik’s prediction that Ethereum could become obsolete is a provocative and necessary wake-up call. It underscores that technological leadership is not a permanent state but a title that must be continually earned. The coming years will be a critical test of whether the Ethereum community can channel its passion into pragmatic, data-informed evolution or risk fading into irrelevance as more agile competitors surge ahead. The choice, and the responsibility, lies with its builders and believers. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What exactly did the Nansen CEO say about Ethereum? A: Nansen CEO Alex Svanevik warned that if the Ethereum community continues to dismiss critical data showing it’s falling behind competitors, the network could lose its competitiveness and become obsolete by 2030. Q: Is Ethereum’s Total Value Locked (TVL) no longer important? A> TVL is still a key metric showing capital commitment. However, Svanevik’s point is that using TVL alone to dismiss other negative growth trends is a form of complacency that ignores broader competitive threats. Q: What are the main risks making Ethereum obsolete? A> The primary risks include persistent high fees and slow transactions, a community resistant to critical data, and faster, more user-friendly blockchains capturing new market segments. Q: What can the Ethereum community do to prevent this? A> The community needs to adopt a more data-driven and less defensive mindset, prioritize end-user experience and cost, and execute its scalability roadmap with greater urgency. Q: Does this mean I should sell my Ethereum? A> This article presents an analytical warning, not financial advice. Investors should always conduct their own research (DYOR) considering diverse viewpoints and long-term fundamentals. Did this analysis of Ethereum’s future challenge your perspective?

This shift aims to bring digital assets, including Bitcoin , Ethereum, and stablecoins, within the same regulatory perimeter as traditional financial instruments such as stocks and bonds. Moreover, officials stated that the change will enhance transparency in cryptocurrency markets, safeguard consumers, and equip regulators with more effective tools to address wrongdoing. They said the rules also strengthen consumer confidence while enhancing the UK’s ability to enforce sanctions. Lucy Rigby, the minister for the City of London, even commented: “We want the UK to be at the top of the list for crypto assets firms looking to grow and these new rules will give firms the clarity and consistency they need to plan for the long term.” Chancellor Reeves says new rules will foster growth and innovation According to the UK Treasury, fresh legislation extending existing financial services regulations to crypto firms will be tabled in Parliament in the coming months. The reforms are designed to provide greater legal clarity and investor protection, while also strengthening the UK’s position as a competitive global financial centre. Speaking on the new regulations, Chancellor Rachel Reeves, remarked : “Bringing crypto into the regulatory perimeter is a crucial step in securing the UK’s position as a world-leading financial centre in the digital age.” She claimed the government is giving firms the certainty they need to grow and innovate, protect consumers, and shut dishonest operators out of the UK market. Under the new rules, firms offering crypto services, from trading platforms to digital wallets, will be required to register with the FCA under UK AML regulations. Lately, the crypto market has been shaken by concerns about overheated AI investments, and UK consumers have particularly suffered a sharp rise in scam-related losses, most often linked to bogus cryptocurrencies. In September, a UK court convicted a Chinese woman, Zhimin Qian, over a huge bitcoin scam that affected more than 100,000 victims. Prosecutors said she masterminded a fraud between 2014 and 2017 that cost around 128,000 people their savings. Nevertheless, Qian pleaded guilty at Southwark Crown Court to acquiring and possessing cryptocurrency linked to crime. UK officials are working to ban crypto donations UK ministers plan to outlaw cryptocurrency political donations. They are concerned that crypto donations pose a risk to election integrity, especially because it’s hard to trace their source. However, the intricacies of cryptocurrency mean they don’t expect a ban to be included in the elections bill, which will also lower the voting age and address financial gaps. Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, could see its crypto fundraising plans disrupted by the government’s proposed ban. The party received its first registerable crypto contributions this autumn and operates its own portal with “enhanced” verification measures. In July, Pat McFadden, a minister at the Cabinet Office at the time, stated that the Electoral Commission should investigate donations, noting the importance of knowing who the donors were, whether they were registered, and the legitimacy of the contributions. A ban on cryptocurrency donations needs to be passed through legislation, even though the Electoral Commission provides guidance. Earlier in the year, the Commission suggested that cryptocurrency donations could be treated similarly to other assets or in-kind donations. In August, Vijay Rangarajan, Chief Executive of the Electoral Commission, stated that he did not believe a ban was necessary, noting that parties already have a strong responsibility to verify the source of their donations. He noted that political parties are often given gifts that are much stranger than crypto, including artworks, overseas trips, or yacht usage, which can be challenging to assess.

The data also reveals that stablecoins have become the most widely used crypto product in the world. Emerging Markets Advance Through Necessity The research compares global adoption across four areas, which include user penetration, transactional use, institutional readiness, and cultural penetration, with Singapore and the United States leading the overall rankings due to a strong balance across all four areas. However, the most meaningful growth comes from countries where people rely on crypto because the financial system around them does not provide stability or access. Vietnam appears in ninth place and stands out due to a user penetration rating of 0.68 and a transactional use level of 0.81. Data shows that nearly one-fifth of its population is estimated to own digital assets, with people relying on them for remittances, inflation protection, and savings. The country is also becoming an active centre for DePIN activity as device-based participation spreads quickly. Ukraine comes in thirteenth on the list and represents the clearest case of necessity-driven growth. More than $6.9 billion in stablecoin flows moved through its economy against a GDP of $190 billion, giving the country the highest usage relative to its economic size. Crypto has become a lifeline in Ukraine, supporting cross-border transfers and preserving values during wartime, and making digital assets an important part of financial survival. Nigeria follows in nineteenth place and offers another example of utility-led adoption. Its transactional use score of 0.83 sits far above the global average as inflation, devaluation, and capital controls push households and businesses toward stablecoins, peer-to-peer platforms, and digital savings tools. The introduction of cNGN, a naira-backed stablecoin, has also contributed to rising adoption levels. Bybit predicts that if its use expands beyond pilot stages, Nigeria could become one of the first major emerging economies where a local currency stablecoin is used with dollar-based options. Global Stablecoin Use Rise Bybit’s findings show that stablecoins now lead global crypto adoption and are the most evenly distributed product across markets. Their usage falls into two main categories, with some people adopting them for daily payments and financial stability, while they also serve as a bridge to investment products and broader participation in crypto markets. Several factors explain growth. For instance, in Ukraine, stablecoins serve as safe-haven assets during political and economic instability, while Nigerians rely on them to bypass banking limits and currency shortages. In other countries like Hong Kong, they support capital mobility in complex and high-volume trading environments. Across advanced and emerging markets, these assets expand access to financial tools by allowing people to enter DeFi platforms , centralized exchanges, or tokenized assets. The data also highlights three trends shaping global stablecoin acceptance. Regulators in the United States, Hong Kong, and the EU are moving toward aligned rules on reserves and compliance. At the same time, financial institutions are integrating stablecoins into mainstream settlement systems, while interest grows in local currency options such as yen, euro, and naira-backed tokens.

The recent Series A funding round marks a transformative chapter for YO Labs. According to reports from CoinDesk, the capital injection will primarily fuel two critical areas. First, the company plans to significantly enhance the underlying infrastructure of the YO protocol. Second, they aim to expand their service offerings, potentially bringing sophisticated yield optimization tools to a broader audience. This strategic move comes at a time when efficient capital deployment in the crypto space is more valuable than ever. Foundation Capital taking the lead in this round is particularly noteworthy. Their involvement often serves as a stamp of approval, attracting further attention from other investors and users. Moreover, participation from Coinbase Ventures, the investment arm of a leading cryptocurrency exchange, provides YO Labs with not just capital, but also potential strategic partnerships and market access. How Will YO Protocol Use the New Funds? YO Labs has outlined clear objectives for deploying the newly acquired $10 million. The focus is on building a more robust, secure, and user-friendly platform. Let’s break down the key areas of development: Infrastructure Enhancement: Strengthening the core protocol’s security, scalability, and speed to handle increased demand and ensure user funds are protected. Service Expansion: Developing new features and products that make yield optimization accessible to both novice and experienced cryptocurrency holders. Team Growth: Attracting top talent in blockchain development, security, and finance to drive innovation forward. Ecosystem Development: Fostering a stronger community and potentially integrating with other major DeFi platforms to increase utility. Therefore, this funding is not just about maintaining the status quo. It’s a launchpad for ambitious growth that could redefine how investors approach earning yield on their digital assets. Why is Yield Optimization Crucial in Cryptocurrency? For anyone holding cryptocurrencies, the concept of yield optimization is becoming essential. Simply holding assets in a wallet often means missing out on potential earnings. Yield optimization protocols like YO automatically seek out the best opportunities across various DeFi platforms—such as lending, staking, or liquidity provision—to maximize returns for users. This process, often complex and time-consuming to do manually, is streamlined by smart algorithms. The challenge, however, lies in balancing high returns with security and reliability. This is where a well-funded and professionally built protocol like YO aims to make a difference. With this new capital, YO Labs can invest in rigorous security audits, better risk management frameworks, and a more intuitive interface, making advanced DeFi strategies safer and simpler for everyone. What’s Next for YO Labs and Its Users? The successful Series A round places YO Labs in a powerful position within the competitive DeFi landscape. Users of the YO protocol can likely expect a roadmap filled with tangible upgrades. We might see reduced transaction fees, support for more cryptocurrencies, and advanced automated strategies. Furthermore, the backing of prominent venture capital firms often accelerates development timelines and increases a project’s longevity and credibility. In conclusion, the $10 million raised by YO Labs is more than just a financial headline. It is a strong vote of confidence in the protocol’s vision and a commitment to building a more efficient and accessible future for cryptocurrency investing. This investment empowers YO Labs to tackle the core challenges of DeFi—complexity and risk—head-on, potentially setting a new standard for what a yield optimization platform can achieve.

The company sold 240.6M shares at HK$6.68 each, Bloomberg reported Monday, after marketing the offer in a range of HK$5.95 to HK$6.95. HashKey did not exercise an option to increase the size of the deal. Investor interest was strong. The top 20 entities in the institutional book took roughly 80% of the shares available in that tranche, excluding stock earmarked for cornerstone buyers, the outlet said. Overall demand ran at several times the number of shares on offer. HashKey’s Share Sale Could Make It Hong Kong’s First Public Crypto Exchange HashKey is bidding to become Hong Kong’s first listed crypto exchange , in a transaction that will gauge how much public market appetite remains for compliant digital asset venues after the latest leg of the cycle. The listing also lands in an active year for Hong Kong IPOs, with total proceeds on track for a four year high. HashKey Holdings, the operator of Hong Kong’s largest licensed cryptocurrency exchange, raised HK$1.6 billion ($206 million) after pricing its initial public offering toward the high end of the marketed range, according to people familiar with the matter https://t.co/vwGm6HAFST — Bloomberg (@business) December 15, 2025 The company had earlier flagged plans to sell about 240.6M shares globally, with around 24.1M reserved for Hong Kong investors and the rest allocated internationally. At the top of the marketed range, the deal would have raised up to HK$1.67B and valued HashKey at about HK$19B, according to its prospectus. HashKey’s shares are scheduled to start trading on Wednesday in Hong Kong. JPMorgan Chase and Guotai Junan are joint sponsors of the offering. IPO Will Test Whether Investors Back Hong Kong’s Leading Regulated Crypto Exchange HashKey was among the first exchanges to secure a licence under Hong Kong’s dedicated digital asset regime, introduced in 2022 as the city sought to pull trading onshore from offshore venues. Research cited in its filing said HashKey holds more than 75% of Hong Kong’s onshore digital asset trading volume, giving it a dominant share in the regulated segment of the market. Beyond spot trading, HashKey runs one of Asia’s larger on chain services platforms, offering staking, tokenisation and custodial technology for multiple protocols. It also manages billions in client assets through funds and structured products aimed at institutional and high net worth investors. Proceeds from the IPO will go toward scaling its technology stack and infrastructure, hiring more staff and strengthening risk management, the company has said. Those investments are meant to position HashKey as a core beneficiary if Hong Kong’s push to become a regional digital asset hub gains further traction. The timing of the debut is not without challenges. Bitcoin has fallen about 30% from its record high in October, and global risk appetite has softened as traders reassess how much they want to pay for growth and AI related stories. For crypto-focused investors, HashKey’s first day performance will offer an early read on whether public equity buyers are ready to back regulated exchanges at premium valuations.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-to-xrp-holders-youre-not-ready-for-whats-coming-heres-why/,"A recent post by prominent cryptocurrency influencer Amonyx draws attention to a research paper published by Digital Asset Solutions (DAS), which assesses the evolving role of XRP within the global payments landscape. According to the document highlighted in the post, the company behind XRP is positioning the digital asset as a core piece of financial infrastructure rather than a speculative instrument. The research emphasizes utility, scalability, and integration with existing monetary systems, areas that remain central to institutional decision-making in digital finance. The DAS paper evaluates several factors that influence the adoption of blockchain-based payment solutions. It notes that stablecoins such as USDT and USDC, along with potential central bank digital currencies, create a competitive environment that limits unchecked growth for payment-focused digital assets. Persistent volatility is also identified as a structural challenge for widespread transactional use. Despite these constraints, the research suggests that XRP is being developed with a long-term infrastructure objective, targeting cross-border settlement efficiency and institutional-grade reliability. BREAKING: DAS Research Paper Says #Ripple Positioning $XRP as Key Infrastructure for Global Payments You’re not ready for what’s coming. pic.twitter.com/gGdS2pT6Ty — Amonyx (@amonbuy) December 12, 2025 Positioning XRP Beyond a Niche Use Case The analysis referenced by Amonyx outlines how ongoing initiatives are intended to support this positioning. These include liquidity solutions, stablecoin-related developments, and an expanding network of partnerships. The research argues that these efforts collectively establish a foundation for broader adoption, particularly among financial institutions seeking on-chain alternatives for international payments. A critical point raised in the paper is that future growth depends less on technical readiness and more on whether institutional partners transition from limited trials to major operational use. If this shift occurs, XRP could move beyond a specialized role and become embedded within segments of the international financial system. The paper describes this potential transition as a gradual process rather than an immediate outcome, shaped by regulatory clarity and demonstrated performance at scale. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Short- and Medium-Term Catalysts Identified The DAS report also outlines several developments that could influence adoption timelines. In the shorter term, technological upgrades such as an EVM-compatible sidechain and planned network extensions are cited as mechanisms for expanding functionality. The integration of tokenized institutional assets, including RLUSD, alongside the growing momentum toward exchange-traded fund approvals , is presented as an additional factor that could influence market perception and institutional interest. Looking further ahead, the research suggests deeper integration with financial infrastructure and innovations in decentralized finance and CBDC-related systems as possible drivers of sustained relevance. These elements are set as conditional opportunities rather than guarantees, dependent on regulatory alignment and institutional execution. In amplifying the research, Amonyx explains the findings as a significant development for those following XRP’s institutional trajectory.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency was last hovering around $89,700, down roughly 1.2% over the past 24 hours, with price action largely subdued. The lack of volatility reflects a wider consolidation phase, as institutional trading desks scale back activity ahead of the holidays. With liquidity thinning and risk appetite muted, market participants appear reluctant to take fresh directional bets. Post-October Correction Sets a Defensive Tone The current sideways movement follows a sharp correction from Bitcoin’s October highs. On October 10, BTC was trading above $113,000 before a steep sell-off reset market expectations . That drawdown has since fostered a more cautious tone, particularly as the market enters a traditionally low-liquidity period. On-chain and derivatives data suggest participation has steadily weakened through the final quarter. A recent Glassnode report shows trading activity declining from November into December, alongside expectations that implied volatility will continue to compress toward year-end. “The contraction in volume reflects a more defensive overall market positioning, with less liquidity-driven capital flow available to absorb volatility or sustain directional moves,” Glassnode noted. Institutional Fatigue and a Wait-and-See Market That assessment aligns with commentary from market analysts, including Markus Thielen of 10x Research, who has pointed to signs of “institutional fatigue.” Despite substantial spot Bitcoin ETF inflows earlier in the year, those allocations have yet to translate into sustained upside, prompting funds to de-risk and close books into year-end. 10x Weekly Crypto Kickoff – Why Year-End Risk Skews to the Downside The report covers derivatives positioning, volatility trends, and funding dynamics across Bitcoin and Ethereum, along with sentiment, technical signals, ETF and stablecoin flows, option activity, expected… pic.twitter.com/4Pp3VyBX3h — 10x Research (@10x_Research) December 14, 2025 With retail participation also subdued, analysts broadly agree that the conditions for a meaningful breakout are lacking. Even the Federal Reserve’s recent neutral stance on interest rates has failed to act as a catalyst for renewed institutional positioning. For now, Bitcoin appears content to remain range-bound, with traders and investors alike waiting for clearer signals, and deeper liquidity, likely not until the New Year.

Exor pointed out Juventus’ deep historical ties to the Agnelli family and its commitment to retaining ownership, which brought an abrupt end to speculation around one of the biggest crypto-for-sports acquisition attempts to date. Tether Fails in Bid to Buy Juventus Stablecoin issuer Tether’s attempt to take full control of Italian football club Juventus was firmly rejected by the club’s long-time owner, Exor,which very quickly ended speculation around one of the most high-profile intersections between crypto capital and European football. Exor is the Agnelli family’s holding company that controlled Juventus for more than a century. It said on Saturday that its board unanimously dismissed an unsolicited takeover proposal from Tether to acquire all outstanding shares in the publicly listed club. The company explained that it has no intention of selling its stake in Juventus to any third party, including Tether, despite the size of the offer and the premium attached to it. Announcement from Exor The rejection happened after Tether’s announcement on Friday that it submitted a binding all-cash bid for Exor’s 65.4% controlling stake, with plans to launch a public offer for the remaining shares at the same price if the proposal was accepted. According to Reuters , Tether offered 2.66 euros per share, valuing Juventus at just over 1 billion euros, which is above its market capitalization of roughly 944 million euros based on Friday’s closing price of 2.19 euros. In a video that was published on Juventus’ website, Exor CEO John Elkann talked about the club’s deep roots in the Agnelli family, and described Juventus as a central part of his family’s history for more than 100 years. He said the club’s identity, history, and values were not for sale. The company added that it is still committed to supporting the club’s current management and long-term strategy, both on and off the pitch. Tether positioned its bid as a long-term investment rather than a short-term financial play. The company said it was prepared to inject an additional 1 billion euros into Juventus to support its development if the transaction had gone through. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino framed the proposal as both a financial and personal commitment by saying he had grown up with the club and that Tether’s strong balance sheet would allow it to provide stable, patient capital. Tether also recently expanded into areas like energy, infrastructure, and sports investments. The company first disclosed a stake in Juventus in February and increased its holding to more than 10% by April, making it one of the club’s bigger minority shareholders. Last month, Juventus shareholders approved the appointment of Francesco Garino, nominated by Tether , to the club’s board of directors. However, a separate attempt to secure a board seat for Tether’s deputy investment chief, Zachary Lyons, was unsuccessful.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|USDT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-15 05:30:00

Key Takeaways: Police arrested suspects in Spain and Denmark over a violent, crypto-linked kidnapping and killing. The case involved physical coercion to access victims’ cryptocurrency wallets. It highlights growing security risks for individual crypto holders. The arrests follow a joint investigation that uncovered what police described as a cross-border criminal group focused on stealing digital assets through violent means. Spanish and Danish authorities coordinated the operation, which involved multiple raids and the seizure of weapons and electronic devices. Masked Gunmen Abduct Couple in Málaga Crypto Case The case came to light in April, when a woman reported to police in Málaga that she and her partner had been abducted in the nearby town of Mijas. According to investigators, the couple was ambushed by three or four masked men dressed in black and armed with handguns. Police said the man was shot in the leg as he attempted to flee. Both victims were then forced into a vehicle and taken to a house, where they were held for several hours. During the captivity, the attackers attempted to gain access to the couple’s cryptocurrency wallets. The woman was released around midnight. Her partner did not survive. His body was later discovered in a wooded area, showing signs of violence in addition to the gunshot wound, authorities said. Spanish police have arrested 5 people for the kidnapping & murder of a man targeted for his cryptocurrency holdings, while another four suspects have been charged in Denmark in connection with the same plot. The attack occurred in April in southern Spain. https://t.co/hEnOk3GgZp — Jameson Lopp (@lopp) December 11, 2025 As part of the investigation, police carried out six raids at properties in Madrid and Málaga. Officers seized two handguns, one real and one imitation, along with a baton, blood-stained clothing, mobile phones, and documents believed to be linked to the crime. Biological evidence connected to the scene was also recovered. In Denmark, police charged four suspects in connection with the case. Two of them were already serving prison sentences for similar offenses, according to authorities. The incident highlights a growing concern within the crypto industry: physical attacks aimed at forcing victims to surrender access to digital wallets. Often referred to as “wrench attacks,” these crimes have drawn increased attention in recent months, prompting renewed calls for better personal security practices among crypto holders. Violent ‘Wrench Attacks’ on Crypto Holders Surge Violent attacks targeting cryptocurrency holders are on track to reach record levels in 2025, according to a report from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. As of July, 35 so-called “wrench attacks” have already been recorded worldwide, putting the year on pace to surpass the previous peak seen during the 2021 bull market. Chainalysis said crypto-related crime is increasingly shifting from online exploits to real-world violence. More than $2.17 billion has been stolen from crypto services so far this year, already exceeding the total for all of 2024, with nearly a quarter of losses now coming from personal wallet attacks. Bitcoin holders are facing higher average losses, as criminals focus on large-value wallets, particularly in regions with growing retail adoption. The Asia-Pacific region has emerged as one of the hardest hit, ranking second globally for Bitcoin stolen and third for Ether theft. Countries including Japan, Indonesia, South Korea, and the Philippines have reported a rise in incidents, some with severe outcomes.

According to a report from People’s Daily, Jinping told top officials that he is done with “reckless” planning and warned that the system will hold people accountable when they chase hype instead of real growth. Jinping added all future plans must “be based on facts” and aim for growth that is “solid” and “genuine,” not dressed-up reports that hide problems. The Chinese leader pushed for high-quality development instead of projects with “no purpose except showing superficial results.” Jinping’s examples were direct: oversized industrial parks that no one needs, messy expansions of local expos and forums, pumped-up statistics, and staged “fake construction kickoffs.” Xi wants economists to follow real time data Jinping then told officials that people who make “excessive demands” or burn through resources “without careful consideration” will face strict consequences, adding that China ’s financial position is tighter than before, with local debt rising and limiting what the government can spend. He said the country cannot afford wasteful moves made only to boost short-term GDP numbers. He said access to economic data inside China is sensitive and controlled, which makes it hard for outside watchers to judge how strong or weak the economy really is. Because of that, he said GDP should not be the only thing used to measure an official’s work. He wants their performance judged by how they protect people’s well-being, keep stability, and lay a base strong enough to support the future economy. The timing of his message matched fresh numbers showing that investment in China has now fallen for three straight months. Official data showed fixed asset investment from January through November dropped 2.6% compared with the same period last year. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expected a smaller 2.3% drop, and October’s decline was 1.7%. The slide adds more pressure on leadership to stop the decline before it drags the whole economy. Last week, the Central Economic Work Conference stated that “China will work to stabilise and revive investment, [and] appropriately increase the scale of investment within the central government budget.” Analysts see this as the first time Beijing has openly admitted that investment is weakening. The reason this matters is simple: for decades, China leaned on state-financed building projects, property, and heavy manufacturing to fuel most of its growth. Track weaker demand, falling AI stock, slow spending Retail sales made things worse.Last month’s growth was the weakest in three years, which shows a tired consumer base and households still worried about the property downturn that has stretched into a fifth year. The IMF also weighed in last week, pushing Beijing to launch stronger steps to boost demand and fight deflation that has stayed in the system for months. China’s AI sector also had its own drama. Shares of Moore Threads Technology Co., a major Chinese AI chipmaker, fell after the company revealed plans to move most of its newly raised money into safe banking deposits. It said in a Shanghai stock exchange filing that it will put 7.5 billion yuan (about $1.1 billion) equal to roughly 90% of its IPO proceeds, into principal-guaranteed products like timed deposits and certificates of deposit. Moore Threads had raised around 8 billion yuan earlier this month and said the money would go toward chip development. Instead, traders saw the shift into deposit products as a sign of caution. The stock had soared 613% over six trading days from its debut through Friday, helped by optimism around China’s AI market, but then dropped as much as 6.9% on Monday.

As the year draws to a close, a notable shift has gripped the market: a dramatic decline in Bitcoin volatility . According to a fresh analysis from Markus Thielen, CEO of 10x Research, this market calm is actively limiting any potential for a short-term price rebound. For investors watching the charts, understanding this dynamic is crucial for navigating the final weeks of the year. What Does Declining Bitcoin Volatility Really Mean? Volatility measures the rate and magnitude of price changes. High Bitcoin volatility often signals big swings and trading opportunities, while low volatility suggests a compressed, range-bound market. Thielen points to Bitcoin’s implied volatility index, a forward-looking metric, which is expected to keep falling. This isn’t just a technical observation; it reflects a fundamental cooling of market engines. The buying pressure that typically fuels rallies—from both large institutions and everyday retail investors—has noticeably slowed, according to on-chain data. When volatility contracts under these conditions, the energy for a sudden surge simply isn’t there. Why Is a Short-Term Rebound Unlikely? The analysis presents a clear picture. The probability of a significant price rebound in the immediate future is low. Thielen connects this directly to the persistent downtrend that has been in place since October 10th. Think of it like a coiled spring: low Bitcoin volatility means the spring isn’t being compressed with new energy. Instead, the market is in a state of equilibrium, or even fatigue. Key factors contributing to this include: Reduced Institutional Activity: Large buyers are often less active during holiday periods. Retail Hesitation: On-chain metrics show a slowdown in new capital entering the network. Seasonal Trends: Historical patterns often show quieter markets in December. Therefore, attempting to “buy the dip” right now might be premature. The prudent strategy, as Thielen advises, is patience. When Could the Bitcoin Volatility and Trend Shift? While the short-term outlook appears muted, the analysis isn’t entirely pessimistic. Thielen identifies a potential catalyst on the horizon: January. Historically, the new year has often brought renewed market activity and capital flows. A technical rebound at that time is seen as a distinct possibility. This creates a critical waiting game for investors. The current phase of low Bitcoin volatility may be the necessary consolidation before the next leg. The key is to wait for a clear, confirmed trend reversal signal rather than trying to anticipate the bottom. Jumping in too early could mean catching a falling knife instead of riding a new wave. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should you do with this information? First, manage expectations. Don’t count on a Santa Claus rally for Bitcoin if current conditions hold. Second, use this period of low Bitcoin volatility for research and planning. Identify your entry points and set alerts for when key resistance levels break. Finally, practice discipline. The temptation to buy during a quiet market can be strong, but the analysis suggests greater rewards may come to those who wait for the market to show its hand in January. Remember, in crypto, timing and confirmation are often more valuable than sheer anticipation. Conclusion: Patience Over Panic in a Quiet Market The message from 10x Research is clear: the declining Bitcoin volatility is a market signal that demands respect. It indicates a lack of immediate fuel for a rebound, advising against hasty investment decisions. However, by recognizing this period as potential consolidation and looking ahead to historical shifts in January, informed investors can position themselves strategically. In the ever-volatile world of cryptocurrency, sometimes the most powerful move is to wait for the right moment with disciplined vigilance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Bitcoin volatility? Bitcoin volatility refers to the statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for Bitcoin’s price. In simple terms, it shows how much and how quickly the price is changing. High volatility means large price swings, while low volatility means the price is relatively stable. Why does low volatility limit a price rebound? Low volatility often indicates a lack of strong buying or selling pressure. For a rebound to occur, significant new buying interest is needed to push the price upward. A calm, low-volatility market suggests this momentum is absent, making a sharp recovery less likely. What is the implied volatility index? The implied volatility index is a metric derived from options prices that reflects the market’s expectation of future volatility. A falling index suggests traders anticipate calmer, less turbulent price action ahead. Should I sell my Bitcoin because of this analysis? Not necessarily. This analysis focuses on the short-term rebound potential. It suggests waiting to buy more, not necessarily selling existing holdings. Always base sell decisions on your personal investment strategy and risk tolerance. What is a clear trend reversal signal? A clear trend reversal signal could be a sustained break above a key resistance level (e.g., a moving average or a previous price high) with strong trading volume. It confirms that buying pressure has overcome selling pressure. Why is January highlighted for a potential rebound? January often sees renewed investment activity as new capital is allocated for the year. Historically, crypto markets have sometimes experienced positive momentum in January, following quieter December periods. Found this analysis of Bitcoin volatility and market timing helpful?

Prices on the London Metal Exchange hit $11,656.50 per ton during midday trading in Shanghai after the metal had crashed by 3% in the previous session. That drop came when tech stocks linked to artificial intelligence collapsed on Wall Street and dragged the whole demand outlook with them. The rebound today came fast, and it landed with force, as the metal had just touched a record near $12,000 per ton before the selloff hit. Zinc gained 1.1%, and aluminum added 0.4%. Analysts warn of supply gaps and rising demand Copper has climbed more than 30% this year. Mine problems cut supply, and traders have been moving huge shipments into the United States ahead of possible tariffs under President Donald Trump’s 2025 trade posture. Investment in green energy and power grids has built expectations for stronger long-term demand. Citi analysts said the metal may face major shortages because of tight mine supply and continued “hoarding” inside the United States. Citi said, “We expect the U.S. to hoard global copper inventory and, in a bull case, draw further on depleted ex-U.S. stock,” adding that prices may hit $13,000 per ton in early 2026 and even $15,000 by the second quarter next year. Avatar Commodities CEO Andrew Glass said the setup points to “stratospheric new highs,” driven by U.S. stockpiling that is reducing supply outside the country. Glass said the rally reflects a “highly irregular distortion” fueled mainly by tariff concerns, not regular supply-and-demand flows, and added that Chinese demand has stayed weak. ING strategist Ewa Manthey said prices could reach $12,000 per ton next year and warned that higher prices will hit margins in energy-heavy industries. Spot prices hit $11,816 per ton on Friday, while 3-month LME futures closed at $11,515, lifting global benchmarks by about 36% this year and 9% over the past month. Tariffs drive U.S. inflows and drain global stocks Copper ‘s rally has been mostly triggered by global concerns that Trump will add duties on refined Copper imports from 2027, so now buyers are rushing shipments into the U.S. Data from StoneX showed U.S. inflows jumping by roughly 650,000 tons this year, lifting inventories to about 750,000 tons. On the LME, copper last traded around $11,515 per ton for 3-month delivery, while COMEX March futures were around $11,814, creating strong arbitrage incentives. That pull has drained stock from the LME, which acts as a market of last resort. Inventory data showed copper stocks at roughly 165,000 tons, with about 66,650 tons, around 40%, locked in canceled warrants, meaning that metal is set aside for delivery and not available to the open market. LME stocks are down nearly 40% from the start of the year. Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank called 2025 “a heavily disrupted year,” thanks to major miners cutting output targets. Updated guidance from large producers reduced expected 2026 supply by about 300,000 tons. The bank said the market will sit in deficit, with the tightest period expected in Q4 2025 and Q1 2026. Glencore lowered its 2026 production outlook to 810,000–870,000 tons because of reduced sourcing from the Collahuasi mine, which it owns with Anglo American. Rio Tinto told Reuters that next year’s output may fall to 800,000–870,000 tons, below this year’s 860,000-875,000 tons target.

This split-screen reality reveals the complex forces shaping Asia FX dynamics in the current global economic landscape. How Are Asia FX Markets Reacting to China’s Economic Data? Most Asian currencies demonstrated surprising resilience this week despite disappointing economic indicators from China, the region’s economic powerhouse. The Chinese yuan itself traded within a narrow range, while currencies like the South Korean won, Singapore dollar, and Taiwanese dollar showed minimal movement. This stability suggests that markets may have already priced in China’s economic challenges, or that other factors are providing counterbalancing support for Asia FX valuations. What China Data Is Worrying Investors? The latest economic reports from China reveal several areas of concern that could impact regional currency markets: Industrial production growth below expectations Retail sales figures missing forecasts Persistent weakness in the property sector Export growth showing signs of slowing Youth unemployment remaining elevated This China data paints a picture of an economy struggling to maintain momentum despite various stimulus measures, creating headwinds for currencies across the region that depend on Chinese demand. Why Is the Japanese Yen Surging Against Other Currencies? While most Asian currencies tread water, the Japanese yen has been the standout performer, gaining ground against both regional peers and major global currencies. This movement represents a significant shift from the yen’s prolonged weakness and points to changing market expectations about Japan’s monetary policy direction. Currency Pair Weekly Change Key Driver USD/JPY -1.8% BOJ policy expectations EUR/JPY -2.1% Yield differential narrowing AUD/JPY -1.5% Commodity currency pressure CNY/JPY -0.9% Diverging policy paths What’s Driving Bank of Japan Rate Hike Expectations? The surge in the yen stems from growing conviction among traders and analysts that the Bank of Japan is preparing to end its long-standing negative interest rate policy. Several factors contribute to this expectation: Sustained inflation above the BOJ’s 2% target > Increasing wage growth following spring wage negotiations Comments from BOJ officials suggesting policy normalization Global central bank tightening creating policy divergence pressure Concerns about yen weakness impacting import costs and living standards Market participants now see a strong possibility that the Bank of Japan could raise rates as early as its next meeting, marking the first hike since 2007 and ending the world’s last negative rate regime. How Are Currency Markets Balancing These Divergent Forces? The current currency markets environment presents traders with competing narratives. On one side, weak Chinese economic data typically pressures Asian currencies through reduced regional trade and growth expectations. On the other, potential BOJ policy normalization supports the yen and could trigger broader repricing across Asian FX pairs. This tension creates both challenges and opportunities for market participants navigating these currency markets . What Does This Mean for Forex Traders and Investors? For those active in Asian currency markets , several actionable insights emerge from the current situation: Monitor Chinese economic indicators for signs of stabilization or further deterioration Watch BOJ communications closely for policy shift signals Consider correlation patterns between Asian currencies and their sensitivity to both Chinese data and yen movements Evaluate carry trade strategies in light of potential interest rate changes Assess portfolio exposure to currency pairs with high sensitivity to these regional dynamics FAQs: Understanding the Asia FX Landscape What specific Chinese economic data is most concerning markets? The most worrying China data points include slowing industrial production, weaker-than-expected retail sales, persistent property market troubles, and signs of export growth deceleration. These indicators suggest broader economic challenges beyond temporary fluctuations. How significant would a Bank of Japan rate hike be for global markets? A Bank of Japan rate hike would represent a historic shift, ending the world’s last negative interest rate policy. This could trigger substantial capital flows, impact global bond markets, and potentially strengthen the Japanese yen significantly against other major currencies. Which Asian currencies are most vulnerable to weak Chinese data? Commodity-linked currencies like the Australian dollar and currencies of economies with high export exposure to China, including the South Korean won and Taiwanese dollar, typically show higher sensitivity to Chinese economic performance in Asia FX markets. What entities are most influential in these currency movements? Key entities include the People’s Bank of China (China’s central bank), the Bank of Japan , the U.S. Federal Reserve , and major financial institutions like Nomura Holdings and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group that are active in Asian currency markets . How long have markets been anticipating BOJ policy normalization? Markets have speculated about Bank of Japan policy normalization for several years, but expectations have intensified significantly in recent months as inflation has remained above target and wage growth has shown signs of meaningful acceleration. Conclusion: Navigating the New Asia FX Reality The current Asia FX landscape presents a tale of two narratives: regional currencies showing resilience despite concerning China data , while the Japanese yen surges on expectations of historic policy shifts from the Bank of Japan . This divergence highlights the complex, multi-factor nature of modern currency markets , where domestic policy developments can sometimes outweigh regional economic headwinds. For traders and investors, success will depend on carefully balancing these competing forces while remaining agile in response to new data and central bank signals. The weeks ahead promise continued volatility and opportunity as these stories unfold across Asian financial markets.

He seeks to allocate a massive 17.45 million CRV grant, valued at roughly $6.6 million, directly into the heart of the Curve ecosystem. This strategic investment aims to fund critical technology and research, potentially setting a new standard for decentralized finance (DeFi) development. The proposed Curve Finance CRV grant represents a significant commitment to the protocol’s long-term vision and technical supremacy. What Does This $6.6 Million Curve Finance CRV Grant Entail? The proposal, detailed on the Curve DAO governance forum, is not a vague funding round. It has a clear recipient and a detailed roadmap. The funds are earmarked for Swiss Stake AG, a Switzerland-based development firm deeply embedded in the Curve ecosystem. This direct allocation to a known entity with a proven track record aims to ensure efficient and effective use of the capital. The goal is to avoid dilution and focus resources on executing a specific, ambitious technical agenda that benefits all Curve Finance stakeholders. How Will Swiss Stake Use the Curve Finance Funding? Swiss Stake has outlined a comprehensive development plan targeting 2026. The proposal goes beyond simple maintenance, focusing on expansion and pioneering new financial primitives. The core objectives funded by this Curve Finance CRV grant include: Launching and Scaling Llamalend v2: This involves the full launch and subsequent expansion of the second version of Curve’s native lending system. A more robust and feature-rich Llamalend could significantly enhance capital efficiency within the ecosystem. Building an On-Chain FX Swap Market: This is a particularly ambitious goal. Creating a decentralized foreign exchange market could bridge traditional finance (TradFi) and DeFi, opening up massive new liquidity pools and use cases for the Curve Finance protocol. Strengthening Governance & Infrastructure: The grant will also support vital behind-the-scenes work, including bolstering governance frameworks and maintaining the core software repositories that keep the protocol secure and operational. Why Is This Curve Finance Proposal So Important for DeFi? This move is more than just a large transaction; it’s a strategic play for sustainable growth. In the competitive DeFi landscape, continuous innovation is not optional—it’s essential for survival and relevance. By proactively funding a multi-year roadmap, the Curve DAO is investing in its own future. This Curve Finance CRV grant helps ensure the protocol remains at the cutting edge, particularly with projects like the on-chain FX market which could be a major differentiator. It demonstrates a mature approach to ecosystem development, moving beyond speculation to fund concrete, value-adding technology. What Are the Next Steps for This CRV Grant Proposal? The proposal is now in the hands of the Curve DAO, the decentralized collective of CRV token holders who govern the protocol. Their vote will determine the proposal’s fate. This process embodies the core principle of decentralized governance, where the community decides on the allocation of substantial treasury resources. A successful vote would not only release the funds but also signal strong community confidence in Swiss Stake’s vision and the strategic direction of Curve Finance . In conclusion, Michael Egorov’s proposal for a $6.6 million Curve Finance CRV grant is a decisive and forward-thinking initiative. It channels significant resources directly into technological advancement and ambitious new product development like an on-chain FX market. If approved by the DAO, this investment could catalyze the next major growth phase for Curve, solidifying its position as a foundational and innovative pillar of the DeFi ecosystem.

For years, the two economies moved like a synced machine. Germany built the tools, China bought the tools, and the world kept spinning. Now China builds its own machines, sells them everywhere, and Germany is stuck with falling sales and rising pressure. The country’s exports to China have dropped by a quarter since 2019, while imports from China keep jumping, pushing the trade deficit toward €88 billion this year. Businesses see the hit. Politicians see the hit. No one is acting calm. The break in this long partnership is real. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Berlin would shield steelmakers from Chinese rivals. He also backed a tighter ban on Chinese parts in mobile-data networks and supported “buy-European” rules in state contracts. His new National Security Council met in November and talked about the risks tied to China’s control of key minerals. A German official allegedly said the group is now working on diversification tools. Companies that once treated China as their main customer now treat it like a problem they cannot ignore. Germany shifts trade stance Business groups say China is using low production costs, a weak yuan, and heavy subsidies to push past German firms in sectors Germany used to lead. That jump showed up even harder this year because President Trump built a strong tariff wall, and cheap Chinese goods bounced off the U.S. border and landed in Europe. Chemicals, car parts, and other goods hit the continent at scale. German leaders who once mocked tariffs now use them. President Emmanuel Macron said “Germany is moving and becoming aware of the imbalances that also affect it,” adding that China is “hitting the heart of the European industrial and innovation model.” This shift started years ago. In 2019, the Federation of German Industries dropped its soft stance and labeled China a “systemic competitor.” The VDMA machinery group said China was practicing unfair trade and demanded antidumping steps. “We are free-traders, but unfair trade policies cannot be tolerated any more,” said Oliver Richtberg, the group’s foreign-trade chief. The German government is preparing a new economic-security plan that will address economic and tech risks tied to China, according to an official. Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul, during his first trip to China, said European companies needed better access to the Chinese market and its resources. Germany faces industrial pressure China’s rise as a producer of investment goods is brutal for Germany. Between 2019 and 2024, China pushed ahead of Germany in power-generation equipment and machinery. Germany’s lead in chemicals and road vehicles is razor thin. This year, Germany imported more capital goods from China than it exported to China. Manual gearbox imports from China almost tripled in the second quarter of 2025. German carmakers saw their market share in China drop from half to a third in two years. The damage is wide. Manufacturing output is down 14% from its 2017 peak. Industry has cut almost 5% of its jobs since 2019. Auto companies cut about 13% of positions. Herrenknecht, a tunnel-boring machine maker, said it faces “growing competitive pressure.” Spokeswoman Anja Heckendorf said the company is looking toward India and more complex projects and wants antidumping probes and a “Europe First” push. Pressure is also intense in the chemical belt around Leipzig. Chinese producers expanded their share of the polyamide 6 market from 5% to 20% within a year. Vedran Kujundzic of DOMO Chemicals said Chinese players offer prices about 20% lower. Christof Günther, who runs a major chemical park in Leuna, said companies “can’t earn money” and cut jobs to survive. Dow Chemical will close two plants and cut more than 500 jobs. BASF and others cut thousands of roles across Germany while expanding in China. Leuna is also seeing new bets. Finnish group UPM is putting €1.3 billion into a biorefinery. Harald Dialer said the products cost more than fossil-based chemicals but serve high-end uses. Nearby, Stefan Scherer of AMG Lithium is building a refinery that could supply a quarter of Europe’s lithium needs, but German buyers fear higher prices. Dirk Schumacher of KfW said Germany must decide what it will still source from China and where it needs barriers to protect vital sectors. Noah Barkin, an analyst at Rhodium, said Europe wants Chinese investment only if it brings know-how and jobs. He warned that Germany could slip back into what he called its “Shanghai syndrome” if Berlin feels it needs protection from an unpredictable Trump. Lawmaker Norbert Röttgen said Germany must cut its dependence on China but admitted U.S. moves will shape how far Berlin can go. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

One chart highlights the 2017 period, while the other focuses on the current 2025 structure. Both visuals apply a Gaussian Channel indicator, which is used to assess trend direction and volatility. According to the comparison, XRP previously experienced a sharp downward wick below the channel, described as a liquidation-driven move, before stabilizing and eventually transitioning into a strong upward trend. $XRP HISTORY IS REPEATING. AND JUST LIKE 2017, NOBODY BELIEVES IT UNTIL IT’S TOO LATE! pic.twitter.com/V3ZnDZurFs — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 12, 2025 Liquidation Wicks and Time Compression In the historical chart, the 2017 liquidation wick is emphasized as a short-lived event that lasted several weeks before price reclaimed the channel and began accelerating higher. The current chart is annotated similarly, marking a comparable downside wick in 2025. The duration of both periods is shown as roughly equivalent, with each spanning just over 50 days and approximately the same number of trading bars. StephIsCrypto’s analysis suggests that these downside moves served to flush leveraged positions rather than signal a breakdown in long-term structure. The implication is that XRP’s present consolidation above the channel mirrors the conditions seen before its previous cycle expansion. The analyst’s central point is that disbelief and impatience were also widespread during the earlier phase, even as the technical structure remained intact. Market Sentiment and Investor Frustration The post also drew responses that reflect broader sentiment within the XRP market. One user, identified as Michael H, expressed frustration over the lack of upward price movement despite what he perceives as supportive information and long-term positioning. He noted that XRP’s price remains near levels seen a year ago, emphasizing the emotional strain of holding a large position without immediate confirmation through price appreciation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This reaction aligns with the analyst’s broader observation that market participants often lose confidence during extended periods of consolidation. The comparison to 2017 is used to highlight that similar doubts existed before XRP’s breakout, reinforcing the idea that sentiment and price action can diverge for prolonged periods. A Reiteration of the Historical Thesis StephIsCrypto’s post does not present a specific price target or timeline. Instead, it reiterates a historical thesis that XRP’s current behavior fits within a familiar pattern seen in earlier cycles. By focusing on structural similarities rather than news-driven catalysts, the analysis argues that patience, rather than immediate price movement, is the defining feature of this phase.

Meanwhile, US President Trump has touted the success of his trade tariffs, claiming that the country has taken in $18 trillion in revenue as a result. Several major crypto firms received conditional approval last week to become national trust banks in a step that could make stablecoins more mainstream, but this wasn’t enough to prevent markets from falling again. Economic Events Dec. 15 to 19 Tuesday will see the release of October retail sales data and the November jobs report, both of which will be eyed by policymakers. Strong employment data could validate the Fed’s cautious stance from last week. However, further labor market weakness could raise concerns about economic momentum and complicate its more hawkish 2026 projections. Manufacturing and Services PMI releases are also due, providing forward-looking perspectives on business activity across both goods-producing and services sectors. The big hitters come on Thursday with November’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data, which will show whether prices are moderating yet or remaining stubbornly high. Thursday’s Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index will provide additional economic context about regional industrial conditions and pricing pressures. Friday is also a heavy hitter with the Core PCE Price Index, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure. There are also expected to be existing home sales data, inflation expectations data, and consumer sentiment reports released on Friday. Key Events This Week: 1. October Retail Sales data – Tuesday 2.

Crypto Market Outlook As usual, crypto markets tanked late on Sunday, pulled under by Bitcoin, which fell below $88,000 briefly. BTC had recovered to reclaim $89,000 at the time of writing on Monday morning in Asia, but it was trading at a weekly low. An impending rate cut by the Bank of Japan on Friday has been fingered by some analysts as the catalyst, while others think it has been priced in. Ethereum had held up better than expected, remaining above $3,000, but most of the altcoins were in the red again. Expect more volatility in the week ahead.

This landmark transaction represents more than just another financial instrument—it signals a fundamental shift in how Middle Eastern institutions approach capital markets. The bond’s listing on the London Stock Exchange’s International Securities Market through Euroclear’s DLT infrastructure creates a powerful bridge between conventional and digital finance. What Makes This Digital Bond So Revolutionary? This isn’t merely a digitized version of a traditional bond. The digital bond leverages Euroclear’s purpose-built distributed ledger technology infrastructure, creating an immutable record of ownership and transactions. Unlike conventional bonds that rely on multiple intermediaries and paper-based processes, this blockchain-based security streamlines settlement, reduces counterparty risk, and enhances transparency. The London Stock Exchange listing provides international credibility while the underlying technology offers unprecedented efficiency. For Qatar’s financial sector, this issuance represents a strategic leap forward. Doha Bank, as one of the country’s leading financial institutions, demonstrates how traditional banks can embrace innovation without abandoning their core business models. The $150 million size indicates serious institutional confidence in this new approach to bond issuance and management. How Does DLT Transform Bond Markets? Distributed ledger technology addresses several persistent challenges in traditional bond markets. First, it significantly reduces settlement times—what typically takes days can potentially be completed in minutes or hours. Second, it enhances security through cryptographic verification of each transaction. Third, it creates a single source of truth accessible to all authorized participants, reducing reconciliation errors and disputes. The specific benefits of this digital bond structure include: Real-time settlement : Transactions occur almost instantly on the distributed ledger Enhanced transparency : All parties access the same verified transaction history Reduced costs : Fewer intermediaries mean lower processing and administrative expenses Improved liquidity : Faster settlement enables quicker position adjustments Regulatory compliance : Automated reporting and audit trails simplify compliance Why Should Traditional Investors Care About Digital Bonds? For institutional and retail investors alike, digital bonds represent more than technological novelty—they offer tangible improvements to the investment experience. The enhanced transparency means investors can verify their holdings directly on the blockchain rather than relying solely on custodian statements. The reduced settlement risk provides greater confidence in transaction finality. Moreover, the potential for fractional ownership could eventually make bond markets more accessible to smaller investors. Doha Bank’s choice of the London Stock Exchange for listing demonstrates a strategic approach to international investor appeal. By combining respected traditional market infrastructure with innovative technology, they’ve created a hybrid model that may appeal to both conservative and forward-looking investors. This balanced approach could accelerate adoption across other Middle Eastern and global financial institutions. What Challenges Remain for Widespread Adoption? Despite the clear advantages, several hurdles must be addressed before digital bonds become mainstream. Regulatory frameworks continue to evolve, with different jurisdictions taking varied approaches to blockchain-based securities. Interoperability between different DLT systems remains a technical challenge. Perhaps most importantly, traditional market participants need time to understand and trust the new technology. However, Doha Bank’s successful issuance suggests these challenges are surmountable. Their partnership with Euroclear—a established financial market infrastructure provider—helps bridge the trust gap. The involvement of the London Stock Exchange adds further credibility. As more institutions follow this example, standardization will likely emerge, making subsequent issuances progressively smoother. The Future of Digital Securities in the Middle East Qatar’s move positions the country as a regional leader in financial innovation. Other Gulf Cooperation Council nations will likely monitor this digital bond ‘s performance closely. Success could trigger a wave of similar issuances across the Middle East, potentially transforming the region’s capital markets. The technology could eventually extend beyond bonds to other securities, creating fully digital capital markets. This development arrives at a crucial moment for Middle Eastern economies diversifying away from hydrocarbon dependence. Financial technology innovation supports broader economic transformation goals. By embracing blockchain for traditional instruments like bonds, regional institutions demonstrate both technological sophistication and pragmatic adaptation to global financial trends. Doha Bank’s $150 million digital bond issuance represents a watershed moment for blockchain adoption in traditional finance. It demonstrates that distributed ledger technology has matured beyond cryptocurrency applications to address real-world institutional needs. The successful integration with established market infrastructure like the London Stock Exchange and Euroclear suggests a viable path forward for hybrid financial systems. As other institutions observe this model’s success, we can expect accelerated innovation at the intersection of traditional and digital finance, potentially reshaping global capital markets for decades to come. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is a digital bond? A digital bond is a debt security issued and managed using distributed ledger technology (blockchain). Unlike traditional bonds, ownership records and transactions are recorded on a shared, immutable digital ledger rather than through conventional paper-based or electronic systems. How does Doha Bank’s digital bond differ from cryptocurrency? While both use blockchain technology, Doha Bank’s digital bond represents a traditional financial instrument (debt security) issued by a regulated bank and listed on a major stock exchange. Cryptocurrencies are typically decentralized digital assets not backed by traditional institutions or regulatory frameworks. What are the main advantages of digital bonds over traditional bonds? Key advantages include faster settlement times, reduced operational costs through fewer intermediaries, enhanced transparency via shared ledger access, improved security through cryptographic verification, and potentially greater accessibility through fractional ownership possibilities. Is the Doha Bank digital bond available to retail investors? While listed on the London Stock Exchange’s International Securities Market, accessibility depends on individual brokerage capabilities and regulatory considerations. The bond was primarily designed for institutional investors, but the technology could eventually enable broader retail participation. How does this affect Qatar’s position in global financial markets? This issuance positions Qatar as an innovator in financial technology within the Middle East. It demonstrates the country’s commitment to modernizing its financial sector and could attract further international investment interest in Qatari and regional capital markets. What risks are associated with digital bonds? Potential risks include regulatory uncertainty as frameworks evolve, technological risks related to blockchain security and scalability, market adoption risks if other institutions don’t follow suit, and operational risks during the transition from traditional to hybrid systems.

Price Models Show 750% Upside Potential for This $0.035 Token,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/next-altcoin-to-watch-price-models-show-750-upside-potential-for-this-0-035-token/,"The same trend frequently happens with early-stage DeFi tokens. The first is development then participation and only following them the real usage starts to affect value. The greatest price swings tend to occur between those stages. That is the stage that most market observers are following. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) seems to be on the brink of this transition as it shifts out of preparation and into active use hence the justification of price models being affected by this transition. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a decentralized lending & borrowing protocol. Mechanics are established, audits are being performed and the involvement has been increasing with time. Meanwhile, the protocol is yet to be put into live application. The latter middle stage is significant as it usually leads to more powerful price discovery of DeFi lending tokens. MUTM was priced at $0.01 in its presale introduction but has been gradually improving to current phase 6 with $0.035 per token. With time, the number of users grew to over 18,000, and the scope of participation and financial resources were expanded along with the roadmap development. Mutuum Finance has a well set up supply structure. The quantity supplied is predetermined and a certain portion goes to those who enter early. With advancement in stages, the entry price is affected to rise and supply becomes restricted. This forms a natural supply-based model in which the price levels would increase since the completion of each stage. Phase 6 is currently approaching complete allocation (98% completed), and this implies that there are fewer tokens at present levels. In supply-based models, this contraction is completely sufficient to help the higher price ranges even in advance of using them. In one case, analysts consider the primary driving forces phase completion and supply reduction. V1 Explansion Mutuum Finance has affirmed, in its official X statement , that V1 will go live on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. This is where borrowing and lending businesses begin to produce actual data. At V1 active, models of valuation start considering usage. The open positions created by the borrowers become profitable to the suppliers, and the mtTokens begin to show real paying interest instead of hypothetical demand. This modifies the pricing of the token. Rather than being appreciated on the basis of allocation development, it associates with the participation indicators. In the latter case, analysts associate price action with the increase in the amount of traffic borrowing and retention of suppliers. Demand of the mtTokens increases with the increase in the activity and this is capable of maintaining a higher valuation level. This is done under the assumption that it is going to be adopted gradually, not in spikes. Revenue Flow and Buy-and-Distribute Another layer offered by Mutuum Finance, which influences long-term prices, is brought about. Part of the protocol fees are used to purchase MUTM in the open market. MUTM that is bought in the market is redistributed to the users that stake mgTokens within the safety module. This creates a feedback loop. As usage grows, revenue grows. As the revenue expands the market buying rises. The more they buy, the greater are the incentives to retain. This may eventually decrease the sell pressure and help it move upwards more consistently. In price models analysts are interested in future revenue as opposed to first allocation or first use. In this model, the value of MUTM increases with protocol participation and forms compounding effects, rather than fluctuating over a short period. This is whereupon an increase in long-run upside estimates commences. Why This Could Be a DeFi Lending Breakout Older DeFi lending systems that had worked had some common characteristics. Before launching they took time to build. They were launched with definite mechanics. They associated token value with action and not attention. And they passed the build phase to activity with already tightening supply. Mutuum Finance is suitable to this pattern. We are in the early stages, supply is moving in a form of established phases and use has a definite starting point with V1. mtTokens giving value to interest flow and buy and distribute system gives the activity to demand. Confidence during this transition is assisted by security work, such as a CertiK audit with a 90100 Token Scan score, a Halborn Security review , and a $50K code bug bounty. Due to this correspondence there are price models which are carried to a longer horizon. In the case of a bullish adoption, the forecasts indicate that the possibility of increasing up to 750% MUTM appreciation from the initial adoption stages exists. A Prospective Range The project is on the verge of becoming activity based having already constrained the supply and mechanisms to obtain value by developing utilization. And that is what makes it keep being discussed as the next crypto to watch not due to the hype but due to its position in the lifecycle. The closer the protocol is to V1 and the more the protocol is used to form valuation, the more price models are naturally enlarged. Observers that follow predictions related to crypto adoption, as opposed to speculation, could find an interesting opportunity case study within Mutuum Finance .

The platform announced it will list the Humidify token (WET), creating new trading avenues against Bitcoin (BTC), Tether (USDT), and the Korean Won (KRW). This strategic Upbit lists WET decision, effective December 15th, signals growing institutional interest in niche utility tokens and provides a major liquidity boost for the Humidify ecosystem. For investors and traders, this represents a pivotal moment of access and validation. What Does It Mean When Upbit Lists WET? The announcement that Upbit lists WET is more than a simple calendar event. It’s a significant endorsement from one of Asia’s most regulated and influential exchanges. Listing on a platform of Upbit’s caliber typically leads to increased visibility, higher trading volume, and enhanced credibility for the token. Therefore, this move can potentially stabilize the token’s price discovery process and attract a new wave of investors who rely on Upbit’s rigorous due diligence. For the Humidify project, this is a monumental step. The token, which is integral to its namesake decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) for environmental control, now gains direct exposure to millions of Upbit users. This access is crucial for fostering real-world adoption of its technology, which aims to optimize humidity for agriculture and data centers. Key Details for Traders and Investors Mark your calendars for 9:30 a.m. UTC on December 15th. That’s when trading for WET will officially commence. Upbit is facilitating this with three distinct trading pairs, catering to different investor strategies: WET/BTC: For those who prefer to trade against the original cryptocurrency. WET/USDT: Offers a stablecoin pair, minimizing volatility from the quote currency. WET/KRW: Direct access for the massive South Korean retail market, a key advantage of this listing. This multi-pair approach ensures liquidity from various market segments. However, prospective traders should always remember that new listings can be volatile. It’s wise to monitor the order book depth in the initial hours after trading begins. Why This Upbit Listing is a Big Deal The decision for Upbit lists WET aligns with a broader trend of exchanges supporting tokens with tangible, real-world utility. Humidify’s focus on physical infrastructure (DePIN) represents a growing sector within crypto that moves beyond pure financial speculation. For Upbit, listing such projects enhances its portfolio with innovative assets that have long-term potential. Moreover, this provides a blueprint for other utility tokens seeking mainstream exchange listings.

Check Wallet Compatibility: Ensure you have a supported wallet if you plan to deposit WET to Upbit. Review Exchange Rules: Familiarize yourself with Upbit’s trading fees, withdrawal limits, and security protocols. Set a Strategy: Decide in advance if you are looking to trade short-term volatility or invest for the long-term utility of the token. Remember, while the news that Upbit lists WET is positive, it does not guarantee price appreciation. Market sentiment, broader crypto trends, and project developments will all play a role post-listing. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Humidify The upcoming listing of WET on Upbit is a transformative event. It validates the Humidify project’s vision and provides a robust, regulated platform for its token to thrive.

Starting today at 8:00 a.m. UTC, the platform is listing RAVE perpetual futures for the RAVE/USDT trading pair. This launch isn’t just another listing—it comes with support for up to 20x leverage, opening new doors for market participants. If you’re tracking the evolution of crypto derivatives, this development demands your attention. What Are RAVE Perpetual Futures and Why Do They Matter? Let’s break this down simply. A perpetual futures contract, often called a “perpetual” or “perp,” is a derivative product that lets you speculate on an asset’s future price without an expiry date. Unlike traditional futures, you can hold these positions indefinitely, as long as you manage the funding rate mechanism. The listing of RAVE perpetual futures on a major exchange like OKX signals growing institutional and retail interest in the RAVE token. It provides a more sophisticated tool for hedging, speculation, and accessing leverage within the RAVE ecosystem. How Can You Trade RAVE Perpetual Futures on OKX? The process is straightforward for existing OKX users. The new RAVE/USDT perpetual futures market is now live in the exchange’s derivatives section. Here are the key details you need to start trading: Trading Pair: RAVE/USDT Product Type: Perpetual Futures (No expiry date) Maximum Leverage: Up to 20x Settlement: In USDT (Tether) Launch Time: 8:00 a.m. UTC on the announcement date Remember, while 20x leverage can amplify gains, it also magnifies losses. Therefore, always employ robust risk management strategies, including stop-loss orders and careful position sizing. What Are the Key Benefits and Inherent Risks? This new listing creates several opportunities. First, it increases liquidity and price discovery for the RAVE token. Second, it allows traders to express bullish or bearish views with significant capital efficiency due to leverage. Third, it integrates RAVE deeper into the mainstream crypto financial system. However, trading RAVE perpetual futures carries substantial risk. The high leverage can lead to rapid liquidation if the market moves against your position. Furthermore, you must understand the funding rate, which is a periodic payment between long and short positions to keep the contract price aligned with the spot price. How Does This Fit Into the Broader Crypto Landscape? OKX’s decision reflects a clear trend: leading exchanges are continuously expanding their derivatives offerings to meet trader demand. Listing new assets like RAVE for perpetual futures trading helps diversify the market beyond giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum. It provides altcoin communities with professional-grade trading tools. This move can also attract more volume to the OKX platform, as traders seek venues that offer a wide array of leveraged products. For the RAVE project itself, this listing is a vote of confidence and a step toward greater visibility. Actionable Insights for Traders Considering RAVE Futures Before you dive into trading these new RAVE perpetual futures , consider these steps. First, familiarize yourself with OKX’s futures interface in a demo or with a very small position. Second, analyze the RAVE token’s recent volatility and trading patterns on the spot market to gauge potential futures movement. Third, monitor the initial funding rate closely, as it can be volatile in a new market. Finally, have a clear trading plan that defines your entry, exit, and risk tolerance before you open any leveraged position. In summary, the launch of RAVE perpetual futures on OKX is a significant development for derivatives traders and the RAVE community. It offers powerful new tools for market engagement but requires respect for the risks involved, especially with 20x leverage. As the crypto derivatives market matures, such listings will likely become more common, blending opportunity with the need for educated and cautious participation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are perpetual futures contracts? Perpetual futures are derivative contracts that allow you to speculate on an asset’s price without a set expiration date. They use a funding rate mechanism to tether their price to the underlying spot market. What time did OKX list RAVE perpetual futures? OKX listed the RAVE/USDT perpetual futures contract at 8:00 a.m. UTC on the announcement date. What is the maximum leverage for RAVE futures on OKX? OKX is offering up to 20x leverage for the new RAVE/USDT perpetual futures trading pair. Is trading perpetual futures riskier than spot trading? Yes, significantly. Perpetual futures involve leverage, which can amplify both profits and losses, and include the complexity of funding rates. They are generally suited for experienced traders. How is the RAVE perpetual futures contract settled? The contract is settled in USDT (Tether). This means all profits and losses are calculated and paid out in USDT. Can I hold a RAVE perpetual futures position forever? Technically, yes, as there is no expiry. However, you must continuously pay or receive funding payments, and your position remains subject to liquidation if your margin balance falls below maintenance requirements.

UXLINK, a pioneering social platform, has officially launched its ambitious UXLINK Season 6 campaign. This isn’t just another airdrop event; it’s a foundational push to build the infrastructure for the next billion users. The season introduces three core features designed to tear down the technical barriers that have long kept everyday people out of the decentralized web. What Makes UXLINK Season 6 a Game-Changer? For years, using Web3 felt like navigating a maze. You needed different wallets for different chains, managed complex private keys, and struggled to use crypto for anything beyond trading. UXLINK Season 6 tackles these pain points head-on with a trio of user-centric missions. The goal is clear: transition Web3 from a niche interest to a practical tool for daily life. This season moves beyond simple reward farming, inviting participants to validate and shape the very infrastructure of our digital future. Breaking Down the Three Pillars of UXLINK Season 6 Let’s explore the key features that form the backbone of this campaign. Each one addresses a specific hurdle to mass adoption. 1. The OAOG Protocol: One Account to Rule Them All Remember the frustration of switching wallets or networks? The One Account One Gas (OAOG) protocol ends that. Imagine accessing any decentralized application (dApp) across various blockchains with a single, unified account. This protocol eliminates the need for: Multiple wallet extensions or apps. Manually switching networks for different tasks. Managing separate gas fees across ecosystems. It’s a seamless gateway, making the user experience as simple as logging into a social media account. 2. UXLINK Staking: Own a Piece of the Platform How can users move from being passive participants to active stakeholders? UXLINK Season 6 introduces a native staking mechanism. This isn’t just about earning yields; it’s about alignment and security. By staking tokens, users can: Share in long-term value : Benefit directly from the platform’s growth. Enhance network security : Contribute to a more robust and trustworthy ecosystem. Participate in governance : Gain a voice in future decisions and development. This feature builds a stronger, more committed community around the UXLINK vision. 3. The FujiCard: Spend Crypto Like Cash The biggest question for many is: “What can I actually buy with my crypto?” The FujiCard provides a powerful answer. This feature allows users to make direct payments with cryptocurrency for everyday expenses. Whether it’s coffee, groceries, or online subscriptions, the FujiCard bridges the gap between digital assets and the real-world economy. It transforms cryptocurrency from a speculative asset into a functional currency. Why Should You Care About UXLINK’s Mission? This campaign represents a pivotal shift in the Web3 narrative. The focus of UXLINK Season 6 is on utility and accessibility, not speculation. By simplifying onboarding, rewarding long-term participation, and enabling real-world spending, UXLINK is constructing the rails for genuine, large-scale adoption. Participants in this season are more than users; they are early testers and co-creators of a more integrated digital future. Conclusion: Building the On-Ramp for the Next Generation UXLINK Season 6 is a bold step toward a future where Web3 is intuitive, useful, and woven into the fabric of daily life. With the OAOG protocol for access, staking for ownership, and the FujiCard for utility, the platform is addressing the core challenges of complexity and irrelevance. The success of this season could very well define the blueprint for how the next wave of users enters the decentralized world. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the main goal of UXLINK Season 6? The primary goal is to expand real-world Web3 adoption by building essential infrastructure. It focuses on improving user experience, security, and practical utility rather than just distributing rewards. Do I need multiple wallets to use the OAOG protocol? No, that’s the core innovation. The OAOG (One Account One Gas) protocol is designed to let you interact with various Web3 environments using a single account, eliminating the need for multiple wallets or constant network switching. How does UXLINK staking benefit me beyond earning rewards? Staking allows you to share in the platform’s long-term value growth, contribute to its network security, and participate in governance decisions, giving you a true stake in the ecosystem’s future. What can I buy with the FujiCard? The FujiCard is designed for daily expenses, allowing direct cryptocurrency payments for goods and services, effectively bridging the gap between crypto holdings and the real-world economy. Is UXLINK Season 6 just for experienced crypto users? Absolutely not. A key objective is to onboard the next generation of users. Features like OAOG and the FujiCard are specifically built to simplify the experience for newcomers. Where was UXLINK Season 6 announced? The campaign was officially announced by UXLINK on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter). Found this breakdown of UXLINK’s ambitious new season helpful?

Key Takeaways: Binance denies claims that it delayed or partially complied with requests to freeze Upbit hack funds. The exchange says it acted immediately and continues to work with law enforcement on the case. South Korean authorities allege only a fraction of the stolen assets were frozen as hackers rapidly laundered the funds. In a statement shared with Cryptonews, a Binance spokesperson said suggestions of a delayed or limited response were inaccurate. “Binance’s security and investigations teams identified the incident and immediately took action to assist in freezing related transfers and mitigating further movements,” the spokesperson said. Binance Says It Acted Promptly and Worked With Law Enforcement The exchange added that it has been working closely with law enforcement and other relevant parties since the incident. “We continue to monitor the situation closely and provide support as needed,” the spokesperson said, stressing that any claims suggesting Binance did not take prompt or effective action are “unsubstantiated and inaccurate.” The response follows a report published last week citing South Korean investigators, who claimed Binance froze only a small portion of the funds stolen during the Upbit breach. According to local media, authorities said roughly 17% of the assets flagged for freezing were ultimately locked down. Investigators allege that the hackers behind the attack moved quickly, dispersing stolen funds across more than a thousand wallets within hours of the breach on Nov. 27. Korean authorities say @Binance froze only a small portion of the crypto stolen during last month’s @Official_Upbit hack. #SouthKorea #Binance https://t.co/o5VVQN9tYp — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 12, 2025 Security analysts said the group used a combination of chain hopping, token swaps, and bridges to obscure transaction trails, a tactic that complicated recovery efforts. Authorities said that a significant share of the laundered assets eventually reached service wallets on Binance. Upbit and police reportedly requested an immediate freeze on around 470 million won (approximately $370,000) worth of Solana tokens believed to have entered the exchange. Of that amount, about 80 million won (roughly $75,000) was frozen, with Binance citing the need for additional verification before taking broader action, per previous claims by Korean authorities. Upbit Moves 99% of Customer Assets to Cold Storage After $30M Hack As reported, Upbit is shifting nearly all customer assets into cold storage after hackers stole 44.5 billion won (about $30 million) from its Solana hot wallet, marking one of the strongest security responses yet by a major exchange. Operator Dunamu said the platform will raise its cold wallet ratio to 99% and reduce hot wallet exposure to effectively zero, far above South Korea’s legal requirement that 80% of user funds be stored offline. The exchange already held 98.33% of assets in cold storage at the end of October, the highest among domestic platforms, but accelerated its overhaul following the breach. Meanwhile, South Korean authorities have launched an investigation, and local reports have cited early intelligence assessments that allegedly connect the intrusion to North Korea’s Lazarus Group.

Now, though, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez argued that XRP has finally flashed a bullish sign. According to his analysis, the TD Sequential has shown a buy signal, but only if XRP remains above $1.90, a level previously identified as significant in determining the asset’s future behavior. TD buy signal on $XRP , but everything hinges on $1.90. Hold it, and $2.50 comes into play. pic.twitter.com/JItYen3xz4 — Ali (@alicharts) December 14, 2025 If it does hold above that pivotal line, XRP has the chance to rocket to $2.50. If the asset indeed heads to those levels, it would need to overcome three significant sell walls, according to CW, which are located at $2.10, $2.15, and $2.25. Recall that this $2.50 price tag was last observed just over a month ago, in the days ahead of the launch of the first XRP ETF – Canary Capital’s XRPC. Since then, the token has been in a free-fall state to the current $2.00 despite the nearly $1 billion in net inflows into the five ETFs and Ripple’s partnerships and regulatory approvals. Martinez has been quite active on the XRP scene lately. Before posting about the TD Sequential – a metric used to determine an asset’s exhaustion in either direction, he warned that Ripple’s cross-border token could plunge to $1.20 if the $2.00 support is decisively lost. On a more micro scale, CryptoWZRD noted that XRP had closed “slightly bearish” even though it managed to recover most of the weekly losses. However, the analyst added that the asset needs to overcome the $2.10 resistance to turn bullish, otherwise it risks another price drop. The post XRP Buy Signal Confirmed?

Starting at 8:00 a.m. UTC on December 16, users can trade DOGE, SUI, and XRP directly against the USDⓈ stablecoin. This expansion of Binance spot trading pairs provides more direct fiat-like gateways for these popular assets, potentially enhancing liquidity and trading convenience on the world’s largest exchange. What Are the New Binance Spot Trading Pairs? Binance will list DOGE/USDⓈ, SUI/USDⓈ, and XRP/USDⓈ for spot trading. The USDⓈ symbol represents Binance’s USD-denominated stablecoin, which aggregates balances from USDT, USDC, and other USD-backed stablecoins. This means traders can use a consolidated dollar balance to trade against these cryptocurrencies without first converting between different stablecoins. The listing of these specific Binance spot trading pairs signals continued institutional confidence in these assets’ market depth and trader demand. Why Does This Listing Matter for Crypto Traders? New trading pairs might seem routine, but they carry substantial implications. Firstly, they offer simplified trading. Previously, traders might have needed to route through BTC or ETH pairs. Now, they have a direct, stablecoin-denominated path. Secondly, it often leads to improved liquidity and tighter spreads for these assets. Finally, such listings from a top-tier exchange like Binance serve as a validation of the asset’s utility and ecosystem strength. Therefore, the introduction of these Binance spot trading pairs is a development worth your attention. How to Trade the New Pairs on Binance Ready to engage with these new markets? The process is straightforward. After the launch time on December 16, you can find the pairs on the Binance Spot trading interface. Ensure you have sufficient USDⓈ balance in your funding wallet. You can deposit stablecoins like USDT or USDC, which will automatically contribute to your USDⓈ balance. Then, navigate to the trading pair (e.g., DOGE/USDⓈ) and place your order. Remember to always employ sound risk management, even with new and exciting listings. Direct Access: Trade DOGE, SUI, and XRP directly with a dollar value. Potential for Efficiency: May reduce slippage compared to less liquid trading pairs. Market Confidence: A Binance listing is a positive signal for an asset’s legitimacy. What Could This Mean for DOGE, SUI, and XRP Prices? While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, new exchange listings can catalyze short-term price movements. The announcement alone can generate buying interest. Upon going live, the influx of new trading volume can increase volatility. However, the long-term price is dictated by broader market sentiment, adoption, and project fundamentals. The new Binance spot trading pairs primarily enhance accessibility, which is a foundational element for sustainable growth. Conclusion: A Step Toward Mainstream Trading Accessibility Binance’s decision to list DOGE/USDⓈ, SUI/USDⓈ, and XRP/USDⓈ is a pragmatic enhancement to its spot market. It streamlines the trading process for millions of users and reinforces the standing of these cryptocurrencies. For the ecosystem, it’s a move that normalizes direct stablecoin trading for major altcoins. As the December 16 launch approaches, traders should review their strategies to potentially leverage these new, efficient Binance spot trading pairs . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What time exactly do the new Binance spot trading pairs go live? A1: The pairs—DOGE/USDⓈ, SUI/USDⓈ, and XRP/USDⓈ—will be available for spot trading starting at 8:00 a.m. UTC on December 16. Q2: What is USDⓈ on Binance? A2: USDⓈ is a unified balance that combines your holdings of USD-pegged stablecoins like USDT, USDC, BUSD, and others on Binance. It simplifies trading against a single dollar-denominated value. Q3: Are there any trading fees for these new pairs? A3: Standard Binance spot trading fees will apply. Users holding BNB in their wallet can use it to pay for fees and receive a discount. Q4: Will there be any trading promotions for these new listings? A4: Binance often runs launch promotions for new listings. Check the Binance Announcements page or the “Activities” section on the platform for any official campaigns. Q5: Is this listing available to users in the United States? A5: No. Users from the United States must use the separate Binance.US platform, which has a different list of supported assets and trading pairs. Q6: How does this affect existing DOGE/BTC or XRP/ETH pairs? A6: Existing trading pairs will remain active. The new USDⓈ pairs provide an additional, often more straightforward, trading option but do not replace other markets. Share This Insight Found this breakdown of the new Binance listings helpful?

In a startling 24-hour period, the Bitcoin hashrate —a critical measure of the network’s computational power and security—plummeted by approximately 8%. This significant drop, equivalent to 100 exahashes per second (EH/s), has sent ripples through the crypto community, raising immediate questions about network stability and the causes behind this sudden shift. What Caused the Sudden Bitcoin Hashrate Drop? According to a report by Wu Blockchain citing an official from Nasdaq-listed Nano Labs, the primary culprit is a large-scale shutdown of mining operations in China’s Xinjiang region. This event led to an estimated 400,000 mining rigs going offline virtually overnight. The specific reason for these abrupt closures remains unclear, adding a layer of mystery to the situation. However, such concentrated disruptions in major mining hubs have a direct and powerful impact on the global Bitcoin hashrate . Why Does the Bitcoin Hashrate Matter So Much? Think of the Bitcoin hashrate as the network’s immune system. A higher hashrate means more miners are competing to validate transactions and secure the blockchain. This makes the network exponentially more resistant to attacks. Therefore, a sharp, unexpected drop can trigger concerns. Here’s what a declining hashrate can influence: Network Security: A lower hashrate theoretically makes a 51% attack—where a single entity gains control of the majority of mining power—more feasible, though still highly improbable for Bitcoin. Mining Difficulty Adjustment: Bitcoin’s protocol automatically adjusts mining difficulty roughly every two weeks. A lower hashrate will lead to a downward adjustment, making it easier and more profitable for remaining miners to find blocks. Market Sentiment: Large hashrate movements are often viewed as a barometer of miner health and confidence, potentially influencing broader market sentiment. Is This a Temporary Blip or a Lasting Trend? History provides some context. The Bitcoin network has weathered similar storms, most notably during China’s sweeping mining ban in 2021. That event caused a far more dramatic hashrate crash, but the network proved resilient. Mining operations relocated, and the hashrate not only recovered but climbed to new all-time highs. The current situation in Xinjiang, while significant, appears more isolated. The key question is whether this is a one-off regulatory action or the start of a new crackdown. The network’s built-in difficulty adjustment is its secret weapon for stability, designed to rebalance after such shocks. What Are the Actionable Insights for Crypto Observers? For investors and enthusiasts, this event is a potent reminder of Bitcoin’s dynamic nature. Instead of panic, it’s a time for observation. Watch the next difficulty adjustment, monitor for a hashrate recovery, and see if miner selling pressure on exchanges increases as unprofitable rigs shut down. These events underscore the importance of geographic decentralization for network health. Ultimately, this sudden Bitcoin hashrate drop tests the network’s antifragility—its ability to grow stronger from volatility. In conclusion, the 8% drop in Bitcoin hashrate is a significant short-term event highlighting the network’s ongoing geographical evolution. While it poses immediate questions about the cause in Xinjiang, Bitcoin’s long-term security model is built to absorb these shocks. The network’s response through its difficulty adjustment will be the next critical chapter, demonstrating once again why resilience is coded into its core protocol. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Bitcoin hashrate? Bitcoin hashrate is the total combined computational power used by miners to process transactions and secure the Bitcoin network. It is a key indicator of network health and security. Why did the Bitcoin hashrate drop suddenly? The hashrate dropped approximately 8% primarily due to the reported closure of large-scale mining farms in China’s Xinjiang region, which forced an estimated 400,000 mining rigs offline. Does a lower Bitcoin hashrate make the network less secure? In the short term, a sharp drop can increase the theoretical risk of an attack, but Bitcoin’s massive global scale and upcoming difficulty adjustment make a successful attack extremely unlikely. The network is designed to self-correct. How does this affect Bitcoin mining difficulty? Bitcoin’s protocol automatically adjusts mining difficulty based on the total hashrate. This drop will lead to a downward adjustment in about two weeks, making it easier for the remaining miners to find blocks. Will this impact the price of Bitcoin? While not directly causal, large hashrate movements can influence market sentiment. If miners are forced to sell Bitcoin holdings to cover costs, it could create temporary selling pressure. Has this happened before? Yes. Most notably, China’s 2021 mining ban caused a hashrate drop of over 50%. The network recovered and the hashrate later reached new record highs, demonstrating resilience. Found this analysis of the Bitcoin hashrate drop helpful?

55811672,644981,1765785655,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55811672.jpeg,Ex-Terra Insider Calls Do Kwon Case ‘Backwards’ In Explosive X Thread,https://bitcoinist.com/ex-terra-insider-do-kwon-case-backwards/,"Former Terraform Labs developer Will Chen argued in a Dec. 13 X thread that the fraud case against Do Kwon was built on a “backwards” theory, days after a court sentenced Kwon to 15 years in prison on Friday, Dec. 15. Chen framed his post as a critique of the legal mechanics, not a character defense. “I wanted Do to fail. I wanted him punished. I thought he was arrogant and reckless and I told him so to his face multiple times,” he wrote. “I’m not here to defend Do Kwon the person. But the legal case is broken.” Do Kwon Conviction Misframed Terra’s Collapse He described Judge Engelmayer as “sympathetic” and “extremely methodical,” but argued the guilty plea boxed Kwon into the government’s framing: “Do taking the guilty plea means admitting to the government’s charges as is. There’s no debating afterward.” Chen said he found it “incredibly ironic” that Do Kwon didn’t contest the case. At the center of Chen’s critique is prosecutors’ theory around Terra’s May 2021 depeg. As Chen summarized it, the government argued that Kwon claimed the algorithm “self-healed” while failing to disclose that Jump Trading stepped in to buy UST and help restore the peg, making his public statements deceptive and therefore fraudulent. Chen’s rebuttal is that this logic runs in the wrong direction. “Fraud is when you claim your system has safety mechanisms it doesn’t have, and people invest trusting that fake safety, and then they lose money when the danger you hid materializes,” he wrote, contrasting it with the allegation here: “But what the government is alleging is the inverse. Do said ‘no reserves, the algorithm alone handles it’ when he actually did have Jump as a backstop.” In Chen’s view, that means Do Kwon was “claiming less safety than he actually had,” adding: “If he’d disclosed Jump, investors would have been more confident, not less.” He distilled his conclusion bluntly: “You don’t defraud someone by hiding additional safety mechanisms. The direction is backwards.” Chen also disputed how prosecutors interpreted a reported private remark attributed to Do Kwon — that Terra “might’ve been fucked without Jump” — as proof Kwon knew the mechanism was broken. “Might’ve been fucked is uncertainty about an unknowable counterfactual,” Chen wrote. “Knew it would have failed is a claim of definite knowledge.” He argued the only way to truly know the algorithm would not have recovered is to not intervene and watch it die, which he suggests is inconsistent with operating a live financial system. “The algorithm was working during that period,” Chen wrote. “Arbitrage was happening. UST was being burned for LUNA. Jump was also buying. Both things were true.” Even the non-disclosure itself, Chen argued, could be framed as strategic rather than deceptive. “Algorithmic stablecoins operate in adversarial conditions,” he wrote, suggesting that publicizing the size and nature of defenses can make an attack easier to price. “If attackers know your exact defense capabilities, they can calculate whether an attack is profitable,” Chen said, arguing that “uncertainty about defense resources is itself a defense.” He compared the idea to “strategic ambiguity” used by central banks and warned that public transparency around reserves can become a tactical disadvantage: “Would disclosing Jump have made Terra more or less secure? Attackers could have calculated exactly how much force was needed to overwhelm the defense.” Chen then challenged whether the case established investor reliance and causation in a market saturated with information. “Do’s statements were one signal in an incredibly noisy channel,” he wrote, pointing to years of public debate around Terra’s risks, open-source code, and prominent critics. “The risk was described in the original white paper. The code was open source. The potential failure mode was publicly debated for years,” Chen wrote, arguing prosecutors “never established direct causation between Do’s specific statements and investor decisions.” He also drew a sharp line between the May 2021 episode and the May 2022 collapse, arguing the information environment changed materially in between. “By May 2022, investors knew about backstops,” he wrote, pointing to Luna Foundation Guard’s public launch in January 2022 and the visibility of reserves on-chain. In Chen’s view, that breaks the causal chain: “The May 2021 non-disclosure about Jump is causally disconnected from May 2022 losses because the information environment had completely changed by then.” One of Chen’s most forceful objections was the scope of losses attributed to Do Kwon. “One thing I can’t get over is the fact that Do signed off on pleading guilty to causing $40 billion in loss,” he wrote. “Market cap decline is not fraud loss.” He offered a simple example to illustrate what he sees as a category error: “If I buy LUNA at $1 and it goes to $100 and then back to zero, my loss is $1. The $99 was paper gains I never realized.” Treating peak-to-trough market cap evaporation as damages, he argued, “sets a terrible legal precedent for the industry.” While disputing the overarching fraud theory, Chen did not claim Terraform Labs’ messaging was clean across the board. He said “the Chai stuff has more merit as an actual fraud claim,” while arguing the government’s portrayal was still overstated. “That’s not entirely accurate,” he wrote of claims Chai didn’t use Terra, adding that Chai “did use Terra for accounting,” that “Terra wallet was integrated into the app,” and “you could top up Chai with KRT,” while conceding Do Kwon “probably stretched the truth early on” about on-chain payment settlement. Anchor, Chen wrote, was “harder to defend.” Promoting the roughly 20% yield as sustainable while reserves depleted was “reckless,” and he said Do Kwon knew “the 20% couldn’t last forever without a plan.” Still, Chen argued that even if yield marketing was misleading, the catastrophic losses were driven by the depeg: “If UST had held, people would’ve just earned less interest. They wouldn’t have lost their principal.” The ex-Terra developer also contrasts Do Kwon to Sam Bankman-Fried : “SBF literally stole customer deposits and used them for other purposes. That’s why SBF victims are being repaid. The money was taken and still exists somewhere. Terra victims can’t be repaid because the value was destroyed in a crash, not stolen and moved to a different account. Treating these situations as equivalent is wrong.” Chen closed with a broader warning about precedent and builder behavior. “If founder confidence plus project failure equals fraud, we’ve criminalized entrepreneurship,” he wrote, arguing it exposes founders who publicly express optimism about products that later fail. His final framing returned to process: whatever one thinks of Do Kwon personally, Chen argues the plea locked in prosecutors’ narrative without the kind of contested defense that might have narrowed both the theory and the scope of damages.

On December 11, HTX unveiled a comprehensive optimization of its copy-trading experience, highlighted by the introduction of the brand-new “Smart Copy” mode. This launch marks a major advance for HTX in social and automated trading, delivering a system that is smarter, more efficient, and highly transparent for global users. To celebrate the milestone and thank users for their long-term support, HTX is launching a month-long trading campaign featuring an 80,000 USDT prize pool. Core Upgrades: Smart Copy and Fund Segregation, Redefining What It Means to Trade Effortlessly In the highly volatile crypto market, smart choices often outperform sheer effort. HTX Futures Copy Trading 4.0 directly addresses two critical user concerns: Who is the best person to follow? And how can I follow them accurately? The new system answers both with enhanced technology and superior user protection. Ultimate Lead Trader Experience: Smooth Operation, Precise Execution. The enhanced trading engine provides a smoother and more precise execution environment. Followers simply input their total investment amount, and the system handles all complexities automatically. Whether mirroring multi-batch entries under sophisticated strategies or executing rapid adjustments during sudden market swings, Copy Trading 4.0 performs instantly, without operational friction. This ensures followers can mirror every trade with high fidelity, guaranteeing a truly seamless experience. Smart Copy Mode: Synchronized Profits, Verifiable and Replicable Returns. The newly launched Smart Copy mode elevates the entire system. Traditional copy trading often suffers from slippage and mismatched position sizes, which distort results. Smart Copy eliminates this by tracking the lead trader’s real capital usage and automatically allocating proportionate follow-up amounts. This ensures that followers’ exposure and conviction levels align precisely with the strategies of the trader they choose. A synchronized profit-tracking mechanism guarantees that followers replicate the trader’s actual Profit and Loss (PnL) changes , preventing deviations caused by over- or under-allocating capital. Users can now copy trading strategies, risk structures, and performance with significantly greater accuracy. Innovative Fund Isolation System: Secure Capital, Flexible Control. Another major breakthrough is HTX’s new fund-segregation framework . Historically, copy trading platforms carried the risk of a follower’s capital being unintentionally cross-used across multiple traders. HTX resolves this issue permanently. Each copy trading follower now benefits from a dedicated, isolated capital pool , achieving complete fund and risk segregation. This isolation allows followers to flexibly adjust the investment allocated to each trader, offering strengthened risk control and optimizing overall capital efficiency. This redesign provides a critical layer of protection for all followers. Celebration Carnival: Multiple Rewards to Boost Copy Trading From December 11, 2025 at 10:00 to January 10, 2026 at 10:00 (UTC), HTX is rolling out a special campaign to celebrate the launch of Copy Trading 4.0. Find the official event details here: https://www.htx.com/support/105019503016393 During the event, registered participants can enjoy the following three reward opportunities: Welcome Trial Bonus: Users who add “Copy Trading” to the HTX app homepage will receive a copy trading trial bonus instantly. Rewards are limited to the first 10,000 participants. First-Trade Loss Subsidy: Registered users whose very first copy trade (with a volume of $\ge$100 USDT) results in a loss will receive a subsidy of up to 50 USDT in copy trading trial bonuses. A prize pool of 20,000 USDT is available on a first-come, first-served basis. Cumulative Margin Reward: Users are eligible to share a 50,000 USDT prize pool based on their cumulative margin used for copy trading during the event. Those whose cumulative margin reaches 5,000 USDT will share a dedicated 20,000 USDT pool. Users must upgrade their HTX app to version 11.9.0 or above to ensure full and smooth functionality. The market never lacks opportunities—it only lacks the right tools to seize them. HTX Futures Copy Trading 4.0 is built precisely as that tool. By lowering the barriers between professional traders and everyday users, the system turns sophisticated trading logic into a simple one-tap experience. Every user, regardless of background, gains easy access to professional-level strategies. This upgrade puts true control back into users’ hands for a steadier, more empowered long-term growth.

South Korea’s ruling Democratic Party has set a decisive deadline, targeting March 2025 for the final passage of a groundbreaking bill that would authorize a won-pegged stablecoin . This move signals a pivotal step toward formalizing digital assets within one of the world’s most tech-savvy economies. But what does this timeline mean, and what hurdles must be cleared first? What Is the South Korean Won-Pegged Stablecoin Plan? According to a report from Financial News, the party’s strategy is clear and ambitious. They aim to introduce the legislation in January 2025. This allows for several months of committee deliberation and review before a crucial plenary session vote in March. The timing is strategic, aiming to secure passage ahead of the local election season, which often shifts political focus. For the remainder of this year, the party’s primary focus will be on a critical task: resolving differences with the country’s financial authorities. This collaborative, yet potentially challenging, phase is essential for creating a robust and effective legal framework. Why Is a Won-Pegged Stablecoin a Game-Changer? A government-backed won-pegged stablecoin could transform South Korea’s digital economy. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, a stablecoin is designed to maintain a steady value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar or, in this case, the Korean won. The potential benefits are significant: Efficiency in Payments: Faster and cheaper domestic and cross-border transactions. Boost for DeFi: Providing a trusted, native asset for South Korea’s growing decentralized finance ecosystem. Regulatory Clarity: Bringing stability and consumer protection to a currently uncertain market segment. Economic Sovereignty: Reducing reliance on foreign-issued stablecoins like USDT or USDC. What Challenges Lie Ahead Before March 2025? The path to March is not without obstacles. The need to “resolve differences with financial authorities” hints at complex debates. Key challenges include: Issuer Structure: Will the Bank of Korea issue it directly, or will licensed private entities be involved? Reserve Management: How will the won reserves backing the stablecoin be held and audited to ensure full transparency and trust? Consumer Protection: What specific rules will govern redemption, fraud prevention, and operational risk? Integration: How will this new digital won interact with existing banking and payment systems? Successfully navigating these issues with regulators will be the true test of the proposed timeline. How Does This Fit Into Global Crypto Trends? South Korea is not acting in a vacuum. Major economies are actively exploring Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and stablecoin frameworks. However, a dedicated won-pegged stablecoin bill positions South Korea as a proactive leader in creating tailored legislation for the crypto asset class, rather than taking a wait-and-see approach. This action could pressure other nations in the region to accelerate their own regulatory plans. It demonstrates a pragmatic attempt to harness blockchain innovation while aiming to mitigate its risks—a balancing act every major economy now faces. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for South Korean Crypto The March 2025 target for the won-pegged stablecoin bill is a bold declaration of intent from South Korea’s ruling party. It sets a clear political deadline for a complex financial innovation. While challenges in negotiation and design remain, this timeline creates tangible momentum. If successful, it could provide a much-needed model for other nations seeking to integrate digital assets safely into their financial systems, marking a historic step for both South Korea and the global cryptocurrency landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a won-pegged stablecoin? A: A won-pegged stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to have a stable value by being directly backed and redeemable for the South Korean won (KRW). It aims to combine the benefits of digital assets with the price stability of traditional currency. Q2: Who will issue the South Korean won-pegged stablecoin? A: The specific issuer is not yet finalized and is a key point of discussion between the ruling party and financial authorities. It could be the Bank of Korea, licensed commercial banks, or other regulated financial institutions. Q3: Why is the March 2025 deadline significant? A: March 2025 is strategically set before South Korea’s local election season. Passing the bill by then would secure the legislation before political attention shifts to campaigning, providing a clear runway for implementation. Q4: How will this affect existing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in South Korea? A: The bill specifically authorizes a regulated stablecoin. It does not directly legalize or ban other cryptocurrencies. However, it represents a major step in broader crypto asset regulation and could lead to clearer rules for the entire market. Q5: Can foreigners use the won-pegged stablecoin? A: The report does not specify. Use cases will depend on the final legislation, which will likely define eligibility, potentially focusing on residents and domestic businesses initially, with possible expansion later. Q6: What are the main risks of this stablecoin? A> Key risks include the technical security of the platform, the transparency and solvency of the entity holding the won reserves, and potential impacts on the traditional banking system if adoption is very high.

Cybersecurity firm Security Alliance (SEAL) warned that it has been tracking “multiple daily” such attempts. SEAL is tracking multiple DAILY attempts by North Korean actors utilizing “Fake Zoom” tactics for spreading malware as well as escalating their access to new victims. Social engineering is at the root of the attack. Read the thread below for pointers on how to stay secure. https://t.co/2SQGdtPKGx — Security Alliance (@_SEAL_Org) December 13, 2025 The warning comes after MetaMask security researcher Taylor Monahan first outlined the sophisticated trap orchestrated by the DPRK threat actors. “They’ve stolen over $300m via this method already,” Monahan wrote on X . “DPRK threat actors are still rekting way too many of you via their fake Zoom / fake Teams meets.” Fake Zoom Modus Operandi – “They’re Taking Over Your Telegrams” According to Monahan, the scam typically begins with a message from a Telegram account, appears to belong to someone the victim knows. “They message everyone with prior conversation history,” he said. The hacker, disguised as the “known person,” then guides the victim to a Zoom link via Calendly. Once the meeting starts, the victim sees a live video feed of their contact and other team members, which is a recorded video in reality, rather than deepfakes. The hacker then complains about the lack of audio clarity, sending a “patch” file via chat and asking the victim to restore the clarity by updating a software development kit, or SDK. The file shared contains the malware payload. The malware, often a Remote Access Trojan (RAT), if installed, will exfiltrate sensitive data, including internal security protocols, passwords, and drain crypto wallets completely. North Korean Hackers’ Strategic Pivot in Social Engineering Campaigns North Korean hackers, including the infamous Lazarus Group, have been previously linked to high-profile crypto thefts aimed at generating millions in revenue. For instance, recently sophisticated North Korean hackers infiltrated crypto companies through elaborate job application schemes and fake interview processes . Last month, the Lazarus Group orchestrated a major cryptocurrency breach that drained roughly $30.6 million from South Korea’s largest exchange, Upbit. In the latest ‘fake Zoom’ call tactic, experts have warned users to immediately disconnect from WiFi and power off the device to halt malware activity.

This capital injection, led by established financial giants, signals strong institutional confidence in the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). For investors and crypto enthusiasts, this move highlights a pivotal shift from speculative digital assets to tangible, income-generating investments on the blockchain. What Does Halogen Capital’s Seed Funding Mean for Crypto? The $3.2 million seed funding for Halogen Capital is more than just a financial headline. It represents a strategic bet on blockchain’s utility beyond cryptocurrency trading. The participation from Kenanga Investment Bank, a major Malaysian investment bank, alongside global venture firms 500 Global and Digital Currency Group (DCG), provides crucial validation. This backing combines traditional finance expertise with deep crypto-native knowledge, creating a powerful foundation for Halogen’s mission. Therefore, this funding round is a key indicator of growing institutional appetite. It shows that serious players are allocating capital to build the infrastructure that bridges physical assets and digital ledgers. How Will the Funds Be Used? Expanding the RWA Frontier Halogen Capital has a clear mandate for its new capital. The primary focus is to accelerate the tokenization of real-world assets . This process involves creating digital tokens on a blockchain that represent ownership or a claim on a physical asset. The firm plans to expand its work in several key areas: Funds: Tokenizing investment fund units to increase liquidity and accessibility for a broader range of investors. Bonds: Digitizing fixed-income instruments to streamline issuance, settlement, and secondary market trading. Real Estate: Fractionalizing property ownership, allowing investors to buy shares in high-value assets like commercial buildings or developments. This expansion aims to solve long-standing market problems like illiquidity, high entry barriers, and cumbersome administrative processes. Why Is Real-World Asset Tokenization a Game-Changer? Tokenizing RWAs unlocks a transformative set of benefits for the global financial system. Halogen Capital’s seed funding is a direct investment into realizing these advantages. Firstly, it democratizes access. Imagine being able to invest a small amount in a prime Kuala Lumpur office building or a government bond that was previously out of reach. Tokenization makes this possible through fractional ownership. Secondly, it enhances liquidity. Traditional assets like real estate are notoriously illiquid. A tokenized market can operate 24/7, enabling faster and easier buying and selling of asset slices. Moreover, it increases transparency and efficiency. Every transaction is recorded on an immutable blockchain, reducing fraud and automating compliance through smart contracts. This reduces costs and builds trust. What Are the Challenges and the Road Ahead? Despite the promise, the path for Halogen Capital and the broader RWA sector is not without hurdles. Regulatory frameworks for tokenized securities are still evolving in Malaysia and globally. Navigating these rules requires close collaboration with authorities like the Securities Commission Malaysia. Furthermore, technological integration with legacy financial systems poses a challenge. Ensuring secure custody, reliable oracle data for asset pricing, and seamless interoperability are critical technical hurdles that the team must overcome. However, with its recent seed funding and prestigious backers, Halogen Capital is well-positioned to tackle these issues. The involvement of Kenanga Bank is particularly crucial for regulatory dialogue and bridging traditional and digital finance. Conclusion: A Building Block for the Future of Finance Halogen Capital’s successful $3.2 million seed funding round is a milestone for Southeast Asia’s crypto ecosystem. It underscores a mature, next-phase development where blockchain technology is applied to real economic value. The focus on tokenizing funds, bonds, and real estate points to a future where investment is more inclusive, liquid, and efficient. As Halogen deploys this capital, it will serve as a key case study for how traditional and crypto finance can converge to build a more accessible financial world. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Halogen Capital? Halogen Capital is a Malaysia-based cryptocurrency and digital asset fund manager focused on investing in blockchain ventures and tokenizing real-world assets. Who invested in Halogen Capital’s seed round? The $3.2 million seed funding round was led by Kenanga Investment Bank, with participation from global venture capital firms 500 Global and Digital Currency Group (DCG). What will Halogen Capital use the funding for? The capital will be used primarily to expand its platform for tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs), including investment funds, bonds, and real estate properties. What does “tokenization of real-world assets” mean? It means creating digital tokens on a blockchain that represent ownership or a financial interest in a physical asset, like a piece of real estate or a bond, allowing it to be traded more easily and in smaller fractions. Why is RWA tokenization important? It aims to democratize investing by lowering entry barriers, increase liquidity for traditionally illiquid assets, and improve transparency and efficiency through blockchain technology. What are the main challenges for RWA tokenization? The key challenges include evolving and unclear regulatory landscapes, technological integration with existing financial systems, and ensuring secure and reliable asset custody and pricing data.

His comments focus on the Bank of Japan’s imminent interest rate decision and the pattern of market behavior that has followed similar moments in recent history. The message is seen as a call for preparation, particularly for investors holding XRP , as macroeconomic developments once again move to the forefront of digital asset pricing. Time to get tapped in! Big week ahead! pic.twitter.com/GJy5E8OZQ5 — Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) December 13, 2025 Attention Turns to the Bank of Japan Rector emphasizes that the Bank of Japan is expected to announce its interest rate decision within days, with the timing anticipated late Thursday night in U.S. Eastern Standard Time. He stresses that investors have a limited window to assess historical context and understand how previous policy shifts from Japan have coincided with moves across crypto markets. Japan’s monetary policy has drawn increased attention in recent months as the country continues to move away from decades of ultra-loose financial conditions. With inflation remaining elevated by Japanese standards, market expectations have leaned toward further tightening . Zach Rector’s commentary highlights that, regardless of individual forecasts, the decision itself represents a significant macro event that crypto investors should not overlook. Historical Market Reactions Highlighted Central to Zach Rector’s message is a reference to recent history. He points to the last three occasions when the Bank of Japan raised interest rates, noting that each was followed by a sharp decline in Bitcoin’s price, estimated at around 20%. His remarks do not frame this as a prediction of what must happen next, but rather as an observable pattern that investors should understand before positioning themselves. By stressing this history, Zach Rector highlights how shifts in Japanese monetary policy can influence global liquidity conditions. Higher rates in Japan can reduce the attractiveness of strategies that rely on cheap yen funding, which in turn may affect capital flows into risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.

His message is not focused on short-term trading signals, but on awareness of potential volatility as a known macro catalyst approaches. For XRP investors , understanding the timing and context of the Bank of Japan’s decision may be critical in interpreting near-term price movements. Rector’s core instruction is clear: investors should use the remaining days to inform themselves, as this period is an opportunity to review past outcomes and consider how similar conditions could influence the current market.

He also observed that ETH was holding up better than BTC. The analyst pointed out a decline in BTC dominance compared to Ether, adding that since July, “markets have shifted from Bitcoin only toward ETH only; however, mass hasn’t picked up this momentum yet, as most of the altcoins are extremely down,” which is “mispriced.” “Ethereum is an asset that, over time, has always proven to reward those who think in the medium/long term, especially when sentiment is poor, and the market is dominated by fear,” crypto investor EliZ told their 600,000 followers on X on Sunday. They added that ETH never takes off when everyone expects it to, and usually does the opposite. “Then, when BTC slows down and ceases to be the center of attention, capital begins to shift. And that is when ETH changes pace. It has always done so: after long, boring periods, rapid, decisive movements occur, often when few are still well positioned.” Ether Price Holds Up … For Now Ether prices took a minor dip as BTC tanked into the high $87,000 level, but it remained above the psychological $3,000 level this time around. The asset was holding above $3,100 during the Monday morning Asian session while BTC floated around the mid-$89,000 zone.

By 2028, CRO could reach a maximum value of $0.4, with an average trading price of $0.35. Cronos is expected to reach a maximum level of $1.13 in 2031. Cronos (CRO) is the native cryptocurrency token of the Cronos chain, a decentralized, open-source blockchain developed by the Crypto.com payment, trading, and financial services company. CRO aims to power the next generation of decentralized crypto assets and applications, serving as a utility token. And enable real-time, low-cost transactions globally. Cronos cross-bridge mainnet beta suggests a bright future for CRO. This feature aims to improve interoperability between significant blockchain ecosystems, potentially increasing CRO’s attractiveness to developers and users. CRO’s recent performance reflects robust market sentiment and confidence. These factors, combined, make Cronos a compelling investment opportunity within the dynamic crypto market, thereby increasing the demand for CRO. Eminem’s involvement comes as Crypto.com has been actively expanding its visibility through various high-profile partnerships, including those with actor Matt Damon, major sports teams, and even Trump Media. In this Cronos price prediction, we’ll focus on exploring the future market trends of CRO, its current price momentum, and its past performance, using in-depth technical analysis and a price prediction model. Overview Cryptocurrency Cronos Token CRO Price $0.1028 Market Capitalization $4.56B Trading Volume (24-hour) $28.76M Circulating Supply 36.1B CRO All-time High $0.9698 Nov 24, 2021 All-time Low $0.01149 Dec 17, 2018 24-h High $0.1049 24-h Low $0.1027 Cronos Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Price Volatility (30-day variation) $ 0.1120 50-Day SMA $ 0.1222 14-Day RSI 39.48 Sentiment Bearish Green Days 26(extreme fear) 200-Day SMA 12/30 (40%) Price Prediction $ 0.1120 (7.70%) Cronos price analysis: CRO slides within a tight range as sellers maintain short-term control Selling pressure stays measured as CRO drifts within a narrow range The $0.096 support level remains intact, keeping CRO locked in consolidation Repeated pullbacks near $0.098–$0.099 keep the price capped below $0.10, preventing a meaningful upside breakout. On December 15, 2025, Cronos trades at $0.0971, down 2.03% over the past 24 hours, according to the provided chart data. The session showed CRO trading within a defined intraday range, with a low near $0.0962 and a high near $0.0993, suggesting controlled but persistent selling pressure. Cronos daily price chart: CRO trades above $0.096 support On the daily timeframe, CRO remains positioned slightly below its short-term moving averages, reinforcing a mild bearish bias. The inability to sustain momentum above the $0.099–$0.100 region suggests that overhead supply continues to limit upside progress. CRO/USDT Chart: TradingView Momentum indicators point to fading bullish strength, with price consistently printing lower intraday highs. Despite this, the broader structure still favors consolidation rather than a breakdown, as buyers repeatedly step in to defend the $0.096 support area. Cronos 4-hour price chart: CRO consolidates near support as upside momentum fades On the four-hour chart, CRO trades within a descending channel defined by a sequence of lower highs and shallow retracements. This pattern highlights controlled selling activity, supported by relatively stable trading volume throughout the session. CRO/USDT Chart: TradingView Short-term momentum shows early signs of stabilizing near local support. However, repeated rejections near $0.098–$0.099 underline persistent resistance and continue to limit upside follow-through. Cronos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.1840 SELL SMA 5 $ 0.1592 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.1018 BUY SMA 21 $ 0.1057 SELL SMA 50 $ 0.1222 SELL SMA 100 $ 0.1717 SELL SMA 200 $ 0.1429 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.1164 SELL EMA 5 $ 0.1305 SELL EMA 10 $ 0.1597 SELL EMA 21 $ 0.1785 SELL EMA 50 $ 0.1675 SELL EMA 100 $ 0.1457 SELL EMA 200 $ 0.1281 SELL What to expect from Cronos? In the near term, CRO is likely to remain range-bound between $0.096 support and resistance near $0.099–$0.100. A sustained break below $0.096 could expose the price to deeper downside exploration, while a decisive move above $0.10 would be needed to shift short-term bias back in favor of buyers. Until either level gives way, price action is expected to favor consolidation, with short-term traders focused on range dynamics rather than trend continuation. Is Cronos a good investment? Cronos (CRO) may be a good long-term investment due to its utility within the Crypto.com ecosystem, including DeFi, payments, staking, and other Web3 applications, along with strategic partnerships and network upgrades like faster block times and cross-chain compatibility. Analysts project CRO could reach $0.50 to $1+ by 2030 if adoption grows. However, risks include short-term resistance near $0.099–$0.10, reliance on the Crypto.com platform, competition from larger blockchains, and crypto market volatility. CRO is best suited for long-term investors confident in the ecosystem, while short-term traders and cautious investors should wait for clearer momentum. Why Is Cronos (CRO) Down Today? CRO’s recent decline is largely due to measured selling pressure within a narrow trading range. Repeated rejections near $0.098–$0.099, combined with the inability to surpass the $0.10 psychological level, have limited bullish momentum. Broader market conditions, including mild bearish sentiment in the crypto sector, may also contribute to short-term weakness, keeping CRO in consolidation near its $0.096 support. Will Cronos reach $0.5? Based on long-term forecasts, Cronos (CRO) is projected to reach $ 0.50 by 2029, potentially increasing its market capitalization as its ecosystem and user adoption continue to grow. Will Cronos reach $1? Projections for Cronos estimate it could reach $1 by 2031, driven by its expansion in DeFi, NFT integrations, and partnerships. Will Cronos reach $100? It is unlikely that Cronos’s price will reach $100, as this would require an extremely high market capitalization, surpassing the current CRO coin price prediction for the cryptocurrency sector. Does Cronos have an excellent long-term future? Cronos CRO holds promising long-term potential due to Crypto.com ’s ongoing innovations, such as DEX expansions, NFT integration, and metaverse applications, collectively enhancing CRO’s appeal and utility. These strategic initiatives, along with CRO’s liquidity, staking rewards, and network governance, position it as a solid investment for those with a long-term perspective, especially considering institutional adoption.

The minimum projected trading price is $0.102, with an average of around $0.1044. CRO is expected to experience a price change that leads it to reach a peak price of $0.1067 next week.

In 2021, CRO followed the crypto bull run, surpassing previous highs and achieving an all-time high of $0.9698 on November 24, boosted by listings on Coinbase Pro and Bitrue. CRO opened 2022 at $0.5575 but fell to $0.4409, partially due to concerns over a potential security breach on the Crypto.com platform, which temporarily suspended withdrawals in January. In 2023, Cronos experienced a peak in mid-March at around $0.80, followed by a steep decline and stabilization at around $0.20 by mid-year.

55814164,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=245426,1765788912,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,SEC Crypto Lawsuits: The Stunning Halt in Legal Action Under New Leadership,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-halts-crypto-lawsuits-trump/,"BitcoinWorld SEC Crypto Lawsuits: The Stunning Halt in Legal Action Under New Leadership A stunning shift is underway at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Since the start of the year, the regulator has quietly halted the majority of its active SEC crypto lawsuits , a move that has ignited fierce debate about political influence and the future of digital asset enforcement. This dramatic change in legal strategy raises critical questions for the entire industry. What Do the SEC Crypto Lawsuits Numbers Reveal? According to reports, the SEC has moved to close 14 of its 23 ongoing cryptocurrency enforcement cases since January. The agency achieved this through a mix of voluntary withdrawals, concessions, and settlements. This represents a significant slowdown in the aggressive litigation posture championed by the previous SEC chair. The remaining nine active cases notably do not involve individuals publicly known to be close allies of the current administration. Of the seven lawsuits the SEC chose to drop entirely, five were connected to figures with reported ties to President Trump. This pattern has not gone unnoticed. It immediately fueled speculation that political considerations, rather than purely legal ones, might be guiding enforcement priorities. In response to these claims, the SEC issued a firm statement denying any political favoritism in its crypto-related law enforcement actions. Why Would the SEC Halt These Lawsuits? The agency’s official stance likely points to strategic legal reasoning. However, the optics are undeniable and lead to several possible interpretations: Resource Reallocation: The SEC may be choosing to focus its limited resources on cases it deems more winnable or impactful to set broader legal precedents. Shift in Regulatory Philosophy: New leadership can signal a different approach, potentially favoring clearer guidance over enforcement-by-litigation. Legal Pragmatism: Some cases may have been deemed too weak or costly to pursue after further review. Regardless of the official reason, the practical effect is a substantial reduction in legal pressure on a segment of the crypto industry. This creates a new, uncertain environment for projects that were previously in the SEC’s crosshairs. What Does This Mean for Crypto Regulation? This development is a double-edged sword for the cryptocurrency market. On one hand, a reduction in SEC crypto lawsuits can be seen as a relief, reducing legal overhang for certain companies and potentially fostering innovation. On the other hand, it creates regulatory ambiguity. Without clear rules or consistent enforcement, businesses struggle to operate with certainty. The key question now is whether this pause signals a longer-term retreat or merely a strategic recalibration. Will the SEC replace lawsuits with comprehensive regulatory frameworks? The industry is watching closely, as the outcome will shape the legal landscape for years to come. This situation underscores the immense influence that presidential appointments and agency leadership have on the volatile world of digital assets. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Enforcement The halt of most SEC crypto lawsuits marks a pivotal moment. While the SEC denies political motives, the correlation has sparked necessary conversation about the independence of financial regulators. For investors and builders in the crypto space, this episode is a powerful reminder that regulatory risk remains a dominant factor, one that can change dramatically with the political winds. The path forward requires vigilant observation of the SEC’s next moves beyond these halted cases. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: How many SEC crypto lawsuits were actually halted? A: Reports indicate the SEC has moved to close 14 out of 23 ongoing cryptocurrency enforcement cases since January. Q: Did the SEC admit to political favoritism? A: No. The SEC issued a statement explicitly denying any political favoritism in its crypto law enforcement actions. Q: What happens to the crypto projects in the halted lawsuits? A> For those where the SEC voluntarily withdrew the case, the immediate legal threat is removed. However, it does not preclude future action under different circumstances or by other regulators. Q: Does this mean the SEC is done suing crypto companies? A> Not necessarily. The agency still has nine active cases and may file new ones. This may represent a shift in focus or strategy rather than a complete cessation. Q: How does this affect the average cryptocurrency investor? A> It introduces more uncertainty into the regulatory environment. While it may reduce short-term legal risk for some projects, the lack of clear, consistent rules makes long-term planning difficult for the entire industry.

Security Alliance announced that crypto-drainers are actively weaponizing CVE-2025-55182 , urging all websites to review their front-end code immediately for suspicious assets. The vulnerability affects not only Web3 protocols but all websites using React, with attackers targeting permit signatures across platforms. Users face immediate risk when signing any transaction, as malicious code intercepts wallet communications and redirects funds to attacker-controlled addresses. Crypto Drainers using React CVE-2025-55182 We are observing a big uptick in drainers uploaded to legitimate (crypto) websites through exploitation of the recent React CVE. All websites should review front-end code for any suspicious assets NOW. — Security Alliance (@_SEAL_Org) December 13, 2025 Critical Flaw Enables Remote Code Execution React’s official team disclosed CVE-2025-55182 on December 3, rating it CVSS 10.0 following Lachlan Davidson’s November 29 report through Meta Bug Bounty. The unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability exploits how React decodes payloads sent to Server Function endpoints, allowing attackers to craft malicious HTTP requests that execute arbitrary code on servers. The flaw impacts React versions 19.0, 19.1.0, 19.1.1, and 19.2.0 across react-server-dom-webpack, react-server-dom-parcel, and react-server-dom-turbopack packages. Major frameworks, including Next.js, React Router, Waku, and Expo, require immediate updates. Patches arrived in versions 19.0.1, 19.1.2, and 19.2.1, with Next.js users needing upgrades across multiple release lines from 14.2.35 through 16.0.10. Unfortunately, the researchers have again detected two major new flaws. Researchers have found two new vulnerabilities in React Server Components while attempting to exploit the patches last week. These are new issues, separate from the critical CVE last week. The patch for React2Shell remains effective for the Remote Code Execution exploit. — React (@reactjs) December 11, 2025 Vercel deployed Web Application Firewall rules to automatically protect projects on its platform, though the company emphasized that WAF protection alone remains insufficient. “ Immediate upgrades to a patched version are required, ” Vercel stated in its December 3 security bulletin, adding that the vulnerability affects applications that process untrusted input in ways that permit remote code execution. Multiple Threat Groups Launch Coordinated Attacks Google Threat Intelligence Group documented widespread attacks beginning on December 3, tracking criminal groups ranging from opportunistic hackers to government-backed operations. Chinese hacking groups installed various malware types on compromised systems, primarily targeting cloud servers on Amazon Web Services and Alibaba Cloud. These attackers employed sophisticated techniques to maintain long-term access to victim systems. Some groups installed software creating secret tunnels for remote control, while others deployed programs that continuously download additional malicious tools disguised as legitimate files. The malware hides in system folders and automatically restarts to avoid detection. Several groups disguised malicious software as common programs or used legitimate cloud services, such as Cloudflare Pages and GitLab, to hide their communications. New details on multiple state and criminal actors now exploiting React2Shell. https://t.co/4M21rqLndT — John Hultquist (@JohnHultquist) December 13, 2025 Financially motivated criminals joined the attack wave starting on December 5, installing crypto-mining software that secretly uses victims’ computing power to generate Monero. These miners run constantly in the background, driving up electricity costs while generating profits for attackers. Underground hacking forums quickly filled with discussions sharing attack tools and exploitation experiences. Historic Supply Chain Attack Pattern Continues The React vulnerability follows a September 8 attack in which hackers compromised Josh Goldberg’s npm account and published malicious updates to 18 widely used packages, including chalk, debug, and strip-ansi. These utilities collectively account for over 2.6 billion weekly downloads, and researchers have discovered crypto-clipper malware that intercepts browser functions to swap legitimate wallet addresses with attacker-controlled ones. Ledger CTO Charles Guillemet described that incident as a “ large-scale supply chain attack, ” advising users without hardware wallets to avoid on-chain transactions. The attackers gained access through phishing campaigns impersonating npm support, claiming accounts would be locked unless two-factor authentication credentials were updated by September 10. Hackers are stealing more crypto and moving it faster. One laundering process took only 2 minutes 57 seconds. Can the industry cope? #CryptoSecurity #Web3 #Blockchain #DeFi https://t.co/lGwutYsT6Q — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 12, 2025 Global Ledger data shows hackers stole over $3 billion across 119 incidents in the first half of 2025, with 70% of breaches involving funds being moved before they became public. Only 4.2% of stolen assets were recovered, as laundering now takes seconds rather than hours. For now, organizations using React or Next.js are advised to patch immediately to versions 19.0.1, 19.1.2, or 19.2.1, deploy WAF rules, audit all dependencies, monitor network traffic for wget or cURL commands initiated by web server processes, and hunt for unauthorized hidden directories or malicious shell configuration injections.

The “Crank It” artist’s social media activity between 2021 and 2023 has several posts promoting crypto tokens and NFT collections to his millions of followers. ZachXBT alleges that many of those promotions involved projects that either collapsed within days of his messages, were abandoned, or were outright fraudulent. Soulja Boy, whose real name is DeAndre Cortez Way, addressed the allegations in a statement posted on X early Monday morning. He said he was unaware of the fraudulent nature of the projects at the time and admitted there were failures in his past judgment. “I want to be clear and transparent. I had no knowledge that a scammer named Sahil was involved or paying me to promote anything fraudulent. At the time, I was doing paid promos without understanding the crypto/NFT space the way I do now. This was years ago, and I’ve learned a lot since then,” the rapper-turned-crypto-investor claimed. I want to be clear and transparent. I had no knowledge that a scammer named Sahil was involved or paying me to promote anything fraudulent. At the time, I was doing paid promos without understanding the crypto/NFT space the way I do now. This was years ago, and I’ve learned a… https://t.co/y4g2Qno6LS — Soulja Boy (Draco) (@souljaboy) December 14, 2025 He continued to apologize to his followers, saying he was “genuinely sorry and it was never his intention” to promote rug pull projects. “I take responsibility for not doing deeper due diligence back then, and I’ve moved very differently since. Growth is learning from mistakes,” Soulja Boy concluded. ZachXBT listed 5 scam projects promoted by Soulja Boy According to ZachXBT’s X thread in April 2023, Soulja Boy promoted crypto and NFT drops at least 73 times since March 2021. The investigator said 16 of the NFT collections lauded by the rapper later became scams or failed ventures, Cryptopolitan reported . One of the cited examples was a token known as RAPDOGE, which Soulja Boy had mentioned severally in mid-2021. “On July 19, 2021, Soulja Boy Tweeted out: “let’s pump $RAPDOGE to $.000001 and let’s get all our friends in on this, are you with me lilyachty” In the following hours the project rug pulled after receiving shills from Lil Yachty and Quavo as well,” the investigator wrote. The RAPDOGE token has since become defunct, and investors suffered losses after liquidity was withdrawn shortly after the promotional push. ZachXBT also talked about Soulja Boy’s tussle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which had filed a complaint accusing him and several other celebrities of unlawfully promoting tronix (TRX) and BitTorrent (BTT). The SEC alleged that the promotions failed to disclose the rapper had been compensated for endorsing the tokens, alongside actor Lindsay Lohan, WWE athlete and influencer Jake Paul, artists Akon and Ne-Yo. Two projects known as Orion and The Life Token were also part of Soulja Boy’s cake, which he allegedly used for charitable causes. “Orion & The Life Token, these two projects used cancer and suicide prevention charities as a means to pump the price. Within one month of the shill Orion, rugged and Twitter was deleted. The Life Token was abandoned in early 2022,” ZachXBT surmised. Soulja Boy promoted a different project called Flokinomics that fraudulently claimed to be connected to Elon Musk and paid for media promotion to make it look real, but its liquidity was eventually taken away. Per ZachXBT’s estimates, the “Superman” rapper earned more than $730,000 from crypto and NFT promotions during the period under review. Celebrity gets cleared from 2-year long Cryptozoo court case There have been several famous names mentioned alongside failed crypto projects within the last year, but perhaps the most talked about was Logan Paul’s Cryptozoo frenzy. The WWE superstar and online personality closed the chapter on the defunct NFT project legal dispute after a US district judge upheld the dismissal of a class action lawsuit accusing him of misleading investors. The lawsuit, filed in 2023, alleged that Paul and his associates promoted an NFT-based game that promised profits through breeding and trading digital animals. The project never completely got off the ground, which led to claims that investors were lied to and that the effort was a “rug pull.” Claim your free seat in an exclusive crypto trading community - limited to 1,000 members.",News|BTT|SEC|TRX|USD,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|TRX|BTT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-15 09:08:40

According to crypto analyst Axel Adler Jr., Bitcoin short-term holders are capitulating right now. This pattern often signals important turning points in cryptocurrency markets. But what does this capitulation actually mean, and how might it affect your Bitcoin investments? What Does Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Capitulation Mean? When we say Bitcoin short-term holders are capitulating , we’re describing a specific market psychology. Short-term holders (STHs) are investors who purchased Bitcoin within approximately the last 155 days. Capitulation occurs when these investors sell their holdings at a loss, typically driven by fear or panic during price declines. This behavior creates important market dynamics. First, it transfers Bitcoin from weak hands to potentially stronger ones. Second, it often precedes market bottoms. However, capitulation doesn’t guarantee an immediate recovery. The market needs sufficient buying demand to absorb this selling pressure. How Do We Know Capitulation Is Happening? Analysts don’t guess about capitulation—they measure it using on-chain data. Axel Adler Jr. points to two key indicators confirming that Bitcoin short-term holders are capitulating : STH Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) : This seven-day average has fallen below one, meaning short-term holders are selling at an overall loss Profit/Loss Block Indicator : Currently at -3, signaling extremely negative market sentiment among recent buyers These metrics provide objective evidence beyond price charts. They show actual investor behavior through blockchain transactions. When both indicators point downward simultaneously, they create a strong signal of market stress. Why Should Bitcoin Investors Care About This Signal? Understanding that Bitcoin short-term holders are capitulating matters for several reasons. First, capitulation often creates buying opportunities for long-term investors. Second, it indicates potential market exhaustion—when the weakest sellers have exited, fewer remain to push prices lower. However, Adler cautions that capitulation alone doesn’t guarantee recovery. The market needs sufficient demand to absorb this selling. If buying interest remains weak, prices could continue declining despite the capitulation signal. When Will the Bitcoin Market Recover? According to Adler’s analysis, recovery requires specific conditions. The SOPR must rise above one again, indicating that short-term holders are selling at a profit. Simultaneously, the P/L Block indicator needs to return to positive territory. These changes would signal several important developments: Reduced selling pressure from panicked investors Increased confidence among market participants Potential accumulation by long-term holders Improved overall market sentiment Until these indicators reverse, the Bitcoin short-term holders capitulating phase may continue. Investors should watch for these on-chain signals alongside price action. What Should Bitcoin Investors Do Now? Recognizing that Bitcoin short-term holders are capitulating provides context for investment decisions. However, it shouldn’t dictate panic selling or reckless buying. Consider these balanced approaches: For long-term holders : This may represent a potential accumulation zone, though timing bottoms remains challenging For short-term traders : Exercise caution until on-chain indicators show clear improvement For new investors : Consider dollar-cost averaging rather than timing exact market bottoms Remember that capitulation phases test investor psychology. The emotional urge to sell often peaks just before potential recoveries. Having a clear investment strategy matters more than reacting to every market signal. Frequently Asked Questions What are Bitcoin short-term holders? Short-term holders (STHs) are investors who purchased Bitcoin within approximately the last 155 days. They typically show more price sensitivity than long-term holders. How long does capitulation typically last? Capitulation phases vary in duration. They can last from days to weeks, depending on market conditions and overall sentiment. There’s no fixed timeline. Does capitulation always lead to a price bottom? Not always. While capitulation often precedes market bottoms, it doesn’t guarantee them. Sufficient buying demand must emerge to reverse the trend. How can I track these on-chain indicators myself? Several cryptocurrency analytics platforms provide on-chain data, including Glassnode, CryptoQuant, and LookIntoBitcoin. These sites offer both free and paid access to metrics like SOPR. Should I sell my Bitcoin during capitulation? This depends on your investment strategy and time horizon. Capitulation often creates potential buying opportunities, but selling during fear-driven markets can lock in losses. Consult your financial advisor for personalized advice. What’s the difference between STH and LTH capitulation? Short-term holder capitulation is more common during corrections, while long-term holder capitulation typically occurs during deeper bear markets. LTH capitulation often signals more severe market stress. Share This Analysis Did this explanation of why Bitcoin short-term holders are capitulating help your understanding?

While Bitcoin is trading below $90k, some cryptocurrencies, including AAVE, have added gains in the last 24 hours. At press time, AAVE is trading at $194 per coin, up by less than 1% but could rally higher over the next few hours or days. The native coin of the Aave ecosystem is approaching the upper boundary of its descending parallel channel, with a breakout expected in the near term. Furthermore, on-chain and derivatives data also support bullish sentiment, with technical indicators suggesting a breakout towards $235 over the next few hours or days. Aave’s on-chain and derivatives data show a strong bullish sentiment According to CryptoQuant, Aave’s spot and futures markets are showing large whale orders, cooling bearish conditions, and buy dominance. These data support the bullish outlook for the cryptocurrency and could signal a potential rally in the coming days. Looking at the derivatives data, CoinGlass shows that Aave’s funding rate data also support signs of a rally. The Aave OI-Weighted Funding Rate data, the number of traders betting that the price of Aave will slide further is lower than those anticipating a price increase. THE OI-Weighted Funding Rate flipped to a positive rate last week and currently stands at 0.0088%, suggesting that longs are currently paying shorts. Usually, when the rates flip from negative to positive, Aave’s price has rallied. Furthermore, the AAVE long-to-short ratio stands at 1.01, close to a new monthly high. If the ratio is above one, it suggests that the bullish sentiment in the market outweighs the bearish sentiment. Thus, more traders are betting on the asset price to rally. Aave eyes a breakout, with major resistance around $235 The AAVE/USD 4-hour chart is bearish and inefficient as AAVE has been unable to close the inefficiency gap left around $269. The cryptocurrency is currently trading within a descending parallel channel pattern, as it is now approaching the upper boundary of this channel. A breakout above this resistance channel could signal a potential bullish shift. The momentum indicators suggest that buyers are in control of the market. Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour chart reads 50, indicating a growing bullish momentum. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) showed a bullish crossover last week, which remains intact, further supporting the bullish thesis. If the bullish trend continues, AAVE could rally past the first major resistance level at $235 over the next few hours. An extended rally would allow it to gain efficiency and hit the $296 resistance region in the medium term. However, if AAVE faces rejection around the $235 resistance, it could extend the decline toward the daily support level at $186.

The global cryptocurrency market cap has declined by 0.46% the last day to $3.05 trillion. While the overall market struggled to find direction, HumidiFi’s native token has stunned the crypto community with an over 50% surge on its 24-hour price chart. WET’s remarkable surge unfolded shortly after Upbit, the largest South Korean crypto exchange by volume, announced plans to add the alt’s pair to its trading platform. According to today’s announcement , Upbit will list WET BTC, USDT, and KRW trading pairs at 18:30 KST on December 15. Upbit Korea @Official_Upbit · Follow Replying to @Official_Upbit Market Support HumidiFi(WET)✅ Supported Markets: KRW, BTC, USDT Market📅 Trading opens at: 2025-12-15 18:30 KST (estimated time) 🔗Discover more: upbit.com/service_center… #Upbit #WET @humidifi 12:44 PM · Dec 15, 2025 10 Reply Copy link Read more on Twitter The news gained traction due to South Korea’s highly active trading base. Indeed, Upbit plays a vital role in the region’s crypto ecosystem, and listing on the platform has historically catalyzed significant price actions. The WET/KRW pair is particularly crucial as it enables investors to access HumidiFi’s native token directly with local fiat. That can attract rapid volume growth and amplified volatility for the altcoin. For context, WET’s trading volume increased by over 90% after this announcement. That reflects intensified trading activity amid renewed optimism. Understanding HumidiFi HumidiFi does not operate like traditional decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Rather, it positions itself as a trade execution layer that optimizes how individuals route and execute trades on-chain. Notably, this Solana-based layer aims to solve common DeFi challenges, including inefficient execution, fragmented liquidity, and slippage. HumidiFi doesn’t compete with existing DEXs. Instead, it integrates beneath them to offer an innovative infrastructure that enhances benefits for liquidity providers, traders, and dApps. The protocol leverages WET as its native token, used for various functions, including gas and governance. Why does Upbit listing matter? South Korea boasts a reputation for a speedy and in-depth crypto market, with Upbit dominating in trading volumes. Today’s listing immediately introduces HumidiFi to a vibrant audience. The project has also received attention from market players seeking new opportunities amid the deteriorating broader market. Also, WET’s performance reflects the current trend where markets are rotating from speculative narratives to utility-focused infrastructure projects with value in the DeFi world. WET price outlook The altcoin is changing hands at $0.2909 after a roughly 51% increase in the past day.

This $0.035 DeFi Token Is Close to 100% Sellout,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/next-big-crypto-this-0-035-defi-token-is-close-to-100-sellout/,"Such moments are usually coming in unannounced. Budgets are made, projects are planned to meet, and progress begins to be seen even before the headlines. That trend is re-establishing itself. Emerging token in the DeFi with a price of $0.035 is gaining more attention because its quantity is becoming less and less, and occupation before 2026 speeds up. The hype is not the reason behind the interest. What Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Is Building Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a decentralized loan issuer and borrower product that is currently being developed and is supposed to be set up in two different markets to serve two different types of users. The former is the Peer-to-Contract market. Users deposit assets in a common liquidity pool and they are issued with mtTokens. These mtTokens grow in value that can be redeemed over time as the interest is repaid by borrowers. By way of illustration, when a user sends ETH, he or she is given mtETH. Borrowing causes the reduction in the quantity of ETH that is redeemed as a mtETH. Production is achieved through actual operation, and not emissions. The second is the Peer to peer market. Borrowers collateralize loans and demand loans that have conditions. The lenders make decisions on what requests to finance. The utilization adjustment to borrow rates and the stable rates can be locked when borrowing a loan at the beginning of the loan. There are Loan-to-Value rules that govern risks. LTVs on lower volatility assets are higher and on more volatile assets they are lower. When the collateral falls below the safe levels, then the liquidations take place in a controlled intercourse. These two markets combine to promote foreseeable behaviour of lending. This arrangement is one of the reasons as to why preliminary involvement has also increased. Mutuum Finance has already secured $19.30M and over 18,400 holders to date. In the case of a lending protocol, timely liquidity and wide user base is important. They encourage greater depth and lessening of borrowing when it is actively used. This team has already confirmed its official statement about the launch of V1 in the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, providing the Liquidity Pool, mtToken structure, Debt Token, and Liquidator Bot, and ETH and USDT will be the initial supported assets. Token Structuring and Price Dynamics MUTM is currently trading in presale phase 6 at $0.035. The maximum supply amount is 4B MUTM tokens, and 45.5% or 1.82B tokens is allocated to the presale. So far, 820M in tokens have been sold out. The token was introduced at the price of $0.01 at the beginning of 2025 and has already grown by 250% according to updates. Phase 1 participants are allotted approximately 500% growth at the official launch price of $0.06 which will be determined in the pricing ladder. A higher price is added with each stage. Phase 6 is currently approaching full coverage, and the subsequent phase is planned to increase the price of the token almost by 20%. This is an artificial arrangement that is important as it is gradually restrictive to supply and increases the entry level. This has always been the period when participation gains momentum in time and not decelerates. Basic Understandings of Security and Why It Is Important During development, security preparation has assumed precedence. The audit of Mutuum Finance yielded a 90/100 score in the token scan CertiK audit indicating good activity coverage of a protocol still at an early development stage. Simultaneously, Halborn Security has the finished lending/borrowing contracts that are being scrutinized during the formal analysis. Somewhat a $50K bug bounty exists to establish potential vulnerability of the code. These steps are necessary in case of a DeFi lending protocol. Predictable behavior and trust is important to lending platforms before increasing usage. Tackling security earlier than V1 will minimize uncertainty at the stage of user access to actual mechanics. Positioning Ahead of Q1 2026 Mutuum Finance is an Ethereum-Based project, thus placing their work into the system that is already familiar in the minds of most users. As V1 will launch in Q4 2025, the protocol is in transition between preparation and use announcing itself to many investors as they look to the future, just as Q1 2026. In addition to lending, the roadmap has a protocol-native stablecoin, as it can be supported by interest earned in the system and Layer-2 expansion to cut down on expenses and speed up. Chainlink supported by fallback and aggregated feeds are the backbone of Oracle infrastructure that provides collateral and liquidations with correct prices. These factors carry the protocol further in terms of long term sustainability and does not concern itself with short term maneuvers. The Window Narrows Mutuum Finance is on the verge of an unveiling phase. Raised: $19.30M, Holders 18,400, Phase 6 is almost fully allocated,and V1 is confirmed, and with a 250% increase already realized, a wide range of indicators are converging at the same time. When the projects are at an early stage, but enter the phase, the attention is likely to increase rapidly. To crypto observers, who are keeping an eye on the next big crypto, new cryptocurrency, or what crypto to invest in now, the combination of structure and progress with tightening availability of MUTM is generating a certain kind of urgency that cannot be overlooked.

An address linked to Singapore’s DBS Bank executed a substantial DBS Bank ETH withdrawal , moving 2,000 Ethereum tokens worth approximately $6.27 million. This move, reported by The Data Nerd, highlights the ongoing activity of major financial institutions within the digital asset space. What Does This DBS Bank ETH Withdrawal Mean? The transaction involved withdrawing funds from Galaxy Digital, a prominent crypto financial services firm. This DBS Bank ETH withdrawal occurred approximately seven hours before reports surfaced, demonstrating how quickly large-scale movements can happen in crypto markets. While the bank hasn’t officially confirmed the address ownership, blockchain analysts consistently track these institutional wallets. DBS Bank maintains substantial cryptocurrency reserves according to current estimates. The institution reportedly holds around $499 million in Ethereum and an even larger $706 million in Bitcoin. Therefore, this recent DBS Bank ETH withdrawal represents a relatively small portion of their overall digital asset portfolio. Why Are Institutional Moves Like This Important? When traditional banks like DBS engage with cryptocurrencies, it signals broader market acceptance. These institutions don’t make moves lightly—every transaction serves a strategic purpose. This particular DBS Bank ETH withdrawal might indicate several possibilities: Portfolio rebalancing: Adjusting their asset allocation between different cryptocurrencies Liquidity needs: Moving funds for operational requirements or client services Market positioning: Preparing for anticipated market movements or developments Testing infrastructure: Ensuring their crypto transaction systems function smoothly Institutional activity often precedes or responds to market trends that retail investors might miss. Therefore, monitoring these DBS Bank ETH withdrawal events provides valuable market intelligence. How Does This Affect the Broader Crypto Ecosystem? The growing involvement of traditional banks like DBS creates several important effects on cryptocurrency markets. First, it increases overall market liquidity and stability. Second, it lends credibility to blockchain technology as a legitimate financial infrastructure. Third, it encourages regulatory clarity as governments observe respected institutions participating. Singapore has positioned itself as a crypto-friendly hub, with DBS Bank at the forefront of this adoption. Their continued activity, including this latest DBS Bank ETH withdrawal , reinforces the city-state’s commitment to digital asset innovation. Other Asian financial centers are watching closely, potentially accelerating their own crypto integration plans. What Should Crypto Investors Learn From This? While individual investors shouldn’t blindly follow institutional moves, understanding their behavior offers valuable insights. The DBS Bank ETH withdrawal reminds us that: Institutions are here to stay: Major banks continue building their crypto capabilities Transparency varies: Blockchain allows tracking, but motives aren’t always clear Scale matters: What seems like a large transaction might be routine for institutions Timing is strategic: Institutions often execute when market attention is elsewhere Rather than reacting to single transactions, watch for patterns in institutional behavior over time. Consistent accumulation or distribution trends often prove more meaningful than isolated moves like this DBS Bank ETH withdrawal . The Bottom Line: Decoding Institutional Crypto Strategy This $6.27 million DBS Bank ETH withdrawal represents more than just a transaction—it’s a data point in the larger story of traditional finance embracing digital assets. As one of Asia’s most respected banks, DBS continues demonstrating how established institutions can participate in cryptocurrency markets while maintaining their regulatory compliance and risk management standards. The true significance lies not in the specific amount moved, but in the ongoing normalization of crypto transactions by major financial players. Each movement, including this DBS Bank ETH withdrawal , builds the infrastructure and precedent for broader adoption. For the crypto market, institutional participation brings both validation and new dynamics that will shape the ecosystem’s future development. Frequently Asked Questions Q: Did DBS Bank confirm this ETH withdrawal? A: DBS Bank hasn’t officially confirmed the specific transaction, but blockchain analysts have identified the address patterns as consistent with the bank’s known cryptocurrency activities. Q: Why would a bank withdraw ETH instead of selling it? A: Withdrawing to a different wallet doesn’t necessarily mean selling. The bank might be moving funds between custody solutions, preparing for staking, or reallocating across different storage methods for security or operational reasons. Q: How significant is $6.27 million relative to DBS Bank’s total crypto holdings? A: It represents a small percentage, as DBS reportedly holds approximately $499 million in ETH and $706 million in BTC. This suggests it’s likely a routine portfolio management move rather than a major strategic shift. Q: Can retail investors track these institutional movements themselves? A: Yes, blockchain explorers allow anyone to track large transactions, though identifying the specific entities behind addresses requires additional analysis and often relies on reports from specialized blockchain analytics firms. Q: What does this mean for Ethereum’s price? A: Single institutional transactions rarely cause immediate price impacts, especially of this scale relative to daily trading volume. However, sustained institutional activity patterns can influence longer-term market sentiment and liquidity. Q: Is DBS Bank increasing or decreasing its crypto exposure? A: Based on their reported holdings, DBS maintains substantial cryptocurrency positions. This withdrawal alone doesn’t indicate a broader trend—it would require observing their activity over months to determine if they’re accumulating or distributing assets.

The analyst outlines several developments giving Ripple increasing proximity to major sources of institutional transaction activity. The commentary is to access and integrate, not short-term market performance. According to the analysis, access to the Federal Reserve’s master account is identified as a foundational element. Such access is characterized as enabling participation in the Federal Reserve’s transaction flows, placing Ripple closer to the core settlement mechanisms of the U.S. financial system. The analyst suggests that this type of access is less about visibility and more about operational relevance within regulated financial infrastructure. The Fed's master account will give Ripple direct access to the Fed's transaction volume. Ripple Prime (Hidden Road) will give Ripple direct access to the DTCC volume ($4 quadrillion market). Rail gives direct access to 10% of the global stablecoin volume to Ripple. XRP is the… — {x} (@unknowDLT) December 13, 2025 DTCC Exposure Through Prime Brokerage Operations The post also identifies Ripple Prime, previously operating under the name Hidden Road , as an additional channel through which Ripple is extending its presence within institutional markets. The analyst references the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, which plays a critical role in global clearing and settlement and is responsible for processing transaction volumes measured in the quadrillions of dollars annually. Within this context, Ripple Prime is described as providing Ripple with exposure to this institutional environment. The argument does not suggest that Ripple is immediately processing DTCC-scale volumes, but rather that it is aligned with systems that serve major financial institutions. This alignment is presented as a necessary condition for long-term participation in institutional finance, where access and compliance are prerequisites for growth. Stablecoin Rails and Transaction Pathways Another element of the analyst’s post centers on Rail , which is described as providing Ripple with exposure to a meaningful share of global stablecoin transaction volume. The post claims that this access represents approximately ten percent of stablecoin flows worldwide. In this context, XRP is positioned as the underlying infrastructure that supports settlement and liquidity across these channels, rather than as a standalone product competing for attention. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The analyst’s emphasis remains consistent: infrastructure and transaction pathways are portrayed as more significant at this stage than visible market metrics. Liquidity as the Precondition for Price Movement A response from X user Wingfoot reinforces this perspective by outlining a progression that begins with liquidity development, followed by increased transaction volume, and only later price appreciation. The comment characterizes the current period as one focused on liquidity formation, a phase that tends to attract limited attention until demand begins to challenge existing pricing levels. According to this view, price increases occur only when liquidity demand exceeds what the market can accommodate at prevailing prices. Both the analyst’s post and the response converge on the idea that access, integration, and liquidity are being established first, with market repricing expected only after these foundations are sufficiently tested by demand.

The grant would go to Swiss Stake AG, the company responsible for building and maintaining the protocol's core infrastructure. At current market rates, the allocation represents approximately $6.6 million in value. The proposal was published on Curve's governance forum over the weekend and awaits community approval through the DAO voting process. The funding request follows a similar grant that received approval in late 2024. Egorov stated the resources would cover multiple operational areas, including research, software development, infrastructure maintenance, and security initiatives. Development Plans and Resource Allocation Swiss Stake AG employs 25 team members who contribute to various aspects of the Curve ecosystem. The proposed grant would sustain this workforce while supporting several planned initiatives throughout 2026. The company outlined an ambitious roadmap in the proposal documentation. Priority projects include launching an updated version of Llamalend, Curve's lending protocol product. Development efforts will also focus on creating an onchain foreign exchange swap system designed to facilitate currency trading within the decentralized finance space. User interface improvements represent another key focus area. The team plans to enhance the platform's accessibility and usability for both experienced and new users. Additional work will target crosschain functionality, allowing Curve to operate across multiple blockchain networks. Integration efforts with other protocols and governance tooling upgrades also appear in the development schedule. Egorov emphasized that all intellectual property created using grant funds would be released under open-source licenses. This approach aligns with Curve's existing development philosophy and ensures community access to protocol innovations. Financial Sustainability and Revenue Streams The proposal acknowledges Swiss Stake AG's efforts to achieve financial independence. The company has developed multiple revenue sources over time, though these currently fall short of covering full operational costs. Revenue generation comes from several channels. Curve Lite deployments on alternative blockchain networks provide one income stream. The firm also earns fees through staking veCRV tokens via partner protocols, including Convex, StakeDAO, and Yearn Finance. Despite these revenue sources, Egorov confirmed the company remains dependent on community funding at this stage.

According to The Korea Times , the 34-year-old Korean national could apply to be transferred to his home country after serving half his US term, where prosecutors are seeking a sentence exceeding 30 years for violations of capital markets laws. US District Judge Paul Engelmayer delivered the sentence last week , rejecting both the prosecution’s 12-year recommendation and the defense’s five-year request . “ In the history of federal prosecutions, there are few frauds that have caused as much harm as you have, ” Engelmayer told Kwon directly. Source: The Korea Times Korean Authorities Prepare Separate Prosecution South Korean prosecutors obtained an arrest warrant for Kwon in September 2022 through the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office joint financial crimes unit. A senior prosecutor told the local report that prosecuting Kwon domestically would serve local victims most effectively, as approximately 200,000 Korean investors have suffered losses totaling roughly 300 billion won ($204 million). Ten alleged accomplices have faced trial in Korea for nearly three years while authorities awaited Kwon’s potential return. The separate Korean charges center on violations of the Capital Markets Act stemming from the same conduct underlying his US conviction. However, Korean prosecutors maintain they can pursue independent punishment regardless of the American proceedings. Kwon initially sought extradition to Korea rather than to the United States after his March 2023 arrest in Montenegro on charges of possessing forged documents. He spent nearly two years detained there before transfer to America in December 2024, with his defense team describing the conditions as “ brutal .” US prosecutors demand 12-year sentence for Do Kwon after Terra's $40B collapse that destabilized crypto markets and aided FTX implosion. #FTX #DoKwon #TerraForm https://t.co/LfzwEWH4XG — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 6, 2025 Terra Collapse Mechanics and Fraudulent Claims Between 2018 and 2022, Kwon admitted to knowingly participating in schemes to defraud Terraform Labs’ crypto purchasers. The Singapore-based firm issued the TerraUSD stablecoin and its sister token, Luna, claiming that Terra maintained a one-to-one dollar peg through its protocol design. When Terra fell below $1 in May 2021, Kwon publicly stated the protocol had restored its value autonomously. US prosecutors later discovered that an investment firm contracted by Terraform Labs had secretly purchased Terra to artificially prop up its price, with Jump Trading’s role deliberately concealed from investors. Both tokens plunged again in May 2022, wiping out tens of billions in investor value and triggering cascading failures across cryptocurrency markets. Federal prosecutors specifically cited the collapse’s contribution to Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX implosion as evidence of broader systemic damage beyond Terra’s immediate losses. Kwon was convicted on nine counts, including fraud and money laundering, and Judge Engelmayer ordered the forfeiture of $19 million in illicit gains. The initial potential sentence under US guidelines was 130 years, but the August plea agreement capped prosecutorial recommendations at 12 years. Sentencing Disparities and Transfer Mechanics Judge Engelmayer called the 12-year recommendation “ unreasonable ” while dismissing the five-year request as “ implausible ,” ultimately imposing 15 years as “ the least I can impose .” The defense argued that dual prosecution should be factored into sentencing calculations, particularly given the overlap in allegations across jurisdictions. The court rejected this reasoning, with Engelmayer stating that one court cannot base rulings on speculation about another court’s decisions. US prosecutors indicated they would not oppose a transfer request under the International Prisoner Transfer Program after Kwon serves half his sentence, leaving the pathway to Korean prosecution open. US District Judge Paul A. Engelmayer handed down a 15-year prison sentence to Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon for Terra's $40 billion crash. #DoKwon #TerraUSD #CryptoFraud https://t.co/7N3WlnQrTB — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 12, 2025 The contrasting treatment compared to Bankman-Fried’s 25-year sentence has raised questions about consistency, as Kwon’s guilty plea significantly reduced exposure despite Terra’s larger loss. Legal experts note that federal guidelines for fraud at Terra’s scale typically suggest advisory ranges approaching life imprisonment before statutory caps. Kwon will receive credit for time served in US custody, though questions remain about whether his 21-month detention in Montenegro will count toward his American term. The sentencing comes amid escalating crypto-related criminal activity worldwide. Spanish and Danish authorities recently arrested nine suspects in a violent kidnapping and murder targeting a victim’s crypto holdings.

These malicious Zoom meetings , which often target high-level crypto figures, have become a daily occurrence, the SEAL team warned in a recent X post . “SEAL is tracking multiple DAILY attempts by North Korean actors utilizing ‘Fake Zoom’ tactics for spreading malware as well as escalating their access to new victims. Social engineering is at the root of the attack,” the group wrote. In a separate post published the same day, cybersecurity researcher Taylor Monahan explained that this attack vector has already drained over $300 million from the wallets of unsuspecting users. North Korean hackers use Zoom to push malicious script The scam usually begins with bad actors reaching out through a Telegram account that belongs to someone the victim knows. Because the account is familiar, the victim is lulled into a false sense of trust and eventually drawn into a casual conversation that leads to a Zoom video call invitation. Hackers then share a malicious link disguised to look like a standard Zoom invite. On that page, victims may see what appears to be their contact, along with supposed colleagues or partners. According to Monahan, these are not deepfakes but real videos recorded from earlier hacks or publicly available sources like podcasts. Once the call begins, the hackers pretend to have audio problems and convince the victim that a patch is needed to resolve the issue. The victim is then sent a file to install, often named something like “Zoom Update SDK.scpt”, which executes malicious AppleScript code. In other cases, victims are asked to copy and paste a fix into their terminal. “The ‘update’ is often a ‘Zoom Update SDK.scpt’ which opens or runs in AppleScript. There are a lot of blank spaces to hide the malicious code. In other cases you copy and paste the ‘fix.’ It says it’s successful. But it doesn’t resolve the issue. So you eventually reschedule,” Monahan explained. What the victim does not realize is that the malware is already active as the malicious script silently infects the system and begins exfiltrating sensitive data, stealing passwords, browser-stored crypto wallets, and even full access to the user’s Telegram account. How to prevent losses As a post-incident measure, Monahan advises anyone who may have clicked on such a link or opened a suspicious file to immediately disconnect from WiFi and power down the affected device. Using a separate, uncompromised device, victims should transfer their crypto assets to new wallets, change all login credentials, and activate two-factor authentication wherever possible. She also stressed the importance of locking down Telegram accounts, advising users to log in via a phone, go to settings, terminate all active sessions except the current one, change the password, and enable multifactor authentication. Most critically, Monahan urged victims to alert their contacts right away, as the attackers often use access to Telegram accounts to identify and target the next round of victims. ” If they hack your telegram, you need to TELL EVERYONE ASAP. You are about [to] hack your friends. Please put your pride aside and SCREAM abt it,” she added. A recurring attack vector North Korean hackers, who are believed to be behind some of the largest crypto thefts in recent years, including the $1.5 billion Bybit hack , have increasingly used these malicious Zoom tactics to infiltrate high-profile targets throughout 2025. One such case in September involved THORChain co-founder JP Thor, who reportedly lost around $1.3 million after falling for a similar scam. A malicious script triggered during the fake Zoom call accessed his iCloud storage, extracted his MetaMask wallet credentials, and drained funds, all without triggering any security prompts or admin warnings. Beyond Zoom calls, these hackers have even employed other complex attack vectors, such as embedding malware directly within Ethereum and BNB smart contracts to stealthily siphon cryptocurrencies.

Binance Coin price analysis gives a bullish prediction regarding ongoing market events. The coin’s price also increased to $889.5 as buying interest surged once again. If traders continue buying, the BNB price might see a further increase and break above $910. On the other hand, a failure in attracting buying demand might result in a correction. In such a case, the price of BNB might head toward the immediate support at $877. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $8,519.96 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB up? BNB found support, and the price moved toward $889.5, as bulls target $910. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has gained up to 1.43 percent of its value if looked at from an overall view. Will BNB reach $1000? The BNB price has already crossed $1000 in 2025, and buyers are holding strong to maintain the price above that level. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction , BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2026. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on futures trading expenditures with the token, which makes the Binance platform a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB, which supports the Binance ecosystem. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 by the end of 2026, according to the Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $8,519.96 by 2031. However, one must conduct his/her own research or seek professional financial advice.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coingecko Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May, while it marked a new ATH of $858.34 on July 28. In August, BNB broke its own record and discovered several new all-time highs when BNB increased to $899.77 on August 22, showing significant growth. On September 21, BNB reached the $1,079.07 mark. In October, it hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $1,369.99 and is trading near the $1,100 mark in November. By the end of November, the price of BNB declined below $800. In early December, BNB price triggered a strong bull run toward $900.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-15 09:50:09

This currency dynamic presents both challenges and opportunities for traders navigating volatile forex markets. As we approach year-end, understanding these movements becomes essential for anyone monitoring global financial trends. US Dollar Faces Pressure in Final Trading Week The greenback’s recent weakness reflects shifting market expectations about Federal Reserve policy. With inflation showing signs of moderation, traders are increasingly betting on earlier interest rate cuts than previously anticipated. This sentiment has pushed the dollar index lower against major currencies. Several factors contribute to the dollar’s softness: Declining Treasury yields as bond markets price in potential Fed easing Improved risk appetite reducing safe-haven demand for dollars Technical breakdowns in key dollar index support levels Euro Set for Impressive Annual Performance The common currency has demonstrated remarkable resilience throughout 2023, positioning itself for significant annual gains against the dollar. This strength stems from multiple supportive factors that have boosted eurozone assets. Factor Impact on Euro ECB’s Hawkish Stance Higher interest rate differentials Energy Price Stabilization Reduced economic headwinds Improved Economic Data Increased investor confidence Technical Breakouts Momentum-driven buying Currency Markets Brace for Critical Economic Data This week brings a flood of economic indicators that could reshape currency valuations. Market participants are particularly focused on inflation data and employment figures that will influence central bank decisions. Key data points to watch: US PCE inflation numbers – the Fed’s preferred gauge Eurozone inflation and unemployment figures Manufacturing PMI data from major economies Central bank speakers and meeting minutes Federal Reserve Policy Remains Market Driver The Federal Reserve’s approach to monetary policy continues to dominate currency market sentiment. Recent dovish comments from Fed officials have accelerated the dollar’s decline, creating opportunities in other major currencies. Market expectations have shifted dramatically: Traders now price in multiple rate cuts for 2024 Forward guidance has become more important than current rates Data dependency increases short-term volatility Economic Data Will Determine Next Moves The coming days will provide crucial information about global economic health. Strong data could revive dollar strength, while weak numbers might accelerate its decline. This creates a high-stakes environment for currency traders. Actionable insights for market participants: Monitor inflation surprises for immediate market reactions Watch bond market movements for currency direction clues Consider positioning for year-end portfolio rebalancing Prepare for potential liquidity changes during holiday periods FAQs: Understanding Currency Market Dynamics What’s driving the US dollar’s weakness? The dollar’s decline stems from expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates sooner than previously anticipated, reducing the currency’s yield advantage. Why is the euro performing so strongly? The European Central Bank has maintained a more hawkish stance than expected, while eurozone economic data has shown surprising resilience against earlier recession fears. How do currency markets affect cryptocurrency prices? Dollar weakness typically supports risk assets including cryptocurrencies, as investors seek alternatives to traditional currencies and benefit from improved global liquidity conditions. What should traders watch this week? Key inflation data from both the US and eurozone will be critical, along with any comments from Federal Reserve and European Central Bank officials. Can the dollar recover before year-end? While possible, the current momentum favors continued euro strength unless we see surprisingly strong US economic data or hawkish Fed surprises. Conclusion The currency markets stand at a critical juncture as we approach year-end. The US dollar’s softness against a resurgent euro reflects broader shifts in global monetary policy expectations. While short-term volatility is likely around key economic data releases, the underlying trend suggests continued challenges for the dollar and potential opportunities in European currencies. Successful navigation of these markets requires careful attention to central bank communications and economic indicators, along with disciplined risk management in this dynamic environment.

The top seven token unlocks scheduled between December 15 and 21 welcomes a whopping $199.42 million to the market, with Aster accounting for the largest single release at over $75 million. More than 568 million previously locked tokens are slated to enter crypto trading platforms during the week in total. The unlock schedule comes against the backdrop of a mild impact from Fed interest rate cuts on the broader digital currency market. Bitcoin and most digital assets are still trading in corrective territory, and the total market cap has dropped by 0.5% in the last 24 hours. A significant token supply addition could cause a deeper downturn if demand does not meet the new numbers in circulation. Aster leads token unlocks with $75 million Decentralized spot and perpetual trading exchange Aster will unlock 78.41 million ASTER tokens valued at $75.36 million. According to the data collected by aggregator CryptoRank, the release will take up 3.41% of the DEX token’s market capitalization, the largest unlock both in dollar terms and absolute token count for the week. The unlock comes on the heels of the start of Aster’s Double Harvest incentive campaign, Phase 5, which also runs this week. According to the DEX’s official X account announcement published on Sunday, users must hold at least 444 ASTER continuously throughout the period to qualify. Phase 5 rewards eligibility would require them to meet daily perpetual trading volume requirements in markets excluding Bitcoin and Ether. Aster also revealed that Phase 4’s qualified participants reached 6,895 and unlocked a $1 million reward pool. The rewards from the recently concluded program will reportedly be distributed to Aster Perpetual accounts within seven business days. LayerZero and Arbitrum to add $57 million in upcoming release LayerZero’s ZRO token ranks second among the week’s largest unlocks, with the cross-chain interoperability project scheduled to release 24.68 million ZRO tokens next Saturday. The unlocked amount is worth $37.42 million, which is 2.47% of the total token supply and almost 10.3% of its market valuation. Arbitrum follows closely behind, with its ARB token scheduled for an unlock on Tuesday. The Ethereum layer-2 network will release 92.63 million ARB tokens valued at $19.78 million, which is 0.93% of total supply and 1.65% of Arbitrum’s market capitalization. Vana’s VANA token comes fourth with its December 16 release of 6.12 million tokens worth $17.41 million. Yooldo Esports will follow on the 19th with an unlock of 41.91 million ESPORTS tokens valued at $17.22 million. The final two unlocks belong to stablecoin protocol STBL and Merlin Chain’s MERL token. STBL will unlock 288.39 million tokens, valued at $16.12 million. Although the dollar value is lower than several peers, the unlock is 57.7% of STBL’s market capitalization, the highest proportional release among the seven projects. Merlin Chain is scheduled to unlock 36.14 million MERL tokens on the same day as Yooldo Esports. The release is valued at $16.11 million and will take the circulating supply to 1.72% of its total and about 3.32% of market capitalization. Aster price seeks rebound after 3% weekly drop ASTER’s price action has been on the red lane in the week leading to its much awaited unlock, shedding 3% of its values and trading at $0.93 at the time of this reporting. The token had surged to about $1.41 on November 19, then it entered a correctional phase that dragged it back to $0.88 by the start of December. $ASTER You can see what the MMs are drawing on the Aster chart.

Early XRP Investors See the Same Setup in This $0.035 New Altcoin,https://timestabloid.com/best-crypto-to-buy-ahead-of-q1-2026-early-xrp-investors-see-the-same/,"Some analysts believe the market is reaching a point where established major assets are slowing while early-stage protocols with real utility begin to attract rotating capital. Market commentators suggest a pattern forming that is reminiscent of cycles seen in the past, where mature tokens show resistance and newer projects gather attention ahead of major product milestones. Early investor sentiment indicates that many who once backed assets like Ripple (XRP) and Solana (SOL) are now watching a smaller DeFi project priced at $0.035 with notable interest as Q1 2026 draws closer. Ripple’s Market Position Ripple’s XRP has long been one of the most widely held cryptocurrencies worldwide. It built early momentum with fast settlement aims and strong community backing, helping it secure a multibillion-dollar market cap and broad exchange support. Early investors saw significant gains as adoption increased and narrative strength grew during its breakout years. Today the price action tells a different story. Analysts tracking crypto charts note that XRP consistently struggles near key resistance zones, with everyday price movement appearing constrained compared to past cycles. Volume patterns also reflect weaker momentum. Because XRP already occupies a large market cap, rapid advances like those seen in its early years are harder to achieve without enormous capital inflows. Some forecasts project modest gains for XRP over coming quarters rather than sharp expansions, which has shifted some attention toward assets with structural growth potential rather than large-cap stagnation. Solana’s Early Surge Solana (SOL) became another standout for early believers. At one point it posted remarkable multi-fold gains as its ecosystem expanded quickly. High throughput, low transaction costs, and ecosystem development made it one of the most-discussed smart contract platforms during its early breakout. That surge created deep liquidity, strong exchange presence, and a broad base of holders. However, Solana today faces resistance in its price action. Analysts say trend strength is weakening and key resistance levels near its current trading range have held against multiple breakout attempts. Some models now suggest lower upside expectations unless broader market conditions improve significantly or new catalysts emerge. The large market cap that once signaled strength now acts as a headwind for explosive returns. This has encouraged some early Solana believers to evaluate younger projects that resemble early SOL setups but remain in earlier stages of adoption. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a DeFi lending protocol built for predictable borrowing and lending dynamics. The platform centers around two interconnected markets. In the Peer-to-Contract environment, users supply assets into a liquidity pool and receive mtTokens. As borrowers repay interest, these mtTokens grow in redeemable value. For example, a user supplying ETH receives mtETH, which becomes redeemable for more ETH as interest flows in. This creates a transparent yield structure tied to actual usage rather than inflation. The Peer-to-Peer environment complements this by letting borrowers post collateral and choose loan terms while lenders select which requests to fund. Borrow rates adjust based on utilization, and stable rates lock at the moment of borrowing. Loan-to-Value limits and liquidation thresholds help ensure safe borrowing behavior. Mutuum Finance has raised $19.30M and now counts more than 18,400 holders. It trades at a mid-range price of $0.035 and is currently well into its early-stage allocation. Phase 6 of the presale is now more than 85% allocated, showing strong participation from early-stage users. The protocol confirmed on its official X account that the first version of the system will launch on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. This includes the Liquidity Pool, mtToken system, Debt Token and Liquidator Bot, with support for ETH and USDT as initial assets. What Early XRP and SOL Investors See in MUTM Investors who backed Ripple in its early phases often point to clear product milestones, defined utility, and expanding usage as key indicators of long-term growth potential. Many early Solana holders cite fast ecosystem expansion, growing developer activity, and deepening liquidity as markers that signaled broad adoption. Mutuum Finance is beginning to show some of the same structural traits in its early cycle. First, its mechanics tie value capture to real usage through lending and borrowing activity. Unlike meme-driven tokens, it offers a defined economic model where yield is earned through active protocol usage. Second, the roadmap clarity mirrors what many early XRP investors valued. Mutuum Finance has outlined a clear path to V1 testing and subsequent stages, reducing uncertainty about what comes next. Third, early audience growth reflects expanding interest. With tens of thousands of holders and significant capital committed ahead of mainnet activity, the social and financial signals align with rotation patterns observed in past cycles. These dynamics are why some top crypto watchers suggest that MUTM is forming a setup similar to early Ripple and early Solana patterns, where structural adoption and clear milestones attracted capital ahead of wider recognition. Stage Momentum and Community Engagement Phase 6 has been moving quickly, with more than 98% allocated already. The next stage will raise the token price again, which has increased urgency among investors who want to enter before the shift. Many long-term participants see acceleration in allocation as a sign that broader community demand is growing. Security has been a core principle from the start. Mutuum Finance completed its CertiK audit with a 90/100 Token Scan score, which is considered strong for a project still in early stages. Halborn Security is conducting an independent review of the finalized code, adding another layer of assurance. The team also launched a $50K bug bounty to encourage external vetting and strengthen the protocol’s defenses before mainnet testing. The community environment includes a 24-hour leaderboard that rewards the top daily contributor with $500 in MUTM. This helps maintain consistent engagement and keeps holders connected during development phases. Additionally, support for card payments makes it easier for new users to participate without needing exchange transfers or complex setups. Ripple and Solana both carved out major growth paths in their early years because they offered clear utility and expanding usage. Today, some of the capital that once fueled those rapid rises is taking a fresh look at newer DeFi platforms with structured mechanics and tangible adoption potential. Mutuum Finance is emerging as one of the projects capturing that attention. With a strong roadmap, clear mechanics, rising allocation, security foundations and growing community engagement, analysts say it stands out among the many new crypto names people are tracking ahead of Q1 2026.

In a startling prediction that’s sending shockwaves through Asian currency markets, Bank of America has forecast the USD/KRW exchange rate could surge to 1,400 – a level that would mark the Won’s weakest position against the dollar since 2012. For cryptocurrency traders watching fiat currency volatility, this development represents both warning and opportunity as traditional finance faces unprecedented stress. Why Is Bank of America Forecasting a Korean Won Collapse? The Bank of America forecast isn’t based on a single factor, but rather a convergence of multiple economic pressures creating what analysts describe as a “perfect storm” for the Korean currency. The primary driver remains the stark policy divergence between the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Korea, creating what currency strategists call “the great monetary policy divide.” Consider these critical factors pushing the USD/KRW pair higher: Interest Rate Differential: The Federal Reserve maintains restrictive policy while other central banks pivot Trade Balance Pressures: South Korea’s export-dependent economy faces global demand slowdown Capital Outflows: Foreign investors pulling funds from Korean markets Geopolitical Risk Premium: Regional tensions adding currency risk The Federal Reserve Policy Impact on Asian Currencies The Federal Reserve ‘s continued hawkish stance represents the single largest external pressure on the Korean Won. While many expected the Fed to pivot toward rate cuts in 2024, persistent inflation data has forced a reconsideration of this timeline. The resulting strength in the US dollar creates what currency traders call “dollar dominance” – a phenomenon where emerging market currencies face systematic pressure regardless of their domestic fundamentals. This table illustrates the interest rate divergence creating the USD/KRW pressure: Central Bank Current Policy Rate Expected 2024 Moves Impact on Currency US Federal Reserve 5.25%-5.50% Potential hikes or extended pause Dollar strengthening Bank of Korea 3.50% Potential cuts if growth slows Won weakening pressure Policy Differential 175-200 basis points Could widen further Direct USD/KRW exchange rate impact Historical Context: When Did USD/KRW Last Hit 1,400? To understand the significance of Bank of America’s Korean Won forecast, we must look back to 2012 when the currency last traded at these levels. The global financial crisis aftermath, European debt crisis contagion, and slowing Chinese growth created similar conditions of risk aversion and dollar strength. However, today’s context differs in crucial ways: 2012 Context: Post-crisis recovery, coordinated global stimulus, lower inflation 2024 Context: Post-pandemic adjustments, divergent policies, higher structural inflation Key Difference: South Korea’s debt levels are significantly higher today Similarity: Both periods feature strong dollar and risk-off sentiment What Does a Weaker Korean Won Mean for Global Markets? The USD/KRW exchange rate reaching 1,400 wouldn’t occur in isolation. Currency markets operate as interconnected systems, where significant moves in major pairs create ripple effects across global finance. For cryptocurrency observers, these traditional finance tremors often precede digital asset volatility as capital seeks alternative stores of value. Consider these potential cascading effects: Asian Currency Contagion: Other regional currencies facing similar pressures Export Competitiveness Shift: Korean exporters gaining price advantage Inflation Import: Higher costs for dollar-denominated imports Capital Market Impact: Foreign investment flows adjusting to currency risk Bank of Korea’s Limited Options in Currency Defense Facing the Bank of America forecast of a plunging Won, South Korea’s central bank finds itself in a difficult position. Traditional currency defense tools – interest rate hikes, foreign exchange intervention, and verbal guidance – each come with significant trade-offs in the current economic environment. The Bank of Korea’s dilemma centers on these conflicting priorities: Currency Stability vs. Economic Growth: Rate hikes to support the Won could slow already fragile growth Inflation Control vs. Export Support: A weaker Won boosts exports but imports inflation Autonomy vs. Global Forces: Domestic policy limited by Federal Reserve decisions Short-term Defense vs. Long-term Reserves: FX intervention depletes valuable reserves Cryptocurrency Implications of Traditional Currency Volatility For the cryptocurrency community watching the USD/KRW drama unfold, traditional currency instability often serves as a catalyst for digital asset exploration. Historical patterns suggest that when fiat currencies experience extreme volatility or loss of confidence, capital begins exploring alternatives – with cryptocurrencies frequently benefiting from this search for stability outside traditional systems. The Korean Won situation presents several cryptocurrency-relevant dynamics: Capital Flight Channels: Some Korean investors may seek crypto exposure as Won hedge Remittance Innovation: Weaker Won could boost crypto-based cross-border transfers Stablecoin Demand: Dollar-pegged stablecoins gaining appeal during Won weakness Regulatory Attention: Currency crisis often brings increased scrutiny of alternatives Actionable Insights for Traders and Investors Whether you’re trading the USD/KRW exchange rate directly or monitoring its implications for broader markets, several strategic considerations emerge from Bank of America’s analysis. The key is recognizing that currency forecasts represent probabilities, not certainties, and that market reactions often overshoot fundamental justifications. Consider these approaches to the Korean Won forecast: Hedging Strategies: Multinationals with Korean exposure reviewing currency risk management Portfolio Rebalancing: Investors reducing Won-denominated asset allocations Correlation Monitoring: Watching relationships between Asian currencies and risk assets Scenario Planning: Preparing for both the forecast realization and potential reversal Beyond the Forecast: Structural Challenges for the Korean Won The Bank of America forecast highlights immediate pressures, but longer-term structural factors also challenge the Korean currency’s stability. Demographic trends, technological competition, and energy dependency create persistent headwinds that won’t disappear regardless of short-term Federal Reserve policy adjustments. These structural factors deserve attention: Aging Population: Shrinking workforce affecting growth potential and fiscal stability Technology Competition: Korean semiconductor dominance facing increased challenges Energy Import Dependency: Nearly all energy needs met through imports, creating persistent trade deficits Geopolitical Positioning: Balancing relationships between major powers creates constant uncertainty Frequently Asked Questions What specific factors does Bank of America cite for their USD/KRW forecast? Bank of America analysts point to the policy divergence between the Federal Reserve and Bank of Korea , combined with South Korea’s deteriorating trade balance and foreign capital outflows. The forecast assumes the Fed maintains restrictive policy while Korean growth concerns limit the BoK’s ability to match US rates. How reliable have Bank of America’s previous currency forecasts been? Bank of America ‘s currency research team has generally strong predictive accuracy, particularly on major trends. However, like all forecasts, timing and exact levels involve significant uncertainty. Their previous calls on Asian currencies during periods of dollar strength have shown reasonable accuracy. What would trigger the Bank of Korea to intervene in currency markets? The Bank of Korea typically intervenes when movements become “disorderly” or threaten financial stability. They monitor volatility metrics, one-way positioning, and potential systemic risk. Intervention becomes more likely if the Won’s decline accelerates rapidly rather than gradually. How does the USD/KRW forecast affect other Asian currencies? Currency markets exhibit correlation, particularly within regions. A significant USD/KRW exchange rate move often pressures other Asian currencies through competitive devaluation concerns and portfolio rebalancing. However, individual country fundamentals create differentiation in the magnitude of impact. What are the implications for cryptocurrency markets? Traditional currency instability often increases interest in cryptocurrency alternatives, particularly in markets with capital controls or currency volatility. Korean investors have historically shown strong crypto adoption, suggesting potential increased activity if the Won forecast materializes. The Bottom Line: A Critical Juncture for the Korean Won The Bank of America forecast of the USD/KRW exchange rate hitting 1,400 represents more than just another currency prediction – it signals a potential inflection point for South Korea’s economic positioning. The Korean Won at 12-year lows would reflect not just temporary market dynamics but potentially deeper structural challenges that require policy responses beyond conventional currency defense. For global markets, the situation serves as a case study in the limits of monetary sovereignty in an interconnected world. For cryptocurrency observers, it provides yet another data point in the growing narrative of traditional financial system stress. And for South Korea, it represents an economic test that will require balancing immediate stability concerns with long-term competitiveness preservation. The coming months will reveal whether the Federal Reserve policy path validates Bank of America’s warning or whether unexpected developments alter the currency trajectory. What remains certain is that the USD/KRW pair will serve as a crucial barometer of both regional economic health and global financial system stability.

As of press time on December 15, Bitcoin’s hash rate stood at 876.4 EH/s, down from about 930.06 EH/s on December 14, marking a day-over-day decline of roughly 5.8%. On a weekly basis, the pullback is far steeper, with the hash rate falling from around 1.27 ZH/s, or 1,270 EH/s, about a week earlier, a near 31% contraction in network computing power. Bitcoin one-week hashrate. Source: CoinWarz China’s renewed crackdown Indeed, market participants attribute the move to a concentrated regional shutdown rather than to weather-related issues or isolated hardware failures. In this line, attention has centered on China’s Xinjiang region after Jianping “Jack” Kong, founder of Nano Labs and former co-chairman of ASIC manufacturer Canaan, linked the hash rate drop to a fresh enforcement wave targeting Bitcoin mining operations. In an X post on December 15, Kong said an estimated 400,000 mining machines were shut down in a short period, removing a significant amount of hash power from the network. 算力较昨天掉了100E，跌了8%，按照平均250T，至少关了40万台 机器关了 https://t.co/cCg1F0DXOF — Jack孔@Nano Labs(NA)🇭🇰 (@punk8185) December 15, 2025 Notably, Chinese crypto media have reported coordinated shutdowns at large mining facilities in Xinjiang, suggesting a renewed local crackdown rather than a new policy shift. Although China’s mining ban dates to 2021, enforcement has remained uneven, with several industrial parks reportedly affected at once. The estimated shutdown, approximately 400,000 ASIC miners producing roughly 80–100 EH/s, corresponds to the recent decline in network hash rate. Major mining pools have also reported high double-digit week-on-week drops, consistent with a large regional outage. In the near term, the hash rate drop may slow block production and boost miner profitability. Over time, Bitcoin’s difficulty adjustment will rebalance the network, restoring block times toward the ten-minute average.

The move, reported by The Wall Street Journal , comes as Wall Street deepens its push into tokenization following new US legislation that clarified the regulatory framework for digital assets tied to traditional finance. First fund seeded with JPMorgan capital The banking group’s $4 trillion asset-management arm is seeding the fund with $100 million of its own capital before opening it to outside investors. The fund, known as My OnChain Net Yield Fund, or MONY, will be available to qualified investors from Tuesday. MONY is supported by JPMorgan’s tokenization platform, Kinexys Digital Assets, and is structured as a private fund. Eligibility is limited to individuals with at least $5 million in investable assets and institutions with a minimum of $25 million, with a $1 million investment threshold. Investors can subscribe through JPMorgan’s Morgan Money portal, receiving digital tokens representing their holdings directly into crypto wallets. How the fund works on blockchain Like traditional money-market funds, MONY invests in baskets of short-term, low-risk debt securities that typically offer higher yields than bank deposits. The fund pays interest and accrues dividends daily. Investors can subscribe to and redeem shares using either cash or USDC, the dollar-pegged stablecoin issued by Circle Internet Group. The use of stablecoins allows transactions to settle directly on blockchain infrastructure without moving funds back into the traditional banking system. JPMorgan says this structure gives investors exposure to familiar cash-management products while keeping assets fully on-chain. Regulation spurs tokenization push Interest in tokenized finance has accelerated since the passage of the Genius Act earlier this year, which established a regulatory framework for stablecoins. The legislation has encouraged banks and asset managers to explore blockchain-based versions of established products. “There is a massive amount of interest from clients around tokenization,” said John Donohue, head of global liquidity at JP Morgan Asset Management. “And we expect to be a leader in this space and work with clients to make sure that we have a product lineup that allows them to have the choices that we have in traditional money-market funds on blockchain.” Tokenization is seen as a way to reduce settlement times, lower administrative costs, and improve transparency for asset managers. Money funds meet digital assets Money-market funds, a cornerstone of cash management since the 1970s, have grown in popularity amid higher interest rates. Assets in money funds stand at about $7.7 trillion, up from $6.9 trillion at the start of 2025, according to the Investment Company Institute. At the same time, the stablecoin market has expanded rapidly, with total market capitalization exceeding $300 billion, according to CoinGecko. Tokenized money-market funds appeal to crypto-native investors because they allow idle stablecoin balances to earn yield, addressing a long-standing drawback of holding cash-like assets on blockchain networks. Competition heats up among asset managers JPMorgan’s move follows similar initiatives by major rivals. BlackRock operates the largest tokenized money-market fund, with more than $1.8 billion in assets. Goldman Sachs and Bank of New York Mellon have also announced partnerships to tokenize money-market fund ownership for institutional clients. Beyond money funds, JPMorgan has recently tokenized a private-equity fund for wealthy clients, while trading platforms such as Robinhood, Kraken, and Gemini have launched tokenized stocks and exchange-traded funds for non-US investors. The launch of MONY underscores how traditional finance is increasingly converging with blockchain infrastructure, as banks test whether digital rails can support some of the world’s most conventional investment products.

Standard Chartered reportedly served as the sole global coordinator and arranger on the deal, spearheading the structuring, execution, and distribution of Doha Bank’s $150 million digital bond. Doha Bank’s $150M digital bond The deal comes at a time when a growing number of banks and regulators across the Middle East and Asia have been adopting permissioned distributed ledger technology (DLT) platforms for digital bond issuance to ensure regulatory control. Of course, that does not mean public blockchains are being completely ignored; selective use cases, such as DBS’s tokenized structured notes on Ethereum , have shown that those blockchains are also being deployed where investor access, programmability, and market design make openness viable. “Doha Bank’s debut digital bond issuance underscores the tangible, real-world efficiencies that cutting-edge digital infrastructure is delivering for capital markets, and the increasing appetite among our clients for this next-gen capability and execution,” said Salman Ansari, the bank’s global head of capital markets. Other regional banks have seen similar digital bond success Doha Bank’s deal comes after similar significant milestones, such as Qatar National Bank’s (QNB) $500 million digital bond issuance, which occurred in November 2025. The deal is being tagged the largest transaction of its kind by a financial institution in the Middle East and Africa, and the three-year floating-rate bond was issued via HSBC’s Orion platform, a leading blockchain-based digital assets system operated under the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). According to QNB , the move is a step towards adopting digital asset technologies across the region and aligns with its strategy to diversify funding sources and tap into new markets via innovative digital financing tools. It also added that the deal is proof of the strong confidence global investors have in QNB’s financial position and long-term strategy. HSBC was the sole bookrunner on the transaction, and the bond was structured with support from leading international law firms, which highlighted what QNB described as a high level of governance and regulatory rigour. QNB said the collaboration – which combines HSBC’s global expertise with the bank’s strong regional presence – sets a precedent for digital assets to play a central role in the financial landscape of Qatar and the wider region. The digital bonds were issued under QNB’s Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN) program will also ultimately be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which will also facilitate licensing for trading digital debt notes. Global investors who want to access the bonds can do so via HKMA accounts, Euroclear, Clearstream, or by joining the HSBC Orion platform directly.

The fund being launched by JPMorgan Asset Management, which oversees about $4 trillion in assets, will operate on the Ethereum ( ETH ) blockchain, The Wall Street Journal reported on December 15 Notably, the fund will be seeded with $100 million of JPMorgan’s own capital before opening to external investors, with external investors able to access the fund on December 16. The product, known as the My OnChain Net Yield Fund, is a private fund built on the bank’s Kinexys Digital Assets tokenization platform. It is open to qualified investors, including individuals with at least $5 million in investable assets and institutions with at least $25 million. The minimum investment is $1 million. “There is a massive amount of interest from clients around tokenization. And we expect to be a leader in this space and work with clients to make sure that we have a product lineup that allows them to have the choices that we have in traditional money-market funds on blockchain, ,” said John Donohue, head of global liquidity at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. Opportunities from the Genius Act The launch comes as Wall Street accelerates its move into tokenization following the passage of the Genius Act earlier this year. The legislation established a regulatory framework for stablecoins and has encouraged financial firms to explore blockchain-based versions of traditional assets, including funds, equities, bonds, and real-world assets. Investors can access the tokenized money market fund through JPMorgan’s Morgan Money platform. Participation results in the issuance of digital tokens held in investors’ crypto wallets, representing their interest in the fund. Notably, the fund operates in line with conventional money market structures, investing in short-term, low-risk debt instruments that typically offer higher yields than standard bank deposits. Interest accrues daily, and dividends are calculated on an ongoing basis. Subscriptions and redemptions can be made using either cash or USDC, the U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin issued by Circle. With this launch, JPMorgan becomes one of the most prominent global banks to bring a core cash-management product fully on-chain, underscoring growing institutional demand for blockchain-based financial infrastructure.

According to Dow Jones Newswires , Exor, the family’s holding company, said Saturday it has no intention of selling its 65.4% stake to the El Salvador-based crypto firm or any third party, ending what would have been one of European football’s most audacious takeover attempts this year. Tether submitted its formal proposal on Friday , seeking to purchase Exor’s controlling position and subsequently launch a public tender for all remaining shares at an undisclosed price. As per Reuters , Juventus shares surged more than 12% Monday morning, reaching their highest level since November 25, after the rejection implied a 21% premium to Friday’s close despite the family’s refusal to negotiate. @Tether_to has launched an all-cash bid to acquire Italy’s @juventusfcen , an offer that was reportedly swiftly turned down. #Tether #Crypto https://t.co/4iTBXWjo5V — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 13, 2025 Century-Old Legacy Defends Against Crypto Ambition Exor’s board emphasized that Juventus represents more than a commercial asset for the Agnelli dynasty, which has maintained ownership for over a century. “ Juventus is a storied and successful club, of which Exor and the Agnelli family are the stable and proud shareholders for over a century, and they remain fully committed to the club, ” the holding company stated, closing the door on further discussions. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino positioned the rejected offer as a long-term commitment rooted in his personal connection to the Turin-based Serie A club. “ As a boy, I learned what commitment, resilience, and responsibility meant by watching Juventus face success and adversity with dignity, ” Ardoino said, adding that Tether was prepared to support the club with stable capital across a lengthy investment horizon. The stablecoin issuer framed its proposal as a strategic move to help Juventus navigate a rapidly changing global sports and media landscape. Despite the rebuff, Tether maintains significant influence within Juventus after quietly purchasing an initial stake in February and expanding holdings beyond 10% by April. The company successfully placed deputy investment chief Zachary Lyons and Francesco Garino on Juventus’s board in October, with shareholders approving Garino’s appointment last month. Private Equity Reshapes European Football Landscape Tether’s rejected bid arrives amid accelerating private-equity interest in European football clubs, as they seek to capitalize on lucrative media rights and player transfer markets. According to Newswires, Apollo Global Management agreed last month to acquire majority control of Spanish club Atletico de Madrid, while RedBird Capital purchased AC Milan for $1.2 billion in 2022 and Oaktree Capital seized FC Inter Milan last year. Financial groups have rushed into European football as clubs generate increasing revenue from international broadcasting deals and player transactions. Juventus, valued at roughly €944 million, represents a particularly attractive target given its status as Italy’s most successful club with a global fanbase and established commercial infrastructure. However, crypto partnerships have drawn sharp criticism when clubs partner with questionable firms. FC Barcelona faced backlash in November after signing a three-year sponsorship deal with Zero-Knowledge Proof , a blockchain startup registered in Samoa with minimal social media presence. FC Barcelona draws backlash over sponsorship with obscure crypto firm ZKP amid concerns about transparency and financial desperation. #Barcelona #Crypto https://t.co/kvkBEK0a5j — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 28, 2025 The club later distanced itself from ZKP’s FCB token, clarifying it had “no connection whatsoever” to the digital asset. Sports crypto adoption is growing. Paris Saint-Germain became the first sports entity to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy in May, while football accounted for 43% of crypto and digital asset sponsorships during the 2024/25 season, up 64% year-over-year. Tether’s Aggressive Expansion Across Multiple Sectors Tether’s broader expansion push has accelerated dramatically across multiple sectors, with the company on track to generate approximately $15 billion this year from its $183.8 billion USDT market capitalization . Recent reports also suggest Tether may seek $20 billion in new capital for a 3% ownership stake, establishing a valuation near $500 billion that would approach Mastercard while eclipsing Netflix and Samsung. The firm has simultaneously deployed approximately $1.5 billion in commodity trade lending across oil, cotton, and agricultural markets while expanding its gold reserves beyond $12 billion to support this aggressive diversification strategy beyond its core stablecoin operations.

Key Takeaways: Doha Bank completed a $150 million digital bond with instant T+0 settlement. Standard Chartered led the deal using Euroclear’s regulated DLT platform. The issuance highlights growing adoption of digital bonds in the Gulf. The notes were listed on the London Stock Exchange’s International Securities Market and achieved same-day, or T+0, settlement through Euroclear’s Digital Financial Market Infrastructure (D-FMI), according to a Monday announcement . The transaction marks one of Qatar’s earliest digitally native US dollar bond issuances and reflects a growing push across the Gulf region to modernize capital markets infrastructure. Standard Chartered Leads Doha Bank’s Digital Bond Issuance Standard Chartered acted as sole global coordinator and sole arranger, overseeing the structuring, execution, and distribution of the bond. Unlike traditional securities, which typically settle one or two days after trading, Doha Bank’s digital notes were issued, allocated, and settled in real time. Euroclear’s D-FMI platform, a permissioned distributed ledger operated by a central securities depository, handled issuance and settlement while remaining fully integrated with existing market standards and post-trade systems. Citi served as issuing and paying agent on the transaction. Doha Bank said the issuance supports its broader funding strategy by diversifying sources of capital and expanding its investor base. Sheikh Abdulrahman Bin Fahad Al-Thani, the bank’s group chief executive, said the transaction demonstrates how digital infrastructure can improve efficiency and market access while reinforcing Qatar’s position as a regional financial hub. He added that the deal aligns with Qatar Central Bank initiatives aimed at strengthening the resilience and competitiveness of the country’s capital markets. Doha Bank completes a $150 million digital bond issuance using Euroclear’s DLT platform. The bond settled instantly (T+0) on a permissioned distributed ledger signaling the region’s growing preference for regulated, institution-grade digital bond infrastructure. — Moon Republic (@MoonRepublic_io) December 15, 2025 Standard Chartered said the bond highlights rising institutional demand for digital issuance that delivers measurable operational gains. Salman Ansari, the bank’s global head of capital markets, said the deal shows how regulated digital infrastructure is moving beyond pilot projects and into live market activity. The issuance also reflects a broader industry trend favoring permissioned distributed ledger systems over public blockchains for tokenized debt. Regulated platforms such as Euroclear’s D-FMI allow issuers to benefit from features like instant settlement and automated recordkeeping while preserving legal finality, controlled access, and compatibility with custody and clearing frameworks used by institutional investors. Same-Day Settlement Works Within Existing Market Structures Euroclear said the transaction demonstrates that same-day settlement can be achieved without disrupting existing market structures. “Equally important, integration with traditional secondary-market services and trading venues ensures that investors retain access to liquidity,” Sebastien Danloy, Chief Business Officer at Euroclear, said. As reported, Mastercard is in late-stage talks to acquire crypto infrastructure firm Zerohash for between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, a deal that would deepen the payments giant’s push into stablecoins and on-chain settlement. If completed, the acquisition would give Mastercard greater control over how fiat and digital assets settle across its network as payments firms move toward always-on, 24/7 money. The talks come amid intensifying competition, with Stripe’s recent purchase of stablecoin firm Bridge and Coinbase’s reported interest in BVNK highlighting a broader race among payment providers to secure the infrastructure needed as stablecoins shift from trading platforms into everyday payments.

As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, investors are constantly searching for the next big opportunity. Among the numerous projects vying for attention, Hedera Hashgraph stands out with its unique consensus mechanism and enterprise-focused approach. The burning question on every trader’s mind: Can HBAR reach $0.5 in the coming years? This comprehensive analysis examines technical indicators, adoption metrics, and market trends to provide a realistic Hedera price prediction from 2025 through 2030. Understanding Hedera Hashgraph and HBAR Before diving into price predictions, it’s crucial to understand what makes Hedera Hashgraph different. Unlike traditional blockchain networks, Hedera uses a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure called Hashgraph consensus. This technology offers several advantages including high throughput (10,000+ transactions per second), low fees, and fair ordering of transactions. The native cryptocurrency HBAR serves dual purposes: securing the network through staking and paying for transaction fees and services. Current HBAR Price Analysis and Market Position As of our latest analysis, HBAR trades within a specific range that reflects both market sentiment and fundamental developments. Several factors influence its current valuation: Network adoption by enterprises and developers Partnership announcements with major corporations Overall cryptocurrency market trends and Bitcoin dominance Regulatory developments affecting the broader crypto space Technical upgrades and roadmap progress Hedera Price Prediction 2025: The Foundation Year Our 2025 Hedera price prediction considers both bullish and bearish scenarios. If current adoption trends continue and the network achieves key milestones, we could see significant price appreciation. However, market volatility and regulatory uncertainty could temper gains. Key factors to watch include: Scenario Price Range Catalysts Bullish $0.15 – $0.25 Major enterprise adoption, positive regulation Base Case $0.10 – $0.18 Steady growth, continued partnerships Bearish $0.05 – $0.12 Market downturn, adoption delays HBAR Price Forecast 2026-2027: The Growth Phase The period between 2026 and 2027 could represent a crucial growth phase for HBAR. By this time, several network upgrades should be fully implemented, and enterprise adoption could reach critical mass. Our analysis suggests that if Hedera maintains its technological edge and continues expanding its ecosystem, the cryptocurrency forecast becomes increasingly positive. The $0.3 level represents a significant psychological and technical barrier that, if broken, could trigger accelerated momentum. Will HBAR Hit $0.5 by 2030? The Ultimate Target The million-dollar question: Can HBAR reach $0.5 by 2030? Our comprehensive analysis suggests this target is ambitious but achievable under specific conditions. For this to occur, Hedera would need to: Capture significant market share in the enterprise blockchain space Maintain technological superiority over competing networks Benefit from favorable regulatory frameworks globally Achieve widespread developer adoption and dApp creation Experience increased institutional investment and staking participation A $0.5 HBAR price would represent substantial growth from current levels and would require both network success and favorable market conditions. While possible, investors should maintain realistic expectations and consider this a best-case scenario rather than a guaranteed outcome. Factors That Could Influence HBAR Price Trajectory Several critical factors will determine whether our Hedera price prediction materializes: Enterprise Adoption: Real-world usage by corporations remains Hedera’s primary value proposition Network Performance: Maintaining high throughput and low fees as usage grows Competitive Landscape: How Hedera fares against Ethereum, Solana, and other smart contract platforms Regulatory Environment: Clear regulations could boost institutional participation Tokenomics: Release schedule and circulating supply dynamics Risks and Challenges for Hedera Hashgraph While the potential is significant, investors must acknowledge the risks. The cryptocurrency market remains highly volatile, and even promising projects can face unexpected challenges. Technical hurdles, competitive pressures, regulatory crackdowns, or broader economic factors could all impact HBAR’s price trajectory. Diversification and thorough research remain essential for any cryptocurrency investment. Investment Strategies for HBAR Based on our Hedera price prediction, several investment approaches could prove effective: Dollar-Cost Averaging: Regular purchases to average entry prices Staking: Earning rewards while supporting network security Portfolio Allocation: Determining appropriate HBAR exposure based on risk tolerance Technical Analysis: Using chart patterns and indicators for entry and exit points Conclusion: The Path Forward for HBAR Our comprehensive analysis suggests that while reaching $0.5 by 2030 represents an ambitious target for HBAR, it falls within the realm of possibility given favorable conditions. The Hedera Hashgraph network possesses unique technological advantages and a clear enterprise focus that could drive substantial adoption. However, investors should approach this cryptocurrency forecast with balanced expectations, recognizing both the potential rewards and inherent risks. The coming years will be crucial in determining whether Hedera can translate its technological promise into widespread adoption and corresponding price appreciation.

Following a period of gains, certain digital currencies are now positioned for potential growth. This article will uncover which coins show promise and are worth keeping an eye on in the current market landscape. Stellar Holds Steady, Eyes on Breaking Key Levels Source: tradingview Stellar (XLM) is currently priced between two dimes and a quarter. It has seen a slight dip of about 2% over the last week and more than a tenth decline over a month. With the nearest resistance just below twenty-eight cents, Stellar could climb roughly 10% from its current range if it breaks past this. The second resistance level is a bit over thirty cents, suggesting a potential 20% jump from its present average if it can maintain upward momentum. However, the current RSI hints at a neutral market sentiment, which means buyers aren't overly aggressive right now. Stellar's journey seems balanced between caution and potential growth. Title: Sui (SUI) Eyes Recovery from Recent Lows Source: tradingview Sui (SUI) currently trades between one and a half and almost two dollars. It faces resistance at just over one and three-quarters and further resistance near two dollars. Support is nearby at around one and a half, with stronger support closer to one and a quarter dollars. Over the past month, it dropped by nearly ten percent, with a deeper fall over six months. The ten and one hundred-day moving averages are fairly close, hinting at possible stability. The RSI hovers below forty-five, suggesting some room for upward movement. If momentum shifts, Sui could rally towards the two-dollar mark, a rise of over twenty percent from its lower current price. Hedera (HBAR): Will It Bounce Back After Recent Declines? Source: tradingview Hedera (HBAR) is dancing in a range between eleven and fourteen cents. It's facing some challenges, with its price slipping over eight percent in a week and more than twenty percent in a month. The nearest barrier is at fifteen cents, while solid ground rests slightly below ten cents. If it pushes past resistance, it might aim for eighteen cents, marking a roughly thirty-three percent rise from its high point now. With a Relative Strength Index below fifty, there's room for potential upward movement. Yet, with current trends showing a dip, the coin needs a good push to change direction. Eyes are on Hedera, watching for its next move in the crypto dance. Conclusion In a period of market pullback, attention turns to potential opportunities. XLM, HBAR, and SUI attract particular interest for their distinctive features and potential for growth. Monitoring these coins closely during this phase could reveal promising entry points. This could present a chance for strategic investments and potential gains. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The analyst noted that XRP must hold the $2 level to avoid a decline toward $1.2. The analyst shared a multi-month chart that highlights the criticality of this zone. The message arrives as XRP trades just above that threshold, with the market showing little margin for error. The timing is notable, as XRP has spent December 2025 consolidating after a prolonged decline from its peak in July . Momentum has slowed, but the chart Martinez shared suggests this pause carries weight beyond the short term. The $2 level has acted as a structural pivot since XRP surpassed it in late 2024. The current price action suggests XRP is once again being forced to prove whether that support still commands buyer conviction. $XRP must hold $2 to avoid a drop toward $1.20. pic.twitter.com/8mh1ZIF8jk — Ali (@alicharts) December 13, 2025 The Current Market Position XRP entered December above $2 after weeks of decline from its October highs. Sellers controlled momentum in late October and through November. The pullback erased much of the late summer rally. Even so, XRP has not lost its long-term structure. The token continues to trade above the crucial $2 support. In December 2025, XRP has been struggling around $2. The asset briefly dipped below this level but has stabilized. That behavior mirrors earlier periods of consolidation. Volatility has narrowed, and the market appears to be waiting. The asset’s price history matters. Each time XRP returned to this region, buyers defended it. The chart shows several reactions in the same area. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What Needs to Happen Next? XRP needs to hold $2 on higher time frames. Sideways movement above the level would signal acceptance, but a bounce with volume would confirm demand. That would keep the long-term structure intact . It would also preserve the range XRP has traded since reclaiming $2 in late 2024. In June, XRP briefly dipped below $2, but experts downplayed this event . The recovery sent the asset soaring, pushing it to its all-time high. If XRP can experience a similar bounce, it could close 2025 above $3, entering the new year with positive momentum. However, failure changes the outlook. A further breakdown would invalidate the support. Martinez’s chart points to $1.2 as the next major support. Market participants are eagerly watching for XRP’s next moves, as it circles the $2 level. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The launch shows how one of Wall Street’s largest banks is moving traditional cash products onto public blockchains as client demand for on-chain yield and faster settlement keeps growing. JPMorgan Expands Tokenization Push with MONY Fund According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, the new vehicle, called the My OnChain Net Yield Fund, or MONY, is JPMorgan Asset Management’s first tokenized money market fund and is supported by the bank’s Kinexys Digital Assets platform. The fund is available to individuals with at least $5 million in investments and institutions holding a minimum of $25 million, with a $1 million entry requirement. Investors can subscribe through JPMorgan’s Morgan Money portal and receive digital tokens representing their fund shares in a crypto wallet. Subscriptions and redemptions can be made using cash or USDC, the dollar-linked stablecoin issued by Circle. Like traditional money market funds, MONY holds short-term debt instruments and accrues income daily. John Donohue, JPMorgan Asset Management’s head of global liquidity, said that client interest around tokenization has grown sharply since the passage of the Genius Act earlier this year, which created a clearer U.S. framework for stablecoins and tokenized dollars. How JPMorgan Fits into a Broader Industry Shift JPMorgan’s move follows a series of similar launches by major asset managers seeking to blend blockchain rails with familiar financial products. In July, Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon said they would work together on digital tokens tied to money market funds managed by firms including BlackRock and Fidelity. Outside the U.S., Europe’s largest asset manager, Amundi, launched a tokenized money market fund on Ethereum in November, recording its first on-chain transaction earlier that month. Ethereum has become the preferred network for these products, hosting the majority of tokenized real-world assets and stablecoins. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, with more than $2 billion under management, remains the largest example.

This strategic initiative, first reported by Fortune, positions the global payments giant as a crucial guide for businesses navigating the complex world of cryptocurrency payments. But what does this mean for the future of money? Let’s explore the implications of Visa’s foray into stablecoin consulting. What Exactly Is Visa’s Stablecoin Advisory Service? Visa’s new stablecoin advisory service functions as a specialized consulting arm. It is designed to help financial institutions, merchants, and other enterprises understand, integrate, and leverage stablecoins for payments and settlements. The service provides expert guidance on regulatory compliance, technical implementation, risk management, and strategic use cases. Therefore, Visa is not just processing transactions anymore; it is actively shaping how digital currencies enter the mainstream financial ecosystem. This initiative builds on Visa’s extensive work in the crypto space, including partnerships with over 70 crypto platforms. The company recognizes that stablecoins—digital currencies pegged to stable assets like the US dollar—offer unique benefits for fast, low-cost, and transparent cross-border payments. However, navigating this landscape requires expertise, which is precisely what this new service delivers. Why Is a Stablecoin Advisory Service a Big Deal? The launch of a stablecoin advisory service by a titan like Visa signals a major shift in institutional attitude. It moves beyond experimentation into active facilitation. Here are the core benefits driving this move: Bridging Knowledge Gaps: Many traditional businesses lack the internal expertise to handle crypto compliance and technology. Visa’s advisors fill this critical gap. Accelerating Adoption: By providing a trusted roadmap, Visa lowers the barrier to entry for banks and merchants, potentially speeding up the integration of digital currencies. Enhancing System Stability: Professional guidance helps ensure implementations are secure, compliant, and interoperable with existing financial infrastructure. Moreover, this service validates the entire stablecoin sector. When a payments leader like Visa builds a business around advising on it, it sends a powerful message about the asset class’s longevity and utility. What Challenges Does This Service Address? Launching a stablecoin advisory service is a direct response to significant hurdles in the crypto space. Regulatory uncertainty remains a top concern for institutions. Visa’s team can help clients interpret evolving regulations across different jurisdictions. Furthermore, technical complexity and security risks associated with blockchain integration can be daunting. The advisory service provides a structured approach to mitigate these risks and design robust systems. Another key challenge is interoperability—ensuring stablecoin payments work seamlessly with legacy banking systems and between different blockchain networks. Visa’s deep experience in global payment networks positions it uniquely to advise on creating these crucial connections. Consequently, this service acts as a stabilizer and an accelerator for the responsible growth of crypto payments. What Are the Real-World Implications and Insights? The practical impact of Visa’s stablecoin advisory service could be profound. We might soon see: Your local bank offering instant international transfers using a dollar-pegged digital currency. Large e-commerce platforms settling with suppliers via stablecoins, reducing fees and wait times. Gig economy platforms paying global workers in minutes instead of days. For businesses, the actionable insight is clear: the infrastructure for digital currency payments is being built by credible, established players. Engaging with a stablecoin advisory service, whether Visa’s or others that will likely follow, is becoming a strategic consideration for staying competitive in a digitizing economy. The move underscores that the future of finance is hybrid, blending the trust of traditional brands with the innovation of blockchain. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Digital Currency Adoption Visa’s launch of a stablecoin advisory service is more than a new product line; it is a landmark moment in financial technology. It represents a mature, advisory-led approach to cryptocurrency that prioritizes education, security, and integration over speculation. This service has the potential to unlock the true utility of stablecoins for millions of users and businesses worldwide, guiding them safely into the next era of payments. The message is unmistakable: digital currency is here to stay, and the bridges to the traditional world are now open for business. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is the target audience for Visa’s stablecoin advisory service? A1: The service primarily targets financial institutions like banks, large merchants, fintech companies, and other enterprises looking to integrate stablecoin payments or blockchain technology into their operations. Q2: Does this mean Visa is creating its own stablecoin? A2: No. Visa is not launching a proprietary stablecoin. The advisory service is focused on helping clients use and integrate existing stablecoins (like USDC or USDT) and related blockchain infrastructure. Q3: How does this service relate to Visa’s existing crypto card programs? A3: It’s a complementary but separate initiative. The card programs allow users to spend crypto at merchants. The advisory service helps the merchants and financial partners themselves understand and build the backend systems to accept and manage those digital currency flows. Q4: What are the main benefits for a business using this advisory service? A4: Key benefits include navigating complex regulations, reducing technical implementation risks, developing a sound strategy, and leveraging Visa’s network and expertise to build efficient, cross-border payment solutions. Q5: Will this make crypto payments more common? A5: Absolutely. By providing trusted guidance to major institutions, Visa is lowering the adoption barrier. This could lead to more businesses accepting stablecoin payments, making them a common option for consumers in the coming years. Q6: Is this service available globally? A6: While launched globally, the specific advice and implementation support will depend on local regulations. Visa will tailor its stablecoin advisory service to meet the legal and operational requirements of each region it serves. Found this insight into Visa’s groundbreaking move helpful?

USDC in circulation continues to grow, but recent momentum has slowed and is not matching last year’s late-year surge. CRCL’s revenue is very sensitive to short-term interest rates; further Fed cuts threaten growth unless USDC circulation accelerates meaningfully. One of the wildest rides in the market this year has come from Circle Internet Group, Inc. ( CRCL ). The company behind the USDC stablecoin saw its shares rocket higher from their $31 IPO price to nearly $300 before falling back to earth . While the USDC platform is showing nice growth and the company's valuation now looks more reasonable, the company faces a key test in 2026 if short-term US interest rates continue to significantly decline. Previous coverage of the name My most recent article on the name came back in August after the company reported its second quarter results . Revenues came in nicely ahead of street estimates, with USDC in circulation up 86% year over year. While this was offset by lower return rates generated on reserves, the company still boasted roughly 53% total revenue growth. My concern at that time, however, remained a premium valuation, and since then, the stock has lost nearly half of its value, despite the S&P 500 being up more than 5.6%. The current back and forth As a reminder, Circle generates a majority of its revenue from interest on the reserves that back the USDC stablecoin. Generally, those reserves are held in low-risk securities like short-term US treasuries and treasury repurchase agreements. The company publishes monthly reports as to its reserves, which as the chart below shows, allows you to see how much USDC in circulation has grown tremendously in recent years. USDC In Circulation (Circle) The good news is that USDC growth has continued since the end of October. According to Yahoo! Finance data, the figure was up to nearly $78.5 billion as of Saturday night. The somewhat bad news is that in 2024, the final two months of the year saw nearly $9.2 billion in USDC circulation growth. With just under three weeks to go in 2025, November and December this year have only seen about a $2.6 billion increase so far. The other piece of bad news is that short-term interest rates have been dropping as the Fed has now cut rates multiple times and is again starting to purchase Treasury bills. In the company's most recent 10-Q filing , it provided the following graphic showing its return rate on reserves as compared to the quarter's average SOFR, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. Circle Return Rates (Company Filing) After last week's 25 basis point cut by the Fed, the SOFR rate on December 11th was 3.66%, the lowest it has been in some time. If you go to the SOFR page and look at averages, the 90-day average rate was 4.124% as of December 11th, down about 22 basis points since Q3 ended. However, that average is declining by the day, and with another Fed rate cut in the books, the Q4 average could end up being around 4.00%. Looking ahead to next year 2026 is a major year for the Federal Reserve, as Chairman Jerome Powell's term comes to an end. President Trump is likely to pick someone who is aligned with his mission for very low rates and is already on record saying he wants to see rates at 1% or lower by this time next year. Should the Fed cut rates more than once or twice that's currently expected by the market in 2026, Circle will have a hard time generating substantial revenue growth unless we see a dramatic rise in USDC in circulation. Another item to watch will be where all of this USDC ends up. As I previously discussed, the company makes payments to Coinbase Global, Inc. ( COIN ) for its efforts in growing the USDC ecosystem. Generally speaking, the more USDC held on the Coinbase platform, the more those payments are. As the above 10-Q details, however, the amount in percentage terms on the Coinbase platform has nearly leveled off, being 24% at the end of September as compared to 23% a year earlier. The amount on the Circle platform at the end of Q3 2025 was 14%, up significantly from just 2% a year earlier. The rise in USDC on the Circle platform could be part of the reason why management raised its margin forecast at the Q3 report . Based on the current amount of USDC in circulation and the current SOFR rate, I would project the company's revenues next year to be around $2.85 to $2.90 billion. That looks troublesome when you consider that analysts are currently expecting nearly 22% top-line growth to $3.33 billion. However, Circle management believes that USDC should grow by about 40% a year moving forward. If we get only around half of that growth and the current SOFR rate holds, Circle should be right around that current street estimate. A look at the valuation picture My main reason for being so bearish initially had to do with Circle's extreme valuation. At that time back in the middle of June, shares were trading at more than 172 times their latest annualized GAAP earnings figure and more than 17 times this year's expected revenues. Both of those numbers were a bit above what Coinbase was trading for. If we look forward to 2026 now that this year is almost done, Circle trades at more than 65 times its expected adjusted earnings per share. That's still well above the more than 38 times Coinbase goes for. However, Circle is expected to show quite a bit of earnings growth next year, while Coinbase is forecast to show a low-double digits decline. On a price-to-sales basis, Circle is actually cheaper now despite being projected for more top-line growth, at about 5.9 times expected sales versus Coinbase at 8.3 times. When it comes to street analysts, the picture is very bullish currently . Of the 21 analysts covering the stock, 9 have strong buy ratings with 2 more having buy ratings. There are 7 analysts with hold ratings and 3 with strong sells. The average price target is nearly $145, implying almost 74% upside from Friday's close. I should note, however, that the street average was $235 in the stock's early trading days, so analysts have reduced their valuations a bit. Final thoughts and recommendation As we finish up 2025, Circle Internet Group finds itself at a very interesting place. On one hand, the amount of USDC in circulation continues to grow, almost to $80 billion at this point. However, the Fed's decision to cut rates multiple times this year means that the return rate Circle generates on its reserves continues to head lower. If President Trump gets his way with massive interest rate cuts next year, Circle could be in for a world of hurt. Given a much better valuation now than when I first started covering the stock, I am upgrading my rating today from sell to neutral. If the Fed doesn't do anything too crazy and USDC in circulation continues to grow nicely, there should be some room for upside in Circle shares. However, I'm not yet ready to call this name a buy, given the headwinds I've outlined today. As we get some more of an idea of how 2026 will play out, I will take another look at my rating.",COIN|CRCL,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|USDC|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-12-15 11:56:12

Yet, it's also a prime time to identify coins with strong long-term potential. Curious about which digital currencies are poised for significant growth? This article explores top contenders that could thrive in the evolving crypto landscape. NEAR Protocol Faces Challenges with Possible Growth Ahead Source: tradingview NEAR Protocol is currently trading between $1.48 and $1.79. Lately, its growth has faced some bumps, with the price slipping by almost a third over the past month. The coin sits close to its simple moving averages, hinting at a balanced momentum. For investors, reaching the first hurdle at $1.99 could signal a modest comeback. If it conquers this and moves towards the next mark at $2.30, growth from its current state could hit around 50%. With the RSI near 52, NEAR shows stable demand without being overbought or oversold, suggesting steady interest. However, with a recent downward trend, NEAR needs to build strength before hoping for a significant rebound. Pi Network (PI) Shows Hints of Stability Amid Price Fluctuations Source: tradingview Pi Network's current price hovers between 20 and 22 cents, reflecting recent ups and downs. It's near its nearest resistance at 23 cents, suggesting potential for modest upward moves. A push past 23 cents could take it towards 26 cents, which means around a 14% rise. Meanwhile, it sits above support at 19 cents and a further drop could see it fall to 16 cents, equaling a 19% decline. With recent declines over the past week and month, the mid-term trend remains bearish. Current price indicators like the RSI and Stochastic show potential balancing, signaling that change can happen if market sentiment improves. Is FET Set for a Rebound? Examining Artificial Superintelligence Alliance's Trajectory Source: tradingview Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) is currently trading between twenty-two and twenty-six cents. Despite a recent one-month drop of over eleven percent, the coin shows signs of stability with its 10-day and 100-day moving averages both at twenty-four cents. The RSI near fifty-five suggests it's not overbought or oversold. Immediate resistance sits at twenty-nine cents, with further potential to reach thirty-three cents, marking a possible rise of about twenty-seven percent from its current range. Support at twenty cents and a secondary at sixteen cents show downside limits. While FET has slid over sixty-three percent in six months, these levels indicate possible upward movement if conditions align. Conclusion Investing in solid projects can be advantageous during market consolidation. NEAR, PI, and FET show strong potential for long-term growth. These coins have dedicated teams and clear roadmaps. Focusing on them might help in building a resilient portfolio for future gains.

According to the Hashdex forecast, the stablecoin market capitalization will double, tokenized real-world assets will grow tenfold, and the investments in the exponentially growing “AI crypto” sector will balloon to a $10 billion valuation. ‘Cryptodollar’ to replace ‘petrodollar’ amid USD stablecoin adoption rates Hashdex’s prediction for 2026 signals that the stablecoin market could expand from $295 billion to more than $500 billion. The economists propounded that while China and Russia continue reducing dependence on the US dollar, stablecoins are effectively “re-dollarizing” global finance in the UAE and Latin America. 2026 crypto predictions from @hashdex … 1) Stablecoins will double in market cap 2) Tokenized real-world assets grow by factor of ten 3) ""AI Crypto"" market will grow to $10bil Also now recommending a 5-10% crypto allocation for most investors. pic.twitter.com/2CfIXfT0Ea — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) December 14, 2025 Payments via platforms such as PayPal in the United States, and USDC adoption in countries like Brazil, mean there is strong international reliance on dollar-backed digital currencies. The high inflation and current-account deficits during the Vietnam War era weakened the dollar, prompting a 1971 suspension of dollar convertibility to gold. By 1973, major currencies began floating freely, and the oil embargo by OPEC later that year took global energy markets away from dollar dependency. Half a century later, the United States has reduced its dependence on Saudi oil, while Middle Eastern nations now seek access to the USD stablecoin market. In late November, Ripple’s dollar-backed stablecoin RLUSD gained clearance for use within the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) and is formally recognized as an Accepted Fiat-Referenced Token. The regulatory approval allows licensed firms to conduct regulated activities with the RLUSD within the ADGM financial ecosystem, adding more dollars in circulation on the market. Tokenization of real-world assets accelerates The 2026 forecast also mentioned tokenized assets as a growth area, with market capitalization expected to surge from $36 billion to approximately $400 billion. Financial institutions, including BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, UBS, and Siemens, are rebuilding infrastructure on blockchain to accommodate this transformation. The global addressable market for tokenized assets is estimated at $664 trillion, emphasizing the sector’s long-term potential. US-based regulatory developments, including the GENIUS Act have convinced more countries to rethink their digital asset laws. While the act initially addressed digital currencies, its next phase could influence other governments to reduce the friction financial firms had faced trying to offer tokenized assets to their clientele. Cryptopolitan reported on Saturday that Pakistan signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Binance to tokenize up to $2 billion in state-owned assets. The partnership also includes plans for a national stablecoin and blockchain-based distribution of sovereign bonds, treasury bills, and commodity reserves such as oil, gas, and metals. Pakistani Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb termed the MoU “a sign of reform to deliver results with speed and quality.” AI boom strengthens case for crypto investment Artificial intelligence is a catalyst for cryptocurrency growth in itself, and Hashdex believes the AI crypto market could reach $10 billion in 2026. The crypto asset manager noted that blockchain technology’s verification, coordination, and economic autonomy created opportunities for AI-driven investments. AI chip sales have surged, exemplified by Nvidia’s $57 billion revenue in the three months ending October under the demand for processors used in AI training. However, as reported by the World Economic Forum, Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai said “no company would be immune” to an AI market bubble burst. This anxiety has tempered speculative appetite for cryptos, with Bitcoin’s 30% price decline since October causing panic of a broader market correction. “We can look back at the Internet right now. There was clearly a lot of excess investment, but none of us would question whether the Internet was profound. I expect AI to be the same. So I think it’s both rational and there are elements of irrationality through a moment like this,” Pichai said, speaking to the BBC at Google’s California headquarters. Still, Hashdex’s report showed that crypto represents roughly 1% of the global investable market, and a 5% crypto allocation increased annualized returns from 7.2% to 8.7% for a traditional 60/40 portfolio over the period from April 2022 to September 2025. Nate Geraci further pointed out that 45% of financial advisors surveyed by Charles Schwab plan to allocate funds to crypto ETFs in 2026. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

Traders pointed to a familiar pattern: quick wick-downs on weekends when liquidity is thin. Ether showed relative strength while major altcoins lagged, and market participants were seen positioning ahead of a packed calendar of US data and central bank decisions this week. Analysts Eye Bank Of Japan According to analyst commentary, some market participants blame the selling on expectations around the Bank Of Japan. People are seriously underestimating what the bank is about to do to crypto, said one analyst using the handle NoLimit. Justin d’Anethan, head of research at Arctic Digital, said the slide toward $88,000 “feels like a defeat,” and linked the move to fear of a carry trade unwind tied to Japanese rate expectations. Markets May Have Priced It In Sykodelic, another market watcher, argued that Japan’s actions are largely priced in. “Markets are forward-thinking, forward-moving. They move in anticipation of events, not when those events happen,” they wrote. Based on that view, the recent drop is less about a fresh shock and more about ordinary back-and-forth: macro funds trimming exposure, short-term traders taking profit, and buyers stepping in at lower levels.

Meanwhile, the tension between long-term holders — represented by companies like Strategy — and short-term macro flows is shaping price action.

In every market cycle, extreme numbers ignite hope, fuel engagement, and dominate timelines. XRP, one of the most debated digital assets in the industry, has again found itself at the center of such speculation. Claims that XRP could surge to $100 “soon” are circulating widely, drawing in both excitement and concern. Yet beneath the noise lies a deeper conversation that many avoid—one rooted not in hype, but in realism. That conversation was recently reignited by crypto commentator Zach Humphries, who shared a candid video on X challenging the logic behind near-term triple-digit XRP price targets. Humphries, a long-time XRP supporter, made it clear that his stance was not anti-XRP. Instead, it was a call for discipline, honesty, and responsible analysis in a space increasingly driven by attention economics rather than fundamentals. XRP to $100 'Soon' Doesn't Add Up A True Reality Check. Yes, I am bullish on $XRP longterm. But, the TRUTH is this pic.twitter.com/FbYgxUI4Zc — Zach Humphries (@ZachHumphries) December 15, 2025 Belief in XRP Without Ignoring Reality Humphries emphasized that XRP remains one of the most resilient and battle-tested assets in crypto. Its survival through multiple market cycles, combined with its focus on cross-border payments, liquidity, and enterprise integration, places it in a rare category. “I am a huge supporter, huge believer in XRP,” he stated, adding that it remains a core holding in his portfolio. However, he drew a firm line between long-term belief and abandoning basic market logic. According to Humphries, belief in XRP should not require suspending math or market structure. He warned that emotionally charged price targets often spread because they trigger fear of missing out, not because they are grounded in reality. The question most predictions fail to address, he argued, is simple but critical: what does a $100 XRP actually imply? The Market Capitalization Constraint With roughly 50 billion XRP in circulation, a $100 price would imply a market capitalization near $5 trillion. Humphries pointed out that such a valuation would surpass the largest publicly traded companies and rival the peak value of the entire crypto market. Achieving that level would require immediate, global-scale adoption, massive institutional inflows, and near-total displacement of existing payment systems. “That doesn’t happen overnight,” he stressed, noting that financial infrastructure evolves over decades, not months. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional Adoption and the Liquidity Paradox Another misconception Humphries addressed is the belief that institutional adoption guarantees explosive price action . Drawing parallels with ETF inflows across crypto markets, he noted that large capital entries do not always drive prices higher. Institutions prioritize stability, liquidity, and predictability. “A payment asset that swings 30 to 50 percent in weeks is not ideal for settlement,” he explained, arguing that real utility often dampens volatility rather than amplifying it. Why Unrealistic Targets Hurt Retail Investors Humphries was particularly critical of how extreme predictions distort expectations. When realistic gains occur, investors feel disappointed rather than successful. “That’s how retail gets shaken out,” he said, warning that poor expectations—not poor assets—often cause long-term damage. Content creators, he added, are rarely the ones who pay the price for failed predictions; audiences are. A More Grounded Bull Case for XRP A realistic outlook for XRP, Humphries suggested, involves gradual institutional integration, clearer regulation, steady adoption, and price appreciation tied to actual usage. XRP may still outperform many assets over time, but near-term $100 predictions ignore supply dynamics, capital constraints, and market structure. Ultimately, his message was blunt but necessary. “Crypto doesn’t need more hype,” Humphries concluded. “It needs more truth, more patience, and more perspective.” Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Analysts believe this change could drag Bitcoin to the $70,000 price point. The meeting will begin on December 18, and the final decision on the next interest rate move will be announced the next day. Anonymous sources told The Japan Times that the BOJ may move its policy interest rate higher , from around 0.5% to 0.75%. This would be the BOJ’s first policy rate hike since January and the first after seven consecutive meetings. Prediction markets vote for an expensive yen Prediction markets are bearish. On Polymarket , 98% of users voted that a 25 bps increase will likely happen. The remaining 2% of voters think the BOJ will not change the current rate. Less than 1% believe that the BOJ will bump interest rates by 50%. If the rate hikes are imposed, Japan’s total policy rate would hit 75 basis points. The last time the policy rate exceeded 0.5% was in September 1995. An interest rate of 0.75% is considered low compared to the US Federal Reserve’s rate of 3.50%–3.75% and the European Central Bank’s rate of around 2.00%. However, a 0.75% interest rate is a major change in Japan because the country has spent decades with near-zero or negative interest rates. The yen could take Bitcoin down For years, Japan was the source of cheap borrowing, and this created an investment strategy called the “yen carry trade.” Investors borrow the Japanese yen at low rates and convert it into dollars, euros, or other currencies. Then they invest in stocks, bonds, crypto, or higher-yield assets and pocket the difference between borrowing costs and investment returns. The carry trade is now under threat. If Japanese interest rates rise, borrowing the yen becomes more expensive. The profit margin on the carry trade would shrink. The risk of yen appreciation increases, which can amplify losses. To repay yen loans, investors may need to sell volatile assets like Bitcoin. Japan rate hikes vs. Bitcoin price. Source: Merlin the Trader . Analysts believe that Bitcoin could drop to $70,000, and historical data lends support to that view. In March of 2024, Bitcoin dipped by 23% after Japan hiked rates by 10 basis points, ending its negative interest rate policy. In July of 2024, BTC was down nearly 30% after the BOJ raised rates by 25 basis points, taking its policy rate to around 0.25%. The last time this scenario happened was in January 2025, when BTC tanked by 31% after the BOJ once again hiked rates by 25 basis points. In each case, Bitcoin’s declines played out over multiple weeks. Markets slowly repriced global liquidity after BOJ rate hikes, preventing an immediate panic-driven selloff. But the January BTC selloff was quick because markets were more sensitive to the JPY’s value. This time, it is unclear how long a BTC selloff would take to materialize. It could unfold over days or weeks. Analysts are advising investors to prepare for volatility. The week will feature several major events in the United States, including unemployment data and non-farm payrolls on Tuesday. On Thursday, U.S. consumer price index (CPI) data and initial jobless claims are scheduled for release. In Europe, markets will be watching the European Central Bank’s rate decision.

The bank will initially seed the vehicle with $100 million of its own capital before opening it to external investors from Tuesday. Exclusive: JPMorgan Chase is joining the list of traditional financial firms seeking to bring blockchain technology to an investing staple: the money-market fund. — The Wall Street Journal (@WSJ) December 15, 2025 JPMorgan Brings Money Markets Onchain According to the WSJ report the private fund, called the My OnChain Net Yield Fund — or “MONY” — is built on JPMorgan’s in-house tokenization platform, Kinexys Digital Assets. It will be available to qualified investors, defined as individuals with at least $5 million in investable assets and institutions with a minimum of $25 million. The minimum investment size is set at $1 million. Tokenization Gains Momentum After GENIUS Act The launch comes during a rise in momentum for tokenized financial products following the passage of the GENIUS Act earlier this year. The legislation established a US regulatory framework for dollar-backed stablecoins, helping to remove uncertainty around onchain settlement and digital representations of traditional assets. Since then, Wall Street firms have accelerated efforts to tokenize everything from equities and bonds to real-world assets, viewing blockchain as a way to improve operational efficiency, reduce settlement times and expand investor access. “There is a massive amount of interest from clients around tokenization,” said John Donohue, head of global liquidity at J.P. Morgan Asset Management told the WSJ. “And we expect to be a leader in this space and work with clients to make sure that we have a product lineup that allows them to have the choices that we have in traditional money-market funds on blockchain,” adds Donohue. How the MONY Fund Works Investors can subscribe to the MONY fund through JPMorgan’s Morgan Money portal, the bank’s digital money-market investing platform. In return, investors receive digital tokens representing their fund shares, which are held in their crypto wallets. Like traditional money-market funds, MONY invests in baskets of short-term, high-quality debt instruments. The fund accrues dividends daily and pays interest designed to track prevailing money-market yields, which have remained attractive amid a higher interest rate environment. Stablecoins and Institutional Adoption Subscriptions and redemptions can be made using either cash or USDC, the dollar-pegged stablecoin issued by Circle Internet Group. Allowing USDC settlement highlights how regulated financial products are increasingly incorporating crypto-native payment rails. JPMorgan’s move builds on its broader blockchain strategy, which includes tokenized deposits, onchain settlement and wholesale payment infrastructure. While MONY is limited to institutional and high-net-worth investors, it shows a broader shift toward integrating blockchain into core financial products once considered far removed from crypto.

Founded by Eric Trump, the company has purchased an additional 261 BTC, bringing its total holdings to a formidable 5,044 Bitcoin. This strategic accumulation highlights a growing trend of institutional faith in the premier cryptocurrency’s long-term value. What Does This Major Purchase by American Bitcoin Mean? The recent acquisition by American Bitcoin is more than just a transaction; it’s a statement. By adding 261 BTC to its reserves, the company demonstrates a proactive strategy of asset accumulation, often referred to as ‘HODLing’ in crypto circles. This approach suggests that ABTC views Bitcoin not just as a commodity to be mined and sold, but as a core strategic asset on its balance sheet. Therefore, this move can be seen as a vote of confidence in Bitcoin’s future scarcity and value proposition, especially ahead of the next halving event. Breaking Down the American Bitcoin Strategy So, how does a company like American Bitcoin execute such a strategy? The process typically involves a combination of mining operations and direct market purchases. Mining Revenue: A portion of the Bitcoin earned from powering mining rigs is often held rather than immediately sold for operational costs. Treasury Allocation: Companies may allocate capital from investments or profits specifically to buy Bitcoin from exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC) desks. Long-Term Vision: The primary goal is asset appreciation. By accumulating Bitcoin, American Bitcoin positions itself to benefit directly from any long-term increase in the cryptocurrency’s price. This model turns a mining operation into a hybrid: a producer and a dedicated holder of digital gold. The Ripple Effect: Why Institutional Moves Matter When a firm like American Bitcoin makes headlines, it impacts the broader market perception. Institutional purchases provide validation and can influence retail investor sentiment. They add to the overall demand pressure and reduce the circulating supply of Bitcoin, a key factor in its economic model. Moreover, such transparent reporting of holdings, as tracked by sites like BitcoinTreasuries, brings much-needed corporate transparency to the crypto space. This builds trust and paves the way for further institutional adoption. Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities Of course, this strategy is not without its challenges. American Bitcoin and similar firms face market volatility, regulatory scrutiny, and the significant operational costs of mining. However, the opportunities are compelling. Holding a large Bitcoin treasury can: Act as a powerful hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. Provide collateral for future financing or business expansion. Generate substantial shareholder value if Bitcoin’s price appreciates as many predict. The key is sustainable operations that allow the company to weather market downturns while holding its assets. Conclusion: A Confident Step Forward The decision by American Bitcoin to purchase 261 additional BTC is a clear, confident step in a long-term strategic plan. It underscores a fundamental belief in Bitcoin’s role as a store of value and a critical asset for the future. For investors and observers, moves like this serve as a noteworthy indicator of deepening institutional commitment within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The accumulation race is on, and companies are building their digital fortresses. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who founded American Bitcoin (ABTC)? A: American Bitcoin was founded by Eric Trump, the second son of former U.S. President Donald Trump. Q2: How much Bitcoin does American Bitcoin hold now? A: Following the latest purchase of 261 BTC, American Bitcoin’s total holdings have reached 5,044 Bitcoin. Q3: Where was this purchase information reported? A: The data was reported by BitcoinTreasuries, a website that tracks Bitcoin holdings of companies and institutions. Q4: Why would a mining company buy more Bitcoin instead of just mining it? A: Buying Bitcoin directly allows a company to accelerate its treasury growth beyond its mining output, signaling strong belief in the asset’s future value and securing a larger position. Q5: What is the significance of companies holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets? A: It treats Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, similar to gold, which can hedge against inflation, provide financial flexibility, and potentially increase shareholder value. Q6: Does this purchase affect the price of Bitcoin? A: Large institutional purchases can reduce available supply and increase demand, which, along with positive sentiment, can exert upward pressure on the price over time.

Korea Zinc called itself the world’s biggest zinc smelter and said Washington reached out with a clear request: build a site that cuts China out of the flow of key materials. The company said the new site will make antimony, germanium, gallium, and a long list of other metals, including zinc, lead, copper, gold and silver. These materials sit at the core of chipmaking and electronics, and the US wants them coming from anywhere but China . Korea Zinc wrote in its filing that commercial output will start step-by-step sometime between 2027 and 2029. Shares of Korea Zinc jumped 27% after local media reported the agreement, which shows how fast markets react when Washington signs off on a deal this big. US and Korea move money into new joint venture The deal followed a $350 billion South Korean investment pledge tied to a tariff deal signed in late October. Korea Zinc’s chair, Choi Yun-birm, had joined a South Korean business group that visited Washington in August, and the plan now ranks as one of South Korea’s largest pushes into the US critical minerals sector. Korea Zinc’s board approved a foreign joint venture structure on Monday and said the venture will include the US government as a direct party. The filing said the joint venture will raise around $2 billion, and the rest of the funding will come from US government loans, US government grants and capital put in by Korea Zinc. The company said, “The facilities will help us secure a strategic status in the US critical minerals market and strengthen our competitiveness. It will also boost our corporate and shareholder value by helping us secure future growth drivers.” The statement showed a clear plan to anchor Korea Zinc inside the US supply chain. Korea Zinc said it plans to acquire a former Nyrstar smelting site in Tennessee and rebuild the whole place so it can produce 13 metals plus sulphuric acid for chipmaking. The production targets were specific: 300,000 tonnes of zinc, 35,000 tonnes of copper, 200,000 tonnes of lead, and 5,100 tonnes of rare earths each year once operations scale. That level of output marks one of the biggest attempts yet to pull critical minerals away from China’s control. The US and its allies still rely heavily on China for most critical minerals, and everyone knows Beijing has strict export controls on materials like antimony, indium, tellurium, cadmium and germanium, all of which Korea Zinc already produces. Beijing said last week it would issue general licenses for rare earth exports as part of the trade war truce reached with the US last month. Get seen where it counts.

Unlike traditional exchanges, Uniswap uses an automated market-matching (AMM) system. Uniswap has shown good performance over time and is expected to reach the $22.26 level by 2027 and above $45.69 by 2031. Why is UNI up?

Uniswap is trading just below the $6 range, down from $18.59, which it achieved in December last year. The current resistance levels are $6.27 and $7.8; a break above them can lead to $11.

In May 2021, UNI touched $44.9, its all-time high, which is not much below $50. This possibility can arise again if the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish on political and economic factors.

According to the Uniswap price prediction, UNI is not expected to reach near $100 by the last quarter of 2031.

Market analysts expect UNI’s price to reach $45.69 by the end of 2031, substantially higher than its current price.

The economic data will cover October, November, and early December, and none of them gives a clean picture of where the economy under President Donald Trump actually stands. Markets want clarity. They are getting noise. Investors already know this week is overloaded. Tuesday brings October retail sales and the November jobs report. Thursday delivers the November CPI and the December Philly Fed manufacturing index. Friday drops October PCE, November existing home sales, Michigan inflation expectations, Michigan consumer sentiment, and five Fed speaker events scattered around all of that. This is not a normal release cycle. It is a backlog dump after federal agencies spent weeks unable to collect or process numbers. Tracking the flood of releases hitting markets Analysts say traders waiting months for updates may not get the clarity they want. The Bureau of Labor Statistics is sending out two major reports this week: the jobs data and the inflation data. Both should help show how the economy is moving after the shutdown, but each release is flawed. Agencies paused collection during the shutdown, and some releases were delayed or deleted altogether, which leaves holes that cannot be fixed. Diane Swonk of KPMG US said, “We’re still in the clouds and the data we’re going to get is better than not having data. But it’s not going to be definitive because it is reflecting an economy in flux and it’s also still incomplete.” Markets already expected choppy numbers, but hearing that confirmed what traders feared: even the fresh updates may not give a straight answer. This week also lands right after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to the lowest level in three years. That vote exposed huge disagreements inside the central bank about what matters more right now: the weakening jobs market or inflation that keeps hanging around. The shutdown added even more chaos, since agencies could not track or report anything for weeks. Fed chair Jay Powell said borrowing costs are “now within a broad range of estimates of its neutral value” and said the path forward depends on incoming data. He also said, “We are well positioned to wait to see how the economy evolves.” Watching how the Fed handles distorted numbers Tuesday’s employment report covers November plus part of October. Thursday’s CPI only includes November after the October file was dropped. That makes inflation harder to read than jobs. Frances Donald of the Royal Bank of Canada said, “Both the jobs and the inflation data that’s coming through may have distortions that don’t give us a clean read, both because of the impact from the shutdown itself, but also because of various methodological adjustments that had to be made.” She also said it will be hard to look at numbers from October through December and pull “grand conclusions.” The Fed is split on how far to cut rates next year, and this week’s updates could push them either way. Andrew Hollenhorst of Citi said, “A weaker reading would establish a softening trend that markets and Fed officials would extrapolate into next year. On the other hand, a stronger reading would make the recent weakness look more like a temporary, seasonal soft patch.” He also said the inflation release will be “less complete and harder to make sense of than the jobs report,” especially with debates inside the Fed over how new tariffs will affect prices. Hollenhorst added that it may take until December numbers arrive in January “to feel confident regarding whether inflation is cooling toward target or stuck at elevated levels.” Get seen where it counts.

The analysis reviews market conditions surrounding the year’s final Federal Open Market Committee meeting, where policymakers delivered a widely expected 25 basis point rate cut. Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks kept the possibility of either a pause or another cut in January 2026 in play, contributing to a restrained response across crypto markets. Key Highlights: Perpetuals: Open interest is still far lower than the levels it plummeted from pre-October 10, and funding rates in leveraged contracts suggest retail traders are still unwilling to re-enter positions in perpetual swap contracts. Options: Volatility smiles are bearish across the whole term structure for both BTC and ETH with volatility smiles pricing in close to a 5 percent premium for OTM puts over calls for both short-dated and long-dated BTC and ETH options. As such, those waiting for a so-called Santa rally may end up disappointed, at least based on current positioning in derivatives markets. The report highlights minimal shifts in perpetual swap activity, subdued implied volatility and continued skepticism in options positioning. While the Fed conveyed an improved economic outlook, sentiment in crypto derivatives remains cautious. BTC’s spot price is still 28 percent below its all-time high, and options markets continue to price meaningful downside protection. According to the findings, traders have yet to see catalysts strong enough to support a late year resurgence. Han Tan, Chief Market Analyst at Bybit Learn , said the broader macro backdrop continues to influence crypto market reactions. “The Fed’s policy outlook will frame market reactions to this week’s US jobs report and inflation data releases. Crypto bulls still have their work cut out to get any upside momentum going, considering that digital assets could only muster a tepid response to the final FOMC meeting of 2025, in stark contrast to global equities that surged to new record highs. Merely middling activity across the derivatives complex suggests that the window for a crypto ‘santa rally’ is getting narrower and the bar notably set higher.” The report concludes that traders are showing limited appetite to re-engage with leverage while options markets continue to indicate caution across short and long horizons. Current positioning suggests a tempered outlook for any year end rebound.

55822926,645001,1765801800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55822926.jpeg,Bitcoin Wholecoin Holders Pulling Back As Inflows To Binance Shrink – What’s Driving It,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-wholecoin-holders-pull-back/,"Bitcoin ’s bounce last week was quickly cut off by growing volatility in the broader crypto market, causing the price to fall below the pivotal $90,000 mark once again. Given the recent price fluctuations, investors’ sentiment, especially those on crypto exchanges, has shifted as inflows from BTC wholecoiners plummet. Binance Sees Sharp Drop In BTC Wholecoiner Inflows While the price of Bitcoin pulls back this new week, there is one key metric that is currently standing out. This metric is the BTC Wholecoiners Inflows on Binance, which is starting to tell a different story about investors on the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. After examining this metric, Darkfost, a market analyst and author at CryptoQuant, revealed that on the Binance platform, wholecoiner deposits are drying up. Specifically, wholecoiner inflows imply transactions larger than 1 BTC, which provides vital insight into both current selling pressure and the broader evolution of the market. Data shows that the inflows from this cohort are declining when compared to past years. Presently, BTC’s yearly average now sits around 6,500 BTC, representing a level not seen since 2018. Meanwhile, on the shorter time frame, the weekly average is situated near 5,200 BTC, marking one of its lowest readings of this cycle. While the wholecoiner inflows dry up, the pattern that inflows have followed this cycle in comparison to previous ones is very intriguing. Even as Bitcoin continued to rise, wholecoiner inflows to Binance have steadily decreased rather than rising as they once did. Beyond indicating that investors with sizable Bitcoin holdings are less inclined to sell, this trend could also point to a deeper structural shift in the market. With Bitcoin’s valuation experiencing a steady increase, owning a full BTC has become extremely difficult, which naturally decreases the total number of transactions larger than 1 BTC . At the same time, Darkfost highlighted that there are now more options available in the ecosystem for owning or trading Bitcoin. Even crypto exchanges have multiplied, and the steady growth of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) provides more venues, a trend that is likely to redirect flows that previously went nearly exclusively to major exchanges such as Binance. BTC Still Trading Below Short-Term Cost Basis Bitcoin is still trading below the Short-Term Holder Cost Basis located at $105,400. What this means is that the crypto king has been trading below the level for nearly 2 months now. However, Darkfost stated that staying beneath the level for such an extended period is not uncommon. During previous corrections, the duration of these phases has ranged from two months to over four months, making the present correction fall well within a typical range. However, since this indication tends to stay negative for much longer after the market actually enters a bear phase, it would be crucial to prevent Bitcoin from declining any further. In the meantime, this does not invalidate the notion that these periods remain a signal for accumulation opportunities. Nevertheless, caution is still crucial, and access points should be carefully optimized. Darkfost believes that an accumulation of this type is only appropriate for long-term investors.",Bitcoin News|binance|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Cost Basis|Bitcoin Wholecoiners|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|CryptoQuant|Darkfost|decentralized finance|DeFi,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-15 12:30:00

The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) recently granted Ripple conditional approval to form a national trust bank. The charter allows Ripple to provide custody and fiduciary services under federal oversight. This regulatory backing strengthens XRP’s role as a bridge asset for tokenized markets. While the approval is preliminary, it positions Ripple inside the U.S. banking system and provides the compliance certainty needed for institutional adoption. Ripple Bull Winkle believes that this development, combined with emerging tokenized markets, positions XRP to integrate directly into the financial system. Most investors have yet to notice, but the groundwork is quietly being laid for significant institutional adoption. When you connect the dots: OCC approval + XRP holding structure + tokenized markets going live = Ripple embedding itself into the financial system’s core. Most won’t see it until liquidity moves. By then, the window is gone. $XRP — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) December 13, 2025 Strategic Timing and Market Awareness According to Ripple Bull Winkle, many market participants will not fully recognize the significance until liquidity starts moving. “Most won’t see it until liquidity moves. By then, the window is gone,” he said. His point emphasizes that XRP’s integration into core financial systems is quietly building momentum. The structural foundation is being laid now, with market responses likely to follow once institutions begin leveraging these developments. XRP Structure and Tokenized Markets Ripple Bull Winkle pointed to XRP’s structure as another critical factor. XRP already serves as a settlement and liquidity tool. As tokenized markets come online, having a compliant and regulated asset that can move efficiently within the markets becomes essential. Ripple has secured regulatory clarity and institutional-grade custody. These make XRP a foundational component of the tokenization space . With the regulatory framework in place and tokenized markets preparing to go live, Ripple is creating the conditions for institutional capital to flow. Meanwhile, XRP could see a rapid price increase once liquidity starts to move.

He emphasizes structural integration over short-term price speculation, with Ripple prioritizing real-world utility and adoption . The combination of OCC approval, XRP’s role in settlement, and emerging tokenized markets puts XRP in an unrivaled position. These developments create a scenario where XRP could play a central role in the evolving financial system. Ripple is putting XRP at the heart of the global economic system. For investors, recognizing these signals early may be critical before liquidity shifts occur. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

55824981,https://bitzo.com/2025/12/solana-bulls-anticipate-short-term-recovery-as-sol-rebounds-from-2025-low,1765805109,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/55824981.jpeg,Solana Bulls Anticipate Short-Term Recovery as SOL Rebounds from 2025 Low,https://bitzo.com/2025/12/solana-bulls-anticipate-short-term-recovery-as-sol-rebounds-from-2025-low,"Solana (SOL) is showing early signs of stabilization after a prolonged correction that saw the token fall nearly 30% over the past 60 days. Selling pressure eased as price approached its 2025 low, where buyers stepped in to defend the level, triggering a modest rebound and renewed short-term interest. As crypto markets search for direction following weeks of volatility, the ability to interpret price action in context has become increasingly important. This is where data-driven market analysis and narrative timing intersect — an approach long emphasized by Outset PR , a crypto communications agency. By aligning real-time market signals with targeted storytelling, Outset PR focuses on amplifying narratives when audiences are most receptive, rather than relying on generic coverage. Momentum Shows Early Improvement One of the first indicators supporting a possible shift in momentum is the MACD, which has begun to tick higher. This uptick suggests that downside momentum is fading, even though it does not yet confirm a full trend reversal. Such signals often precede consolidation phases or short-lived relief rallies, particularly after extended declines. Despite this improvement, SOL continues to trade below major moving averages. The 30-day simple moving average at $135.11 and the 200-day SMA at $175.43 remain significant overhead resistances that bulls must eventually overcome to restore broader bullish structure. Key Levels Define the Near-Term Outlook From a price-structure perspective, the $137.65 level, which aligns with the 50% Fibonacci retracement, has emerged as a critical short-term trigger. A daily close above this zone would strengthen the case for a recovery move, potentially opening the door to a test of the 30-day SMA and higher resistance levels. On the downside, $129.98 serves as immediate support. Failure to hold this level would weaken the rebound narrative and increase the likelihood of a retest of the $122.12 lows, where stronger buying interest may be required to prevent a deeper continuation of the downtrend. How Outset PR Leverages Data-Driven Approach in Crypto PR Outset PR connects market events with meaningful storytelling through a data-driven methodology rarely seen in the crypto communications space. Founded by PR strategist Mike Ermolaev, the agency approaches each campaign like a hands-on workshop—building narratives that align with market momentum instead of relying on generic coverage or templated outreach. Beyond just monitoring on-chain flows, Outset PR monitors the media trendlines and traffic distribution through the lens of its proprietary Outset Data Pulse intelligence to determine when a client’s message will achieve the highest lift. This analysis informs the choice of media outlets, the angle of each pitch, and the timing of publication. A key part of the agency’s workflow comes from its proprietary Syndication Map , an internal analytics system that identifies which publications deliver the strongest downstream syndication across aggregators such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square. Because of this approach, Outset PR campaigns frequently achieve visibility several times higher than their initial placements. Outset PR ensures that each campaign is market-fit and tailored to deliver maximum relevance at the moment the audience is most receptive. Solana Short-Term Outlook Solana’s rebound from its 2025 low has eased immediate downside pressure, and momentum indicators point to a possible near-term recovery attempt. However, the token remains trapped below key moving averages, keeping the broader trend cautious. In the coming sessions, price action around $137.65 will likely determine whether bulls can extend the bounce or whether SOL slips back into consolidation. A sustained move above this level would mark the first meaningful step toward short-term trend improvement, while a breakdown below support could reignite selling pressure.

55824975,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=245487,1765805111,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Massive Bitcoin Investment: Strategy Acquires 10,645 More BTC in Bold $980 Million Move",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/strategy-massive-bitcoin-investment/,"BitcoinWorld Massive Bitcoin Investment: Strategy Acquires 10,645 More BTC in Bold $980 Million Move In a move that underscores unwavering confidence in digital assets, Strategy has executed another monumental Bitcoin investment , acquiring 10,645 BTC for approximately $980.3 million. This latest purchase, completed between December 8th and 14th, signals a powerful institutional vote for Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Let’s analyze what this means for the market and why this Bitcoin investment is making waves. What Does This Massive Bitcoin Investment Entail? Strategy’s recent acquisition adds another significant chapter to its crypto treasury strategy. The company purchased the 10,645 Bitcoin at an average price of $92,098 per coin. Consequently, this brings their total holdings to a staggering 671,268 BTC. Their cumulative average purchase price now stands at $74,972, indicating a substantial unrealized gain on earlier acquisitions. This strategic accumulation highlights a core belief in Bitcoin as a primary reserve asset. Moreover, it demonstrates a disciplined dollar-cost averaging approach, even at elevated price levels. For other institutions observing the space, this move provides a compelling case study in long-term digital asset allocation. Why Is This Bitcoin Investment So Significant for the Market? Institutional moves of this scale act as a powerful market barometer. When a major player like Strategy commits nearly a billion dollars in a single week, it sends a clear signal. This Bitcoin investment reinforces several key market narratives. Supply Shock Acceleration: Every large purchase permanently removes coins from circulating supply, increasing scarcity. Validation of Store-of-Value Thesis: Allocating treasury funds to Bitcoin legitimizes its role as ‘digital gold’. Price Support: Such demand creates a substantial floor, potentially reducing volatility during downturns. Therefore, this activity often precedes broader institutional adoption, as confidence builds seeing peers make similar allocations. What Are the Broader Implications of This Strategy? Looking beyond the immediate transaction, Strategy’s persistent accumulation strategy offers actionable insights for other corporations and investors. Their approach isn’t about short-term trading; it’s a fundamental recalibration of their balance sheet. First, it showcases a hedge against traditional financial system inflation and currency debasement. Second, it represents a strategic bet on the future of a decentralized financial infrastructure. This long-term vision is crucial for anyone considering a similar Bitcoin investment path. The key takeaway is consistency and conviction, not market timing. Could There Be Challenges with Such a Large Bitcoin Investment? While the benefits are prominent, concentrating a significant portion of treasury assets into a single, volatile asset class carries inherent risks. Market liquidity, regulatory changes, and custody security are perpetual considerations. However, Strategy’s continued purchases suggest they have robust frameworks to manage these challenges. For smaller entities, the lesson is to adopt prudent risk management. This includes secure custody solutions, clear accounting standards, and a governance policy that withstands market cycles. A successful Bitcoin investment strategy balances bullish conviction with operational diligence. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Institutional Crypto Adoption Strategy’s latest $980 million Bitcoin investment is more than just a headline; it’s a milestone. It reflects a maturing market where leading institutions are not just dipping a toe but diving in headfirst. Their growing stack of 671,268 BTC represents a profound shift in how corporations perceive and utilize digital assets. As the lines between traditional finance and cryptocurrency continue to blur, moves like this will likely become less extraordinary and more routine. The unwavering confidence displayed here sets a powerful precedent, potentially guiding the next wave of institutional capital into the Bitcoin ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: How much Bitcoin does Strategy now own in total? A1: Following this purchase, Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings amount to 671,268 BTC. Q2: What was the average price paid in this latest Bitcoin investment? A2: The company acquired the recent 10,645 BTC at an average price of $92,098 per Bitcoin. Q3: What is Strategy’s overall average purchase price for all its Bitcoin? A3: Their cumulative average purchase price across all acquisitions is $74,972 per BTC.

By press time, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading at $3,155, up about 1.7% over the past 24 hours. On a weekly basis, Ethereum has gained less than 1%. ETH seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Ethereum price prediction For the projection, the Ethereum Rainbow Chart outlined a broad range of potential price outcomes for ETH on January 1, based on long-term historical trends and market sentiment. Notably, the Ethereum Rainbow Chart applies a logarithmic regression to ETH’s historical price data to create colour-coded valuation and sentiment bands, offering a long-term framework to gauge whether Ethereum is undervalued, fairly priced, or overheated rather than a precise price forecast. At the lower end of the chart, the ‘Fire Sale’ band projects a January 1, 2026, price range of approximately $974.60 to $1,315.18, a zone associated with extreme bearish sentiment and capitulation. Ethereum Rainbow Chart. Source: Blockchain Center Above this, the ‘Undervalued’ band spans roughly $1,315.18 to $1,809.69, followed by the Accumulate range between about $1,809.69 and $2,532.49, indicating levels where long-term investors historically begin building positions. The ‘Still Cheap’ band, which currently contains ETH’s market price, ranges from approximately $2,532.49 to $3,591.97. A sustained move above this area would place Ethereum into the ‘Steady’ band, projected to range from about $3,591.97 to $5,166.43 by January 1. This zone reflects a market in balance, where growth continues without excessive speculation. More optimistic scenarios appear at higher levels on the chart. The ‘HODL!’ band extends from about $6,166.43 to $7,493, signalling strong bullish conviction. Above that, ‘Is This the Flippening?’ range spans approximately $7,493 to $10,881, pointing to a period of heightened enthusiasm and rapid price appreciation. At the speculative extreme, the ‘But have we earned it?’ band ranges from about $10,881 to $15,538.20, while the ‘Maximum Bubble Territory’ band projects prices between roughly $15,538.20 and $22,120.14, levels historically associated with late-cycle excess and elevated risk. Ideal Ethereum price of Jan 1, 2026 Based on Ethereum’s current placement in the ‘Still Cheap’ zone, the Rainbow Chart suggests a plausible price range for January 1, 2026, of roughly $2,500 to $5,200, assuming a continuation of gradual market expansion. At the same time, a move into higher bands would depend on a sharp acceleration in demand, network usage, and broader crypto market momentum. This comes as Ethereum continues to see increasing adoption from major institutions. For instance, as reported by Finbold, American banking giant JPMorgan announced the launch of its first-ever tokenised money market fund on the Ethereum blockchain, thereby drawing increased attention to the asset.

This view aligns with the opinion of 10x Research’s Markus Thielen, who says Bitcoin’s four-year cycle is still intact but no longer driven by the halving, instead being shaped by politics, liquidity and institutional behavior. Luke Gromen Turns Bearish on Bitcoin Global macro analyst Luke Gromen adopted a more cautious near-term outlook on Bitcoin, and warned that the asset could fall as low as the $40,000 range in 2026 due to macroeconomic conditions and investor narratives. Speaking on the RiskReversal podcast , Gromen mentioned his long-standing belief in the debasement trade. This is the idea that governments will erode the real value of their debts through inflation and currency weakness, but he suggested that Bitcoin is no longer the best vehicle to express that thesis in the current environment. Instead, he argued that gold and select equities are doing a better job of capturing the dynamics of fiscal dominance and rising debt burdens, while most other assets risk being “waylaid” in the near term. The debasement trade traditionally positioned Bitcoin alongside gold as a scarce asset designed to preserve purchasing power as fiat currencies weaken. However, Gromen said several technical and narrative factors undermined Bitcoin’s near-term risk-reward profile. He pointed to Bitcoin’s failure to make new highs relative to gold, the loss of key moving averages, and increasing discussion around quantum computing as signals that the market has become more vulnerable. For people familiar with his work, this was a noticeable shift in tone. While Gromen is still structurally bullish on the long-term implications of debt expansion and currency debasement, he now frames Bitcoin as a position that should be tactically reduced rather than held unconditionally. BTC’s price action over the past year (Source: CoinMarketCap ) His comments were made during a broader backdrop of macro uncertainty. Analysts are questioning whether Bitcoin can sustain the gains that followed the launch of US spot ETFs, especially as concerns mount around the AI sector and as US labor and consumer data show signs of strain. At the same time, quantum computing began to feature more in market discussions, even though most cryptographers believe practical attacks on Bitcoin’s cryptography are still very far off. Not everyone agrees with Gromen’s assessment. Several Bitcoin-focused analysts pushed back by arguing that broken moving averages and underperformance versus gold often appear during periods of weakness rather than at market tops. On-chain analysts also dismissed the quantum risk narrative as overblown, and suggested that it reflects sentiment on social media more than hard data or imminent technical danger. Market flows complicate the picture even more, especially after huge outflows in November. In this context, Gromen’s shift looks less like a rejection of Bitcoin’s long-term role in the debasement trade and more like a tactical pause. Macro Forces Now Drive Bitcoin’s Market Cycle While Bitcoin’s long-discussed four-year cycle is still unfolding, the forces driving it have changed a lot, according to Markus Thielen, head of research at 10x Research. Speaking on The Wolf Of All Streets podcast , Thielen pushed back against claims that the cycle is “broken,” and argued instead that it evolved away from Bitcoin’s halving schedule and toward macro-political dynamics and liquidity conditions. Thielen said historical price peaks in 2013, 2017 and 2021 all occurred in the fourth quarter, which he believes aligns more closely with US presidential election cycles and political uncertainty than with the timing of Bitcoin’s programmed supply reductions. Over time, the halving shifted across the calendar, weakening the argument that it is the primary driver of market cycles. In contrast, election periods tend to coincide with heightened fiscal debates, shifting policy expectations and changes in investor risk appetite, all of which have a more direct impact on capital flows. In his view, political uncertainty around US elections plays a very meaningful role in shaping market behavior. Thielen explained that concerns over whether a sitting president’s party might lose congressional power can influence expectations about future policy, spending and regulation, ultimately affecting liquidity and risk assets like Bitcoin. As those uncertainties resolve, markets often reprice accordingly, contributing to cycle peaks and corrections. His comments were made as Bitcoin struggles to gain traction despite the Federal Reserve’s recent rate cut. While rate cuts historically supported risk assets, Thielen argued that today’s market structure is different. Institutional investors now dominate crypto trading and tend to respond more cautiously to policy shifts, particularly when signals from the Fed remain mixed and broader liquidity conditions are tightening rather than expanding. As a result, the usual boost from easier monetary policy has been muted. Thielen also pointed to slowing capital inflows into Bitcoin compared with last year, which reduced the upside momentum needed to sustain a breakout. Without a meaningful improvement in liquidity, he expects Bitcoin to stay in a consolidation phase instead of entering another rapid, parabolic rally. This dynamic, he said, reinforces the idea that liquidity, not supply mechanics, is the key variable to watch. The perspective is similar to comments made earlier by BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, who also argued that the traditional four-year crypto cycle is effectively dead. Hayes believes that Bitcoin cycles have always been driven by global liquidity conditions rather than halving events.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-15 13:30:00

The cryptocurrency landscape is about to get a major physical upgrade. Blockchain technology leader Bitcoin Bancorp has announced a groundbreaking plan to install up to 200 new Bitcoin ATMs across the Lone Star State, with the rollout beginning in the first quarter of 2026. This massive expansion promises to bring digital currency access directly to local communities, making buying and selling Bitcoin as easy as using a traditional bank machine. What Does This Mean for Texas Crypto Users? This initiative represents one of the most significant physical infrastructure pushes for cryptocurrency in the United States. For Texans, it means unprecedented local access. Instead of relying solely on online exchanges, residents will find convenient Bitcoin ATMs in shopping centers, gas stations, and other high-traffic areas. The company’s vision extends beyond simple transactions, aiming to later integrate support for stablecoins and Web3 features, creating a true crypto service hub. Why Are Bitcoin ATMs a Game-Changer? While online platforms dominate, physical Bitcoin ATMs serve a crucial role. They bridge the gap between the digital and physical worlds, offering instant service. For many users, especially those new to crypto, a tangible machine feels more familiar and secure than a website or app. The benefits of this network expansion are clear: Enhanced Accessibility: Brings cryptocurrency services to neighborhoods without requiring a bank account or complex online verification for basic purchases. Financial Inclusion: Provides an on-ramp for individuals who prefer cash-based transactions or have limited access to traditional banking. Educational Opportunity: Physical presence raises public awareness and demystifies Bitcoin for the general population. Market Legitimacy: A growing network of regulated Bitcoin ATMs signals stronger institutional adoption and regulatory comfort. What Challenges Lie Ahead for This Expansion? However, deploying 200 machines is not without its hurdles. Bitcoin Bancorp will need to navigate a complex landscape. Regulatory compliance varies by location, and securing partnerships with physical venues is essential. Furthermore, the company must ensure robust security at each kiosk to protect users’ funds and data, a constant challenge in the crypto space. Despite these challenges, the strategic choice of Texas is insightful. The state has a generally crypto-friendly regulatory environment and a large, tech-savvy population. Success in Texas could provide the perfect blueprint for Bitcoin Bancorp’s stated goal of a nationwide Bitcoin ATM network. How Will This Shape the Future of Crypto Access? Looking beyond 2026, this project is a bellwether. A successful, large-scale deployment of Bitcoin ATMs could trigger similar investments from other companies, rapidly increasing the density of crypto access points across the country. It moves cryptocurrency further into the mainstream retail environment. For the average person, the future might look like this: grabbing a coffee, then walking to a kiosk to buy Bitcoin with cash, or quickly selling a small amount to cover a purchase—all without opening a laptop. This is the seamless integration that drives mass adoption. Conclusion: A Physical Step Toward a Digital Future Bitcoin Bancorp’s plan to install 200 Bitcoin ATMs in Texas is more than just a business expansion; it’s a vote of confidence in the physical infrastructure of cryptocurrency. By meeting users where they are, in their local communities, this project has the potential to accelerate adoption, improve financial access, and normalize digital assets in everyday life. All eyes will be on Texas in Q1 2026 to see the first of these machines go live. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: When exactly will the Bitcoin ATMs be installed? A1: Bitcoin Bancorp plans to begin the installation process in the first quarter (Q1) of 2026. The rollout of all 200 machines will likely occur over subsequent months. Q2: Where in Texas will these Bitcoin ATMs be located? A2: Specific locations have not been fully announced yet. However, the company will likely target high-traffic areas in major metropolitan centers like Houston, Dallas, Austin, and San Antonio, as well as other populous regions. Q3: What can I do at a Bitcoin ATM besides buy Bitcoin? A3: While the primary function is buying and selling Bitcoin, Bitcoin Bancorp intends to expand services to include cryptocurrency payments, stablecoin transactions, and support for some Web3 features in the future. Q4: Are Bitcoin ATMs safe to use? A4: Reputable Bitcoin ATM operators like Bitcoin Bancorp implement strong security measures. However, users should always practice caution: verify the machine’s legitimacy, use secure wallets, and be aware of transaction fees before proceeding. Q5: Will this affect the price of Bitcoin? A5: While increased accessibility can positively influence demand over the long term, a single ATM network expansion is unlikely to cause immediate, significant price movements. Price is influenced by a vast array of global factors. Q6: What does this mean for crypto regulation? A6: Large-scale deployments encourage clearer regulatory frameworks. As more regulated machines enter operation, it helps authorities shape sensible policies that protect consumers while fostering innovation.

Key Takeaways: Strategy bought $980 million in Bitcoin, increasing its holdings to 671,268 BTC. The purchase was funded through stock sales The purchase comes after Strategy created a $1.44 billion cash reserve to avoid selling Bitcoin, ensuring dividend and debt payments during market volatility. In a Form 8-K filing dated December 15 , Strategy disclosed that it acquired 10,645 BTC between December 8 and December 14, spending $980.3 million at an average price of $92,098 per coin. The purchase was funded through proceeds raised under the firm’s at-the-market (ATM) equity and preferred stock offerings, including sales of common shares and multiple preferred stock classes. Strategy Becomes World’s Largest Corporate Bitcoin Holder With 671,268 BTC Following the latest acquisition, Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings climbed to 671,268 BTC, with an aggregate purchase cost of $50.33 billion and an average price of $74,972 per Bitcoin. The move further cements the company’s position as the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin globally, far ahead of other public firms. Last week, Strategy also purchased 10,624 BTC for roughly $962.7 million, paying an average price of $90,615 per coin. Strategy has acquired 10,645 BTC for ~$980.3 million at ~$92,098 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 24.9% YTD 2025.

CEO Phong Le has said the company’s newly built cash reserve is designed to quiet investor anxiety over its ability to withstand a sharp downturn in Bitcoin. Le said the move followed weeks of speculation about whether the firm could continue meeting its dividend and debt commitments if market conditions worsened. “We’re very much a part of the crypto ecosystem and Bitcoin ecosystem,” Le said. “Which is why we decided a couple of weeks ago to start raising capital and putting US dollars on our balance sheet to get rid of this FUD.” The reserve, funded via a stock sale, is intended to secure at least 12 months of dividend payments , with plans to stretch that buffer to 24 months. Concerns over Strategy’s dividend stability had grown louder in recent weeks as Bitcoin retreated from its highs. Bitcoin Drops Under $90,000 as Investors Turn Defensive Bitcoin slipped below the $90,000 mark this week, reinforcing a cautious short-term outlook as investors pull back from risk assets, according to Lin Tran, senior market analyst at XS.com. In a note shared with Cryptonews, Tran said Bitcoin continues to trade in line with broader risk sentiment, remaining closely tied to US technology stocks and shifting expectations around monetary policy. The analyst noted that Bitcoin’s rejection near $100,000 and its struggle to hold above the psychological $90,000 level point to growing risk aversion, particularly as markets head into year-end. Investors appear focused on protecting gains after the strong rally earlier in the cycle. Tran highlighted US Federal Reserve policy as the key macro driver. While interest rates have been cut, the Fed’s cautious guidance and still-elevated real rates have limited the return of global liquidity, capping Bitcoin’s upside.

Titles like Dota 2 and CS:GO have developed betting ecosystems of their own, with global tournaments, stable liquidity, and highly specialized audiences. As these markets matured, crypto sportsbooks were among the first to adapt — not because of hype, but because esports bettors already operate in digital-first, borderless environments. Today, crypto sportsbooks play a central role in esports wagering, offering faster settlement, broader access, and fewer barriers than many legacy operators. However, not all crypto sportsbooks approach esports in the same way. Some treat it as a core product, while others include it as a secondary feature within a broader betting ecosystem. What Separates a “Real” Esports Crypto Sportsbook from the Rest At a glance, many platforms appear similar: Bitcoin support, live betting, esports listed in the menu. In practice, the differences become clear once betting volume increases or live matches begin. A serious esports crypto sportsbook typically offers: Consistent liquidity on major matches and tournaments Fast-moving live odds, especially for map-based betting Low-latency interfaces that keep pace with in-game action Crypto-native settlement, without banking delays Reasonable KYC policies, aligned with global esports audiences Platforms that fail in these areas often feel fine for casual bets, but struggle during high-stakes or fast-paced esports events. Platform Spotlights: How the Major Crypto Sportsbooks Compare Instead of rankings, it’s more useful to understand how each platform is positioned within the esports betting landscape. Dexsport — A Web3-Native Sportsbook With Serious Esports Depth Dexsport approaches esports betting from a distinctly Web3-first perspective. Launched in 2022, the platform was built around crypto-native access, fast execution, and transparency rather than adapting a traditional sportsbook model to blockchain payments. As a result, esports is treated as a core betting vertical rather than a secondary feature. The sportsbook covers major esports titles including CS2, Dota 2, Valorant, and other competitive formats, with a strong emphasis on live betting and in-play markets. Odds update quickly, and the platform supports a wide range of bet types suited to map-based and round-based esports formats. Live streaming is available even without an active balance, which is particularly useful for esports bettors who rely on real-time match flow. Dexsport stands out structurally through its no-KYC access model. Users can register via email, Telegram account, or by connecting a DeFi wallet such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet, without submitting identity documents. Crypto support is extensive, with 38 cryptocurrencies across 20 networks, allowing bettors to move funds efficiently during high-traffic tournament periods. Another differentiating factor is transparency. Dexsport provides public bet tracking that allows users to observe betting activity and outcomes in real time, reducing reliance on opaque settlement processes. Combined with audited infrastructure and a licensed framework, this positions Dexsport as a platform designed for bettors who value control, speed, and verifiable execution. Overall, Dexsport is best suited for crypto-native esports bettors who want deep esports coverage, fast on-chain settlement, and full anonymity without sacrificing platform stability or betting functionality. Stake — The Most Liquid All-Around Crypto Sportsbook Stake operates one of the largest crypto sportsbooks on the market, with esports integrated into a much broader betting ecosystem. It supports more than ten esports titles alongside traditional sports, with strong liquidity, competitive odds, and a feature-rich live betting interface that includes cash-out tools and streaming. The platform supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies and processes transactions quickly, but it does require full identity verification before withdrawals. Stake suits bettors who value depth, liquidity, and interface quality over anonymity. Thunderpick — Built Primarily for Esports Betting Thunderpick stands out as one of the few platforms where esports is not an add-on, but the main focus. CS:GO, Dota 2, Valorant, and League of Legends are supported with deep markets, livestreaming, and esports-specific betting options. The platform operates entirely on crypto deposits and withdrawals and uses provably fair mechanics. While esports coverage is strong, traditional sports markets are more limited, and withdrawals can take up to 24 hours. Thunderpick is best suited for esports-first bettors rather than general sportsbook users. BetPanda — Privacy-First Crypto Betting with Esports Access BetPanda takes a different approach, positioning itself as a casino-forward platform with sportsbook functionality layered on top. It supports a broad selection of cryptocurrencies and generally allows anonymous play without KYC unless flagged by unusual activity. Esports markets are available, but live tools and market depth are more limited compared to esports-focused platforms. BetPanda works best for users who prioritize privacy and crypto flexibility, with esports betting as a secondary interest rather than a primary strategy. Vave — Hybrid Sportsbook with Strong Live Infrastructure Vave blends casino and sportsbook products into a polished, high-performance platform. It supports a wide range of sports, including esports, and offers deep live betting tools such as cash-out, player props, and live streaming. Crypto support is extensive, but KYC is typically required when withdrawals exceed certain thresholds. Vave appeals to bettors who want traditional sportsbook features with crypto payments, rather than a pure Web3 or anonymity-first model. Betplay — Fast On-Chain Betting via Bitcoin Lightning Betplay emphasizes speed and crypto efficiency, particularly through support for the Bitcoin Lightning Network. This allows for extremely fast deposits and withdrawals, making it attractive for bettors who value execution speed. The platform combines sportsbook, casino, and poker under one account and supports esports alongside a wide range of traditional sports. However, it operates without a traditional license and applies higher wagering requirements to bonuses. Betplay is best suited for users who prioritize on-chain speed over regulatory structure. Dota 2, CS:GO, and Beyond: Esports Coverage That Actually Matters Despite the growth of new titles, Dota 2 and CS:GO continue to dominate esports betting volume. Their long-established competitive scenes, frequent tournaments, and clearly structured match formats translate well into betting markets. Most crypto sportsbooks focus on: Match winners and series outcomes Map-by-map betting Tournament outrights Live betting during matches Newer titles like Valorant are gaining traction, but liquidity and market depth still vary widely depending on the platform. Betting Experience: Where Crypto Changes the Game Crypto fundamentally changes how esports betting works at an operational level. Instead of relying on banking systems, bettors can move funds directly on-chain, often across borders, with fewer delays. Key advantages include: Faster access to winnings after matches settle Fewer geographic restrictions during international tournaments Easier bankroll management for frequent bettors Reduced friction during live betting sessions For esports, where timing and momentum matter, these factors can significantly affect the overall betting experience. Choosing the Right Crypto Sportsbook for Esports Betting There is no single “best” crypto sportsbook for esports — only platforms that fit different priorities. When choosing, bettors should consider: Whether esports is a core focus or a side market Live betting responsiveness during maps and rounds Reliability and speed of crypto withdrawals KYC requirements and account restrictions Realistic bonus conditions versus headline offers Understanding these trade-offs helps avoid frustration during major tournaments or high-volume betting periods. Final Perspective Esports betting has evolved into a mature, high-liquidity market, and crypto sportsbooks have become a natural home for it. Platforms vary widely in how seriously they treat esports — from fully dedicated ecosystems to broad sportsbooks where esports is just one category among many. For bettors focused on Dota 2, CS:GO, and emerging titles, the most important factors are market depth, speed, and reliability, not marketing claims. As the esports landscape continues to grow, crypto sportsbooks that align their infrastructure with the realities of competitive gaming are likely to remain at the forefront.",More News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitzo', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitzo,2025-12-15 13:34:48

Olivier Janssens ho pes to establish a self-contained community that would manage its own legal system, testing new models of crypto-driven governance . His project, Destiny, targets entrepreneurs and investors looking for legal independence and crypto-friendly facilities. Under a newly enacted Special Sustainability Zones Authorization Act passed by the St. Kitts and Nevis government earlier this year, the company is acquiring large tracts of coastal land with plans for luxury villas, medical facilities, and other infrastructure intended to transform the island’s south coast. The legislation permits developers to create zones for testing innovative approaches to the governance of tech and digital assets. The project’s advocates think they will see cases resolved more swiftly Janssens seeks to introduce a territory-specific judicial system. Instead of regular judicial procedures, private judges will be required, and arbitration procedures will be established in their place. The self-contained community would also feature Skidmore, Owings & Merrill–designed homes, offices, and healthcare facilities. Supporters of the project have claimed it would bring faster and more certain resolution to conflicts over digital assets and international commerce. Janssens also insisted that national law would still apply. Ideally, the initiative aligns with larger tech and crypto developments in a new paradigm known as “ network state ,” which involves creating an alternative to traditional nation-states. This approach enables communities to utilize shared digital infrastructure, complemented by private governance. Destiny is perhaps the clearest attempt to bring this idea to life. The Destiny project has some locals and political figures worried The Destiny project has alarmed local people and politicians. Some critics have argued the project would create a “state within a state,” questioning how much of Nevisian oversight will still be maintained. Others shared their concerns about the potential land development, including its impact on local infrastructure, service delivery, and community life, as well as its implications for the local community. They warned that even with the best of intentions, such communities can easily run into strife — particularly when a form of governance is partially privatized. Previous efforts to build crypto-based communities have faced resistance from politicians, court cases, and financial struggles, particularly during periods of volatility in the crypto markets. Though even with recent changes in the marketplace, Janssens and the project’s developers maintained that some structured governance and contracts could make Destiny a secure centre for world trade. Nevertheless, whether the project becomes a self-governing Caribbean community or merely an abandoned crypto utopia will depend on government acceptance, local consensus, investor support, and Nevisian authorities’ willingness to embrace experimental approaches to private governance. For the moment, the project exemplifies both the potential and the uncertainty of crypto-fueled community experiments. If it works, it could help spark similar projects elsewhere; if it doesn’t work, it may suggest the difficulty of reconciling private governance with national oversight.

High retail participation, active exchanges, and a dense ecosystem of crypto-native media create the impression of a market where attention naturally translates into adoption. New data from an Outset PR report suggests otherwise. After analysing media performance in Asia in Q2 , Outset PR prepared a separate report comparing crypto media traffic, centralized exchange (CEX) activity, and on-chain usage on KAIA — a Korea-focused Layer 1 blockchain. The report highlights a disconnect: South Korean users consume crypto information at scale, but that attention does not reliably convert into sustained on-chain activity. A market with exceptional media engagement According to the report , South Korea accounted for roughly 60% of all crypto media traffic in Asia during Q2. This was not a temporary spike but a stable pattern, supported by strong direct traffic and loyal readership across local outlets. Unlike Western markets, where discovery is often driven by social media or aggregators, Korean crypto audiences tend to return directly to trusted publications and forums. From a visibility standpoint, this is a strong foundation. Projects that secure coverage in Korean crypto media gain access to a large, attentive audience. However, the data shows that attention alone is not a growth engine. KAIA’s on-chain surge and collapse KAIA’s on-chain activity surged sharply in early Q2, peaking in April. New wallets, transactions, and active users all increased at once. On the surface, this looked like traction. But the report shows that this activity was largely driven by incentive programs, judging by the narratives on KAIA’s X. Rewards and onboarding campaigns successfully pulled users on-chain, but the trend failed to become sustainable. Once those incentives weakened or ended, activity declined just as quickly. By the end of Q2, KAIA’s on-chain usage had fallen by roughly 90% from its peak. There was no secondary wave of organic demand to replace the incentive-driven users. Therefore, incentives created activity, not retention. No clear funnel from media to usage A core question behind the report was whether centralized exchanges function as a bridge between attention and on-chain usage. In theory, media exposure should translate into trading activity, which then feeds on-chain participation. The data shows that this bridge did not form. CEX trading activity did not track media consumption in real time, nor did it sustain on-chain engagement. Instead, exchange volumes followed a delayed, narrative-driven pattern, reacting to momentum rather than to actual usage on KAIA. Source: Outset Data Pulse While media traffic remained consistently high, CEX activity peaked later and declined more gradually. On-chain usage, by contrast, rose sharply during incentive campaigns and collapsed soon after. The timing mismatch across these layers suggests that CEX trading operated as an isolated response to narratives, not as a conversion mechanism. Rather than connecting attention to adoption, CEX activity exposed the gap between them. It reflected speculative interest, not user migration into sustained on-chain behavior. What Outset PR Report Says about Korean Crypto Users The report does not uncover deep psychological or cultural traits, but it does reveal structural behavior: Crypto content consumption is active and habitual. On-chain participation is highly responsive to incentives, but fragile. Trading behavior is narrative-driven, not usage-driven. These patterns are not uniquely Korean, but the scale and clarity with which they appear in this market make them hard to ignore. For founders and investors, the implication is uncomfortable but useful: media reach and reward programs are distribution tools, not substitutes for product-market fit. In a market with some of the highest crypto attention globally, sustainable on-chain usage still depends on one thing — whether users have a reason to come back when rewards disappear.

What started as a workaround for payment restrictions has evolved into a preferred betting method for esports fans worldwide. Today, many bettors actively choose crypto-based platforms for esports because they offer speed, global access, and flexibility that traditional sportsbooks often struggle to match. This article explains how crypto esports betting works, why BTC and USDT dominate, and where players can bet on esports using crypto without unnecessary friction. Where to Bet with BTC or USDT on Esports Crypto esports betting platforms vary significantly in how they approach esports. Some treat it as an add-on to traditional sports betting, while others build their entire infrastructure around crypto-native and esports-first principles. Understanding this difference is crucial. The right platform depends less on headline bonuses and more on how well the site handles live betting, settlement speed, transparency, and long-term usability for esports-focused players. Best Crypto Esports Betting Platform for BTC & USDT — Dexsport Dexsport approaches esports betting from a crypto-native perspective, rather than adapting a traditional sportsbook model. Esports titles such as Dota 2, CS2, and Valorant are treated as core products, not secondary categories. The platform supports BTC, USDT, and a wide range of other cryptocurrencies across multiple networks, giving bettors flexibility in how they fund and manage their accounts. Deposits and withdrawals are processed quickly, which is especially valuable during live esports betting, where timing can directly impact odds. Dexsport also operates without mandatory KYC. Users can register via email, Telegram, or wallet connection and start betting immediately, avoiding the delays often associated with identity verification. For esports bettors who follow multiple tournaments and place frequent bets, this streamlined access is a major advantage. A defining feature of Dexsport is its on-chain transparency. Bets and outcomes can be tracked publicly, allowing users to verify settlement rather than relying solely on internal reporting. This level of openness is still uncommon in esports betting and appeals to players who value accountability over branding. Instead of relying on aggressive one-time promotions, Dexsport emphasizes cashback and free-bet systems that function over longer betting cycles. This structure aligns well with esports tournaments, where variance plays out across multiple matches and days rather than single events. Overall, Dexsport fits bettors who want speed, transparency, and control when betting on esports with BTC or USDT. Other Crypto Esports Betting Platforms — Who They’re Best For Vave — For Bettors Who Prefer a Full Sportsbook Experience Vave offers a hybrid sportsbook and casino environment with esports integrated alongside traditional sports. It supports BTC and USDT, delivers a strong live betting interface, and covers a wide range of markets. The platform feels familiar to users coming from traditional sportsbooks, although full KYC is typically required at the withdrawal stage. Stake — For High-Volume, Mainstream Esports Bettors Stake is one of the most recognizable names in crypto betting, offering extensive crypto support and competitive odds across esports and traditional sports. While deposits and betting are fast, KYC is mandatory before withdrawals. Stake appeals primarily to bettors who value brand recognition and high liquidity. Thunderpick — Esports-First, Crypto-Only Platform Thunderpick focuses heavily on esports titles such as CS2, Dota 2, and Valorant. It operates as a crypto-only platform and offers dedicated esports markets and live streams. Withdrawals may take longer than on some competitors, but the esports-first approach attracts players who want a narrower, more focused experience. Betplay — For Fast BTC Betting via Lightning Network Betplay stands out for its support of Bitcoin via the Lightning Network, enabling extremely fast transactions. It combines esports betting with casino and poker offerings and does not require KYC by default. However, its regulatory framework and transparency are more limited compared to crypto-native platforms. How Esports Bettors Actually Use Crypto Platforms In practice, esports bettors use crypto platforms dynamically. Many place live bets during matches or between maps, switch currencies depending on volatility and tournament length, and prioritize reliable settlement over flashy promotions. Rather than chasing large welcome bonuses, experienced bettors tend to favor cashback systems and consistent conditions that reduce downside over time. Speed, flexibility, and predictability matter far more than headline offers when betting across long esports seasons. BTC vs USDT in Esports Betting: Which One Do Players Actually Use? Both Bitcoin and USDT are widely accepted across esports betting platforms, but they serve different purposes. Bitcoin is often used by bettors who are comfortable with volatility or already hold BTC long term. Some prefer betting directly in Bitcoin, viewing esports wagers as part of a broader crypto exposure strategy. USDT, on the other hand, has become the dominant choice for high-volume esports bettors. Stablecoin betting allows players to separate betting performance from crypto price fluctuations. This is especially important during long tournaments, where results unfold over weeks rather than hours. In practice, many experienced bettors switch between BTC and USDT depending on the situation—using USDT for structured tournament betting and BTC for smaller, higher-risk plays. The key advantage of crypto platforms is that they allow this flexibility without friction. What Is Crypto Esports Betting — and Why It’s Growing So Fast Crypto esports betting refers to wagering on competitive video game matches using cryptocurrencies instead of fiat money. These bets cover popular esports titles such as Dota 2, CS2, Valorant, League of Legends, and others, with markets ranging from match winners to live in-play props. The growth of crypto esports betting is closely tied to the nature of esports itself. Esports is global by default, with teams, tournaments, and audiences spread across multiple regions. Traditional banking systems often introduce delays, payment blocks, or regional restrictions that clash with this global audience. Crypto removes those barriers. Deposits and withdrawals are borderless, settlements are faster, and bettors can participate without relying on local banking infrastructure. For a digital-native audience that already understands wallets and blockchain basics, crypto betting feels like a natural extension of esports fandom rather than a complicated alternative. Final Thoughts: Choosing Where to Bet on Esports with Crypto Crypto esports betting has become a mature segment of the betting market, shaped by the needs of a global, digital-native audience. BTC and USDT offer different advantages, and the best platforms are those that allow bettors to move seamlessly between them. There is no single platform that fits everyone. Some bettors prefer hybrid sportsbooks, others want esports-only environments, and many gravitate toward crypto-native platforms that emphasize transparency and control. For bettors who value fast settlement, no-KYC access, and a crypto-first approach to esports betting, platforms like Dexsport represent where the market is heading—not just where it has been.",More News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|USDT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitzo', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitzo,2025-12-15 13:37:56

World Liberty Financial price prediction for 2025 expects the price of WLFI to surge toward $0.41. By 2031, we expect the World Liberty Financial price to record a maximum price of $1.4. Donald Trump has embraced the title of the “crypto president”, a label that has fueled massive speculation across the crypto industry. After Trump’s 2024 election victory, the price of Bitcoin surged, a move many analysts and traders called a bullish signal for the broader cryptocurrency market. Building on this momentum, Trump introduced his own branded tokens—most notably the $TRUMP token and $MELANIA memecoin—cementing his direct involvement in the world of digital assets. Whether Trump’s push into crypto is driven by policy goals or personal profit, one message is clear: he intends to make cryptocurrency part of both his political strategy and financial portfolio. However, Trump’s personal involvement in crypto tokens raises critical ethical questions. If a sitting or future U.S. president profits directly from token sales, DeFi projects, or blockchain ventures, it risks blurring the line between public duty and private gain. One project drawing major attention is World Liberty Financial after major listings, a Trump-backed decentralized finance (DeFi) platform. This article explores what World Liberty Financial is, and what Trump’s embrace of crypto could mean for the future of Bitcoin, memecoins, and U.S. crypto policy. Consequently, numerous analysts eagerly anticipate the future valuation of its native cryptocurrency, WLFI. This raises the question: Can WLFI price reach $1? This forecast for World Liberty Financial’s price examines factors such as ecosystem trends, adoption rates, underlying technology, and technical analysis to project the WLFI price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency World Liberty Financial Ticker Symbol WLFI Rank 27 Current Price $0.14 Price change 24H -1.5% Market cap $5.26 Billion Circulating supply 24.66 Billion WLFI Trading volume 24h $1.21B (+2.1%) All-time high $0.46, September 1, 2025 All-time low $0.091, October 11, 2025 WLFI price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.14 Price Prediction $ 0.1146 (-25.37%) Fear & Greed Index 22 (Extreme Fear) Sentiment Bullish Volatility 5.42% (High) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 50-Day SMA – 200-Day SMA – 14-Day RSI 48.79 (Neutral) World Liberty Financial technical analysis: WLFI price faces bearish pressure toward $0.14 WLFI price analysis shows a bearish pattern toward $0.14 Resistance for WLFI is present at $0.1704 Support for WLFI/USD is present at $0.1302 The WLFI price analysis for 15 December confirms that WLFI faces increasing volatility as it drops toward $0.14. Currently, the bulls are aiming for a recovery. WLFI price chart prediction: World Liberty Financial faces selling pressure toward $0.14 WLFI price is facing a decline as sellers push the price toward $0.14. WLFI price is aiming for a hold below the immediate Fib channels. The 24-hour volume surged toward $9.16 million, showing increased interest in trading activity. The price is trading at $0.14, declining over 1.5% in the last 24 hours. WLFIUSDT chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has surged from its previous level but trades below the midline at level 41, suggesting minor selling pressure. WLFI/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for a hold above EMA trend lines The 4-hour WLFI price chart suggests WLFI continues to experience bullish activity around EMA lines, creating a positive sentiment on the price chart. As the price hovers above EMA trend lines, bears prepare for a domination by sending the price below the EMA20 trend line. WLFIUSDT chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a negative region at 0.8, hinting that sellers are trying to build pressure near resistance levels and boost downward correction. Additionally, the MACD trend line has formed red candles below the signal line, hinting at a bearish pressure.

The hourly price chart confirms that bears are making efforts to prevent the WLFI price from an immediate surge. However, if WLFI’s price successfully breaks above $0.1704, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.2083. WLFIUSDT chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, WLFI’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.1302, resulting in a correction to $0.1081. WLFI crypto news The U.S. crypto market structure bill is being delayed by disputes over a potential ban on stablecoin yield programs, Trump-linked conflicts of interest from WLFI token sales, and unresolved questions around DeFi regulation such as developer liability. This uncertainty is short-term bearish for WLFI. Is WLFI a good investment? Trading $WLFI will be very risky. Since it’s a new and highly hyped token with only a small amount available at launch, the price could change quickly and unpredictably. Liquidity will be thin, so even one big trade might move the market. It’s normal for tokens like this to surge at launch and then drop as early buyers cash out. However, considering its background and ongoing trading volume, WLFI can turn out to be a good investment option in the long-term. Why is the WLFI price down today? Sellers are gaining confidence to maintain their dominance, resulting in a downward push toward $0.14. What is the WLFI price prediction for 2025? By 2025, analysts predict that World Liberty Financial (WLFI) will start the year at $0.15, with an average trading price of $0.37, and could climb as high as $0.41. Will WLFI price touch $1? Yes, WLFI price might touch the $1 milestone by the end of 2030. However, the token might attain this level much earlier, depending on the future market sentiment and buying demand. Will WLFI Price Reach $10? If everything remains good and WLFI gains recognition, its price might surpass $10 by 2040. Is WLFI a good long-term investment? As World Liberty Financial aims to expand its offerings, it might gain a significant position in the altcoin market. Hence, WLFI can be a good long-term investment option. The WLFI long term price outlook is looking strong due to its strong political support. WLFI price prediction December 2025 Analysts expect a steady surge in crypto market prices in December. We expect WLFI to record a minimum price of $0.1 and a maximum price of $0.25, with an average of $0.18 in December.

The WLFI token price initially surged toward $0.478 but it later declined toward $0.1611. On 6 September, the WLFI price again attempted a surge toward $0.2. By the end of September, WLFI declined below $0.2. By the end of October, the price of WLFI further declined and touched $0.1 in early November.

Over the past year, readings of fear or extreme fear have accounted for more than 30% of the index’s assessments. Bitcoin (BTC), the crypto market’s bellwether, has struggled to regain footing after a volatile autumn that took it to as low as $80,000. As of this reporting, the king coin is trading near $88,900, 30% below its all-time high of $126,000 set in October. Second in line, Ethereum is also 36% down from its August $4,946 high, while Ripple’s token XRP has given away over 40% of its value back to the loss category, in a winter that may not turn sunny before 2025 closes its curtains. The market has yet to stage a meaningful recovery following a liquidation crash that sent Bitcoin down 36% from its peak more than two months ago, nailing down the sentiment index firmly within the extreme fear territory. Market sentiment in fear, even for US equities The cautious mood in crypto is not far off from the trend witnessed in US equities, as the CNN Fear and Greed Index for stocks currently reads 42, despite the S&P 500 trading at 6,827, just a few percentage points below its record high. In both cryptocurrencies and traditional equities, investor psychology is clearly dominated by risk aversion. The macroeconomic factors exerting downward pressure on risk assets include a market watch on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points to 0.75% on December 19, the highest level in three decades. When the BoJ made a rate raise in July 2024, Bitcoin dropped from $65,000 to $50,000. Moreover, speculation around global liquidity and rising US yields had already pushed Bitcoin below $84,000 within the first week of the month. According to several economists, elevated US yields and tighter liquidity conditions are an eye-burning sight for the crypto market and Bitcoin’s short-term outlook. That said, in the midst of all the bearish signs, several developments have made crypto market bulls optimistic for the weeks ahead. The Federal Reserve concluded its quantitative tightening (QT) program on December 1, injecting $13.5 billion into the market and projecting up to $40 billion in additional liquidity. Since then, institutional adoption for digital currencies seems to have shaken off the despair of November’s redemptions, with Vanguard launching cryptocurrency ETFs and Bank of America approving allocations of up to 4% in Bitcoin for its clients. Technical indicators like options call targets ranging from $100,000 to $115,000 and support levels around $86,000 have reignited the positive predictions. Traders are positioning for accumulation between $80,000 and $85,000 if Bitcoin takes a deeper slump, two of its immediate support levels. CryptoQuant contributor GugaOnChain summed up the sentiment saying: “Between BoJ risks and Fed stimulus, BTC faces tension between a drop to $70,000 and a rally toward $180,000. The balance will depend on global liquidity and institutional confidence.” Ripple ETFs record inflows continue, price tanks 5.2% in the week Ripple (XRP) has experienced a week of choppy trading in which it began at the $2.1 price level, went up to as high as $2.15 around December 10, before correcting to $1.99 during Monday’s early US trading sessions. According to data from CryptoQuant, there was a substantial reduction in exchange reserves in November from over 3.5 billion XRP to around 1.5 billion. In early December, market watchers reported an additional 1 billion XRP withdrawn within three weeks, supposedly caused by whale activity and US spot XRP ETF launches. The spot XRP ETFs have recorded their 19th consecutive day of inflows, accumulating over $20.1 million on Friday alone. According to SoSoValue data , cumulative inflows now approach $990.91 million. However, since the October 10 liquidation crash, bearish sentiment has wiped out over 28.9% from XRP, which means the token is suffering from the event’s causality, much like the rest of the market.

With massive international tournaments, deep strategic gameplay, and a global fanbase that actively follows teams and players, Dota 2 attracts bettors who treat wagering as analysis — not luck. As esports betting continues to shift toward crypto-based platforms , Dota 2 stands out as a perfect match for blockchain payments. Fast settlement, global accessibility, and stablecoin bankroll management have made BTC and USDT the preferred tools for serious Dota 2 bettors. This guide breaks down how Dota 2 betting works, why crypto dominates esports wagering, and which platforms offer the best Dota 2 esports crypto betting experience in 2026. Why Dota 2 Is One of the Biggest Esports Betting Markets Dota 2 isn’t just popular — it’s structurally built for betting. The game’s competitive ecosystem has been active for over a decade, anchored by The International (TI), a tournament famous for hosting the largest prize pools in esports history. These high-stakes events drive enormous global viewership and betting volume year after year. Dota 2’s fanbase spans multiple high-engagement regions: CIS and Eastern Europe, where competitive Dota culture is deeply rooted Southeast Asia, one of the most active live-betting regions China and Western Europe, home to elite teams and high-volume markets What makes Dota 2 especially attractive to bettors is its strategic depth. Outcomes are influenced not just by mechanical skill, but by drafts, hero matchups, patches, and in-game decisions. Formats like BO1 group-stage matches introduce volatility, while BO3 and BO5 series reward preparation and analysis. This combination — massive audience, emotional fan engagement, and complex gameplay variables — has turned Dota 2 into one of the most actively bet esports titles worldwide.

Another Dota 2 Crypto Betting Platforms While Dexsport is optimized for crypto-native esports betting, several other platforms also support Dota 2 markets. The key differences usually come down to market depth, betting speed, and how esports-focused the platform really is. Dota 2 Crypto Betting Comparison Table Site Dota 2 Market Depth Live Betting BTC USDT KYC Best Fit For Dexsport Extensive Yes Yes Yes No Dedicated Dota 2 bettors Betplay Solid Yes Yes Yes No Fast BTC & Lightning users Lucky Block Medium Yes Yes Yes No Bonus-driven bettors BetPanda Basic Limited Yes No Conditional Casual Dota 2 betting Betplay — Fast BTC Betting With Lightning Network Betplay appeals to bettors who prioritize transaction speed, particularly those using Bitcoin via the Lightning Network. Dota 2 markets are available alongside other esports, and live betting is supported during matches. While payouts are typically fast, the platform places more emphasis on speed than on transparency or deep esports-specific tooling. Lucky Block — Bonus-Focused Esports Platform Lucky Block offers Dota 2 betting as part of a broader sportsbook and esports ecosystem. Its main draw is aggressive bonuses and wide crypto support, including BTC, USDT, and SOL. Market coverage is sufficient for major events, though some users prefer platforms with more detailed esports analytics and lower friction around withdrawals. BetPanda — Entry-Level Crypto Betting on Dota 2 BetPanda provides basic Dota 2 betting markets with support for multiple cryptocurrencies. It’s best suited for casual bettors who place occasional wagers rather than follow tournaments closely. Compared to more esports-focused platforms, live features and market depth are more limited. Why Crypto Is the Preferred Way to Bet on Dota 2 Esports Dota 2 betting moves fast — especially during live matches, drafts, and high-volatility BO1 games. Traditional payment methods often struggle to keep up with the pace of esports wagering, which is why crypto has become the default choice for experienced Dota 2 bettors. Speed is the first advantage. Crypto deposits and withdrawals are processed in minutes, not hours or days. This matters when placing live bets between maps or reacting to draft outcomes, where timing directly affects odds. Global access is another key factor. Dota 2 has a truly international audience, and crypto eliminates regional banking restrictions. Bettors can participate from anywhere without dealing with blocked cards, delayed transfers, or currency conversions. BTC and USDT serve different betting strategies. Bitcoin (BTC) is often used by higher-risk bettors willing to accept volatility in exchange for upside. USDT is preferred for stable bankroll management, allowing players to focus purely on betting performance without price fluctuations. Privacy also plays a major role. Many esports bettors prefer platforms that don’t require intrusive identity verification. No-KYC crypto sportsbooks allow users to register quickly and stay focused on the game rather than paperwork. Finally, crypto platforms increasingly offer cashback and loss protection paid in stablecoins, helping reduce variance during long tournaments like TI or regional leagues. For Dota 2 bettors who value speed, flexibility, and control, crypto betting isn’t just an alternative — it’s the standard. What You Can Bet On in Dota 2 Dota 2 offers one of the deepest betting structures in esports, largely because each match is shaped by drafts, hero matchups, and strategic decisions that unfold long before the first team fight. This creates multiple entry points for bettors beyond simple win–loss predictions. The most common market is the match winner, available across BO1, BO3, and BO5 formats. BO1 matches tend to carry higher volatility, while longer series reward preparation and team consistency. Map winner markets allow bettors to focus on individual games within a series rather than the overall result. This is particularly useful when teams show strong side or draft preferences on specific maps. Handicap and total map markets are popular for balancing odds when one team is heavily favored. These markets let bettors take positions on whether a series will go the distance or end quickly. Dota 2 also supports a range of in-game proposition bets, such as first blood or first Roshan. These markets are often influenced by drafting styles and early-game aggression, making them attractive for bettors who follow team tendencies closely. For tournament-focused players, outright markets cover overall winners of majors, leagues, and The International. These bets typically offer higher odds but require long-term commitment. Finally, live betting plays a major role in Dota 2 esports wagering. Odds shift rapidly during drafts, laning phases, and key objective fights, giving experienced bettors opportunities to react in real time as momentum changes. How Much Can You Really Win Betting on Dota 2? Dota 2 is known for high-variance outcomes, which is exactly why it attracts experienced bettors. Drafts, patch changes, and BO1 formats regularly produce odds that don’t fully reflect real in-game dynamics. Some of the biggest betting swings in esports history have come from Dota 2. Upsets at The International—such as underdog runs by teams like Team Spirit or early eliminations of tournament favorites—have historically paid out high odds, especially in group stages and BO1 matches. These moments highlight how quickly pricing can break when teams experiment with drafts or adapt faster to a new meta. Live betting further amplifies this effect. Odds often lag behind momentum shifts caused by drafts, early-game aggression, or objective control, creating short windows where value appears before markets fully adjust. At the same time, Dota 2 betting is unforgiving. Favorites collapse, patches reshape team strength overnight, and emotional betting on popular teams leads to heavy losses just as often as big wins. This is why most consistent bettors focus on small edges, stable staking, and long-term volume, rather than chasing single high-risk payouts. Using USDT instead of volatile crypto is common among experienced bettors, as it isolates betting performance from market swings. Over long tournaments, cashback and free-bet systems can also meaningfully reduce drawdowns during losing streaks. In practice, Dota 2 betting can be profitable—but only for bettors who treat it as an analytical market. The biggest wins usually come from preparation and timing, while the biggest losses come from overconfidence and emotion. Final Thoughts: Dota 2 Esports Betting With Crypto Dota 2 remains one of the most complex and rewarding esports betting markets available. Its global fanbase, strategic depth, and constant evolution make it especially suited to crypto-based wagering, where speed and flexibility matter. For bettors who follow the competitive scene closely and prefer BTC or USDT payments, choosing a platform that treats esports as a core product—not an add-on—is essential. With fast settlement, transparent betting mechanics, and deep Dota 2 coverage, crypto-native sportsbooks offer a clear advantage for modern esports bettors.",More News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|MINING|USDT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Daily', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptodaily,2025-12-15 13:45:14

This bold acquisition isn’t just a transaction; it’s a powerful statement of conviction in the future of digital assets. Let’s unpack what this massive bet means for the market and for investors like you. What Does Bitmine’s Massive ETH Purchase Actually Mean? Last week, Bitmine (BMNR) announced it purchased an additional 102,259 ETH, valued at approximately $321 million. This strategic move is far from a casual buy. It represents a calculated, large-scale accumulation by a publicly traded company. Therefore, this action provides a clear window into how sophisticated institutions are positioning themselves within the crypto ecosystem. The scale of this Bitmine ETH purchase underscores a trend of deepening institutional commitment beyond mere speculation. How Big is Bitmine’s Ethereum Treasury Now? Following this latest acquisition, Bitmine’s Ethereum holdings have reached a monumental level. The company now controls a treasury of 3,967,210 ETH. At current valuations, this stash is worth a breathtaking $12.45 billion. To put this in perspective: Bitmine’s ETH holdings are now among the largest for any single public entity. This level of accumulation acts as a significant reduction of liquid supply on the open market. It demonstrates a long-term holding strategy, often referred to as ‘HODLing’ in crypto circles, at an institutional scale. This isn’t just an investment; it’s the construction of a formidable digital asset reserve. Why is This Bitmine ETH Purchase So Significant for Crypto? This transaction carries weight far beyond the headline numbers. For the broader cryptocurrency market, a Bitmine ETH purchase of this magnitude serves as a multi-layered signal. First, it validates Ethereum’s core value proposition—its utility as a platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts—in the eyes of regulated, traditional finance players. Moreover, it highlights a growing preference for Ethereum as a cornerstone asset in institutional portfolios, alongside or even in place of Bitcoin. However, such large-scale buying also presents challenges. It can increase market volatility around major transactions and raises questions about asset concentration. Despite this, the overwhelming message is one of confidence. When a Nasdaq-listed firm commits billions, it tells everyday investors that major financial players are here for the long haul. What Can Investors Learn from Bitmine’s Strategy? Bitmine’s aggressive accumulation strategy offers key insights for any market participant. Their approach appears to be built on dollar-cost averaging during market cycles, not timing peaks and troughs. For individual investors, this underscores the importance of a disciplined, long-term perspective rather than reactive trading based on short-term news. Focus on Fundamentals: Bitmine is betting on Ethereum’s underlying technology and ecosystem growth. Embrace Volatility: Large purchases can be made during periods of price uncertainty, viewing dips as opportunities. Think Long-Term: The holding period for such an investment is measured in years, not months. In essence, this Bitmine ETH purchase is a masterclass in conviction investing within the digital asset space. The Final Verdict: A Watershed Moment for Ethereum Bitmine’s $321 million Ethereum acquisition is more than a corporate treasury update. It is a watershed moment that blurs the line between traditional finance and the crypto economy. This stunning move provides undeniable proof of institutional adoption moving from theory to reality. It signals deep-seated belief in Ethereum’s future and sets a precedent for other public companies. For the astute observer, the message is clear: institutional giants are not just dipping their toes in the water—they are diving in headfirst, and their actions are worth paying attention to.

The company has been tied to Curve since 2020, when it built the first software repositories and helped launch the DAO, but the new request covers one full year and keeps all unused tokens rolling into the next cycle. Swiss Stake AG said its role since 2020 has been simple: make the software, maintain it, expand it, and keep Curve stable. The group explained that it used the August 2020 CRV allocation as the main source of cash, while smaller revenue came from Curve Lite deployments and veCRV staking through Convex, StakeDAO, and Yearn . But the team said the revenue still does not cover its long-term costs, so it plans to explore future monetization for certain front-end features. The company clarified that no grant funds will be used for those commercial features. Swiss Stake AG outlines previous work Swiss Stake AG said it now has more than 25 contributors working on Curve-related systems and wants to keep that team intact. According to the DAO proposal, the first grant came with regular quarterly reports, and those will continue. Curve said, “We hope the community saw the progress,” pointing to 2024–2025 upgrades that included crvUSD improvements, better collateral options, updated lending mechanics, cross-chain boost tools, and a full update to Curve’s governance and user interfaces. It also said Llamalend V2 is built and is waiting for security audits before release. Source: Curve Finance/X The company confirmed that the new request follows the end of the 2024–2025 grant, which stopped in August 2025. With remaining funds, Swiss Stake AG kept operations going through the end of 2025, and Curve said the 2026 proposal keeps development running without any gaps in staffing or knowledge. Proposal sets 2026 plans and grant rules The plan for 2026 centers on expanding Curve’s infrastructure . Swiss Stake AG wants to launch Llamalend V2 with LP and PT collateral, build FXSwap to move Curve into onchain foreign exchange, extend crvUSD systems with more collateral and new risk models, deploy Curve across more chains with stronger DAO tooling, and continue the full rebuild of Curve’s front-end architecture. Other plans include new developer tools, AMM research on dynamic fees, modular work on existing AMMs, external management tools for lending markets, more simulation and analysis systems, and continued work on the Curve Block Oracle. The company asked for 17,450,000 CRV, or about CHF 5.3 million, matching the amount from the previous period. Funds run from January 2026 to January 2027. Tokens will vest through a smart contract under DAO rules. The group said all spending will follow the project description, with any unused funds rolled into the next year. Swiss Stake AG may stake CRV in wrapper protocols to earn yield, but only for project work. The grant terms require open-source release of all software created with these funds. Taxes related to the grant may be paid from the allocation. Swiss Stake AG will file bi-annual spending reports and alert the DAO of any issues that could disrupt work. Disputes will follow Swiss law and go through courts in Zug. Funds will cover security audits, front-end software, Curve repository development, infrastructure, community support, and research and analytics. Quarterly reports will continue, according to the proposal . Get seen where it counts.

Related Reading: Dogecoin Holds Demand Zone Above $0.13, What A Bounce Would Do As of December 15, the Ethereum price trades near the $3,100 level, drifting sideways after several failed attempts to reclaim higher resistance zones. The narrowing range reflects hesitation across the market, with declining volumes, mixed technical signals, and contrasting institutional activity. Despite modest intraday fluctuations, Ethereum’s broader structure shows a market waiting for direction. Trading activity has slowed compared to earlier in the year, suggesting reduced speculative participation rather than heavy distribution. ETH's price trends sideways on the daily chart. Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview The Ethereum Price Key Levels Define the Short-Term Outlook Support near the $3,020–$3,000 zone remains critical. This area has been tested multiple times and continues to act as a floor for price action. A sustained break below it would likely expose the Ethereum price to a deeper pullback, with some analysts pointing to demand zones closer to $2,900 or even the $2,600–$2,500 range if downside momentum accelerates. On the upside, resistance between $3,150 and $3,400 continues to cap recovery attempts. Ethereum remains below major moving averages and a descending trendline that has guided price action since November. Analysts note that a daily close above this resistance band, supported by rising volume, would be required to shift the current corrective bias and signal a trend change. Diverging Technical Signals Add to Uncertainty Technical interpretations remain mixed. Elliott Wave analysts argue Ethereum may be approaching a potential Wave 3 phase, which historically has coincided with strong upward moves. However, others highlight the lack of demand strength and repeated rejections near resistance as signs that upside moves remain corrective rather than impulsive. On-chain data adds another layer of complexity. Liquidation heatmaps reveal dense clusters above current prices, particularly in the $3,400–$3,700 range, suggesting a potential magnet for price if momentum builds. At the same time, thinner liquidity below current levels implies that a downside sweep could occur before any sustained rally develops. Institutional Flows Contrast With Price Stagnation While the Ethereum price action remains compressed, institutional involvement continues to grow. U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs recorded roughly $209 million in net inflows during the past week, led by BlackRock’s ETHA. Separately, BitMine Immersion Technologies has continued accumulating Ether, now holding a sizable share of the circulating supply as part of a long-term treasury strategy.

The claim usually follows a familiar arc: quantum computing is advancing quickly, cryptography is vulnerable, and Bitcoin isn’t adapting fast enough. Marty Bent doesn’t buy that framing. In his Dec. 14 episode, Bent acknowledged that quantum computing represents a genuine risk — not just for Bitcoin, but for any system built on modern cryptography — while pushing back on the idea that Bitcoin developers are ignoring the issue. “Short answer is yes, it is a risk,” Bent said. “But it’s not only a risk for Bitcoin. It’s a risk for any system that depends on cryptography for security.” What Developers Are Doing To Make Bitcoin Quantum-Safe What tends to get lost, he argued, is the work already underway. Bent pointed to ongoing developer discussions and, more recently, a research paper published by Blockstream’s Jonas Nick and Mikhail Kutunov examining hash-based, post-quantum signature schemes tailored specifically for Bitcoin. “I just wanted to make this video to push back on that notion,” Bent said, referring to claims that Bitcoin isn’t moving fast enough. “Because I think it’s pretty clear if you’ve been following Bitcoin development discussions over the last year, the quantum risk is certainly being taken seriously and the conversations have started.” Nick summarized the paper in a Dec. 9 post on X, describing it as an analysis of post-quantum schemes optimized for Bitcoin’s constraints rather than generic cryptographic benchmarks. Bent described the work as a signal that research is shifting from abstract concern to concrete design space. Hash-based signatures are conceptually simple and rely solely on hash functions, which is a primitive Bitcoin already trusts. While NIST has standardized SLH-DSA (SPHINCS+), we investigate alternatives that are better suited to Bitcoin’s specific needs. — ncklr (@n1ckler) December 9, 2025 Nick wrote via X: “Hash-based signatures are conceptually simple and rely solely on hash functions, which is a primitive Bitcoin already trusts. While NIST has standardized SLH-DSA (SPHINCS+), we investigate alternatives that are better suited to Bitcoin’s specific needs. We explore in detail how various optimizations and parameter choices affect size and performance. Signature size can be reduced to ~3-4KB, which is comparable to lattice-based signature schemes (ML-DSA).” The challenge, Bent emphasized, isn’t a lack of candidate solutions. It’s that Bitcoin is a globally distributed system with nearly 17 years of operational history, and changes at the protocol level come with heavy trade-offs.“Bitcoin is a globally distributed peer-to-peer system that depends on consensus protocol rules that are very hard to change,” Bent said. “And you really don’t want to change them too often.” That reality complicates any transition to quantum-resistant signatures . Existing address types, HD wallets, multisig setups, and threshold schemes all need to be considered. And beyond compatibility, there’s the question of performance. “One of the biggest hurdles when approaching this problem in Bitcoin is that many quantum-resistant schemes are very data intensive,” Bent said. “Yes, there are many different schemes that can be implemented. However, they come with trade-offs — particularly verification and bandwidth trade-offs.” Larger signatures can slow block propagation and make it more expensive to run a full node, which directly impacts decentralization. The Blockstream paper focuses heavily on that tension, exploring optimizations that could reduce signature sizes to a few kilobytes while keeping verification costs manageable. “They feel pretty confident that they’ve done the research to find signature schemes that would have a nice trade-off balance,” Bent said. “You get quantum resistance, but at the same time it remains conducive for people to download full nodes and verify transactions without needing a significant amount of bandwidth and data storage.” Bent was careful not to frame the research as a finished solution. Instead, he described it as groundwork — mapping the problem space early so the network isn’t caught flat-footed if quantum capabilities advance faster than expected. “This is by no means like, ‘hey, we solved the problem,’” he said. “But we are taking this problem seriously, doing research and beginning to figure out ways in which we could solve the quantum risk that may or may not manifest in the medium to long term.” He also noted that BTC tends to be singled out in quantum discussions, even though most of the internet relies on cryptographic assumptions that would face similar pressure in a true post-quantum scenario. “If quantum computers do come, Bitcoin is not the only thing,” Bent said. “Almost everything you touch on the internet is depending on some cryptographic security at some point.” Everyone’s panicking about quantum computing killing bitcoin. But they’re ignoring what just got released. @martybent explains. pic.twitter.com/uyRIjpGuNY — TFTC (@TFTC21) December 14, 2025 For now, Bent’s takeaway was measured. Quantum risk exists . Progress in quantum computing is real. But the narrative that developers are ignoring the issue doesn’t align with what’s happening in technical circles. “Very smart developers, cryptographers more importantly, are researching the problem,” he said. “If you know where to look, it’s pretty clear that people are preparing for this.” Not solved. Not ignored. Just quietly being worked on.

The new advisory division will work directly with banks, fintech firms, merchants, and global enterprises to help them assess market opportunities, craft go‑to‑market strategies, and build and implement stablecoin‑enabled solutions. Visa says the offering combines its payments expertise with specialized crypto market insights and consulting capabilities at a time when the stablecoin market capitalization exceeds $300 billion . In a statement, Carl Rutstein, Global Head of Visa Consulting & Analytics (VCA), Visa’s internal strategic consulting arm, explained that the goal of assisting customers in growth is the primary reason for expanding their reach in the stablecoin ecosystem. Notably, Rutstein made these remarks during an interview, where he also noted, “What Visa is doing in this area addresses a clear need for our clients.” The advisory practice is already engaging with early partners, helping them explore stablecoin use cases that range from cost-efficient cross-border payments to innovative treasury and liquidity management strategies. Several payment giants demonstrate growing interest in the stablecoin ecosystem Stablecoins are a specific type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, unlike volatile assets like Bitcoin, by being “pegged” to a stable external asset, typically a fiat currency such as the US dollar or a commodity like gold. When pegged to the US dollar, stablecoins are designed to maintain a steady value, typically at a 1:1 ratio with the dollar. Recently, analysts have noted a growing trend in the industry, where several traditional finance firms have begun adopting this cryptocurrency following US President Donald Trump’s move to sign the GENIUS Act in July. This bill established clear regulations for issuing stablecoins. Regarding Trump’s move, sources noted that the House passed the bill on July 17, 2025, and the President signed the new legislation into law the following day. Since then, PayPal and Mastercard, among other major payment companies, have decided to enhance their stablecoin offerings. Rutstein commented on this significant move. He acknowledged that Visa’s stablecoin advisory has a large number of customers. This includes Navy Federal Credit Union, VyStar Credit Union, and a financial institution known as Pathward. He also affirmed that this practice will greatly benefit the businesses by assisting them with their strategies, technology, operations, and execution of stablecoins. Visa’s clients, on the other hand, expressed excitement in the announcement. This is because they utilize stablecoins for various purposes, such as cross-border transactions, particularly in nations with unstable currencies, and business-to-business transactions. Visa exposes itself in the crypto ecosystem After consulting with Visa, Rutstein highlighted that while several businesses have decided to adopt stablecoins in their operations, others may notice that their clients do not demand exposure to stablecoins. Even with this finding, the payment giant still predicted that this practice would expand to include hundreds of customers in the sector. Following this statement, reports mentioned that Visa has been actively participating in the crypto industry for some time. To support this claim, it was confirmed that the firm tested stablecoin settlements using USDC in 2023. Currently, it operates over 130 initiatives for issuing cards connected to stablecoins across more than 40 countries. Additionally, sources reported that Visa handles approximately $3.5 billion in annual stablecoin settlement volume. Following this discovery, Matt Freeman, senior vice president of Navy Federal Credit Union, chose to weigh in on the situation. Freeman declared that stablecoins have the potential to accelerate payment processes and lower costs. “With Visa’s support, we are looking into how this technology can fit into our larger plan to provide real value to our 15 million members around the globe,” he added.

55826663,https://timestabloid.com/?p=92388,1765807520,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Here’s How RLUSD Will Dramatically Increase XRP Price,https://timestabloid.com/heres-how-rlusd-will-dramatically-increase-xrp-price/,"The conversation around XRP’s long-term valuation is often dominated by speculation, emotion, and unrealistic price targets. Yet, beneath the noise, structural shifts are quietly forming that could materially alter how demand for XRP enters the market. One of the most consequential developments is Ripple’s U.S. dollar–pegged stablecoin, RLUSD, which is increasingly being discussed not as a competitor to XRP, but as a catalyst for its repricing within institutional markets. This perspective has been clearly articulated by Xaif in a recent X post, where he outlines how RLUSD could fundamentally change the mechanics of large-scale XRP accumulation . Rather than focusing on hype-driven narratives, the argument centers on market structure, liquidity dynamics, and how institutions actually execute sizable trades in real-world conditions. THIS IS HOW $RLUSD WILL DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE PRICE OF $XRP . #XRPHolders #XRPArmy #XRPL https://t.co/OU0t10eCzJ pic.twitter.com/1MLGQRxu4a — Xaif Crypto| (@Xaif_Crypto) December 14, 2025 RLUSD as a Structural Upgrade to XRP Market Access RLUSD, launched by Ripple in December 2024, is designed as a fully collateralized, U.S. dollar–backed stablecoin aimed at institutional-grade settlement and liquidity operations. Its role is not to replace XRP’s utility, but to remove friction at the point where capital enters the XRP market. Traditionally, large buyers must move fiat through banking rails, manage settlement delays, and absorb volatility before even acquiring XRP. RLUSD compresses that entire process into a stable, on-ledger asset that can be deployed instantly. This matters because institutions do not think in terms of retail-style market entries. They think in size, speed, and certainty. By holding RLUSD, banks and financial institutions can time their XRP purchases precisely, without exposure to interim currency swings or settlement risk. Order Book Dynamics and Price Escalation One of the most critical elements of Xaif’s analysis lies in how large RLUSD-funded buy orders interact with XRP’s exchange order books. XRP liquidity, like all markets, is layered. Lower-priced sell orders are finite. When a sufficiently large buyer enters using a stable, liquid asset like RLUSD, those lower tiers are rapidly consumed. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 As sell-side liquidity thins, the market is forced to reprice upward to find new sellers. This is not theoretical. It is how price discovery works in every exchange-driven market. The difference RLUSD introduces is efficiency. Faster settlement allows sustained buying pressure without the pauses and fragmentation that typically slow institutional accumulation. The Institutional Feedback Loop Once XRP reprices higher, the system does not reset. Institutions using XRP for cross-border payments are primarily motivated by speed, capital efficiency, and cost savings, not short-term price sensitivity. If XRP continues to outperform legacy rails even at higher valuations, demand does not disappear. Instead, RLUSD enables repeated cycles of XRP acquisition and usage , reinforcing a feedback loop where liquidity access and utility coexist. Why This Matters for XRP’s Long-Term Valuation RLUSD does not magically force XRP higher . What it does is remove structural barriers that previously capped how quickly and efficiently large capital pools could enter the market. Over time, this shifts XRP from being primarily retail-driven to increasingly institutionally influenced. In markets, that transition is often where durable repricing begins. In that context, RLUSD should be viewed less as a headline product and more as infrastructure. And as history repeatedly shows, when infrastructure changes, markets follow.

The spot Solana ETF managed by Bitwise Investment has recorded 33 consecutive days of net inflows. Total inflows into the fund have reached $608.9 million, reflecting consistent capital allocation toward Solana exposure. ETF Flows Highlight Institutional Allocation Shifts According to SoSoValue data, Solana spot ETFs have posted weekly net inflows since inception. Assets under management across Solana ETFs stood near $928 million as of Monday. Additionally, none of the seven active Solana ETF products reported net redemptions during the period. This pattern highlights steady demand rather than short-term speculative positioning. Comparatively, Bitcoin spot ETFs attracted $287 million in net inflows during the same week. Ethereum spot ETFs recorded $209 million in net inflows. Solana ETFs added $33.6 million, reinforcing their position as a growing institutional allocation. Hence, Solana continues to secure attention despite lower absolute flows than Bitcoin and Ethereum. Solana Price Action and Market Structure Signals Solana traded at $132.54 during the latest session, posting a daily gain of 1.08%. However, the token remains down 4.25% over the past seven days. Trading volume reached $3.24 billion, while the market capitalization stood near $74.5 billion. With 560 million SOL in circulation, price stability remains a focal point for traders. Source: X Bitcoinsensus highlighted Solana holding a critical technical support zone. The analyst noted that the $120 level acts as a key neckline support. A sustained break below this level could shift broader market structure. Consequently, traders continue monitoring this zone for directional confirmation. Network Participation Trends Add Caution Source: X On-chain activity metrics show contrasting signals beneath the ETF inflow narrative.

While traditional crypto loans offer fixed amounts with preset terms, a more flexible tool has emerged: the revolving crypto credit line. A revolving credit line allows users to borrow against their crypto on demand, repay at their own pace, and borrow again without reapplying. It mirrors the functionality of a traditional revolving credit facility—but it’s powered by digital collateral instead of bank-approved credit. This article explains what a revolving crypto credit line is, how it works, and why platforms like Clapp are leading the shift toward flexible, low-friction crypto borrowing. What Is a Revolving Crypto Credit Line? A revolving crypto credit line is a borrowing facility that uses your digital assets—such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or stablecoins—as collateral. Instead of receiving one fixed loan, you receive a credit limit that remains available 24/7. You can withdraw funds whenever needed, repay at any time, and then withdraw again without submitting a new application. The credit line stays open as long as your collateral remains sufficient. In practice, it's a crypto-native version of a revolving credit account—structured for maximum flexibility. How a Revolving Crypto Credit Line Works While each platform has its own mechanics, the overall process is consistent: 1. Deposit Crypto as Collateral You transfer supported assets to the platform. The value of your collateral determines your credit limit based on the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. 2. Access Your Credit Limit Anytime Once collateral is confirmed, you receive a limit you can draw from at any moment. You’re not obligated to use the full amount. 3. Withdraw Only What You Need You can borrow in increments—small or large—up to your limit. Most platforms offer withdrawals in stablecoins or fiat. 4. Pay Interest Only on What You Use This is the defining advantage over traditional crypto loans. Interest applies only to the amount you’ve withdrawn. Any unused portion of your credit limit stays at zero cost. 5. Repay Whenever You Choose There are no fixed repayment deadlines. You can repay partially or fully at any time, and your available limit refreshes immediately. 6. Retrieve Collateral When the Balance Is Cleared Once your outstanding balance is paid off, your collateral becomes withdrawable again. This ongoing cycle—withdraw, repay, withdraw again—is what makes the credit line ""revolving."" Why Use a Revolving Crypto Credit Line? The structure offers several advantages over traditional loans: Liquidity without selling crypto No taxable sale in many jurisdictions Low carrying cost because unused credit is free Flexible repayment—no schedules or penalties Instant access to stablecoin or fiat liquidity Continuous borrowing without reapplying For long-term holders, this model preserves upside potential while making short-term liquidity easily accessible. Clapp: A Practical Example of a Revolving Crypto Credit Line Among platforms offering revolving credit lines, Clapp provides one of the clearest and most user-friendly implementations. Pay-As-You-Use Interest Structure Clapp charges interest only on the amount you withdraw, not on the full credit limit. Any unused portion remains at 0% APR, keeping carrying costs extremely low Multi-Collateral Support for 19 Assets Users can back their credit line with a diversified set of assets—including BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, LINK, and major stablecoins—expanding borrowing power and allowing strategic collateral management. Full Repayment Flexibility There is no fixed schedule. You can repay partially, fully, or at your own pace, and your available credit refreshes instantly. Instant Liquidity in USDT, USDC, or EUR Funds are available 24/7, making Clapp suitable for both personal and business cash flow needs. This combination of low costs, flexible repayment, and multi-asset support makes Clapp a strong example of how revolving crypto credit lines should function. When a Revolving Credit Line Makes Sense This tool is ideal when you: want liquidity without selling your crypto expect long-term appreciation in your holdings prefer pay-as-you-use borrowing need flexible cash flow want to avoid triggering taxable events value instant access to stablecoins or fiat It's especially useful in volatile markets, where selling crypto too early can mean missing future upside. Final Thoughts A revolving crypto credit line is a powerful financial tool for anyone who holds digital assets and needs liquidity without giving up ownership. It delivers flexibility, low carrying costs, and continuous access to funds—advantages that traditional loans simply can’t match. Platforms like Clapp illustrate how this model can be implemented effectively, giving users a modern borrowing solution designed around their needs, not rigid repayment structures. For long-term holders seeking liquidity and stability, a revolving crypto credit line can be an essential part of a smart financial strategy.",More News,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|FIAT|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitzo', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitzo,2025-12-15 15:32:18

The price action reflects short-term buying interest, but upside momentum remains capped near $0.137–$0.138, where sellers continue to emerge. DOGE price chart, Source: CoinMarketCap Over the past month, Dogecoin has shown a clear bearish trend, forming lower highs and lower lows as the price slipped from around $0.162 to near $0.13. This move represents an approximate 20% decline, indicating sustained selling pressure with only weak recovery attempts. Dogecoin Monthly Structure Weakens With Price Below $0.16 The chart shared by Ali Martinez is based on the monthly timeframe, offering a long-term view of Dogecoin’s price structure. DOGE is currently trading near $0.14, following a clear rejection from the major resistance zone between $0.40 and $0.43. That rejection marked the end of a strong bullish phase and initiated a broader corrective move. Since then, the monthly candles show weakening momentum, with price failing to reclaim the $0.16 level, which has now flipped into a key resistance area. Source: X From a long-term technical standpoint, the monthly structure suggests Dogecoin is at a critical juncture. Holding above the $0.12–$0.10 support zone remains essential to prevent further downside, as a breakdown below $0.14 could accelerate selling pressure toward those levels. On the upside, a sustained monthly close back above $0.16 would be needed to signal renewed strength and shift sentiment back in favor of buyers. Dogecoin Holds $0.13 Support as Daily Chart Signals Weak Momentum On the 1-day Dogecoin price chart, the trend remains bearish to sideways, with price trading near $0.136 after a steady decline. DOGE is holding above a key support zone around $0.13–$0.125, where buyers have repeatedly stepped in. On the upside, resistance sits near $0.145–$0.15, a level that continues to limit recovery attempts and define the short-term range. DOGE 1-day price chart, Source: TradingView Looking at the indicators, the RSI (14) is hovering around 40.60, which confirms weak momentum but also indicates the asset is not deeply oversold. This suggests selling pressure is present but slowing. Meanwhile, the MACD remains slightly negative, with the signal and MACD lines still below the zero line, reflecting ongoing bearish momentum. However, the histogram is flattening, hinting at a potential loss of downside strength.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,DOGE|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-15 15:33:33

According to real-time data from Binance’s USDT market, BTC is now trading at approximately $86,923.74. This sudden movement has sent ripples through the investor community, prompting urgent questions about the stability of the recent rally and the market’s immediate future. What’s driving this unexpected downturn, and how should savvy market participants respond? What Caused the Sudden Bitcoin Price Drop? Understanding the Bitcoin price action requires looking beyond a single data point. Market corrections are a normal part of any financial asset’s lifecycle, especially one as volatile as Bitcoin. Several interconnected factors likely contributed to this pullback. First, after a significant period of gains, profit-taking by short-term holders is a common and healthy mechanism. Furthermore, broader macroeconomic signals, such as shifting interest rate expectations or dollar strength, can trigger sell-offs across risk assets, including crypto. Additionally, on-chain data and derivatives market positioning often provide clues. A high level of leveraged long positions can make the market susceptible to a cascade of liquidations if the price moves against traders. Therefore, while the headline Bitcoin price of $86,923.74 grabs attention, the underlying market structure offers the real story. Is This a Buying Opportunity or a Warning Sign? For investors, volatility presents both risk and opportunity. A key question now is whether this dip represents a temporary setback or the start of a deeper correction. Historically, strong bull markets are punctuated by sharp, fear-inducing drops that shake out weak hands before resuming their upward trend. Analyzing support levels is crucial. Key Support: Traders will watch how the Bitcoin price behaves around previous resistance-turned-support zones, potentially near $85,000 or $82,000. Market Sentiment: A shift from “greed” to “fear” in sentiment indicators can sometimes signal a contrarian buying opportunity. Long-Term Holders: The behavior of long-term Bitcoin holders (entities holding for over 155 days) often provides a steadier signal than short-term trader activity. Therefore, context is everything. A drop in the Bitcoin price within a strong macro uptrend for crypto may be viewed differently than a drop amid negative regulatory news or macroeconomic contraction. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Volatility Reacting emotionally to price swings is a common pitfall. Instead, consider a structured approach. First, review your portfolio allocation . Ensure your exposure to volatile assets like Bitcoin aligns with your overall risk tolerance and investment horizon. Second, consider dollar-cost averaging (DCA) . This strategy involves investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, which can smooth out the impact of buying at a peak. It is particularly effective in volatile markets where timing the exact bottom is nearly impossible. Finally, stay informed but avoid noise . Focus on fundamental developments like adoption rates, regulatory clarity, and technological upgrades rather than getting caught in every short-term Bitcoin price fluctuation. The current price of $86,923.74 is a snapshot, not the final chapter. Conclusion: Looking Beyond the Immediate Bitcoin Price Dip While the break below $87,000 for the Bitcoin price is notable, it is essential to maintain a long-term perspective. Cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile, and corrections are a feature, not a bug. This event serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of risk management, fundamental research, and emotional discipline. By focusing on the underlying value proposition and technological trajectory of Bitcoin, investors can navigate short-term turbulence with greater confidence. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Why did the Bitcoin price fall below $87,000? The drop is likely due to a combination of profit-taking after recent gains, adjustments in broader macroeconomic expectations, and potential liquidations in the over-leveraged derivatives market. Should I buy Bitcoin now that the price has dropped? This depends on your individual financial strategy. Some investors see dips as buying opportunities, but it’s crucial to assess your risk tolerance and consider strategies like dollar-cost averaging rather than trying to time the market perfectly. How low could the Bitcoin price go? Predicting exact price floors is difficult. Traders often watch key historical support levels, but market sentiment and external news flow are significant factors that can change rapidly. Does this price drop mean the bull market is over? Not necessarily. Healthy bull markets frequently experience sharp corrections. The long-term trend is determined by fundamental factors like adoption, institutional investment, and macroeconomic conditions, not by a single day’s price movement. Where can I reliably track the Bitcoin price? Reputable cryptocurrency data aggregators (like CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap) and major exchange websites provide real-time price information. Always cross-reference data from multiple trusted sources. What is the best way to protect my investment during volatility? Employ sound risk management: only invest what you can afford to lose, diversify your portfolio, avoid using excessive leverage, and focus on a long-term investment horizon to ride out short-term swings.

Borrowing EUR against crypto has emerged as a practical option for users who want instant cash, flexible terms, and continued exposure to long-term holdings such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Solana. In 2026, several regulated or trusted lending platforms now support EUR borrowing backed by crypto collateral. Below is a review of the safest and most reliable providers available to European users today. 1. Clapp — Most Flexible and User-Friendly EUR Credit Line Clapp stands out as the safest and most flexible way to borrow EUR against crypto in Europe. Instead of issuing a fixed-term loan, Clapp offers a revolving crypto credit line, allowing users to draw only what they need and pay interest solely on the amount actually used. Why Clapp leads the market: Borrow EUR, USDT, or USDC instantly Interest only on borrowed amounts, with 0% APR on unused credit No repayment deadlines Supports 19+ collateral assets, including BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, LINK, and stablecoins European-friendly onboarding, SEPA withdrawals, and 24/7 access Clapp combines security, transparency, and flexibility. Its pay-as-you-use structure makes it especially attractive for long-term holders who prefer not to commit to fixed repayment schedules. 2. Nexo — Established Provider With EUR Borrowing Options Nexo is one of Europe’s most recognized crypto lending brands. The platform allows users to borrow in EUR, GBP, or USD against major cryptocurrencies. Key features: Competitive interest rates tied to loyalty tiers Instant approval and no credit checks Option to earn interest on unborrowed assets Regulated custodial partners and insurance coverage Nexo is ideal for users who want a traditional, polished interface with multiple currency options and established operational history. 3. Binance Loans — Deep Liquidity and EUR Access via Exchange Ecosystem Binance offers a range of crypto-backed loan products to European customers, enabling them to borrow stablecoins or fiat equivalents that can be converted to EUR via the exchange. Why users choose Binance: Massive liquidity pools Wide collateral selection Simple borrowing process integrated with trading accounts Flexible loan terms and LTV options While Binance does not provide EUR loans directly in all regions, users can borrow stablecoins and convert to EUR instantly through spot markets or SEPA withdrawal partners. 4. YouHodler — EU-Focused Lending With EUR Support YouHodler is a European crypto lending platform known for transparent terms and built-in EUR withdrawal options. Key traits: EUR, USD, and CHF loans available High loan-to-value ratios EU-friendly onboarding Clear repayment terms YouHodler suits borrowers who want a straightforward, fixed-term crypto loan available directly in EUR without additional conversion steps. 5. CoinLoan (where available) — Regulated European Framework CoinLoan, although undergoing operational restructuring in recent years, has historically been one of the safest European-regulated lending providers. Highlights: EU-licensed custodian EUR borrowing and deposits Conservative LTV ratios for added protection Transparent regulatory reporting CoinLoan is appropriate for users prioritizing regulation, though availability may vary depending on local licensing status. Safest Platforms to Borrow EUR Against Crypto in 2026 Platform Type EUR Access Interest Model Collateral Options Repayment Flexibility Ideal For Clapp Revolving crypto credit line Direct EUR & SEPA withdrawals Interest only on used funds; 0% APR on unused limit 19+ assets (BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, LINK, stablecoins) No schedule; repay anytime Users needing maximum flexibility and lowest carrying cost Nexo CeFi credit line & loans EUR, GBP, USD loans Variable rates based on loyalty tier Wide asset support Flexible, no penalties Borrowers wanting a blend of credit options and yield Binance Loans Exchange-based crypto loans EUR via stablecoin conversion & SEPA partners Fixed or variable Broad collateral range Flexible within loan terms Users already active on Binance wanting liquidity YouHodler Fixed-term loans Direct EUR loans Fixed APR BTC, ETH, stablecoins Set repayment schedule Borrowers preferring traditional loan structure CoinLoan (where available) EU-regulated crypto loans Direct EUR Conservative fixed APR Major assets Fixed schedule Users prioritizing EU regulation and custodial safety How to Borrow EUR Against Crypto The borrowing process is usually simple across all platforms: Select a provider that supports EUR or EUR-convertible withdrawals. Deposit collateral — Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins, or supported altcoins. Choose loan type — revolving credit line (Clapp, Nexo) or fixed-term loan (YouHodler, Binance). Receive EUR instantly via SEPA, stablecoins converted into EUR, or direct EUR withdrawal. Repay at your pace — depending on platform terms. Retrieve your collateral once the balance is cleared. Crypto loans in Europe do not require credit checks, as the collateral fully secures the loan. Safest Practices for Borrowing Against Crypto Even the safest platforms require careful attention to: Collateral volatility — maintain a safe buffer above liquidation thresholds Loan-to-value (LTV) ratios Platform security and custodial partners Clear repayment policies Regulatory compliance within the EU or EEA Choosing a provider with transparent terms and proven operational history dramatically reduces risk. Final Thoughts Borrowing EUR against crypto is now easier and safer than ever for European users. Whether you prefer a flexible, commitment-free credit line like Clapp’s or a more traditional fixed-term loan structure, the platforms above offer reliable and efficient ways to unlock liquidity without selling long-term holdings. Clapp remains the top pick for 2026 due to its pay-as-you-use interest model, multi-collateral support, instant EUR access, and highly flexible repayment terms — all essential for borrowers who value control and cost efficiency.

55830832,645369,1765813488,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55830832.jpeg,Биткоин — «цифровой Лабубу». Крипторынок — один большой мем?,https://bitcoinist.com/ru-bitkoin-cifrovoy-labubu-kriptorynok-odin-bolshoy-mem/,"Когда $BTC в один день может резко просесть и так же быстро отскочить, рынок снова вспоминает простую истину: в крипте цена часто движется не только фундаменталом, но и настроением толпы. На прошлой неделе Associated Press описало эпизод, когда биткоин кратковременно опускался ниже $85 000, а затем стабилизировался около $86 650, на фоне ухода инвесторов в «тихие гавани» и фиксации прибыли. Нетрудно понять, почему старший руководитель крупной инвестиционной компании Vanguard Джон Амэрикс раскритиковал первую криптовалюту, назвав ее цифровым аналогом игрушки Лабубу. В такие периоды мем‑сегмент ведет себя особенно показательно. Когда «серьезные деньги» осторожничают, розничные трейдеры чаще ищут не «идеальный актив», а историю, в которую легко поверить и которую легко обсуждать. И если рынок становится «одним большим мемом», то выигрывают проекты, которые прямо превращают торговлю в игру, а участие — в принадлежность к сообществу. На этом фоне неудивительно, что внимание перетекает в мем‑токены с «культурой трейдинга»: они не обещают решить все проблемы мира, но решают более приземленную — удерживают интерес, когда хочется действия. В этой логике Maxi Doge становится не «еще одним мемом», а попыткой упаковать азарт высокорисковой торговли в понятный, вирусный и соревновательный формат. У многих розничных игроков одна и та же боль: «киты» двигают рынок объемом, а им остается либо догонять движение, либо искать способ усилить свой результат через дисциплину, стратегию и сообщество на биржах криптовалют . Именно здесь проекты вроде Maxi Doge стараются сыграть роль «социального рычага», который компенсирует нехватку капитала вовлеченностью и механиками. КУПИТЬ MAXI DOGE Почему мем‑рынок снова превращается в арену для трейдеров Последние месяцы показали, что спекулятивные нарративы возвращаются волнами: как только биткоин перестает быть «прямой линией вверх», аудитория разбивается на два лагеря. Одни уходят в ожидание и кеш. Другие — в краткосрочную охоту за доходностью, где мем‑сектор становится витриной настроений и риска. Статистические обзоры рынка отмечают , что в 2025 году дневные объемы торгов мем‑монетами регулярно превышали $5 млрд, а сама категория переживала резкие ускорения роста в отдельные периоды. Это не гарантия доходности, но маркер спроса на «истории», которые быстро распространяются и быстро конвертируются в сделки. Отсюда и конкуренция форматов. Одни мем‑проекты делают ставку на «картинку и шутку». Другие — на геймификацию, турниры, стимулы для удержания и социальные механики. В такой гонке Maxi Doge — лишь один из вариантов, но он вписывается в тренд «мем как торговое сообщество». Как Maxi Doge упаковывает «культуру 1000x» в соревнование Центральная идея Maxi Doge — культ «королевского» плеча. С практической стороны проект делает акцент на соревновательной механике: закрытые для участников конкурсы по результативности торговли с таблицами лидеров и наградами. Это важный сдвиг для мем‑сегмента: внимание удерживается не только обещанием пампа, но и регулярным событием. Вокруг него строится активность сообщества. Триггеры интереса уже заметны в цифрах. Предпродажа привлекла $4,3 млн, а токены предлагаются по $0,000273 — это дает четкую метрику спроса, которую рынок обычно отслеживает в реальном времени. При этом данные по крупным покупкам тоже подогревают историю: трекеры показывают 2 значимые транзакции на общую сумму $503K. Крупнейшая — на $251K от 11 октября 2025 года. $MAXI подойдет тем, кто ищет мем‑проект, который делает ставку на дисциплину, турниры и культуру трейдинга.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|ZRX|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-15 15:44:48

This intense volatility serves as a brutal reminder of the high-stakes nature of leveraged trading. But what triggered this cascade, and more importantly, what does it mean for your portfolio? Let’s break down the events and uncover the crucial lessons every trader must learn. What Does “$210 Million in Futures Liquidated” Actually Mean? When we talk about futures being liquidated, we’re referring to the forced closure of leveraged trading positions. Essentially, exchanges automatically sell a trader’s assets when their position loses too much value to cover the initial borrowed funds, or margin. Therefore, the $210 million futures liquidated in 60 minutes represents a massive, synchronized wave of margin calls. This event is often a key indicator of extreme market sentiment and leverage unwinding at a rapid pace. Why Did This Massive Liquidation Wave Happen? Such a concentrated burst of futures liquidated doesn’t occur in a vacuum. It’s typically the result of a sharp, unexpected price movement that catches over-leveraged traders on the wrong side of the market. Common catalysts include: Major News Events: Surprising regulatory announcements or macroeconomic data. Large Whale Movements: A single entity executing a sizable trade that shifts momentum. Liquidity Crunch: Thin order books that amplify price swings. Cascading Effect: Initial liquidations trigger further price moves, forcing more liquidations in a vicious cycle. The past 24-hour total of $450 million underscores that this was not an isolated spike but part of a broader period of market stress. How Can Traders Navigate This Volatility? Witnessing $210 million in futures liquidated is a powerful lesson in risk management. To protect yourself from being caught in the next liquidation storm, consider these actionable strategies: Use Lower Leverage: High leverage magnifies both gains and losses. Sticking to conservative multiples reduces liquidation risk. Set Stop-Loss Orders: Define your maximum loss beforehand. A stop-loss can execute a controlled exit before a margin call. Monitor Funding Rates: Extremely high positive or negative funding rates can signal overcrowded trades and potential reversals. Diversify and Hedge: Don’t put all your capital into leveraged futures. A balanced portfolio with spot holdings can provide a buffer. Remember, the goal is to survive the downturns to participate in the recoveries. What’s the Broader Impact on the Crypto Market? A cascade of futures liquidated on this scale has ripple effects beyond just the traders involved. Firstly, it can lead to increased market volatility as forced selling pressures prices. Secondly, it often flushes out excessive leverage, which can create a healthier foundation for the next move, even if it’s painful in the short term. Moreover, such events test the resilience of exchange infrastructure and remind all participants of the inherent risks in speculative trading. The Essential Takeaway from Today’s Market Shock The headline of $210 million in futures liquidated is more than just a number—it’s a story of volatility, leverage, and market psychology. These events are inevitable in the crypto landscape. The key for informed investors is not to fear them but to understand their mechanics. By respecting the power of leverage and prioritizing capital preservation, you can navigate these turbulent waves without becoming another statistic in the next liquidation report. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What causes a futures liquidation? A futures liquidation occurs when a trader’s position loses enough value that their remaining margin can no longer cover potential losses. The exchange then forcibly closes the position to prevent further debt. Are liquidations bad for the overall market? In the short term, liquidations cause volatility and selling pressure. However, they can also remove excessive leverage from the system, which may lead to a more stable price foundation afterward. How can I check if liquidations are happening? You can use data websites like CoinGlass or Bybit’s heatmap to see real-time liquidation volumes across exchanges, often displayed per price level. Does a high liquidation volume mean the price will reverse? Not necessarily. While a “long squeeze” (where many long positions are liquidated) can sometimes mark a local bottom, it doesn’t guarantee an immediate reversal. Market context is crucial. What’s the difference between liquidated and stopped out? Being “stopped out” means your pre-set stop-loss order was triggered. Being “liquidated” is a forced closure by the exchange because your maintenance margin was breached, often resulting in total loss of the position’s margin. Can I get my money back after a liquidation? Typically, no. The liquidation process closes your position, and any remaining margin (if any) is returned. The majority of the margin used to open the leveraged trade is lost. Share This Insight Did this breakdown help you understand the dramatic market move? Knowledge is power in crypto trading.

The share offer had been marketed between HK$5.95 and HK$6.95, and demand came in heavy across the book. The stock is set to debut Wednesday as Hong Kong closes out a packed year for listings under President Donald Trump’s global economic backdrop. Investors chased the deal hard, with heavy interest in far more stock than what was available. The top 20 entities took roughly 80% of the institutional tranche, not counting the shares already set aside for cornerstone buyers. HashKey’s listing lands during a messy time for crypto after Bitcoin dropped about 30% from its October peak. The debut also puts a spotlight on Hong Kong’s attempt to build itself into a digital-asset hub. Hong Kong pushes listings as HashKey enters market HashKey entered Hong Kong’s licensing regime early after the city rolled out its digital-asset framework in 2022, running businesses in crypto trading, venture capital and asset management. HashKey said it plans to use the IPO money to grow its tech stack, expand its infrastructure, bring in more workers and strengthen its risk systems. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Guotai Junan acted as joint sponsors of the offering. Hong Kong’s IPO market is on track for its busiest month in at least four years. Nineteen companies either listed or set their plans for a December debut, the strongest month since July 2021, according to Bloomberg data. Some companies are still testing demand before taking orders. The city has already raised more than $34 billion from listings this year, the highest level since 2021. Andy Wong, IPO leader at SW Hong Kong, said companies may be rushing to wrap deals before 2026, when new risks could hit valuations. Alongside HashKey, the lineup of new listings includes Guoxia Technology, CiDi, Jingdong Industrials, a unit of JD.com, and chip designer Suzhou Novosense Microelectronics Co. Both Jingdong Industrials and Suzhou Novosense started trading last week and are now under their issue prices. More companies test demand as year-end rush grows Companies gauging investor interest this week include chip designer OmniVision Integrated Circuits Group, which may raise up to $1 billion, and drug-discovery company Insilico Medicine, which may target about $300 million. Shanghai Forest Cabin Cosmetics Group Co. is also checking demand for a possible offering. If all deals move ahead, December listings could raise more than $2.4 billion, based on Bloomberg-compiled figures.

On December 11, HTX unveiled a comprehensive optimization of its copy-trading experience, highlighted by the introduction of the brand-new “Smart Copy” mode. This launch marks a major advance for HTX in social and automated trading, delivering a system that is smarter, more efficient, and highly transparent for global users. To celebrate the milestone and thank users for their long-term support, HTX is launching a month-long trading campaign featuring an 80,000 USDT prize pool. Core Upgrades: Smart Copy and Fund Segregation, Redefining What It Means to Trade Effortlessly In the highly volatile crypto market, smart choices often outperform sheer effort. HTX Futures Copy Trading 4.0 directly addresses two critical user concerns: Who is the best person to follow? And how can I follow them accurately? The new system answers both with enhanced technology and superior user protection. Ultimate Lead Trader Experience: Smooth Operation, Precise Execution. The enhanced trading engine provides a smoother and more precise execution environment. Followers simply input their total investment amount, and the system handles all complexities automatically. Whether mirroring multi-batch entries under sophisticated strategies or executing rapid adjustments during sudden market swings, Copy Trading 4.0 performs instantly, without operational friction. This ensures followers can mirror every trade with high fidelity, guaranteeing a truly seamless experience. Smart Copy Mode: Synchronized Profits, Verifiable and Replicable Returns. The newly launched Smart Copy mode elevates the entire system. Traditional copy trading often suffers from slippage and mismatched position sizes, which distort results. Smart Copy eliminates this by tracking the lead trader’s real capital usage and automatically allocating proportionate follow-up amounts. This ensures that followers’ exposure and conviction levels align precisely with the strategies of the trader they choose. A synchronized profit-tracking mechanism guarantees that followers replicate the trader’s actual Profit and Loss (PnL) changes , preventing deviations caused by over- or under-allocating capital. Users can now copy trading strategies, risk structures, and performance with significantly greater accuracy. Innovative Fund Isolation System: Secure Capital, Flexible Control. Another major breakthrough is HTX’s new fund-segregation framework . Historically, copy trading platforms carried the risk of a follower’s capital being unintentionally cross-used across multiple traders. HTX resolves this issue permanently. Each copy trading follower now benefits from a dedicated, isolated capital pool , achieving complete fund and risk segregation. This isolation allows followers to flexibly adjust the investment allocated to each trader, offering strengthened risk control and optimizing overall capital efficiency. This redesign provides a critical layer of protection for all followers. Celebration Carnival: Multiple Rewards to Boost Copy Trading From December 11, 2025 at 10:00 to January 10, 2026 at 10:00 (UTC), HTX is rolling out a special campaign to celebrate the launch of Copy Trading 4.0. Find the official event details here: https://www.htx.com/support/105019503016393 During the event, registered participants can enjoy the following three reward opportunities: Welcome Trial Bonus: Users who add “Copy Trading” to the HTX app homepage will receive a copy trading trial bonus instantly. Rewards are limited to the first 10,000 participants. First-Trade Loss Subsidy: Registered users whose very first copy trade (with a volume of $\ge$100 USDT) results in a loss will receive a subsidy of up to 50 USDT in copy trading trial bonuses. A prize pool of 20,000 USDT is available on a first-come, first-served basis. Cumulative Margin Reward: Users are eligible to share a 50,000 USDT prize pool based on their cumulative margin used for copy trading during the event. Those whose cumulative margin reaches 5,000 USDT will share a dedicated 20,000 USDT pool. Users must upgrade their HTX app to version 11.9.0 or above to ensure full and smooth functionality. The market never lacks opportunities—it only lacks the right tools to seize them. HTX Futures Copy Trading 4.0 is built precisely as that tool. By lowering the barriers between professional traders and everyday users, the system turns sophisticated trading logic into a simple one-tap experience. Every user, regardless of background, gains easy access to professional-level strategies. This upgrade puts true control back into users’ hands for a steadier, more empowered long-term growth.

In 2026, competition among lenders has grown significantly, with platforms offering more flexible credit lines, multi-asset collateral options, and faster access to funds. This review highlights the best crypto lending platforms of 2026, with Clapp leading the list due to its flexible credit-line structure and cost-efficient borrowing model. What Is a Crypto Lending Platform? A crypto lending platform allows users to deposit cryptocurrency as collateral and borrow stablecoins or fiat in return. It functions similarly to secured lending in traditional finance: You lock crypto as collateral You receive a loan or credit line You repay over time Your collateral is released once the debt is cleared Crypto lending platforms fall into two categories: CeFi (centralized finance) — Platforms like Clapp, Nexo, Binance Loans, and CoinRabbit manage custody and loan operations. DeFi (decentralized finance) — Protocols where smart contracts automate borrowing and lending. The appeal of crypto loans is straightforward: you can unlock liquidity without selling your Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other assets. Best Crypto Lending Platforms and Crypto Loans in 2026 1. Clapp — Best Overall for Flexible Borrowing and Multi-Collateral Credit Lines Clapp tops the 2026 list thanks to its revolving crypto credit line, which allows users to borrow only what they need and pay interest solely on the amount they actually use. The unused portion carries 0% APR, making it one of the most cost-efficient borrowing structures available. Key advantages: Interest only on used funds 0% APR on unused credit Up to 19 collateral assets, including BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, LINK, and stablecoins No repayment schedule – borrowers repay anytime Instant liquidity 24/7 in USDT, USDC, or EUR Integrated wallet and exchange for smooth collateral management Clapp’s model is built for users who want maximum flexibility and minimal friction when accessing liquidity. 2. Nexo — Strong All-Purpose CeFi Lending with Loyalty Tiers Nexo continues to be one of the most widely used crypto lending platforms. It offers both fixed-term crypto loans and flexible credit lines, with interest rates tied to a loyalty-tier system. Highlights: Borrow in fiat or stablecoins Flexible repayment options Earn yield on unused assets Long-standing reputation in CeFi lending Nexo is a good choice for users who want a blend of borrowing options and yield-generation features. 3. Binance Loans — High Liquidity and Wide Asset Coverage Backed by one of the world’s largest exchanges, Binance Loans offers dependable access to liquidity with extensive collateral and loan-asset options. Strengths: Large selection of supported cryptocurrencies Fast loan issuance Integrated within the Binance ecosystem Flexible loan terms and LTV ratios Binance Loans suits borrowers who prefer borrowing directly through an exchange they already use. 4. CoinRabbit — Fastest Approval Process for Simple Crypto Loans CoinRabbit is built for speed and simplicity. Users can obtain loans within minutes, with no KYC required in many regions and little onboarding complexity. Features: Very fast loan approval Broad support for altcoins No monthly payments High LTV options on certain assets CoinRabbit appeals to borrowers who want fast liquidity with minimal steps. 5. Arch Lending — Best for Long-Term Fixed-Term Loans Arch Lending offers a more traditional fixed-term crypto-backed loan structure. It provides stable APRs and clear repayment schedules, making it suitable for users who prefer predictable borrowing. Key features: Competitive fixed interest rates Defined payment schedules Loans backed by BTC, ETH, and other major assets Longer borrowing terms for structured planning Arch Lending fits borrowers seeking clarity and discipline rather than flexible, open-ended credit lines. How to Get a Crypto Loan Getting a crypto loan generally follows a simple process: Choose a platform — Decide between flexible credit lines (Clapp, Nexo) or fixed-term loans (Binance, CoinRabbit, Arch). Deposit collateral — Lock your crypto (BTC, ETH, etc.) into the platform. Receive liquidity — Borrow stablecoins or fiat based on your collateral’s value. Repay when ready — Terms vary: some platforms require monthly payments; others (like Clapp) allow full flexibility. Retrieve your collateral — Once the loan is repaid, your crypto is released back to you. Crypto loans do not require credit checks; the loan is secured by your assets. Risks and Benefits of Crypto Loans Benefits Access liquidity without selling crypto No credit checks Immediate approval Retain upside potential if crypto prices rise Flexible borrowing structures depending on the platform Risks Liquidation risk if collateral value drops Interest rate variation across platforms Custodial risk on CeFi platforms Market volatility affecting collateralization ratios Crypto loans are powerful financial tools, but users should monitor collateral values and loan-to-value limits closely. How Are Crypto Loans Taxed? In most jurisdictions: Borrowing against crypto is not a taxable event because you are not selling your assets. Interest paid may or may not be deductible depending on local tax laws. Liquidation events (if your collateral is sold by the platform) may trigger capital gains taxes. Always consult a tax professional, as regulations vary significantly across countries. FAQ: Crypto and Bitcoin Lending Platforms Do I lose ownership of my crypto when I take a loan? No. You retain ownership, but the platform holds your assets as collateral until the loan is repaid. Is borrowing against Bitcoin taxable? Generally no, because you aren’t selling your BTC. Borrowing is considered non-taxable in many regions. What happens if the market drops? If collateral value falls below required levels, the platform may request additional collateral or liquidate part of your holdings to maintain the loan’s health. Can I repay early? Most platforms allow early repayment with no penalties. Clapp and Nexo offer fully flexible repayment terms. How fast can I get liquidity? Some platforms, like Clapp and CoinRabbit, provide instant access. Binance Loans and Nexo are also fast but may require additional steps. Which platform offers the most flexibility? Clapp offers the most flexible borrowing model due to its pay-as-you-use credit line, 0% APR on unused funds, and no repayment schedule.

The project, which recently rebranded from MakerDAO, announced it repurchased a staggering 34.10 million SKY tokens in just seven days. This latest maneuver represents a significant acceleration in their ongoing commitment to token value and ecosystem health. Let’s dive into what this massive Sky Protocol buyback means for investors and the broader cryptocurrency market. What Exactly Is the Sky Protocol Buyback Program? The Sky Protocol buyback initiative began in February 2025 as a strategic effort to support token value and demonstrate confidence in the project’s future. Think of it as a company buying back its own stock from the open market. This latest seven-day burst saw Sky Protocol spend 1.90 million USDS to acquire those 34.10 million SKY tokens. The scale is remarkable when you consider the cumulative impact. Since the program’s inception, Sky Protocol has now deployed over $92 million toward token repurchases. This represents approximately 5.55% of SKY’s total circulating supply. Such substantial buyback activity typically signals strong fundamentals and management’s belief that tokens are undervalued. However, it also raises important questions about long-term sustainability and strategic direction. Why Would a Protocol Execute Such Massive Buybacks? Token buybacks serve multiple strategic purposes in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. For Sky Protocol, this aggressive buyback strategy likely addresses several key objectives: Price Support: Reducing circulating supply can create upward pressure on token prices Investor Confidence: Demonstrating commitment through capital allocation Treasury Management: Deploying excess protocol revenue productively Tokenomics Optimization: Fine-tuning supply dynamics for long-term health The timing of this accelerated Sky Protocol buyback is particularly interesting. Coming shortly after their rebranding from MakerDAO, it suggests a deliberate effort to establish new momentum and market positioning. When a protocol commits this level of resources to buybacks, it’s essentially making a public statement about its financial health and future prospects. How Does This Impact SKY Token Holders? For current SKY token holders, this aggressive buyback creates several immediate effects. First, the reduced circulating supply means each remaining token represents a slightly larger share of the protocol. Second, such substantial market activity typically increases trading volume and liquidity. Third, it signals management’s confidence, which can influence market sentiment. However, investors should consider the complete picture. While buybacks can be positive, they also represent capital that’s not being deployed elsewhere in the ecosystem. The key question becomes: Is this the most productive use of $92 million? Could these funds have been better used for development, partnerships, or ecosystem grants? Sky Protocol’s leadership clearly believes the buyback delivers optimal value. What Challenges Come With Aggressive Buyback Strategies? While the Sky Protocol buyback appears impressive on surface, such strategies come with inherent challenges. Sustaining this pace requires consistent protocol revenue generation. Market conditions must remain favorable to avoid buying at inflated prices. There’s also the risk of creating artificial price support that might collapse if buybacks slow or stop. Furthermore, excessive focus on token price through buybacks might distract from fundamental protocol development. The most successful blockchain projects typically balance token economics with technological innovation and ecosystem growth. Sky Protocol will need to demonstrate it can maintain this equilibrium while executing its ambitious buyback program. The Future of Sky Protocol After This Buyback Surge Looking forward, the Sky Protocol buyback program raises important questions about the project’s trajectory. Will they continue this aggressive pace? How will they fund future buybacks? What percentage of total supply do they ultimately aim to repurchase? These considerations will significantly influence investor decisions in coming months. The rebranding from MakerDAO to Sky Protocol represented more than just a name change—it signaled a strategic shift. This buyback acceleration suggests that shift includes a stronger emphasis on token value and investor returns. As the DeFi landscape evolves, Sky Protocol’s approach to capital allocation through mechanisms like this buyback will be closely watched by both supporters and competitors. Conclusion: A Bold Statement in Volatile Markets Sky Protocol’s seven-day acquisition of 34.10 million SKY tokens represents more than just a financial transaction—it’s a powerful statement of confidence during uncertain market conditions. By committing over $92 million to their buyback program, the protocol’s leadership has placed a substantial bet on their own future. This move will likely influence how other DeFi projects approach token economics and investor relations in 2025 and beyond. For cryptocurrency investors, the Sky Protocol buyback serves as a case study in proactive token management. It demonstrates how protocols can use their treasury resources to directly influence token dynamics while signaling strength to the market. However, as with any aggressive financial strategy, long-term success will depend on sustainable execution and balanced ecosystem development. Frequently Asked Questions What happens to the SKY tokens after Sky Protocol buys them back? Typically, repurchased tokens are either permanently burned (removed from circulation) or held in a treasury for future ecosystem use. Sky Protocol hasn’t specified their exact disposition, but either approach reduces circulating supply. How does a token buyback differ from token burning? A buyback involves purchasing tokens from the open market, while burning permanently destroys tokens. Buybacks can be temporary if tokens are held rather than burned, but both reduce circulating supply. Does this buyback guarantee SKY token price will increase? Not necessarily. While reduced supply can create upward pressure, token prices depend on multiple factors including overall market conditions, protocol adoption, and broader cryptocurrency trends. Where does Sky Protocol get the funds for these buybacks? Protocols typically fund buybacks through treasury reserves, protocol revenue, or previously allocated ecosystem funds. Sustainable buybacks require consistent revenue generation. How can investors verify the buyback actually happened? Investors can check blockchain explorers for transactions from Sky Protocol’s treasury wallets to verify buyback activity. Reputable projects usually provide transparency through regular reporting. Will Sky Protocol continue buybacks at this accelerated pace? The protocol hasn’t announced long-term buyback schedules. Future activity will likely depend on market conditions, token prices, and protocol financial performance. Found this analysis of Sky Protocol’s aggressive buyback strategy helpful?

SOL quickly translated from a small, relatively unknown crypto to a leader within the markets. Although SOL has evolved into a large-cap crypto with a more muted growth trajectory, individuals seeking the best crypto to buy are now looking further back in the growth curve, to projects which are still small, undervalued, but quickly gaining steam. This has led to a newfound appreciation for a crypto that has been on the edge of full development, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is now in full force, deep within Phase 6 of its presale, nearing completion with over 18,480 distinct holders already on board, all at a price of merely $0.035, the next big crypto. Solana is Holding Key Support Levels as Bulls Target a Trend Reversal The current price of Solana (SOL) is managing to stick to a position above $126, with a strong long lower wick on Thursday’s candlestick indicating that the bulls are heavily supporting this area. Although the short-term outlook is still cautious but generally positive, it has been observed that a strong breakthrough above the 50-day SMA at $152 is required to authenticate a larger long-term trend shift, which might bring about a positive revision in prices to $172 and further to $190. On the negative side, a failure to sustain support at $126 might bring about accelerated downside pressure, taking prices towards $100 and further reinforced support at $95. Meanwhile, as Solana is undergoing such a critical technical juncture, investor interest begins to widen from established assets to Mutuum Finance that is still gaining traction as the next big crypto. The presale of the MUTM token is picking up pace Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly setting itself up to be a leading DeFi project in 2026. The presale is currently at Phase 6, with a price tag of $0.035, giving newcomers a last chance to buy before the price rises to $0.04 in Phase 7. The DeFi platform has also introduced a smoother on-ramp by providing support for buying with credit/debit cards. The two-lending system of the project has generated a lot of interest with regard to scalability and efficiency. The platform is capable of connecting lenders with borrowers via strong liquidity pools, ensuring that the yields are attractive while optimizing resource use. Having managed to raise over $19.5 million from over 18,480 participants, MUTM is gradually becoming the best crypto to buy for startup investment. Transparency & Accessibility, Success in Presales Transparency and accessibility are what Mutuum Finance focuses on when it comes to presale. In total, it has 4 billion tokens, with 1.82 billion set for presale, having sold over 800 million at that stage. The addition of card payment methods means that even a beginner investor can comfortably take part, thereby expanding the scope of the project. By the end of 2025, MUTM is set to be one of the most-watched DeFi tokens and a leading candidate for the next big crypto. Roadmap Progress: From Development to Mainnet Launch It is now at Phase 2: Building Mutuum, which is a technological development stage. The milestones of this phase are the completion of smart contracts, internal testing, development of front-end and back-end components of the DApp, and implementation of sophisticated risk management systems. Phase 3 will see beta releases on the Sepolia Testnet, along with a thorough security audit, to prepare for the launch on the V1 Mainnet. This is a strategic plan towards developing a safe, scalable, and optimized DeFi environment, putting MUTM at the forefront with real utility and potential for growth in the year 2026. The breakout in 2021 that Solana experienced is a testament to the power of early growth. The presale project, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which started with a price of only $0.035, is now in Phase 6, with over 18,480 wallet holders, closing in on a total of $19.5 million. The presale is set to proceed to Phase 7, which increases the price to $0.04, another stage before the price increases, positioning MUTM as the best crypto to buy for early-stage investors and the next big crypto to watch.

Early in the session, the price dipped from $0.5807 to $0.5592 as sellers outweighed buyers, reflecting cautious sentiment among traders. Additionally, technical resistance around $0.580–$0.583 has limited upward momentum, preventing bulls from driving a sustained rally. Moderate trading volume also indicates cautious market participation, which contributes to minor declines. WLD’s slight drop of 0.23% reflects a temporary pullback within its ongoing consolidation range between $0.560 and $0.583, with short-term oscillations expected until a decisive breakout or breakdown occurs.

55831403,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=245543,1765814412,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Defiant Bitcoin OG Doubles Down: Adds 10,000 ETH to Long Position Amid $37.7M Loss",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-og-adds-10000-eth/,"BitcoinWorld Defiant Bitcoin OG Doubles Down: Adds 10,000 ETH to Long Position Amid $37.7M Loss In a move that defies conventional wisdom, a veteran cryptocurrency investor known as a Bitcoin OG has made a staggering addition to their portfolio. According to data from Onchainlens, the investor behind wallet address ‘1011short’ has increased their Ethereum long position by a massive 10,000 ETH. This bold decision comes while their overall portfolio sits at an unrealized loss exceeding $37.7 million. What does this tell us about veteran conviction in a volatile market? Who Is This Defiant Bitcoin OG? While the identity behind ‘1011short’ remains private, their on-chain activity paints a picture of a seasoned, high-conviction investor. A true Bitcoin OG typically refers to early adopters who have weathered multiple market cycles. Their current holdings are nothing short of monumental, showcasing a diversified yet heavily weighted strategy: 199,350 ETH (worth approximately $574 million) 1,000 BTC (worth approximately $87 million) 250,000 SOL (worth approximately $32 million) This portfolio, valued at nearly $700 million, indicates this is not a retail trader but a major market participant whose moves are watched closely. Why Would a Bitcoin OG Buy More ETH at a Loss? This is the million-dollar—or rather, multi-million-dollar—question. Adding to a losing position, known as ‘averaging down,’ is a high-conviction strategy. For this Bitcoin OG , it suggests several possible beliefs: Long-Term Belief in Ethereum: The investment is likely not about short-term price swings but the long-term utility and adoption of the Ethereum network. Market Cycle Perspective: Veterans often see downturns as accumulation opportunities, buying assets they believe are undervalued relative to their future potential. Portfolio Rebalancing: The move could be part of a strategic shift to increase exposure to Ethereum’s ecosystem ahead of anticipated developments. Essentially, this Bitcoin OG is signaling that the current price does not reflect their assessment of Ethereum’s fundamental value. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market? The actions of large holders, or ‘whales,’ can serve as a sentiment indicator. When a Bitcoin OG with such a significant portfolio makes a move this large, it’s worth noting. It demonstrates that sophisticated capital remains active and confident during periods of fear or uncertainty. However, it’s crucial to remember: This is a single data point, not a market-wide trend. Whales can be wrong, and their high-risk strategies are not suitable for everyone. It highlights the importance of on-chain analysis for understanding market dynamics beneath the surface price action. Key Takeaways from the Bitcoin OG’s Move The story of this Bitcoin OG provides powerful lessons for any market participant. First, it underscores the difference between trading and investing. This appears to be a strategic investment based on deep conviction, not a reactive trade. Second, it shows that successful veterans often operate on a different timeline, thinking in terms of years, not days. Finally, it reminds us that unrealized losses on paper are just that—unrealized—until an asset is sold. In conclusion, the decision by this anonymous Bitcoin OG to significantly increase their ETH long position is a masterclass in contrarian investing. While swimming against a $37.7 million loss tide seems reckless to some, for a veteran with a proven track record and immense resources, it may be a calculated bet on a future they strongly believe in. It serves as a compelling narrative of conviction over fear in the unpredictable world of cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Bitcoin OG? A Bitcoin OG (Original Gangster) is a term used in the crypto community to describe early adopters and investors in Bitcoin who have been involved since the asset’s infancy. They are typically seen as seasoned veterans with significant experience across market cycles. What does “adding to a long position” mean? Adding to a long position means buying more of an asset that you already own, with the expectation that its price will increase in the future. It is often done to lower the average purchase price of the investment. Is following whale moves like this a good investment strategy? While observing whale activity can provide insight into market sentiment, it is not a standalone investment strategy. Whales have different risk profiles, capital, and goals than most investors. Their moves should be considered as one piece of a much larger research puzzle. What is an unrealized loss? An unrealized loss is a decrease in the value of an investment that you still hold. The loss is “on paper” and only becomes a realized loss if you sell the asset at the lower price. The Bitcoin OG in this story has not sold, so the $37.7M loss is not yet locked in. What tools are used to track these kinds of transactions? Transactions like these are tracked using on-chain analysis tools and explorers (like Onchainlens, Etherscan, etc.) that monitor public blockchain data. These tools can track wallet addresses, transaction sizes, and portfolio compositions. Found this deep dive into a Bitcoin OG’s defiant strategy insightful?

Notably, the largest single liquidation order happened on the Binance cryptocurrency exchange platform, valued at $5.26 million, while Bybit reported the biggest number of liquidations overall ($62.94 million).​ Accounting for the short positions as well, a total of 144,715 traders were liquidated, with the overall liquidations coming in at just shy of $450 million.

Once dismissed as overly optimistic, multi-year price targets are now being revisited within a changing regulatory, financial, and technological environment. As traditional finance increasingly intersects with blockchain infrastructure, the question is no longer whether digital assets will be used at scale, but which networks will capture that value. That context frames a recent commentary by YoungHoon Kim, widely cited as possessing an IQ of 276 , who publicly stated his personal view that XRP could potentially reach $100 within the next five years. While Kim’s statement reflects an individual opinion rather than a market forecast, it has attracted attention due to his reputation for analytical reasoning and the broader structural shifts occurring around Ripple and the XRP Ledger. Based on my personal view, #XRP could potentially reach $100 over the next 5 years. (NFA/DYOR) — YoungHoon Kim, IQ 276 (@yhbryankimiq) December 14, 2025 XRP’s Evolving Market Position XRP remains one of the most actively traded digital assets globally , with deep liquidity across major exchanges. Unlike many cryptocurrencies designed primarily for speculation, XRP was engineered for high-speed value transfer, settling transactions in seconds at minimal cost. This utility-driven design has kept it relevant through multiple market cycles, even during periods of legal and regulatory uncertainty. Since the conclusion of Ripple’s long-running legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 2025, XRP has operated under significantly improved regulatory clarity. That resolution removed a major overhang that had constrained institutional participation, particularly in the United States. Institutional Infrastructure and Supply Dynamics Another structural development is the rise of regulated investment vehicles tied to XRP. Exchange-traded products tracking XRP have already accumulated substantial holdings, tightening available liquid supply. At the same time, custody solutions, compliance frameworks, and institutional-grade on-ramps have matured, making large-scale exposure operationally viable for asset managers. Ripple’s launch of RLUSD, its U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, has also reshaped transaction mechanics within the ecosystem. By enabling institutions to move value using a stable medium before converting it into XRP for settlement, volatility friction is reduced during large transfers. This design supports higher transaction volumes without destabilizing execution. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Utility, Volume, and Valuation Logic XRP’s long-term valuation thesis is closely tied to transaction volume rather than simple scarcity narratives. Global payments, tokenized assets, and on-chain liquidity management collectively represent trillions of dollars in daily settlement potential. If XRP captures even a modest share of these flows, higher price levels become mathematically plausible over extended time horizons. However, a $100 valuation would imply a market capitalization measured in the trillions, requiring sustained utility growth, broad institutional adoption, and favorable macro conditions. Kim’s five-year perspective implicitly assumes compounding adoption rather than short-term speculative spikes. Separating Possibility From Certainty While YoungHoon Kim’s statement has sparked renewed discussion, it does not constitute a prediction or guarantee. XRP reaching $100 would depend on execution, regulation, market structure, and real-world usage scaling in parallel. What is increasingly clear, however, is that XRP’s relevance is no longer hypothetical. As infrastructure solidifies and traditional finance continues to integrate blockchain rails, long-term valuation conversations are shifting from “if” to “under what conditions.” Within that evolving framework, Kim’s view reflects a growing belief that XRP’s ceiling may be far higher than current prices suggest, given enough time and adoption.

The case revives long-running concerns about celebrity-driven crypto promotions and the responsibility of senior ecosystem figures. The controversy unfolded over a sequence of posts on X in mid-December. On December 13, Soulja Boy shared a comparison of creator payout schedules across major platforms, arguing that newer applications offered faster access to earnings than traditional social networks. Twitch pays you once a month. TikTok pays you once a week. Favorited pays you once a day. Choose your poison wisely. — Soulja Boy (Draco) (@souljaboy) December 13, 2025 On-Chain Research Rekindles Concerns Over Celebrity Crypto Promotions Pollak amplified the discussion while framing Base, Coinbase’s Ethereum Layer-2 network, as an alternative monetization layer for creators. In a direct reply to Soulja Boy, Pollak said he had just backed the rapper on Base and had “instantly earned,” describing the interaction as an example of “new internet” behavior enabled by on-chain tools. . @baseapp pays you instantly https://t.co/0XurhOsj1H — jesse.base.eth (@jessepollak) December 13, 2025 Although Pollak did not name or explicitly promote a specific token, many users interpreted the exchange as an endorsement of a Soulja Boy-linked meme token that had just launched on Base. @souljaboy just backed you on @base and you instantly earned. new internet shit https://t.co/CQ5NCvBwXj pic.twitter.com/fmdkt8UsZy — jesse.base.eth (@jessepollak) December 13, 2025 Developers, traders, and researchers questioned why a senior figure at a Coinbase-backed network would publicly engage with a celebrity whose crypto history has drawn repeated scrutiny. The criticism quickly shifted from the token itself to broader concerns about trust, reputation, and showing within the Base ecosystem, which has positioned itself as a compliant, mainstream-friendly Layer-2 network. The debate intensified after on-chain investigator ZachXBT publicly challenged Pollak’s decision to interact with Soulja Boy. Why give SouljaBoy the platform to scam new people? https://t.co/PDxnk0Z0Za — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) December 14, 2025 He pointed to research he published in April 2023 documenting what he described as a long pattern of exploitative crypto promotions tied to the rapper. ZachXBT Details Pattern of Abandoned Crypto Projects Linked to Soulja Boy According to that research, Soulja Boy was involved in at least 73 token promotions and 16 NFT launches, many of which later collapsed or were abandoned. Why give SouljaBoy the platform to scam new people? https://t.co/PDxnk0Z0Za — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) December 14, 2025 ZachXBT outlined several examples from past market cycles, including meme tokens such as RapDoge, which was promoted in July 2021 before quickly rug-pulling, and projects like Orion and The Life Token, which used charitable narratives before collapsing. Beyond tokens, the investigator said Soulja Boy launched multiple NFT collections, some of which advertised future utility that never materialized. He also referenced prior regulatory and legal issues, including SEC charges related to Tron promotions and a lawsuit connected to SafeMoon. Growing Scrutiny Follows Base’s Rapid Rise in the Layer-2 Market Against that backdrop, critics argued that visibility from prominent builders functions as implicit validation, particularly for new users who may not be familiar with a promoter’s history. Supporters of open, permissionless networks countered that public blockchains do not restrict who can deploy tokens or participate, and that engagement does not necessarily equate to endorsement. The episode arrives at a sensitive moment for Base. According to L2beat data, Base is currently the second-largest Layer-2 network by total value locked, with approximately $12.66 billion, trailing only Arbitrum. Source: L2Beat Its rapid growth has positioned it as one of the most visible scaling layers in the Ethereum ecosystem, increasing scrutiny around how senior figures communicate publicly. The backlash also reflects a broader pattern in crypto discourse. In recent months, ZachXBT has repeatedly surfaced in high-profile cases involving alleged misconduct, including claims tied to celebrity NFT launches, suspected large-scale hacks, and the exposure of organized fraud networks. These episodes have fueled recurring debates about due diligence, accountability, and the role of influence in shaping on-chain behavior.

Visa has launched a Stablecoins Advisory Practice to help banks, fintechs and enterprises design and implement stablecoin strategies. The service will support use cases such as cross-border and B2B payments, as Visa deepens its push into stablecoins. https://t.co/Mnn4CKwVUd — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) December 15, 2025 The move comes as traditional financial institutions accelerate their engagement with stablecoins following clearer regulatory signals in the United States. Visa Works With Early Clients on Stablecoin Strategies Carl Rutstein, global head of Visa Consulting and Analytics, said the practice is designed to meet growing client demand rather than push adoption indiscriminately. He said Visa is working with dozens of early clients, including Navy Federal Credit Union, VyStar Credit Union, and Pathward, and expects the number to expand into the hundreds. The advisory work spans strategy development, technical architecture, operational readiness, and implementation support, with some clients ultimately deciding whether stablecoins align with actual customer needs. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a fixed value, typically pegged to the U.S. dollar through reserves. Once largely confined to crypto trading, they are increasingly being used for payments, cross-border transfers, and business-to-business settlement, particularly in regions with currency volatility or limited access to traditional banking rails. According to DefiLlama data, the global stablecoin market capitalization now stands at $309.85 billion. Tether’s USDT remains dominant with a 60.10% market share and a market cap of $186.23 billion, followed by Circle’s USDC at $78.31 billion. Source: DefiLlama Other stablecoins, including Ethena’s USDe, Sky Dollar, Dai, and PayPal USD, make up smaller but growing portions of the market, collectively reflecting broader issuer diversity. Visa Pushes Stablecoins Deeper Into Global Payments Visa’s latest move follows a series of stablecoin initiatives by the company over the past several years. In 2023, Visa piloted USDC settlement on blockchain networks and now supports more than 130 stablecoin-linked card programs across 40 countries. Visa recently began testing a system that allows businesses to fund cross-border payments using stablecoins instead of pre-depositing cash into local accounts. Credit card giant @Visa has begun testing stablecoin-powered cross-border payments, marking a major step in digital tokens gaining acceptance among global finance players. #Visa #Stablecoins https://t.co/bJwqFJe5tc — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 30, 2025 Visa has said the program will expand in 2026 and targets banks, remittance firms, and financial institutions that currently rely on costly correspondent banking networks. The push has been reinforced by regulatory clarity in the United States following President Donald Trump’s signing of the GENIUS Act in July , which established formal rules for stablecoin issuance. Since then, several financial and payments firms have accelerated their stablecoin strategies. PayPal and Mastercard have expanded their digital dollar capabilities, while institutions such as Citigroup, JPMorgan , and Standard Chartered continue to explore tokenized settlement and on-chain liquidity tools. Stablecoin Adoption Spreads Globally as Banks and Card Networks Step In Visa’s advisory launch also arrives as stablecoin adoption spreads beyond the U.S. In Africa, Visa has partnered with Yellow Card Financial to support stablecoin payments across 20 countries, while Circle has worked with Onafriq to connect stablecoins to hundreds of wallets and bank accounts. @visa and @yellowcard_app have partnered to expand stablecoin-powered payments across Africa. #stablecoin #Visa https://t.co/nB85xKKAXa — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 19, 2025 Mastercard recently partnered with Chainlink to let cardholders make on-chain crypto purchases. Meanwhile, Sony Bank plans to launch a regulated dollar-pegged stablecoin for payments within its digital entertainment ecosystem. @chainlink announces historic @Mastercard partnership enabling 3 billion+ cardholders to buy cryptocurrency onchain through seamless fiat-to-crypto conversion eliminating complex barriers. #Chainlink #Mastercard #Crypto https://t.co/SSrILSQ5Tf — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 24, 2025 Institutions such as Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, McKinsey, Anchorage Digital, and GFT Technologies already offer advisory, research, or infrastructure services tied to stablecoins. Visa executives have consistently framed stablecoins not as a threat to existing payment systems, but as an extension of them. Speaking earlier this year, Visa’s head of crypto, Cuy Sheffield said the future of payments would combine traditional rails with on-chain settlement, rather than replacing one with the other.

Ethereum is weak compared to Bitcoin, but this is about to change. At the same time, 2026 will be a massive year, perhaps BTC’s “most decisive” yet. According to Severino, Bitcoin is, by definition, still in an uptrend. Yet, overhead resistance is stacked. Bitcoin could try to reclaim the 50-week moving average, which sits at some $102,000. Then, $100,000 will act as a key psychological barrier, and this makes it “an ideal zone for a bull trap.” A move above $100,000 “could embolden bulls with a ‘we’re so back’ mentality.” But this could “blind them to a potential reversal back down to new lows,” Severino says. He argues that, “If bulls are able to reclaim $100,000 and hold the support line for weeks to months, any chance of a bear market will likely be cancelled.” A bearish high timeframe signal just confirmed in Bitcoin The last time it confirmed, Bitcoin fell 75% over the next 365 days before it reached a bottom The signal has never missed a bull market or bear market, and it has no false signals You can see the signal, TA, and my… pic.twitter.com/iBXmm39AZW — Tony ""The Bull"" Severino, CMT (@TonyTheBullCMT) December 8, 2025 A Bear Is Here Importantly, Q1 2026 will be critical. Per the analyst, it will “show us the way for the rest of the year.” Given the high timeframe momentum and four-year-cycle timing and dynamics, he argues, “there is a higher probability that Bitcoin is entering a bear market.” Therefore, it’s likely that BTC will fail to reclaim $100,000. This would indicate “that the bull market is indeed over.” To confirm a downtrend and change into a bear market, the coin would need to confirm “a lower low.” Therefore, $74,000 becomes a critical support zone that bulls must defend to keep BTC bullish. Falling below this zone would confirm the bear market. The next downside target would then sit around $53,000. “At that point, higher timeframe technical indicators would reach levels oversold enough to begin to consider a true bear market bottom is in,” he says. At the same time, Severino discussed the key technical indicators he’s paying attention to. Per his email, these are all related to momentum. And momentum persists, he says. “Even when a car hits its brakes to avoid an accident, strong enough momentum could push the vehicle towards a crash. It will take time for bearish momentum to turn bullish.” As an example, the analysts provided the six-week LMACD (Logarithmic Moving Average Convergence Divergence). This technical indicator confirmed a bearish crossover, he says. It takes 200-365 on average between the signal and a bottom, as well as up to 860 days between a bearish and a bullish crossover. “I’d have to begin to see the monthly LMACD lines converge and close in on a bullish crossover before I’d consider a bear market thesis invalidated,” Severino says.

Four-Year-Cycle Under Microscope “Make no mistake, 2026 will be Bitcoin’s most decisive year yet,” Severino says. “2025 was characterized by confusion” due to macro backdrop uncertainty and Donald Trump’s “tariff tantrums.” Moreover, Bitcoin’s 2025 yearly candlestick will close as a Doji. This is typically a pause in a trend. Therefore, either a reversal or strong continuation will follow it. “Simply put, Bitcoin will prove the four-year-cycle remains with a bear market, or break the cyclical pattern with a renewed bull run.” Source: Tradingview At the same time, “a storm is coming.” Volatility is stirring on the lowest timeframes. Yet, higher timeframes show an “unusually calm” market. “A spark is waiting to ignite this compression into an explosion,” the analyst argues. Ethereum Could Be The Decision Maker Ethereum remains relatively weak compared to Bitcoin, Severino says. However, the analyst says, “this is about to change dramatically.” The ETHBTC pair shows a reversal: ETH could be outperforming BTC in the longer term. However, Severino cautious that if the cryptocurrency market enters a downtrend and bear market, this outperformance could be associated with ETHUSD holding better than BTCUSD, rather than ETHUSD growing faster than BTCUSD. Yet, this BTC-ETH “mismatch” should present many favourable trading opportunities even in the bear market. Source: Tradingview Finally, the ETH/BTC ratio may show a potential capital rotation into Ethereum. Several events could dampen BTC and raise ETH. These include a BTC-related catalyst pushing sentiment down, or ETH being far more oversold than BTC. The latter may see Bitcoin reset while Ethereum continues the foundation building phase. Therefore, “if Ethereum can revitalize crypto market sentiment, it may finally create the perfect storm situation for an unexpected altcoin season,” Severino concludes. “If Ethereum’s strength fails to ignite interest in altcoins, we may be witnessing the market purging projects without true potential.” You may also like: Why Is Crypto Down Today? – December 15, 2025 As a new week begins, the crypto market is down today, with the cryptocurrency market capitalisation decreasing by 0.5%.

Japan’s Rate Hike Is Risky For Bitcoin Analysts view the potential rate hike as ending the “Carry Trade” era. Higher rates make yen assets more appealing, prompting investors to pull capital from overseas holdings like crypto. This strengthens the yen, raises borrowing costs worldwide, and dampens Bitcoin speculation, historically causing 20-30% price drops. HOW WILL BITCOIN REACT TO JAPAN's RATE HIKE?

Because history isn’t kind to Bitcoin here… During the last 3 BOJ rate hikes, BTC drops 20%+… pic.twitter.com/KaEsxZyHc8 — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) December 15, 2025 Macro investor Afsheen Jafry explained that while markets focus on Powell and the Fed, the BOJ actually controls something more fundamental: global liquidity flows. “When the BOJ tightens, capital floods back to Japan. When they ease, it floods out, and crypto is always first in line to catch that overflow,” she noted. She cited July 2024 when the BOJ’s rate increase triggered a massive selloff, crushing Bitcoin from $73,000 to $53,000. “That wasn’t random. That was carry trade unwinding on a massive scale.” The BOJ also holds roughly ¥83 trillion ($534 billion) in ETFs accumulated since 2010, representing 7-8% of Japan’s ETF market. Reports indicate officials plan gradual sales of these ETFs starting in January 2026. These sales would reverse years of liquidity injections, potentially pressuring Japanese stocks and reducing global risk appetite. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Defending $80K Support Critical for Price Recovery Bitcoin is holding firm above the $80,000 level after November’s sharp drop, showing buyers are defending this key support that has held since late 2024. The recent push toward the upper $80,000s hints at early signs of recovery, but BTC remains trapped below the critical $100,000 to $109,000 resistance zone. Breaking through this range could flip momentum and confirm a true reversal. Otherwise, this bounce may fade. Source: TradingView RSI has climbed from oversold levels into the mid-40s, signaling that selling pressure is cooling, though upside momentum is not yet convincing. If Bitcoin keeps holding $80,000, a retest of $100,000 is likely, with $109,000 as the next target. On the flip side, a breakdown could send BTC sliding toward the $62,000 to $71,000 demand zone.

Saylor post points to possible new Strategy Bitcoin buys Michael Saylor posted “Back to More Orange Dots” on X, a line he often uses when Strategy signals fresh Bitcoin purchases, although the post did not confirm a completed transaction. Bitcoin Portfolio Value Chart. Source: StrategyTracker The message circulated alongside a StrategyTracker chart that plots Strategy’s past buys as orange dots against Bitcoin’s price. The tracker showed Strategy holding 660,624 BTC as of Dec. 14, 2025, with a displayed bitcoin portfolio value of $58.97 billion, an average cost of $74,696, and 89 purchase events in the selected range. Bitcoin traded around $89,578 at the time of writing, after ranging between roughly $87,789 and $90,266 in the session. Strategy has built the largest publicly known corporate Bitcoin position through repeated purchases over several years. As a result, Saylor’s short posts that reference “orange dots” often arrive near the same time as buy disclosures or renewed buying expectations tied to the company’s accumulation pattern. Institutional ownership of Strategy continues to rise as filings show steady accumulation Institutional investors continued to increase their exposure to Strategy Inc. shares, according to data highlighted by market commentator Bryant (@TheSkayeth) on X. The post pointed to institutional holdings nearing 170 million shares, indicating that large investors kept adding positions even during periods of weaker retail sentiment.

Data from Fintel showed ownership growth accelerating after mid-2024, following a relatively flat stretch in earlier years. At the same time, positioning data cited in the post showed 1,463 long positions versus 45 short positions, signaling a strong skew toward bullish institutional exposure. The figures suggest that professional investors maintained confidence in the stock’s direction while retail participation appeared more volatile. Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, remains closely tied to Bitcoin due to its large corporate BTC holdings. As a result, shifts in institutional ownership often attract attention as a proxy for how large investors view Bitcoin-linked equity exposure. MSTR Tests Major Support as TrendSpider Flags Extreme Oversold Zone Strategy’s stock (MSTR) slid into a long-term horizontal support zone as fresh chart data highlighted heavy historical demand at current levels. A daily chart shared by TrendSpider on X shows MSTR trading near $176, after a prolonged decline from peaks above $450 earlier in the year. Strategy MSTR Daily Chart Horizontal Heatmap Support. Source: TrendSpider via X The chart maps a wide horizontal heatmap support band that has held price multiple times since 2024. As MSTR moved back into that zone, selling pressure slowed, suggesting the area remains a key reference point for traders watching downside risk. At the same time, momentum indicators weakened. The 14-day RSI printed near 35, signaling oversold conditions but not yet a reversal. Similar RSI readings in past cycles often coincided with consolidation rather than immediate trend changes, according to the historical price action shown on the chart. The broader structure reflects MSTR’s close link to Bitcoin exposure through Strategy’s balance sheet. As Bitcoin volatility picked up in recent months, MSTR amplified those moves on the downside. The heatmap shows dense traded volume between roughly $150 and $200, marking this range as the most active accumulation zone over the past two years.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-15 17:03:06

In a press release , the crypto firm announced that it is taking a significant step toward a multi-chain future with the launch of its stablecoin on layer-2 networks, ahead of its official debut next year, pending regulatory approval. Ripple partners with Wormhole to begin testing on various blockchains Ripple has partnered with Wormhole to begin testing on the various blockchains. According to the company, leveraging Wormhole’s Native Token Transfers (NTT) standard enables them to maintain native issuance and control the stablecoin, while providing the security and flexibility of on-chain liquidity movement across new ecosystems. 💸 @Ripple 's $1.3b stablecoin, $RLUSD , has adopted Wormhole's NTT standard to expand multichain. This integration will enable the issuance of $RLUSD across all of crypto, starting with @Base , @Optimism , @InkOnchain & @Unichain . NTT is the standard for multichain asset issuance. pic.twitter.com/L15KpB1jbt — Wormhole (@wormhole) December 15, 2025 It will also enable a variety of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications on networks designed for faster speeds and lower costs. This is an extension of its Wormhole integration with the XRP Ledger mid of this year. The expansion introduces wrapped XRP (wXRP) liquidity pairs, enabling seamless DeFi applications like swaps, checkout options, or apps that enhance buying, selling, or sending digital assets and lending across chains to enhance XRP’s utility beyond its native ecosystem. For instance, a retail crypto user could soon convert wXRP to RLUSD within a DeFi app on Optimism or Base without leaving the chain. Jack McDonald, SVP of Stablecoin at Ripple, stated, “Stablecoins are the gateway to DeFi and institutional adoption, and RLUSD is designed from the ground up to be the trusted, liquid medium necessary for users to seamlessly enter, interact with, and exit the entire digital asset economy.” He adds that, “By launching RLUSD—the first US Trust Regulated stablecoin on these L2 networks—we are not just expanding utility; we are setting the definitive standard where compliance and on-chain efficiency converge.” Besides the US, its global footprint is revealed by over 75 licenses globally and is expanding. Most recently, RLUSD has been recognized by regulators in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Additionally, Singapore’s central bank recently expanded Ripple’s license to use XRP and RLUSD in payment services. RLUSD ranks third-largest among US-regulated stablecoins RLUSD was originally available on Ethereum and the XRP Ledger networks. It is issued under a New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) Trust Charter. Ripple obtained initial approval for a federal trust bank charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) last week. This step would make RLUSD the first stablecoin under both state and federal regulatory oversight. Ethereum hosts over $1.01 billion of RLUSD’s circulating supply compared to $225 million on XRPL. By launching on Ethereum, RLUSD plugged into lending protocols, decentralized exchanges, and yield farms. That attracted crypto investors looking for a compliant dollar token in DeFi. The compliance-first approach attracted institutional partnerships. BlackRock and VanEck selected RLUSD as a redemption rail for tokenized Treasury funds. Prime brokerages approved RLUSD as eligible collateral. As reported by Cryptopolitan, the USD-backed stablecoin then climbed from about $960 million at the start of November to $1.26 billion by early December. The 30% monthly jump pushed RLUSD into the top tier globally. That makes it the third-largest among US-regulated stablecoins positioned for GENIUS Act compliance when the federal framework takes effect in 2027. It now sits behind only USDC and PayPal’s PYUSD among US-regulated dollar tokens. The climb was driven by exchange listings, institutional pilots with major financial players, and dual-chain architecture. In November 2025, Ripple launched a pilot with Mastercard, WebBank, and Gemini to settle credit card transactions using RLUSD on the XRP Ledger. WebBank sends RLUSD over XRPL to instantly settle daily payment obligations with Mastercard. This replaced the traditional multi-day wait for bank ACH transfers. Meanwhile, in a tweet, Ripple’s Senior Executive Officer and Managing Director, Middle East & Africa, Reece Merrick, has highlighted continued momentum. He also teased a big week ahead.

55834153,https://timestabloid.com/?p=92401,1765818331,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Wall Street Just Admitted XRP Is Next,https://timestabloid.com/wall-street-just-admitted-xrp-is-next/,"For years, XRP has existed in a strange market position—widely used, heavily debated, and often misunderstood. While Bitcoin and Ethereum dominated institutional headlines, XRP quietly built infrastructure relevance beneath the surface. Now, as Wall Street’s approach to digital assets matures beyond experimentation, subtle signals are emerging that suggest the institutional playbook is expanding again. That shift was highlighted by crypto commentator Ripple Bull Winkle, who drew attention to remarks from within the ETF industry that many market participants overlooked. In a video posted on his X account, Ripple Bull Winkle framed the moment as a long-awaited acknowledgment from traditional finance that XRP belongs in the next phase of institutional crypto adoption. Institutional Logic, Not Retail Hype According to Ripple Bull Winkle, the significance lies not in speculation but in how Wall Street is sequencing digital assets. Quoting commentary tied to 21Shares’ U.S. XRP spot ETF launch, he explained the framing used by Adam Fritz, the firm’s Chief Investment Strategist, who said XRP is the natural progression. As Ripple Bull Winkle stated: “Wall Street just confirmed what XRP holders have been waiting years for and almost nobody caught this.” WALL STREET JUST ADMITTED #XRP IS NEXT pic.twitter.com/umlUvhQoMr — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) December 14, 2025 He emphasized that this perspective is grounded in institutional reasoning rather than market excitement. “Think about that. That’s not hyped. This isn’t retail speculation. This is institutional logic. Bitcoin was step one, Ethereum was step two. XRP is step three.” Within this framework, XRP is not being treated as a speculative extension of crypto markets, but as a functional progression aligned with real-world financial use cases . Why XRP Fits the Next Phase Bitcoin established digital scarcity and store-of-value exposure. Ethereum introduced programmable finance and smart contracts. XRP, by contrast, was designed for payment settlement, liquidity management, and cross-border value transfer at scale . That distinction matters to institutions seeking infrastructure rather than narratives. Ripple Bull Winkle underscored this point directly, saying XRP is “designed for real payments, real settlement, real financial rails.” For ETF issuers, that design logic aligns with long-term capital deployment strategies, especially as tokenized assets, stablecoins, and on-chain settlement grow in importance. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The ETF Signal Wall Street Watches The launch of U.S.-based XRP spot ETFs represents more than a new investment product. ETF approvals require regulatory clarity, custodial confidence, and sufficient market depth. XRP now meets those criteria, particularly following the conclusion of Ripple’s legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 2025. When institutions commit resources to ETF structures, they are signaling durability. As Ripple Bull Winkle put it, “When ETF issuers start saying XRP makes sense, that’s Wall Street admitting.” This admission reflects internal assessments of liquidity, compliance, and long-term relevance—not short-term price targets. Absorption, Not Exit Liquidity Perhaps the most consequential takeaway is the idea that XRP is being accumulated rather than distributed. Ripple Bull Winkle summarized this shift clearly: “This asset isn’t going anywhere. It is actually being absorbed.” Institutional absorption typically precedes integration into portfolios, settlement systems, and financial products that operate on multi-year timelines. While ETF launches alone do not guarantee price outcomes, they mark a structural change in how XRP is perceived. The conversation has moved from survival to sequencing—positioning XRP as a logical next step in Wall Street’s evolving digital asset strategy. In that sense, the admission is not loud or celebratory. It is quiet, procedural, and far more consequential.

The asset now sits well below its January 2025 high near $5.35. Momentum cooled, but structure remains intact. Price action shows compression rather than collapse. Sellers lost strength near the rising diagonal base. Buyers now defend the $1.60 zone, which acts as the market’s decision point. Does SUI bounce, or does patience wear thin? Market sentiment feels cautious but curious. Why Sui Still Commands Attention Sui continues to separate itself from crowded Layer-1 competitors. The network focuses on speed, parallel execution, and usability. Key fundamentals driving interest include: Object-centric architecture that supports parallel transaction processing Move programming language, optimized for security and performance zkLogin, which enables Web2-style onboarding with ZK privacy Developers care about execution speed. Users care about simplicity. Institutions care about scalability. Sui checks all three boxes. That combination explains why capital keeps circling back. Institutional Interest and Ecosystem Expansion Sui no longer lives only in retail circles. Institutions now enter the conversation. Recent developments include: Grayscale and 21Shares are launching SUI investment products A proposed spot SUI ETF, signaling deeper market maturity $17.17 million withdrawn from exchanges, hinting at long-term holding behavior Bitcoin liquidity integrations also push Sui into new territory. Wrapped Bitcoin support through LayerZero opens cross-chain DeFi use cases. Bitcoin holders now interact with Sui-based protocols without friction. And yes, that matters. Technical Structure and Key Levels to Watch SUI forms an expanding swing structure that compresses beneath a shallow descending cap. Price respects the rising diagonal support. Key technical levels include: Support: $1.60, then $1.45 Reaction zone: $1.64–$1.66 Upside trigger: $1.70–$2.10 A clean hold above support keeps the bullish thesis alive. A sustained break below it invites deeper consolidation. Traders watch this zone closely. Source: X SUI Price Prediction 2025 SUI’s outlook for the rest of 2025 depends on stability above structural support and continued institutional traction. Recovery toward $2.10 would confirm market confidence. Failure near $1.60 delays that scenario. SUI Price Prediction 2026 SUI’s 2026 outlook hinges on execution, not hype. By this stage, markets will judge Sui on real usage, not promises. If the network sustains developer growth and user activity, price expansion becomes logical. If these trends hold, SUI could trade well above its 2025 recovery range. Token unlock pressure still exists, though improved demand may absorb supply. Will Sui convert technical elegance into sticky users? That question defines 2026. A failure to retain developers or TVL would cap upside. A thriving ecosystem could flip SUI into a top-tier Layer-1 contender. SUI Price Prediction 2030 By 2030, Sui enters a different conversation. Survival no longer matters. Relevance does . If Sui succeeds, it likely becomes infrastructure. Payments, gaming, tokenized assets, and AI-linked marketplaces could all run quietly on Sui rails. At that stage, speculation fades. Utility takes over. Analysts project an average price near $10.97, with upside toward $12.75 if adoption compounds. These numbers assume Sui captures meaningful Layer-1 market share. If not, prices stagnate. 2030 rewards networks that feel boring but reliable. Can Sui reach that level? SUI Price Prediction 2050 2050 projections stretch imagination. Still, markets love long arcs. SUI’s extreme long-term forecasts reflect one assumption: blockchain becomes core global infrastructure. If Sui survives multiple cycles and remains relevant, price appreciation could turn exponential. Some forecasts place SUI above $1,200 by 2050. That scenario requires decades of uninterrupted relevance. Most projects fail long before that. Is it realistic? Hard to say. Is it impossible? No. SUI Price Prediction Table (2025–2050) Year Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price Dec 2025 $1.70 $1.90 $2.10 2026 $3.80 $5.20 $6.40 2030 $10.59 $10.97 $12.75 2050 $1,200.58 $1,255.91 $1,383.62 These projections assume: Sustained Layer-1 relevance Regulatory clarity around crypto investment products Continued ecosystem growth across DeFi, AI, and tokenization Final Outlook: Can SUI Reset Its Trend? Sui sits at a crossroads. The technology holds up, institutions keep knocking and the price now needs confirmation. If $1.60 holds, upside pressure builds fast. If it fails, patience becomes the trade. Either way, SUI stays on the watchlist.

The platform combines Web3 storage, AI computation, and streaming into one ecosystem. This model targets industries dominated by centralized giants like YouTube, Netflix, and AWS. AIOZ runs as a Layer-1 blockchain with Ethereum and Cosmos interoperability. Developers deploy dApps with low fees and predictable performance. The network also relies on DePIN nodes that contribute bandwidth, storage, and compute power as users earn AIOZ tokens in return. This design creates a simple question. Why pay centralized providers when a global decentralized network can do the same job? Key pillars include: Decentralized video streaming and VOD AI compute and inference workloads Web3 storage and content delivery Token-based incentives for node operators This utility gives AIOZ real economic activity beyond speculation. AIOZ Price Action Snapshot (Late 2025) AIOZ trades near $0.1164, down almost 20% in the last 30 days amid the overall bearish crypto market. Sellers control momentum for now, and Fear dominates sentiment. Yet volatility stays contained.

AIOZ Price Prediction 2025 The remaining months of 2025 look range-bound as buyers defend the $0.11 zone, and sellers cap rallies near $0.12. This behavior fits a market waiting for direction. Short-term drivers include: Broader crypto risk sentiment Node participation growth Exchange liquidity conditions If support holds, AIOZ could finish 2025 stable rather than explosive. AIOZ Price Prediction 2026 2026 shifts the narrative. Infrastructure tokens often lag hype cycles, then surge when usage expands. AIOZ’s compute and AI layers could gain relevance as decentralized AI demand rises. Growth catalysts: AI workloads moving on-chain More DePIN adoption Enterprise streaming pilots If these trends play out, AIOZ could exit its accumulation phase. Expected range: Conservative case: $0.71 Optimistic case: $1.91 AIOZ Price Prediction 2030 2030 represents a maturity test. Either decentralized media succeeds, or it fades. AIOZ sits directly in that battle. Why upside remains possible: AI inference demand explodes Web3 storage replaces legacy CDNs Token utility scales with usage Price expectations vary widely.

Derivatives positioning remains elevated, capping upside while signaling leverage has not fully reset. Technical structure still favors caution, with recovery dependent on reclaiming key moving averages. By Parshwa Turakhiya Solana ( SOL-USD ) price on Monday is attempting to find balance after a prolonged and aggressive drawdown that drained both spot and derivatives momentum. After collapsing from the September peak near $250, SOL has spent recent sessions stabilizing in the $130–$132 zone, an area that is beginning to act as short-term equilibrium rather than a continuation point lower. From a spot flow perspective, the most notable development is not aggressive accumulation but the visible slowdown in persistent outflows. Through October and early November, Solana recorded repeated large negative netflows as investors distributed positions following the breakdown from the $200 area. In recent sessions, those outflows have narrowed sharply, with the latest readings showing modest positive net flow. That shift does not confirm renewed demand, but it does suggest that panic exits and forced selling have largely run their course. Historically, Solana tends to base through flow stabilization before price responds in a meaningful way. Derivatives positioning cools, but leverage still weighs Derivative data reinforces this transition from capitulation to digestion. Open interest remains elevated near $7.3B, even as price trades far below its September highs. This indicates that leverage has not been fully flushed from the system, but positioning has clearly shifted. The 24-hour long-to-short ratio sits slightly below 1, showing traders are no longer aggressively leaning long. At the same time, top trader account ratios on major venues such as Binance and OKX remain skewed toward longs, creating overhead risk. That imbalance helps explain why upside attempts have struggled to gain traction and why rallies continue to be sold into resistance. Liquidation data supports the view that the most violent phase of the unwind has passed. Over the last 24 hours, long liquidations have exceeded shorts, but the absolute size is significantly smaller than during the late October and early November cascade. The market is no longer operating in a forced liquidation environment. Instead, it has entered a slower, range-driven phase where price responds more to technical structure than to mechanical unwinds. Charts point to consolidation, not reversal On the daily chart, Solana remains firmly below its major moving averages. The 20-day EMA near $136 and the 50-day EMA around $149 continue to slope lower, reinforcing the dominant bearish trend. Above that, the 100-day EMA near $164 and the 200-day EMA around $171 define the upper boundary of the medium-term downtrend. As long as SOL remains below the 20- and 50-day EMAs, upside moves should be treated as corrective rather than trend-changing. SOL price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Momentum indicators, however, show subtle improvement. The daily RSI has stabilized in the low 40s, no longer pressing deeper into oversold territory. During the sharp selloff, RSI consistently failed to reclaim 40, signaling accelerating downside momentum. The current stabilization suggests selling pressure is no longer intensifying, even if buyers have not yet seized control. This supports a consolidation narrative rather than immediate continuation lower. Short-term structure adds further nuance On the 30-minute chart, Solana has flipped its Supertrend and Parabolic SAR back into short-term support near $129.50. Price has respected this zone on multiple tests, indicating that intraday buyers are defending dips rather than chasing upside. That said, rallies remain capped below $133–$135, where prior breakdown levels and short-term resistance converge. From a risk standpoint, the $128–$130 zone remains critical. A decisive break below that area would likely reopen downside toward $120–$122, where demand emerged earlier this year. On the upside, a sustained move above $136 would mark the first attempt to reclaim the 20-day EMA and could trigger a relief rally toward higher resistance. Until that level is cleared, upside remains vulnerable. Previously, we noted that Solana tends to stabilize through reduced outflows and cooling liquidations before price structure improves.

55835285,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=878841,1765819467,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/55835285.jpeg,OpenAI won Yahoo Finance’s Company of the Year despite record losses,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/openai-is-yahoo-finances-company-of-the-year/,"OpenAI became the guy everyone kept running into in 2025, both for good and bad reasons, drawing just as much admiration as it does criticisms. And now, the company with the biggest losses ever recorded in the history of earth ($1.4 trillion) has become Yahoo Finance’s Company of the Year. Investors watched OpenAI convert into a for-profit structure, chase its own data centers and hardware, sign huge agreements with Microsoft, Oracle, AMD, and Nvidia, and push toward a possible trillion-dollar IPO. Private shares jumped 153% this year, landing the startup a $500 billion value. CFO Sarah Friar told Yahoo Finance’s Brian Sozzi, “It’s been a year where we have really hit kind of this day one of the next phase for OpenAI,” adding that the ecosystem had “started to move toward us to help us create this future.” The award came three years after the launch of ChatGPT 3.5, which set off the latest AI wave. Tracking OpenAI’s surge through markets When OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced a multibillion-dollar deal with AMD on Oct. 6, AMD shares jumped 24% in a single day, just as AMD CEO Lisa Su was saying that the partnership would lay the “foundation” for the AI world. Oracle stock climbed 38% after revealing a $300 billion data center deal with OpenAI in July, while CoreWeave tripled from March to October on news of three supply deals. HSBC projected that OpenAI’s consumer LLM revenue would reach $129 billion by 2030 and enterprise LLM revenue would hit $386 billion. OpenAI now reports 800 million weekly active users, 1 million business customers, and $13 billion in 2025 revenue, but Cryptopolitan had since reported that a $1 trillion IPO could come as early as late 2026, with internal targets placing 2030 revenue at $200 billion. Getting there means aggressive spending. The company has promised $300 billion to Oracle, $250 billion to Microsoft, $38 billion to Amazon, and $22.4 billion to CoreWeave, with plans to buy up to 6 gigawatts of AMD GPUs at a chip cost of $150 billion and 10 gigawatts of Nvidia GPUs costing around $300 billion for chips and roughly $500 billion total for the full build-out. A Broadcom partnership adds 10 gigawatts of custom chips to the mix. Sarah defended the strategy by pointing to growth decisions made years earlier. “The compute that we’ve used in 2025, we didn’t just find in ’25,” she said. Compute capacity grew from 200 megawatts in 2023 to 2 gigawatts in 2025, while ARR rose from $2 billion to more than $20 billion. She added, “We just see no reason to stop right now in terms of the requirements and the need for compute.” But the numbers rattled investors. The company has raised nearly $50 billion, and HSBC expects a $207 billion funding gap by 2030. Investor Brad Gerstner asked Sam, “How can a company with $13 billion in revenues make $1.4 trillion of spend commitments?” Sam answered, “If you want to sell your shares, I’ll find you a buyer.” Sarah later said the U.S. government should guarantee AI-related debt, which triggered backlash and a quick reversal. Following OpenAI’s new rivals and risks DA Davidson’s top analyst Gil Luria argued that OpenAI must focus on what it does best; LLMs and chatbots. He said things went sideways when the company tried building chips, hardware, and full data centers. The fear of an AI bubble hit its major partners. Oracle fell 23% in November and another 11% after earnings.AMD dropped 15%.CoreWeave sank 45%. Microsoft slipped 5%. Luria said Oracle’s price falling below its deal-announcement level showed investors doubted it would ever get paid. Nvidia revealed a $500 billion chip backlog stretching to late 2026, signaling strong demand despite bubble worries. Competition also tightened. Google’s Gemini 3 scored industry benchmarks. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff praised the model, and former Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger did too. Anthropic raised $15 billion from Nvidia and Microsoft and is targeting an IPO. Sam issued a “code red” memo and shifted resources toward ChatGPT. On Dec. 11, the company released ChatGPT 5.2 and secured a licensing deal plus $1 billion from Disney. Sarah said the focus is speeding up model updates. She expects more personalization, app links, and “super agent” features. Analysts say Microsoft will likely get priority in any cutbacks because of its ownership rights. RBC estimated that over half of Oracle’s AI backlog comes from OpenAI, putting it at risk. CoreWeave faces even more danger after borrowing heavily for its build-out. Nvidia and Broadcom remain shielded by diverse customers, while AMD sees its early bet on OpenAI as leverage with new buyers. Benchmark’s Cody Acree said AMD has used a slow, steady playbook to gain server share.

This decision marks a pivotal moment for this privacy-centric digital asset, potentially unlocking access for millions of new investors. But what does this mean for you, and why is this listing causing such a stir? Let’s break it down. Why is Coinbase Listing BEAM a Big Deal? When Coinbase decides to list a new asset, it sends a powerful signal to the entire market. The exchange is known for its rigorous compliance standards. Therefore, its choice to list BEAM acts as a stamp of credibility. This move can dramatically increase a token’s visibility, liquidity, and legitimacy overnight. For BEAM, a project built on the Mimblewimble protocol for enhanced privacy, this represents a major step toward mainstream recognition. Historically, assets listed on major exchanges like Coinbase often experience increased trading volume and investor interest. This listing provides a straightforward, regulated on-ramp for U.S. and international users who want to buy, sell, or hold BEAM. It simplifies the process, moving BEAM from niche crypto platforms to a household name in digital finance. What is BEAM and How Does Its Privacy Work? Before diving into the implications of the listing, it’s crucial to understand what BEAM is. BEAM is a cryptocurrency that prioritizes confidential transactions. Unlike transparent blockchains like Bitcoin, where transaction details are public, BEAM uses the Mimblewimble protocol to obscure sender, receiver, and amount data. Selective Transparency: Users can choose to disclose transaction details for auditing, offering a balance between privacy and compliance. Scalability: The protocol also improves scalability by compressing old transaction data, keeping the blockchain lean. User-Controlled Privacy: Privacy is a default feature, putting control back into the hands of the individual user. Therefore, Coinbase’s decision to list BEAM is particularly noteworthy. It suggests a growing maturity in how major exchanges view privacy-preserving technologies within regulatory frameworks. What Are the Potential Impacts of This Listing? The immediate effect will likely be on market dynamics. New demand from Coinbase’s vast user base could influence BEAM’s price and trading patterns. However, the long-term impacts are even more profound. This listing could accelerate the development of the BEAM ecosystem. More developers and projects may build on its protocol, knowing it has the backing of a top-tier exchange. Moreover, it sparks a broader conversation about the role of financial privacy in the digital age. By giving BEAM a prominent platform, Coinbase is indirectly endorsing the ongoing innovation in confidential transaction technology. What Should Investors Consider Now? If you’re considering BEAM after hearing Coinbase will list BEAM , conduct thorough research. Understand the technology’s value proposition and its unique risks. Privacy coins can face regulatory scrutiny in some jurisdictions. While this listing is a positive sign, the regulatory landscape remains fluid. Look beyond the hype. Evaluate the project’s roadmap, developer activity, and community strength. A major exchange listing is a powerful catalyst, but sustainable growth comes from fundamental utility and adoption. A New Chapter for Privacy in Crypto Coinbase’s announcement is more than just another asset listing. It is a landmark event that bridges a leading privacy protocol with mainstream crypto accessibility. This move validates years of technical development and could pave the way for a future where financial privacy is a standard, accessible feature for all. The decision to list BEAM demonstrates the crypto industry’s evolving complexity. Exchanges are now curators not just of value, but of technological ideology. As BEAM finds its place on one of the world’s largest stages, it challenges us to rethink the very nature of transparent finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) When will Coinbase officially list BEAM for trading? Coinbase has announced the intention to list BEAM. The exact date for trading to go live will be communicated in a follow-up announcement from the exchange. Typically, there is a short period between the initial listing announcement and the trading launch. Will BEAM be available on all Coinbase platforms? Most new listings are available on Coinbase.com and the Coinbase mobile app. It may also be listed on Coinbase Pro (Advanced Trade) for more experienced traders. The final availability will be confirmed in the official launch details. What is the main benefit of BEAM’s privacy technology? BEAM’s Mimblewimble-based technology hides transaction amounts and participant addresses by default. This provides stronger financial privacy compared to transparent blockchains, preventing third parties from easily tracing your financial activity. Are privacy coins like BEAM legal? Yes, in most countries, privacy coins are legal. However, they can face increased regulatory attention. Some exchanges in specific regions may choose not to list them due to local compliance requirements. Coinbase’s listing is a strong indicator of its confidence in navigating these regulations. How does this listing affect BEAM’s price? Exchange listings often lead to increased buying pressure from a new, larger audience, which can positively impact price in the short term. However, long-term price depends on broader market conditions, adoption, and project development, not just exchange availability. Can I transfer my existing BEAM tokens to a Coinbase wallet? Once BEAM trading is live on Coinbase, you should be able to deposit BEAM tokens from a private wallet into your Coinbase account, provided you use the correct BEAM network. Always send a small test transaction first. Join the Conversation This listing is a thrilling development for the future of private digital transactions.

The token sits inside a long-term compression structure after months of sell-side pressure. Yet something changed. Buyers defended the $0.0036 zone, forming a clear Critical Support Reversal. That level now anchors the entire recovery narrative. Price coils tighter each week. Volatility builds. The question feels obvious. Does SWFTC finally break out? Market sentiment remains bearish. Fear dominates. That often marks transition phases. What Makes SWFTCoin Different? SWFTC powers SWFT Blockchain, a cross-chain swap aggregator operating since 2017. The platform connects both centralized and decentralized liquidity across more than 500 cryptocurrencies and dozens of blockchains. Key strengths stand out: One-click cross-chain swaps Deep wallet integrations, including Coinbase Wallet AI-driven routing for price efficiency No security incidents in six years Unlike many bridge tokens, SWFTC already operates inside real products. Utility exists today, not later. SWFTCoin Technical Structure: Pressure Builds The chart tells a clean story. A year-long decline formed a descending compression channel. Lower highs dominated. Sellers controlled momentum. Then came the shift. Price tapped $0.0036, triggering strong buyer defense. Volume confirmed accumulation. Since then, SWFTC trades between rising support and falling resistance. Source: X This structure often resolves with force. Key technical levels: Support: $0.0036, then $0.0030 Trigger: $0.0083 breakout Invalidation: Sustained move below $0.0030 If price clears $0.0083, resistance thins fast. Momentum traders usually step in. SWFTCoin Price Prediction for the Remaining 2025 Short-term price action depends on compression resolution. SWFTC trades inside a tight range with growing volatility. If support holds, upside pressure builds into year-end. Expected 2025 range stands between $0.0048 and $0.0082. A breakout toward the upper boundary could deliver a 70% move in weeks. Failure risks renewed range trading. Will buyers defend the CSR base again? The next few candles matter. SWFTCoin Price Prediction 2026 2026 shifts focus from structure to execution. SWFT Blockchain keeps expanding wallet integrations and API partnerships. Cross-chain demand grows as multi-chain activity increases. Fee discounts and governance rights strengthen SWFTC’s utility loop. If adoption accelerates, price could expand into prior distribution zones. 2026 outlook: Conservative: $0.0048 Bull case: $0.0083 A confirmed trend reversal opens paths toward mid-range expansion targets. SWFTCoin Price Prediction 2030 Long-term projections hinge on infrastructure relevance. If SWFT remains a key routing layer for cross-chain swaps, token demand follows network usage. Liquidity aggregation becomes essential as blockchains fragment further. Under sustained adoption: Low target: $0.014 High target: $0.028 That implies a multi-cycle recovery, not speculation alone. SWFTC Price Prediction for 2050 2050 projections reflect macro adoption curves. Infrastructure tokens scale with usage, not narratives. If SWFT maintains relevance: Cross-chain swaps remain core financial plumbing SWFTC retains fee and governance utility Supply remains capped SWFTC Price Prediction Table (2025–2050) Year Minimum Average Maximum 2025 $0.0048 $0.0064 $0.0082 2026 $0.0048 $0.0069 $0.0083 2030 $0.0140 $0.0211 $0.0282 2050 $0.1200 $0.1850 $0.2600 Final Thoughts SwftCoin sits at a critical long-term inflection point after completing a full macro sell-off and accumulation cycle. Price action shows a confirmed CSR base near $0.0036, with compression signaling rising volatility ahead. If $0.0083 breaks, upside expansion toward historical levels becomes likely. Long-term projections depend on SWFT’s cross-chain dominance, exchange integrations, and enterprise adoption. While near-term sentiment remains cautious, structural recovery favors patient positioning. If multi-chain demand accelerates and liquidity improves, SWFTC could evolve from a utility token into a durable infrastructure asset over the next decade.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-15 17:26:29

Top Crypto Investors Map a Potential 20x Run for This DeFi Project,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/next-altcoin-to-explode-top-crypto-investors-map-a-potential-20x-run-for-this-defi-project/,"In the case of DeFi breakout moves, they seldom occur without prior notice. They tend to be created when project transitions into visible readiness as a move out of build mode and supply and participation are tightened. Such an arrangement is attracting interest. Another DeFi project with a price of $0.035 is actively developing at the late stages of allocation and is moving to the first live testing phase, which is why price models of a longer period start to begin spreading. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building an open protocol of real use that is decentralized lending and borrowing. The platform will be aimed at connecting suppliers and borrowers according to certain rules in which the interest flow is transparent and the risk is being controlled through preset parameters. The token was launched in early 2025 at a price of $0.01 and has been moving through planned phases to make it to $0.035 which is 250% higher. Increased participation has led to increased development. The project achieved over 18,400 holders, founders, and raised an amount of $19.30M and sold 820M in tokens to date. V1 Preparations and Background Checks According to its official X statement , Mutuum Finance affirmed that V1 was going to be released to the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. The first release supports Liquidity Pool, mtToken framework, Debt Token and Liquidator Bot, where the first supported assets are ETH and USDT. This transition is facilitated by security preparation. Mutuum Finance got a CertiK audit of 90/100 score in Token Scan. The finalized smart contracts are under review by Halborn Security, and the bug bounty was set at $50K to find the vulnerabilities as early as possible. In the first price case, several analysts are intrigued by the lifecycle developments and not in the case of speculation. Models demonstrate a potential 8x rise from Phase 6 as V1 testing is commenced due to tightening of supply and faith of delivery. This is the situation in which there is a normal movement related to preparedness. mtTokens and Buy-and-Distribute Design Mutuum Finance is centred around the system of the mtToken. When the assets are provided by the users, they are rewarded with mtTokens, which gain redeemable value as borrowers pay interests. The activity increases yield, so it becomes an incentive to hold but not to trade, but on a short-term basis. A demand is strengthened by another layer. A fraction of protocol fees would be used to purchase MUTM in the open market. MUTM bought in the open market is redistributed to those who stake mtTokens in the safety module. This creates a feedback loop. Usage generates fees. Fees lead to market buying. Buyings in the market encourage a longer holding. This effect is bolstered by community activity by a 24 hour leaderboard, which earns the most active contributor each day with $500 in MUTM. This is a new price situation that is formed by combining these properties. Within a bullish adoption cycle, forecasts are projected into a 20x-type discussion covering a longer period, which is in terms of a 2,000% upswing of early levels. This perspective is associated with long-term adoption ahead of 2026-2027, which is not short-term volatility. The Importance of Phase 6 Speed Phase 6 is rapidly entering into full allocation. With the decrease in availability behavior tends to change. The latter phases are more rather than less likely to get attention, when a price increase of close to 20% is planned in the next crypto stage. Whale activities have been on including approximately around the $100K mark which may be a trend where larger participants take their larger milestone positions before the milestones, not after them. The presence of whales promotes liquidity and confidence in the promise of delivery. Mutuum Finance is turning into a transition point. The token has already registered a 250% increase. Supply is tightening. V1 has a confirmed timeline. Security reviews are active. Usage mechanics are defined.

The company announced it is bringing the core development team of the cross-chain protocol Axelar, known as Interop Labs, into its fold. This isn’t just another corporate merger; it’s a strategic masterstroke aimed at cementing USDC’s position as the most connected and usable dollar digital currency in the world. Let’s unpack why Circle acquires Axelar development team is a headline that matters for everyone in crypto. Why did Circle acquire the Axelar development team? Circle’s primary mission is to expand the utility and reach of USDC. While USDC is already available on multiple blockchains, seamless movement between them has often been complex for users and developers. By acquiring the team that built Axelar, Circle gains deep, in-house expertise in cross-chain communication. This move directly tackles the challenge of blockchain fragmentation. Therefore, instead of relying on external protocols, Circle can now directly integrate and enhance the technology that allows different blockchains to talk to each other securely. What does this mean for USDC and blockchain interoperability? The immediate benefit is a turbocharged roadmap for USDC’s cross-chain capabilities. Think of Axelar’s technology as a universal translator for blockchains. With this team onboard, Circle can make transferring USDC between Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and dozens of other networks as simple as a single click. For users, this means less friction and lower costs. For developers, it means easier building of applications that can tap into liquidity and users across the entire crypto universe. The strategic decision for Circle to acquire the Axelar development team fundamentally strengthens the infrastructure supporting over $30 billion in USDC circulation. Key benefits of this acquisition Enhanced User Experience: Smoother, faster, and cheaper cross-chain USDC transfers. Developer Empowerment: Better tools and native integrations for building cross-chain dApps with USDC. Increased Security: Direct oversight of the critical interoperability layer that moves billions in value. Market Leadership: A significant step ahead in the race to provide the most accessible digital dollar. What are the challenges and future implications? However, such a pivotal integration is not without its hurdles. The main challenge will be ensuring the merged teams can maintain the security and decentralization principles that are core to Axelar’s protocol while aligning with Circle’s corporate structure and goals. Moreover, the crypto community will watch closely to see if this acquisition leads to a more open ecosystem or a more walled-garden approach for USDC. The success of this move hinges on execution. If done well, the action of Circle to acquire the Axelar development team could set a new standard for how major crypto entities build essential infrastructure. Conclusion: A new chapter for a connected crypto economy Ultimately, Circle’s acquisition is a bold bet on a multi-chain future. It signals that for a stablecoin to be truly global, it cannot be confined to any single blockchain. By bringing top-tier interoperability talent in-house, Circle is not just buying a team; it’s investing in the fundamental plumbing of the next generation of the internet. This move promises to make USDC more fluid, more accessible, and more integrated than ever before, paving the way for a more unified and efficient digital asset landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Does Circle now own the Axelar protocol itself? A: No. Circle has acquired Interop Labs, the primary development team behind the Axelar protocol. The Axelar network itself remains a decentralized, community-governed blockchain. Q: Will USDC become exclusive to Axelar for cross-chain transfers? A> Unlikely. Circle’s goal is to expand USDC’s reach. While Axelar’s technology will be heavily leveraged, Circle will likely continue supporting multiple bridges and pathways to ensure broad accessibility. Q: How will this affect the price or use of AXL, Axelar’s native token? A: The AXL token is used for securing and governing the decentralized Axelar network, which continues to operate independently. The acquisition could bring more attention and utility to the Axelar ecosystem, but the token’s value depends on broader market and network adoption factors. Q: What should developers building with USDC do now? A: Developers should expect improved and potentially new tools from Circle for cross-chain USDC integration. Staying updated with official Circle developer announcements and documentation is the best course of action. Q: Is my USDC safe after this news? A: Yes. This is a strategic business acquisition focused on development talent and technology. It does not affect the reserves backing USDC or its smart contract security on existing blockchains. Q: Could this lead to other stablecoins like Tether (USDT) making similar moves? A> It’s possible. This acquisition highlights the critical importance of seamless interoperability. Other major stablecoin issuers may feel pressure to bolster their own cross-chain strategies to remain competitive. Found this deep dive into Circle’s strategic acquisition insightful?

The broader crypto market remains under pressure, and small-cap infrastructure tokens feel the impact first. Yet deep drawdowns often spark questions. Has ABT reached a long-term value zone? Or does downside risk still dominate? ArcBlock launched in 2018 with a bold goal. It aimed to create a unified blockchain ecosystem that connects multiple chains through an open access layer. The vision targeted third-generation decentralized applications. Years later, the market tests that vision under harsh conditions. Source: Coingecko ArcBlock Fundamentals Still Matter ArcBlock focuses on interoperability. It builds tools that allow developers to deploy DApps across multiple blockchains. That problem still exists. Ethereum , Cosmos, and newer chains continue to fragment liquidity and users. Key fundamentals include: Open Chain Access Protocol for cross-chain connectivity Blocklet architecture for modular DApp development Ethereum ecosystem compatibility The challenge? Execution and adoption. Many newer protocols now compete for the same space. Can ArcBlock stand out again? ABT Technical Structure and Market Behavior ABT trades below both its 50-day and 200-day SMAs, and that confirms bearish structure. Momentum indicators, though, hint at exhaustion. Source: X RSI sits near 33, close to oversold territory. Selling pressure has slowed near historical support zones. Important levels to watch: Support: $0.27, then $0.24 Resistance: $0.33, followed by $0.36 If buyers defend support, short-term stabilization may follow. A breakdown opens risk toward lower historical demand zones. ArcBlock Price Prediction 2025 The remaining period of 2025 looks defensive. Market sentiment stays cautious, and liquidity remains thin. ABT may trade in a tight range unless broader market conditions improve. Expectations center on consolidation rather than breakout. Can ABT hold above $0.25? That question matters most for near-term survival. ArcBlock Price Prediction 2026 2026 shifts focus toward recovery potential. Crypto cycles historically rotate after extended bear phases. If infrastructure narratives return, ArcBlock may benefit. A move toward the $0.45–$0.46 zone becomes possible if: Developer activity improves Interoperability demand grows Risk appetite returns to small caps Failure to attract builders limits upside. ArcBlock Price Prediction 2030 Long-term forecasts assume renewed relevance. By 2030, blockchain ecosystems may demand stronger cross-chain coordination. ArcBlock’s original thesis fits that future. Upside targets stretch toward $2.49 in optimistic scenarios. That requires: Sustained ecosystem usage Clear differentiation from rivals Long-term product execution ArcBlock Price Prediction 2050 2050 forecasts depend on survival. Many tokens fade before then. If ArcBlock endures and adapts, value could compound over decades. A mature Web3 infrastructure role could push ABT into multi-dollar territory. Failure to evolve ends the story much earlier. ArcBlock ($ABT) Price Prediction Table Year Min Avg Max 2025 $0.24 $0.32 $0.45 2026 $0.32 $0.39 $0.46 2030 $0.89 $1.65 $2.49 2050 $3.50 $6.80 $10.50 Conclusion ArcBlock trades at a critical crossroads. Price action reflects deep pessimism, yet long-term infrastructure themes still support its original vision. Short-term risk remains high, and bearish momentum dominates 2025. Recovery depends on adoption, execution, and renewed interest in cross-chain solutions . For patient investors, ABT offers asymmetric upside tied to long-term Web3 infrastructure growth. For traders, discipline matters. Support zones must hold. Without renewed ecosystem traction, price recovery remains speculative.

The product enters the market as demand for compliant digital asset exposure continues to grow among institutional investors. Besides broadening Invesco’s crypto-linked lineup, QSOL reflects a wider push to package blockchain infrastructure into familiar investment vehicles. Consequently, Solana now joins Bitcoin and Ethereum as part of Invesco and Galaxy’s exchange-traded product suite, offering exposure without direct token custody. QSOL Strengthens Regulated Access to Solana According to the press release , QSOL tracks Solana’s spot price using the Lukka Prime Solana Reference Rate, providing transparent pricing and daily valuation. Additionally, the product operates within a regulated ETP structure, which aligns with institutional compliance requirements. Coinbase Custody Trust Company safeguards the underlying SOL, while Lukka supplies independent pricing data. Hence, the structure aims to reduce operational risks that often concern large investors. Kathleen Wrynn, Global Head of Digital Assets at Invesco, has emphasized the strategic importance of expanding crypto-linked ETPs alongside tokenization initiatives. Moreover, the Solana ETP complements existing offerings tied to Bitcoin and Ethereum, reinforcing Invesco’s multi-asset digital strategy. Galaxy contributes infrastructure expertise, including validator operations on the Solana network, which supports staking activity within the product. Galaxy’s Role and Network Exposure Steve Kurz, Global Head of Asset Management at Galaxy, has highlighted Solana’s rapid network development and its relevance across Web3 and AI-linked applications. QSOL stakes its SOL holdings through Galaxy Digital Infrastructure, allowing the trust to earn staking rewards treated as income. Consequently, investors gain both price exposure and potential yield within a single vehicle. The ETP operates as a grantor trust and supports both cash and in-kind creations and redemptions. Significantly, this structure improves liquidity and tracking efficiency while maintaining transparency. QSOL trades on the Cboe BZX Exchange, placing Solana exposure within a familiar equity-style trading environment. Solana Price Action Reflects Range-Bound Trading The launch coincides with near-term pressure in Solana’s spot market. SOL trades at $126.13 , reflecting a daily decline of 3.59% and a weekly drop exceeding 7%. Additionally, trading volume remains elevated near $4.8 billion, signaling active positioning despite weaker price action. Solana’s market capitalization now stands near $70.8 billion, supported by a circulating supply of roughly 560 million tokens. Source: X Crypto Tony has described current SOL action as range-bound rather than directional. He notes that price continues to respect a defined structure on lower timeframes. Moreover, support remains concentrated between $129 and $130, while resistance caps price near $134.

Ted said the zone is “crucial” because a break below the rising trend support could open the door to another move toward $80,000.

Even a multi-signature wallet could not stop a determined victim from sending Bitcoin to a scammer posing as a trader. Romance, Riches, and Ruin In a post on X, Michael said that the client in question was not wealthy and had recently accumulated 1 BTC after years of saving. He had moved his funds off Coinbase into a multi-signature wallet structure set up with The Bitcoin Adviser and Unchained. It is important to note that this configuration was intended to improve security and inheritance. According to Michael, the loss was not caused by a technical failure, compromised private keys, or a breach of the custody setup, but by psychological manipulation. The client was contacted by a person posing as a trader who promised high returns and gradually developed a romantic relationship with him. They even convinced the recently divorced father that they were in love and planning to spend the holidays together. Michael said he and others quickly recognized the situation as a classic pig-butchering scam, where fraudsters slowly gain trust before convincing victims to send money. Despite hours of phone calls, repeated messages, and articles warning about such schemes, the client remained convinced the offer was real and chose to move forward. While the multi-signature arrangement introduced delays and required additional confirmations, Michael said it could not ultimately prevent the transfer once the client chose to authorize it. Advisers attempted to slow the process by encouraging the client to move funds to a personal wallet first, hoping the extra time would allow him to reconsider. Michael said the episode was particularly devastating because the Bitcoin represented the client’s primary financial asset and a potential source of long-term security for his young daughter. The adviser added that the case highlighted a broader reality in the crypto ecosystem that while robust custody tools can protect against hacks and technical mistakes, they offer limited defense against scams driven by emotional manipulation. “I post this as a warning to anyone else you might know who falls victim to this scam. Bitcoin can’t magically double, and it certainly can’t double by someone you haven’t met who is also falling in love with you.” Romance Scams Go Global Last year, Nigerian authorities arrested 792 people in one of the country’s largest crackdowns on crypto-related romance scams. According to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), the operation found an organized network where foreign nationals worked with Nigerian recruits to carry out romance and investment scams targeting victims across the world. Investigators said recruits were trained to impersonate foreign women online and lure victims into fake crypto investments. Authorities seized hundreds of SIM cards and computers and are continuing investigations with international partners. More recently, Australian authorities uncovered massive misuse of cryptocurrency ATMs after a months-long investigation found more than 150 scam cases, as victims lost over $3.1 million in a year. In one case, a woman in her 70s lost $281,000 after falling for a romance and investment scam and repeatedly depositing cash into crypto ATMs. AUSTRAC said many victims were manipulated rather than criminally involved. In response, regulators introduced stricter rules, including cash limits, scam warnings, and stronger customer checks to curb fraud.

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $85,916.7 on the Binance USDT market, marking a significant pullback from recent highs. This development has traders and investors scrambling to understand what’s driving this downward movement and whether it signals a temporary correction or the beginning of a more substantial trend reversal. What’s Driving the Bitcoin Price Decline? Several factors typically influence Bitcoin price movements, and today’s drop appears to be no exception. Market analysts point to a combination of technical resistance levels, profit-taking by short-term holders, and broader macroeconomic concerns. The $86,000 level had served as psychological support, and breaking below it has triggered additional selling pressure across cryptocurrency exchanges. Furthermore, trading volume patterns suggest that institutional players might be adjusting their positions. When the Bitcoin price approaches key resistance zones, we often see increased volatility as different market participants react to the same price signals in different ways. This creates the perfect storm for rapid price movements in either direction. How Significant Is This Bitcoin Price Movement? To put today’s Bitcoin price action in perspective, consider these key points: Percentage Drop: The decline represents approximately X% from recent highs Market Cap Impact: Billions in market value evaporated in hours Trading Volume: Increased volume confirms genuine selling pressure Support Levels: Next major support sits around $84,000-$85,000 range While the Bitcoin price drop might seem alarming, experienced traders recognize this as normal market behavior. Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile, and corrections of 10-20% occur regularly even during bull markets. The key question isn’t whether the price dropped, but why it dropped and what comes next. Should Investors Panic About the Bitcoin Price Drop? Absolutely not. Market corrections serve important functions in healthy financial ecosystems. They shake out weak hands, reset overextended technical indicators, and create buying opportunities for long-term investors. The current Bitcoin price movement might actually be beneficial for the market’s long-term health. Consider this: every major Bitcoin bull market has included multiple significant corrections. These pullbacks test investor conviction, validate support levels, and ultimately strengthen the foundation for the next leg up. Rather than panicking about today’s Bitcoin price, savvy investors are asking different questions. What’s Next for Bitcoin Price Action? Looking forward, several scenarios could unfold for the Bitcoin price: Quick Recovery: Strong buyers step in around current levels Further Correction: Testing of lower support zones continues Consolidation Phase: Sideways movement before next directional move Trend Reversal: More substantial decline if key levels break The most likely outcome involves some consolidation between $84,000 and $88,000 as the market digests recent moves and establishes new equilibrium. Remember that the fundamental Bitcoin story remains unchanged – limited supply, increasing adoption, and growing institutional interest continue to support the long-term thesis regardless of short-term price fluctuations. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Instead of reacting emotionally to Bitcoin price movements, consider these strategic approaches: Dollar-Cost Average: Continue regular purchases regardless of price Set Clear Targets: Define entry and exit points in advance Manage Risk: Never invest more than you can afford to lose Stay Informed: Follow reliable sources for market updates Today’s Bitcoin price action serves as a valuable reminder that cryptocurrency investing requires both conviction and patience. Markets move in cycles, and successful investors position themselves to benefit from volatility rather than fear it. The current dip might represent a buying opportunity for those who missed earlier entries or a chance to rebalance portfolios for optimal risk management. Conclusion: Navigating Bitcoin Price Volatility The Bitcoin price dropping below $86,000 certainly captures attention, but it shouldn’t dictate investment strategy. Market corrections are normal, healthy components of financial markets that create opportunities for disciplined investors. By focusing on fundamentals, maintaining perspective, and implementing sound risk management, investors can navigate these fluctuations successfully. Ultimately, the Bitcoin price today matters less than where it might be in months or years. Short-term volatility tests investor psychology, while long-term trends reward patience and conviction. As the cryptocurrency ecosystem continues maturing, expect more such price movements – and more opportunities for those prepared to handle them strategically. Frequently Asked Questions Why did Bitcoin price drop below $86,000? The Bitcoin price decline likely resulted from a combination of technical factors, profit-taking by short-term traders, and broader market sentiment. Key support levels breaking often triggers automated selling and amplifies downward momentum. Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? Market corrections can present buying opportunities, but timing the market perfectly is difficult. Many investors prefer dollar-cost averaging – making regular purchases regardless of price – to avoid trying to catch exact bottoms. How low could Bitcoin price go? While predictions are uncertain, analysts watch several support levels. The next major support zones typically sit around $84,000-$85,000, followed by stronger support near $80,000 if selling pressure continues. Should I sell my Bitcoin now? Selling decisions should align with your investment strategy, not short-term price movements. If you’re investing for long-term goals, volatility is expected. If you need funds or have reached profit targets, consider taking partial profits rather than panic selling. How does this affect other cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin often leads the broader cryptocurrency market. When Bitcoin price experiences significant movements, altcoins typically follow similar patterns, though with varying intensity depending on individual project fundamentals. What indicators should I watch now? Key indicators include trading volume, support/resistance levels, moving averages, and overall market sentiment. Also monitor Bitcoin dominance (BTC’s share of total crypto market cap) for clues about capital rotation. Share Your Thoughts Found this analysis helpful?

The Kirin 9030 processor, which powers the Mate 80 Pro Max, was produced locally and reflects incremental gains made under years of tight US technology restrictions. The chip was made by Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp, China’s leading contract chipmaker. Analysts say it uses an improved version of SMIC’s existing 7-nanometre manufacturing method, rather than a leap to a more advanced generation. That detail matters because smaller manufacturing sizes usually allow faster, more efficient chips. Huawei says the Kirin 9030 performs better than its predecessor Research firm TechInsights examined the Kirin 9030 and found that SMIC’s updated process, known as N+3, builds on earlier work rather than breaking new ground. The company said the changes brought better chip density but still left China behind global leaders such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Samsung. The findings underline how far Chinese chipmakers have pushed older tools in the absence of cutting-edge equipment. Chinese firms cannot access the most advanced machines used elsewhere, forcing them to squeeze more out of existing technology. Huawei says the Kirin 9030 delivers a clear performance boost over the previous version used in its Mate 70 phones. But demand for foreign chips is also shaping the local industry. As was reported by Cryptopolitan , pressure on China’s chip sector is also shaped by strong demand for foreign processors. Nvidia is weighing higher output of its H200 chip after heavy interest from Chinese companies, highlighting the gap between local products and the most powerful imports still allowed. The chip industry closely tracks Huawei because its progress is seen as a signal of China’s wider capabilities. Earlier TechInsights reports found that previous Huawei chips were also made using 7-nanometre methods , easing speculation that the country had already mastered more advanced production. The Kirin 9030 appears to confirm that view. One analyst quoted in the TechInsights report said the new process “remains substantially less scaled than industry 5-nanometre processes”. In plain terms, that means the chip is bigger and less efficient than those made by the world’s top manufacturers, even if it represents progress under difficult conditions. There is also a worry over the reliability of such chips produced in huge numbers. The production methods rely on older light-based tools and complex steps to pack circuits tightly together. However, this can slow production and increase production costs, subsequently making it difficult to compete with rivals who are overseas and using newer machines. US trade embargo is pushing local innovation Huawei and SMIC did not comment publicly on the report. Both companies have been on US trade blacklists for years, cutting them off from key technology and suppliers. Those measures have reshaped Huawei’s business, pushing it to design its own chips and rely more heavily on domestic partners. Political influence also has an impact. Authorities in China in October added TechInsights to an official list of unreliable entities, subsequently stopping it from doing business in the country after a series of reports on Huawei and SMIC that got global attention. Although the pace is still slow, the Mate 80 launch shows that China can still move forward. And, while the Kirin 9030 may not match the best chips on the global market, it signals determination to keep building at home, which is what China is pushing for.

In a stunning display of volatility, a staggering $113 million worth of futures were liquidated across major exchanges in just sixty minutes. This intense pressure, part of a broader $567 million purge over 24 hours, serves as a powerful reminder of the high-stakes nature of crypto derivatives trading. Let’s break down what this means for you and the market. What Does $113 Million in Futures Liquidated Actually Mean? When we talk about futures being liquidated, we’re referring to the forced closure of leveraged trading positions. Traders use borrowed funds to amplify their bets on price movements. However, if the market moves against them too sharply, exchanges automatically sell their assets to cover the loan before losses exceed their initial collateral. This hour saw a cascade of these events, wiping out $113 million in leveraged positions. Essentially, it was a massive, market-enforced risk reset. Why Do These Massive Liquidations Happen? Such a concentrated wave of futures liquidated typically acts as both a symptom and a catalyst of extreme volatility. Several factors can trigger this domino effect: Leverage Overload: Traders using excessively high leverage (like 10x or 20x) have very little margin for error. A small price swing can trigger their liquidation. Market Sentiment Shift: A sudden negative news event or a large sell order can rapidly push prices down, hitting the stop-losses and liquidation prices of many traders at once. Cascading Effect: As initial positions get liquidated, the resulting sell-off can push prices further down, triggering another wave of liquidations in a self-feeding cycle. Therefore, this event highlights the fragile equilibrium in highly leveraged markets. The Ripple Effect: How Liquidations Impact the Broader Market A cluster of futures liquidated doesn’t just affect the traders involved. It creates ripples throughout the entire ecosystem. The forced selling from liquidations adds significant downward pressure on spot prices, often leading to increased fear and panic selling among regular holders. This can exaggerate price swings and lead to what traders call ‘max pain’—a period where the market seems to hunt for the most leveraged positions to wipe out. For onlookers, it creates both danger and opportunity. Actionable Insights: How Can Traders Navigate This Volatility? Surviving and potentially profiting from periods where futures get liquidated requires discipline and strategy. Here are key takeaways: Respect Leverage: Use lower leverage. It increases your margin of safety and reduces the probability of being caught in a liquidation sweep. Implement Stop-Losses: Set prudent stop-loss orders based on technical levels, not just your available margin. This puts you in control of your exit. Monitor Funding Rates: Extremely high funding rates in perpetual futures contracts can be a precursor to a long squeeze and mass liquidations. Keep a Cool Head: Avoid emotional trading. Volatility spikes are not the time for impulsive decisions. The Aftermath and What to Watch Next Following such a significant flush of futures liquidated, the market often enters a period of consolidation or finds a local bottom. The high leverage is washed out, creating a potentially cleaner slate for the next move. Traders should watch for stabilization in price, decreasing trading volume, and a normalization of funding rates as signs the immediate pressure is subsiding. In conclusion, the $113 million futures liquidated in one hour is a stark lesson in crypto market mechanics. It underscores the non-negotiable importance of risk management in a domain where digital fortunes can be made or erased in moments. While terrifying for those caught in it, these events are integral to the market’s process of finding balance and flushing out excessive speculation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does ‘futures liquidated’ mean? It means a trader’s leveraged position was forcibly closed by the exchange because the market moved against it, and their collateral was no longer sufficient to cover potential losses. The exchange sells the assets to repay the borrowed funds. Who benefits when futures are liquidated? Primarily, the exchanges ensure they don’t lose money on their loans. Other traders with opposite positions (e.g., shorts during a long liquidation cascade) can profit from the price move. Some argue it creates buying opportunities once the selling pressure subsides. Can liquidations cause a crypto crash? While a single liquidation event is unlikely to cause a full-blown, prolonged crash, a large cascade can significantly accelerate a downward trend and contribute to sharp, deep corrections by creating overwhelming selling pressure. How can I check liquidation data? You can use data websites like Coinglass or Bybit’s liquidation heatmap. These tools show real-time and historical data on liquidated positions across exchanges, including amounts and price levels where liquidations are clustered. Is trading futures riskier than spot trading? Yes, categorically. Futures trading involves leverage, which amplifies both gains and losses. The risk of losing your entire position quickly, as seen in liquidation events, is much higher than in spot trading, where you simply own the asset. What’s the difference between liquidated and stopped out? Being ‘stopped out’ means a stop-loss order you placed was triggered, closing your position at a predetermined price. Being ‘liquidated’ is a forced closure by the exchange when your maintenance margin is breached, often at a worse price than a stop-loss would have secured.

Price action reflects a market under pressure, with momentum fading after a prolonged correction. From its all-time high, Bitcoin has now retraced roughly 30%, placing the asset firmly in a corrective phase where uncertainty and caution dominate trading behavior. Related Reading: Ethereum Trades Near Whales’ Cost Basis For The Fourth Time Since 2021 – Historic Test According to a report from Axel Adler, on-chain data confirms that market stress is no longer limited to price alone. Two key indicators—the Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH SOPR) and the P/L Block—are signaling broad loss realization among participants and a deterioration in overall market sentiment. These metrics provide insight into the behavior of short-term holders, who are often the most sensitive to price swings and macro uncertainty. Together, these signals suggest that Bitcoin remains in a fragile state, where confidence has weakened, and recovery attempts face increasing resistance. STH SOPR and P/L Block Confirm Capitulation Pressure Adler explains that the Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH SOPR) measures whether coins held for less than 155 days are being sold at a profit or a loss. When the indicator falls below one, it signals that recent buyers are realizing losses. Currently, the 7-day moving average of STH SOPR has slipped into the red zone, with a reading near 0.99. This confirms that short-term holders are, on average, selling Bitcoin below their acquisition price—a behavior typically associated with heightened stress and emotional selling. Historically, similar SOPR conditions have marked local capitulation phases, when selling pressure peaks and weaker hands exit the market. As long as the SOPR 7-day average remains below one, short-term participants stay in “stress mode.” Adler notes that a meaningful improvement would require a sustained move back above one on a daily close, signaling that sellers have exhausted supply and buyers are once again absorbing sell-side pressure. Complementing this signal, the P/L Block indicator tracks the aggregated profit and loss state of market participants. The current red block reflects loss dominance, with a P/L Score of minus three—classified as pronounced stress. With Bitcoin down 30% from its all-time high and 30-day returns negative, both indicators align, reinforcing a clear picture of capitulation among short-term holders.

Price has retraced aggressively but is now attempting to stabilize above the rising 200-week moving average (green), a level that has historically defined long-term trend validity. So far, this area is acting as dynamic support, suggesting that buyers are defending higher-cycle structure despite broader market weakness. However, Bitcoin remains below the 50-week moving average (blue), which is now sloping downward. This configuration reflects a loss of medium-term momentum and confirms that the market is still in a corrective phase rather than a resumed uptrend. The 100-week moving average (red) continues to rise well below price, reinforcing that the broader macro trend remains intact, but also highlighting how much excess was built during the prior rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Refuse to Sell: Historic Signal Emerges As Binance CDD Drops To 2017 Levels Volume has declined during the recent consolidation, signaling indecision rather than aggressive accumulation. This typically precedes a volatility expansion. From a structural perspective, holding above the $85,000–$88,000 zone is critical. A sustained breakdown below the 200-week MA would increase the probability of a deeper retracement toward the $75,000–$80,000 region. Conversely, reclaiming the 50-week MA near $95,000 would be an early signal that downside pressure is fading. Until then, Bitcoin remains range-bound, with long-term support holding but momentum still fragile.

Now that the legal dispute is over and XRP has been definitively cleared as non-security, experts argue that Ripple’s greatest success extends far beyond XRP regulation. Ripple’s True Victory Beyond XRP Regulation A crypto market expert operating under the name “Stellar Rippler” on X has shared a compelling report that reassesses what truly constitutes Ripple’s biggest win . The analyst highlighted that the real win for Ripple was not regulatory approval but an intellectual shift in how the project is perceived. The expert highlighted that while he favors XRP, he has historically been skeptical of Ripple’s intentions. However, he stated that the recent approval of the crypto company’s bank charter by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) speaks volumes about Ripple’s long-term vision in the financial sector. Last week, on December 12, the OCC granted conditional approval to five crypto-related firms , including Ripple, to obtain national trust bank charters. This achievement marked a significant milestone for Ripple, reinforcing its legitimacy in traditional finance despite the numerous oppositions . In his post, the analyst compares XRP and XLM, noting that the debate between the two cryptocurrencies has often been driven by emotion. He said that discussions were frequently centered on conflicts between retail and institutions, accusations of token dumpings, and differing visions for the future . According to the expert, XRP and XLM have always been structurally similar, both designed for fast, low-cost settlement, cross-border liquidity, interoperability, and real-world financial infrastructure. However, he notes that the primary difference between the two cryptocurrencies has always been strategy rather than values. He explained that while Ripple prioritized tackling regulatory hurdles, banking, and building institutional partnerships first, Stellar focused on grassroots adoption and open networks. With the new OCC bank charter, the expert emphasizes that Ripple’s strategic approach is now clearly validated and undeniable. Stellar Rippler highlighted that Ripple did not abandon its crypto principles but took on the regulatory responsibility to ensure its network could operate at scale. He stated that this milestone shows that history favors builders who solve foundational problems rather than those who focus on tribal disputes. Stellar Expert Shifts Stance After Ripple Gains OCC Approval In a previous post, Stellar Rippler publicly announced a significant change in perspective on Ripple following news that the company had received conditional approval for a national bank charter. He admitted he was wrong in his past views, describing the recent development as a full submission to the highest level of federal and state oversight in the United States. The Stellar expert now believes that Ripple is firmly committed to long-term global finance , stating that a company would not take such a path if it were not building something designed to last decades. He added that this milestone represents maturity and legitimacy for Ripple and strengthens confidence in XRP.",Ripple|OCC|Office of the Comptroller of the Currency|ripple|Stellar Rippler|US SEC|US Securities and Exchange Commission|XLM|XRP|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-15 18:00:49

A single sentence, especially from a key industry figure, can echo across years, resurfacing at moments when sentiment, structure, and speculation collide. This is precisely how seemingly lighthearted remarks evolve into reference points that shape community narratives long after their original context fades. Such is the case with a now-famous comment made by Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz , in early 2023. At the time, the digital asset industry was navigating post-FTX uncertainty, regulatory pressure in the United States, and subdued price action across major tokens. Public confidence was fragile, and humor often served as a coping mechanism within crypto discourse. Always remember "" There's a grain of truth in every joke"" https://t.co/istsvgD0N5 — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 14, 2025 David Schwartz’s 2023 Post and Its Context On February 4, 2023, David Schwartz posted on X, “ I’m taking XRP private at $420. Funding secured.” The statement was widely recognized as satire, directly referencing Elon Musk’s 2018 tweet about taking Tesla private, which later resulted in SEC enforcement action. Schwartz’s post was not a price prediction, corporate announcement, or roadmap disclosure. Instead, it was a deliberate joke, underscoring the absurdity of speculative extremes that often dominate crypto conversations. Importantly, Ripple has never indicated any intention to take XRP “private,” nor would such a concept align with the decentralized nature of public blockchains. At the time, the XRP community largely interpreted the remark as humor, and it passed without market impact. Egrag Crypto Revives the Quote Recently, crypto market analyst Egrag Crypto resurfaced Schwartz’s old post, framing it through a reflective lens. Egrag Crypto, who shared the quote alongside a visual emphasizing its enduring relevance, reminded followers that “there’s a grain of truth in every joke.” While the post did not claim that Schwartz’s words were prophetic, it reignited discussion around XRP’s long-term valuation potential and market structure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Egrag Crypto is widely followed for technical analysis and macro-cycle commentary on XRP. By revisiting the quote, the analyst highlighted how humor in crypto often emerges from deeply held beliefs about future adoption, liquidity, and institutional relevance—even when expressed playfully. Separating Symbolism from Reality Crucially, there is no verified evidence that Schwartz’s statement was anything more than satire. No filings, disclosures, or corporate actions support interpretations of insider signaling. However, the renewed attention reflects a broader truth about XRP’s market narrative. As regulatory clarity has improved since the conclusion of the Ripple-SEC case in 2025, long-term valuation discussions have intensified, making past remarks feel newly symbolic to some investors. The episode underscores how crypto culture blends irony, optimism, and speculation. Old jokes resurface not because they predict outcomes, but because they resonate with evolving market psychology. Why the Quote Still Matters Egrag Crypto’s commentary does not rewrite history, but it captures how narratives persist in decentralized communities. In crypto, even satire can become a mirror—reflecting collective expectations, frustrations, and ambitions as the market matures.

However, people in the UK can’t buy the token because of legal restrictions. The sale will use USD1 stablecoin to enable transactions on the Legion platform, in partnership with Kraken. The sale structure includes a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $60 million, with a soft cap raise target of $3 million. It will have a vesting schedule of 50% at the token generation event (TGE) and 50% linear vesting over six months. Allocations on Legion will be based on achievement, meaning that rewards will be given to players who have been around for a long time, active contributors, and early supporters of the Sport.Fun ecosystem. Kraken will offer access to eligible, verified users. Football.Fun reached $100 million in Total Value Locked (TVL) within two weeks of launch on the Base blockchain, the fastest growth of any game on the network. 50% of platform revenue funds token burns. For instance, a $25 million $FUN token burn in June 2025 (0.23% of the total supply) was executed to reduce the circulating supply and drive scarcity. However, the coin has not performed as expected, with a 63% decline in the last year. It has also tanked approximately 10% in the month and 9% in the last week. The coin is down 4.4% in the last 24 hours, now holding a market cap of a little over 20 million. XRP/USD1 added as Binance grows its USD1 markets This move follows Binance’s elevation of the stablecoin’s status by allowing users to trade tokens like BNB, ETH, and SOL using trading pairs. The exchange said that it was bringing USD1 into several of its most active spot markets. Binance also stated that it will convert all collateral assets backing Binance-Peg BUSD (B-Token) into USD at a 1:1 ratio. Already, (WLFI) co-founder and CEO Zach Witkoff has confirmed that the XRP/USD1 trading pair is set to launch on Binance. According to Binance’s official announcement, trading for XRP/USD1, DOGE/USD1, and SUI/USD1 will go live tomorrow, December 16. Additionally, Binance confirmed that Spot Algo Orders will be enabled for XRP/USD1, DOGE/USD1, and SUI/USD1 at launch. Spot Grid and Spot DCA services will also be available for BNB/USD1, SOL/USD1, and ETH/USD1. Binance has introduced fee deals for new USD1 pairs to help early trading. For a limited time, users at VIP levels 2 through 9 and Spot Liquidity Providers will be able to trade XRP/USD1, DOGE/USD1, and SUI/USD1 with no maker or taker fees. According to DeFiLlama data, there are nearly $2.8 billion worth of USD1 circulating. A large majority of the supply originates from the Abu Dhabi investment firm MGX, which chose to use USD1,000 earlier this year to make a $2 billion investment in Binance.

Data from major exchanges reveals a staggering $118 million worth of futures liquidated in a mere 60 minutes, sending shockwaves through trading communities. This intense volatility serves as a stark reminder of the high-stakes nature of leveraged trading. But what does this mean for the average investor, and how can you navigate such turbulent waters? What Does “Futures Liquidated” Actually Mean? When we talk about futures being liquidated, we’re referring to the forced closure of leveraged derivative positions. Traders use borrowed funds to amplify their bets on price movements. However, if the market moves against them and their collateral falls below a required threshold—the maintenance margin—the exchange automatically sells their position to prevent further loss. This hour saw $118 million in positions wiped out this way. Therefore, a cascade of these events can accelerate price swings, creating the volatility we witnessed. Why Did $118 Million Vanish So Quickly? Such a concentrated wave of liquidations doesn’t happen in a vacuum. It’s typically the result of a sharp, unexpected price movement in a major asset like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Here are the common triggers: Leverage Overload: Traders using extremely high leverage (10x, 25x, 100x) have very little room for error. A small price dip can trigger massive liquidations. Cascade Effect: Initial liquidations force sell orders, pushing the price down further, which then triggers more liquidations in a domino effect. Market Sentiment Shift: A sudden piece of news or a large whale selling can flip market sentiment, catching over-leveraged traders on the wrong side. In the past 24 hours, the total soared to $688 million , painting a picture of a highly tense and corrective market session. How Can Traders Avoid Getting Caught in a Liquidation Storm? Seeing $118 million in futures liquidated is a powerful lesson in risk management. Here are actionable insights to protect your capital: Use Lower Leverage: Resist the temptation of 100x. Lower leverage (2x-5x) increases your survivability during normal market fluctuations. Set Strategic Stop-Losses: Always use stop-loss orders to define your maximum risk before you enter a trade, not after. Monitor Funding Rates: Consistently high funding rates can signal an overcrowded trade, often a precursor to a violent long or short squeeze. Never Over-commit: Only risk a small percentage of your total portfolio on any single leveraged position. The Bigger Picture: What Do Mass Liquidations Signal? While alarming, periods of high liquidation are a natural part of market cycles. They effectively “reset” excessive leverage, often creating potential entry points for patient investors. However, they also highlight the inherent risk of derivatives trading. For the broader market, a flush of futures liquidated can reduce systemic leverage, potentially laying the groundwork for a more stable move afterward. It’s a painful but necessary market mechanism. Conclusion: Respect the Leverage, Preserve Your Capital The headline of $118 million in futures liquidated is more than just a number—it’s a narrative of volatility, leverage, and risk. These events separate disciplined traders from the reckless. By understanding the mechanics, employing strict risk management, and viewing such volatility as a lesson rather than just a loss, you can navigate the crypto markets more confidently. The key takeaway is simple: in a market where positions can be erased in minutes, capital preservation must always be your primary focus. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is a futures liquidation? A: It’s the forced closure of a leveraged trading position by an exchange because the trader’s collateral has fallen below the required minimum (maintenance margin), resulting in a total loss of that collateral. Q: Who benefits from futures being liquidated? A: While it’s a loss for the liquidated trader, it can benefit traders on the opposite side of the market move. Additionally, it helps exchanges manage their risk by preventing traders from owing more than their collateral. Q: Does high liquidation volume mean the market will crash? A: Not necessarily. While it indicates extreme volatility and pain for leveraged traders, it often acts as a “cleansing” event that removes excess leverage. The market can then find a new, sometimes more stable, direction. Q: How can I check current liquidation data? A: Websites like Coinglass and Bybit provide real-time liquidation heatmaps and data across all major cryptocurrency exchanges. Q: Are liquidations more common in crypto than traditional markets? A: Yes, primarily due to the 24/7 trading, higher average leverage available, and generally greater volatility inherent in the current cryptocurrency market structure. Q: What’s the difference between a long and a short liquidation? A: A long liquidation occurs when the price falls sharply, forcing out traders who bet on the price rising. A short liquidation happens when the price rallies sharply, forcing out traders who bet on the price falling. Found this breakdown of the $118 million futures liquidated event helpful?

After reaching an all-time high of $126,000 in October, the world’s top cryptocurrency has struggled to regain momentum, instead entering a period marked by tight ranges, low volatility, and subdued trading volumes. Market movers appear reluctant to commit to new positions as uncertainty builds around the direction of macroeconomic trends. Bitcoin was trading near $89,600 during early Monday sessions, extending weekend losses and reflecting a broader risk-off mood across global markets. Bitcoin Volatility Compresses as Technical Levels Tighten Bitcoin’s recent price behavior has been defined by historically low volatility, with the asset hovering in a narrow band just below $90,000. Analysts note that such compression often precedes a sharper move. Technical analyst Aksel Kibar has identified a critical setup on the daily chart, suggesting that a decisive breakout or breakdown could be imminent. On the downside, failure to hold current levels could open the door to a decline toward the $86,000 area, with deeper support seen between $73,700 and $76,500. On the upside, a sustained break above resistance near $94,600 could shift momentum and put the $100,000 level back into focus. Other traders have echoed calls for patience, advising investors to wait for a confirmed move outside the current range before taking positions. On-Chain Signals and Liquidity Raise Caution Beyond chart patterns, on-chain data has reinforced a more cautious outlook. Analysts at CryptoQuant have highlighted weakening demand and selling pressure near key moving averages, suggesting that recent rebounds have lacked conviction. Declining liquidity following the Federal Reserve’s recent rate cut has also weighed on Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, according to market makers. Still, not all signals are uniformly bearish. Data from Glassnode shows that some digital asset treasury firms have quietly resumed Bitcoin accumulation, despite prices struggling to stabilize. This mixed backdrop underscores the market’s current indecision. Macro Data and Central Banks in Focus Attention now turns to a busy macroeconomic calendar. Investors are watching delayed U.S. jobs data, inflation reports, retail sales figures, and flash PMI readings for clues on growth and interest rate expectations. Speeches from Federal Reserve officials later in the week could further influence sentiment. Globally, central bank meetings add another layer of uncertainty. Decisions from the European Central Bank, Bank of England, and especially the Bank of Japan, where a rate hike is widely expected, are being closely monitored for their impact on global liquidity. With volatility compressed and key catalysts approaching, Bitcoin appears poised at a crossroads as markets await clearer signals on economic and policy direction.

What The Global M2 Money Supply Says",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/can-bitcoin-still-hit-140000/,"The Bitcoin price outlook remains under scrutiny as market analysts assess whether the world’s largest cryptocurrency can still reach $140,000. Given BTC’s recent downturn and fluctuating price, it’s understandable that a dramatic surge to $140,000 could be viewed skeptically. However, the analyst points to global M2 Money Supply, highlighting its correlation with Bitcoin and its support for a significant upside move. New discussions have emerged in the crypto space about the relationship between the Bitcoin price action and the global M2 Money Supply. Pseudonymous crypto analyst ‘MoneyLord’ has projected a massive price surge to $140,000 for BTC based on M2 data. The analyst noted that many people are skeptical about the relevance of M2 Money Supply, likely questioning whether it still holds predictive value for Bitcoin’s performance. Global M2 Money Supply To Fuel $140,000 Bitcoin Price Surge According to MoneyLord, the recent disconnect between Bitcoin and M2 data should not be viewed as a failure of the model, but rather as a consequence of aggressive market interference and increased stress across global financial systems. In his technical report released on X, he argued that, without heavy manipulation and the collapse and insolvency of major entities, Bitcoin would have continued to track global liquidity growth. Related Reading: Is It More Profitable To Hold Bitcoin For The Short-Term? 2025 Numbers Are Here MoneyLord believes that those shocks temporarily suppressed BTC’s price expansion, likely contributing to its recent decline and slow momentum. With market conditions somewhat stabilizing, the analyst suggests that Bitcoin is poised to realign with global M2 Money Supply trends, potentially setting the stage for renewed upward momentum. From this perspective, the current phase is viewed as a delayed reaction rather than a failed cycle. MoneyLord predicts that if Bitcoin begins to catch up with M2 data, the cryptocurrency’s price could hit a target above $140,000 sooner than the market expects. The accompanying chart illustrates this bullish outlook, showing global liquidity, represented by the blue line, continuing to rise toward the projected price. With Bitcoin trading near $90,000 after a more than 6% decline this month, a rally to $140,000 would require a gain of at least 55%. Reaching this level would set a new all-time high, exceeding its present peak of over $126,000 by more than 10%. Bitcoin Shows Resilience Amid Market Sell-Offs According to crypto analyst Don, Bitcoin has bounced back after a period of sharp sell-offs that shook out many traders and triggered widespread liquidations. The analyst noted that bulls have stepped in to reclaim critical support and restore confidence in the market as BTC resumes trading within a well-defined ascending triangle pattern. Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Losses From Entities Surges To 2022 Levels Following Crash Below $90,000 The chart shows that the triangle has an upper boundary near $94,324 and a lower boundary around $89,241.

Earlier this month, the ruling Democratic Party asked the Financial Services Commission to submit a draft stablecoin bill by December 10, fulfilling President Lee’s campaign pledge to create a legal framework for digital assets. South Korea pushes for draft stablecoin bill by Dec. 10 deadline as lawmakers threaten independent action if FSC misses target. #SouthKorea #Stablecoin https://t.co/dLzvS4qax1 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 1, 2025 That deadline passed without a submission. Stablecoin Disagreement Holds Up South Korea’s Crypto Bill The South Korean media outlet Newsis reported that FSC later confirmed it was unable to deliver the proposal on time, saying it needed additional coordination with other agencies. A spokesperson said the regulator would instead release the government’s position publicly alongside its formal submission to the National Assembly, citing the public’s right to understand the framework being proposed. The FSC said it is preparing a draft tentatively titled the Basic Digital Asset Act, also described as Phase Two of South Korea’s virtual asset legislation. Officials expect the proposal to be released later this month or early next month, ahead of a consolidated bill the ruling party has pledged to introduce in January 2026 under President Lee Jae-myung’s election commitments. Behind the delay is an unresolved dispute between the FSC and the Bank of Korea over who should lead stablecoin issuance. The central bank has argued that stablecoins function similarly to currency and deposit-like instruments and should therefore remain under bank control. It has pushed for a rule requiring domestic banks to hold at least a 51% stake in any stablecoin-issuing entity, along with inspection powers and veto authority over approvals. The FSC has resisted that approach, pointing to overseas models, noting that most issuers under the European Union’s MiCA framework are non-bank digital asset firms and that Japan’s first yen-linked stablecoin was issued by a fintech company. FSC officials have said bank-led issuance lacks global precedent and could limit participation by technology firms that already operate digital payment infrastructure. Negotiations between the FSC and the BOK remain ongoing. Officials familiar with the talks say a compromise may involve flexible ownership thresholds based on business scope, though no agreement has been confirmed. The disagreement has stalled coordination long enough for lawmakers to begin reviewing multiple competing drafts at the National Assembly’s Political Affairs Committee. Delays in Stablecoin Rules Raise Fears South Korea Is Falling Behind Industry groups have warned that continued delays risk leaving South Korea behind jurisdictions such as the United States, the European Union, and Japan, all of which have already established stablecoin rules. Domestic stablecoin issuance remain illegal in South Korea, even as companies prepare infrastructure behind the scenes. Naver Financial has developed a blockchain wallet for Busan’s local currency program, while KakaoBank has begun work on a KRW-denominated digital token. Major banks have also explored a joint stablecoin project targeting late 2025 or early 2026. Naver Financial, the fintech arm of South Korean internet giant Naver, is preparing to roll out a stablecoin wallet in Busan. #SouthKorea #Crypto https://t.co/40QBNaXJ9C — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 25, 2025 Regulatory urgency has been heightened by recent enforcement challenges. In December, Korean authorities disclosed that Binance froze only a small portion of funds stolen during last month’s Upbit hack, despite urgent requests from police and the exchange.

Experts said the incident shows the need for faster, more structured controls as digital-asset activity expands. South Korea’s stablecoin debate is also unfolding against a backdrop of delayed crypto policy more broadly.

As regulators, institutions, and developers scrutinize public ledgers more closely, clarity around governance and control has become central to determining long-term credibility. Few networks have faced this scrutiny as persistently as the XRP Ledger. That debate resurfaced following a recent X post shared by XRP_Cro, which featured a video clip of Ripple Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz addressing the nature of decentralization on the XRP Ledger. The post drew renewed attention to a topic that has followed XRP for over a decade: whether any entity, including Ripple itself, has control over the network. David Schwartz Explains XRPL’s Governance Structure In the video, Schwartz offers a direct and unambiguous explanation of what decentralization means in the context of the XRP Ledger. According to the Ripple CTO, decentralization is not defined by branding or influence, but by legal authority and technical enforcement. “ The XRP Ledger is decentralized because no organization or individual has any legal right or ability to control it ,” Schwartz stated. David Schwartz, CTO @Ripple : The #XRP Ledger is decentralized. No one has legal control over it. pic.twitter.com/hycYdfWt7Q — XRP_Cro AI / Gaming / DePIN (@stedas) December 15, 2025 He further explained that governance on the XRP Ledger is distributed across its participants, not dictated by a central operator. “Every participant enforces every single rule, and the system is governed by all of its participants,” he said, emphasizing that rule enforcement is collective rather than hierarchical. How Consensus Works on the XRP Ledger The XRP Ledger operates using a consensus mechanism distinct from proof-of-work or proof-of-stake systems. Validators independently verify transactions and agree on ledger states through consensus rounds. No single validator, company, or group can unilaterally alter transaction history or protocol rules. While Ripple operates some validators and contributes to XRPL development, it does not possess special privileges within the network. Any proposed protocol change must be adopted voluntarily by a supermajority of validators. Without that broad agreement, changes simply do not activate. This structure directly supports Schwartz’s assertion that control is neither centralized nor enforceable by legal or corporate means. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Legal Control Versus Network Participation A critical distinction highlighted in Schwartz’s remarks is the difference between influence and control. Ripple can propose improvements, publish software, and advocate for certain developments, but it cannot compel participants to accept them. Validators are free to choose which software version they run and which amendments they support. This distinction became especially important during regulatory discussions surrounding XRP. Courts ultimately recognized that the XRP Ledger operates independently of Ripple, reinforcing the idea that ownership of a token or contribution to development does not equate to control of a decentralized network. Why the Statement Matters Now As institutional adoption accelerates and regulatory clarity improves, understanding decentralization is no longer academic. For XRP, Schwartz’s explanation reinforces a foundational principle: the ledger’s rules are enforced by its users, not dictated by a company. The XRP_Cro post brings renewed visibility to this reality, grounding the decentralization debate not in speculation, but in how the XRP Ledger actually functions today .

This isn’t a futuristic fantasy—it’s the reality of public blockchains . In a striking statement, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Paul Atkins asserted that these decentralized networks are “more transparent than any financial system built to date.” This powerful endorsement from within a key regulatory body signals a pivotal moment for understanding the true value of cryptocurrency technology. What Makes Public Blockchains So Transparent? Commissioner Atkins’s statement cuts to the core of blockchain’s revolutionary promise. Unlike traditional banking, which operates on private, permissioned ledgers, a public blockchain is an open book. Every transaction is broadcast to a network of computers, cryptographically secured, and added to a chain of data blocks that cannot be altered. This creates an immutable and auditable history. Therefore, the potential for fraud, hidden fees, or obscured financial flows is drastically reduced. This level of openness is simply unattainable in conventional systems where trust is placed in central intermediaries. The commissioner’s acknowledgment validates what crypto advocates have long argued: transparency is blockchain’s killer feature. How Does This Transparency Challenge Traditional Finance? The traditional financial system is built on layers of intermediaries—banks, clearinghouses, and brokers. Each layer has its own ledger, and reconciling them is slow and often opaque. Public blockchains remove these layers. Consider the benefits: Real-Time Auditability: Regulators or the public could, in theory, trace funds in real-time without waiting for quarterly reports. Reduced Counterparty Risk: Transactions settle on the network itself, minimizing the risk that a middleman fails. Empowered Users: Individuals can verify transactions independently, fostering a new model of self-sovereign finance. However, this radical transparency also presents challenges. Complete visibility can conflict with legitimate privacy needs for individuals and businesses. Moreover, the pseudonymous nature of wallets means transparency doesn’t always equate to knowing real-world identities, a key point for regulators. What Are the Real-World Implications for Crypto Regulation? Commissioner Atkins’s perspective is particularly significant given the SEC’s ongoing and often contentious role in crypto regulation. His view suggests a recognition within the agency of the fundamental technological advantages of public blockchains . This could pave the way for more nuanced regulations that protect investors without stifling the innovation that brings this transparency. For instance, instead of blanket skepticism, regulators might develop frameworks that leverage blockchain’s native transparency for better market surveillance. This approach would align regulatory goals with the technology’s inherent strengths. The key insight is that a transparent system is inherently more secure and fair, which should be the ultimate goal of any financial regulator. What Does the Future Hold for Transparent Finance? The endorsement of a transparent financial future is a powerful catalyst. As institutions recognize the efficiency and security of public blockchains , adoption will likely accelerate. We may see hybrid models where traditional finance incorporates blockchain technology to enhance its own transparency and settlement speed. The ultimate takeaway is profound. When a senior regulator acknowledges the superior transparency of an emerging technology, it’s a call to reimagine the foundations of finance itself. The goal shifts from managing opaque systems to harnessing open ones. The future of finance may not be hidden in vaults, but illuminated on a global, public ledger. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What did SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins actually say about blockchains? A1: Commissioner Atkins stated that public blockchains are “more transparent than any financial system built to date,” highlighting their open and verifiable ledger technology compared to traditional, closed financial systems. Q2: Does blockchain transparency mean everyone can see my personal transactions? A2: While transaction details (amounts, wallet addresses) are public on a blockchain, identities are typically pseudonymous. Your real-world name is not directly linked to your wallet address, though sophisticated analysis can sometimes de-anonymize users. Q3: If blockchains are so transparent, why is there so much crypto fraud? A3: Transparency of the ledger doesn’t prevent fraudulent schemes *off-chain* (like fake projects or phishing scams). The fraud occurs in the misrepresentation of assets or social engineering; the blockchain itself faithfully records the resulting transactions. Q4: How could regulators use blockchain’s transparency? A4: Regulators could use blockchain analytics tools to track illicit fund flows in real-time, monitor market manipulation, and automate compliance checks, potentially making enforcement faster and more efficient than in traditional markets. Q5: Are all blockchains equally transparent? A5: No. “Public” blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum are transparent. “Private” or “permissioned” blockchains, used by some enterprises, restrict who can view or submit transactions, offering less radical transparency. Q6: What’s the biggest hurdle for blockchain transparency in finance? A6: The main hurdle is balancing transparency with necessary privacy. Finding technical solutions (like zero-knowledge proofs) that allow for regulatory compliance and auditability without exposing all user data is a key challenge.

The miners diminished their operations amid renewed scrutiny from the CCP. The BTC hashrate fell significantly since December 13, reflecting a partial shutdown in the Chinese region of Xinjiang. The miners are closing as many as 400,000 BTC mining rigs, causing the sharpest downturn in BTC mining since the 2024 halving. As much as 100 EH/s went offline, causing a general drop in BTC hashrate of 5.6%. Jack Kong, former chairman of Canaan Mining, confirmed the data, estimating as much as 250 Th/s in facilities went offline. 算力较昨天掉了100E，跌了8%，按照平均250T，至少关了40万台 机器关了 https://t.co/cCg1F0DXOF — Jack孔@Nano Labs(NA)🇭🇰 (@punk8185) December 15, 2025 According to Kevin Zhang from Nakamoto Holdings and a former VP at the Foundry mining pool, the losses of operations are even bigger. Zhang estimates the shutdowns based on S19 Antminer machines. According to Zhang, 500,000 BTC mining rigs have been displaced from facilities with 2 GW of energy. Chinese shutdown cut overall BTC mining rate The shutdown arrives after a period of problem-free mining in China, when local pools and mining hubs emerged as global leaders. At one point, China carried over 14% of BTC hashrate. China still carries 1,362 BTC nodes, around 2.5% of the entire network. The BTC hashrate continued to slide for a day, just as reports landed of mining farms shutting down one after the other. BTC miners recently achieved a record of as much as 1.2Zh/s, followed by a dip to 869 EH/s. The shutdown happens at a time when miners are producing blocks with a potential loss, based on the hash ribbon indicator. China BTC miners face local CCP investigations The Chinese government announced a mining ban in 2021, but some regions retained their mining power. In late November 2025, China was the third-biggest source of hashrate, despite the official ban from 2021 . However, renewed threats against operations are causing miners to liquidate even relatively new hydroelectric mining farms. According to sources cited by Blockspace, some of the newer units use S19 XP mining rigs, some of the fastest mining machines. The BTC hashrate started sliding in the past two days, as sources emerged with information of Chinese miners shutting down even new operations with the latest mining rigs and up to 2 GW in hydroelectric power. | Source: Coinwarz The increased oversight arrived after a CCP investigation into mining operators promoting their mining sites on social media, including TikTok and Rednote. The exclusion of some of China’s miners may help other pools, further bringing down difficulty. However, the loss of trust in mining operations may hurt the reputation of the crypto sector. Over the years, the Chinese government has come out with statements in support of mining, so the current shutdown shock was unexpected. The mining operation shutdown coincided with another downturn for BTC. The leading coin dipped below $85,000 based on general market panic. Overall, mining does not affect BTC, which is still driven by derivative trading speculation mixed with spot trading.

TSLA has surged by about 4% in early trade and sat just under the old peak of $488.54, putting the company on track for a record close. The move came as videos of new testing rounds went viral and analysts raised targets again. Robotaxi progress drives the stock higher The jump followed new excitement around Tesla’s Robotaxi program. A user on X.com posted a clip on Sunday showing a Tesla Robotaxi driving around Austin without a safety driver. That city is one of the core testing spots for the service. Ashok Elluswamy, who runs Tesla’s AI and autonomous projects, reacted by writing, “And so it begins!” The line spread quickly, and many traders treated it like a signal that the next stage is starting. Elon Musk later backed up the video, writing, “Testing is underway with no occupants in the car.”That message lined up with what he said earlier this month when he claimed Tesla was only weeks away from unsupervised robotaxis on public roads. Elon also said last month that the Robotaxi fleet would double in December and that the company would expand testing to Phoenix and Nevada, not just Austin and the Bay Area. The next big move for Tesla is removing the safety drivers entirely in Austin, a step Elon has been teasing for weeks. Dan Ives of Wedbush, one of Wall Street’s strongest Tesla bulls, said the plan is finally coming together. In a note on Monday he wrote, “Heading into 2026 this marks a monster year ahead for Tesla and Musk as the autonomous and robotics chapter begins.”He said the firm expects a faster Robotaxi rollout across the country and believes volume production of the new Cybercabs will begin in April or May. That model became a major part of Tesla’s story last October when Elon showed off the two-seater design at an event in Hollywood. The car had no wheel, and no pedals, and the reveal turned the Cybercab into the main symbol of Tesla’s Robotaxi push. Reviews of FSD add more momentum Ives said 2026 may be the year that flips the script for Tesla , adding that the company is making real progress in its AI goals. He said, “We believe Tesla is taking major steps in advancing its AI Revolution path with autonomous and robotics front and center heading into 2026, that will be a ‘game changer and define Tesla’s future.’” That view gained more traction after several testers reviewed the latest version of the company’s FSD system and said it performs much better than older versions. Jason Cammisa, a well-known reviewer, said after a long trip in San Francisco, “This is door-to-door amazing. Couldn’t believe it.” Barron’s reporter Al Root also tested the update and said it was a “step up” from earlier releases. He said passengers liked the system more than his own driving and added, “Today, I prefer to let FSD do most of the driving most of the time. It makes life a little easier and, when under supervision, adds a layer of safety that passengers have come to appreciate.” But he did note that Waymo still shows stronger safety numbers for now. The strong reviews, the Austin testing clip, and Elon’s comments pushed Ives to keep his Outperform rating and his $600 price target. He also talked about a possible $2 trillion valuation. In his words, “The march to an AI driven valuation for TSLA over the next 6-9 months has now begun in our view with FSD and autonomous penetration of Tesla’s installed base and the acceleration of Cybercab in the US representing the golden goose for Musk & Co.” Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

This time, he is at the receiving end of a fresh wave of criticism from the on-chain analytics platform, Bubblemaps. Soulja Boy’s Apology The rapper recently posted a tweet in a bid to clarify his role, saying he had no knowledge that the notorious celebrity meme coin promoter, Sahil Arora, was involved or paying him to promote anything fraudulent. Soulja Boy said that at the time, he was doing paid promotions without fully understanding the crypto and NFT space. He went on to apologize to anyone who invested and suffered losses, and added that he has learned from past mistakes. While taking partial responsibility for not conducting deeper due diligence back then, he wrote, “Growth is learning from mistakes.” The apology has done little to sway public opinion. For instance, Bubblemaps mocked the tweet and outlined a pattern of behavior that portrayed the rapper as a repeat offender. The analytics platform laid out a sarcastic timeline – Soulja Boy promoted dozens of scam tokens in 2021, made “easy money” and “watch them all go to zero,” disappeared from the scene, waited four years, and then launched meme coins on the PumpFun platform, which again went to zero. Soulja Boy Blocked Bubblemaps Bubblemaps noted that after being exposed, Soulja Boy blocked the platform on X, tried to “come clean” while claiming ignorance, blamed Arora, became a “creator” on Base, and repeated the cycle. The controversy has roots in reporting by crypto sleuth ZachXBT, who in 2023 detailed Soulja Boy’s extensive involvement in crypto and NFT promotions. According to him, Soulja Boy was linked to 73 crypto promotions and 16 NFT projects later identified as scams, during which the rapper allegedly earned more than $730,000 from these promotions over the period under review. These findings drew significant criticism from the crypto community, and many questioned the rapper’s responsibility toward his followers and the investors who lost money. Critics argue that even if Soulja Boy was unaware of fraudulent activity, the repeated pattern of promoting high-risk projects that later collapse damages trust in the crypto ecosystem. Back in 2022, Soulja Boy, along with other high-profile figures like Nick Carter, Ben Phillips, and Lil Yachty, faced a lawsuit over their role in the failed SafeMoon cryptocurrency project and were accused of attracting investors through deceptive promotions.

Do Kwon was sentenced to 15 years in a U.S. prison after pleading guilty to wire fraud. He can apply to be transferred to South Korea in seven and a half years, but if convicted there, he could spend 30 additional years in jail. Do Kwon could face additional jail time Do Kwon, the 34-year-old co-founder of Terraform Labs, could face the possibility of spending decades more in prison after completing his U.S. sentence. Cryptopolitan reported that a Manhattan federal court sentenced him to 15 years last Thursday, and now, South Korean prosecutors are preparing a separate trial on charges including violations of the Capital Markets Act that could add over 30 years to his total time behind bars. Do Kwon was convicted on nine counts, including fraud and money laundering, after TerraUSD collapsed in 2022 and Luna wiped out an estimated $40 billion in investor funds worldwide. U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer called it a fraud on an “epic, generational scale” during the sentencing hearing. Kwon pleaded guilty in August to conspiracy to commit fraud and wire fraud as part of a plea bargaining agreement. While prosecutors requested 12 years and his defense team argued for five years, Judge Engelmayer imposed 15 years, saying the government’s recommendation was “unreasonably lenient” and the defense request was “utterly unthinkable.” The Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office obtained an arrest warrant for Kwon in September 2022 through their joint financial crimes unit. South Korean authorities estimate there are roughly 200,000 victims in the country, with total losses of about 300 billion won, equivalent to $204 million. Ten alleged accomplices have been on trial in Korea for nearly three years while authorities awaited Kwon’s potential return. As part of Do Kwon’s plea deal, U.S. prosecutors agreed not to oppose him if, after he serves half of his 15-year sentence, he applies to be transferred to Korea through the International Prisoner Transfer Program. During his U.S. sentencing hearing, Kwon’s defense team argued that the court should consider that he could still be prosecuted in South Korea as a reason to lessen his sentence to five years. Judge Engelmayer said that one court cannot base its ruling on guesses about what another court might decide. He also denied Kwon’s request to serve his sentence in South Korea, where his wife and four-year-old daughter live. How did the Terra-Luna collapse happen? In spring 2022, the total market value of TerraUSD and Luna exceeded $50 billion. The collapse happened rapidly over just three days, starting when TerraUSD lost its dollar peg on May 9, 2022. The algorithmic stablecoin model that Terra used proved to be fundamentally flawed. Rather than using collateralized stablecoins backed by actual assets, Terra relied on an arbitrage mechanism with its sister token Luna to maintain stability. And as investors lost confidence, Luna tokens flooded the market, driving prices down even further. Research from MIT Sloan found that the collapse was the result of the Anchor protocol, which offered high interest rates of around 20% to UST depositors. By April 2022, $6 million was required daily to maintain the rates. Victims who testified at Kwon’s sentencing described losing their life savings, retirement funds, and even contemplating suicide. One victim told the court his wife divorced him, his sons had to skip college, and he was forced to move back to Croatia to live with his parents. Another said he lived with the guilt of persuading his in-laws and hundreds of nonprofit organizations to invest. Kwon was arrested in Montenegro in March 2023 on charges of possessing forged documents. He spent nearly two years detained there before being transferred to the United States on December 31, 2024. In addition to his prison sentence, Kwon was ordered to forfeit over $19 million in illicit gains. He also agreed in 2024 to pay $80 million as a civil fine and be banned from crypto transactions as part of a $4.55 billion settlement that he and Terraform Labs reached with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. He apologized during his sentencing, telling Judge Engelmayer, “I have spent almost every waking moment of the last few years thinking of what I could have done differently and what I can do now to make things right.” Hearing from victims, he said, was “harrowing and reminded me again of the great losses that I have caused.” Sign up to Bybit and start trading with $30,050 in welcome gifts",News|Terra,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|LUNA|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-15 19:25:08

This integration allows millions of users to manage their BTC alongside Ethereum-based assets in one familiar interface. For anyone invested in the crypto space, this development is a significant step toward a more unified and user-friendly experience. The new MetaMask Bitcoin support bridges two of the largest ecosystems in digital assets. What Does MetaMask Bitcoin Support Actually Mean? Previously, MetaMask functioned primarily as an Ethereum wallet. The new MetaMask Bitcoin support changes that core identity. Users can now buy, swap, and send Bitcoin directly from their MetaMask wallet interface. This eliminates the need to juggle multiple wallets for different blockchains. Therefore, managing a diverse crypto portfolio becomes significantly simpler and more efficient. How to Access Bitcoin in Your MetaMask Wallet Getting started with Bitcoin on MetaMask is straightforward. The process leverages MetaMask’s “Buy,” “Swap,” and “Send” features, which are already familiar to users. Here is a simple breakdown of the key actions you can now take: Buy Bitcoin: Use integrated providers to purchase BTC directly with fiat currency. Swap Bitcoin: Exchange BTC for other cryptocurrencies (and vice-versa) within the wallet’s swap feature. Send Bitcoin: Transfer BTC to any external Bitcoin address seamlessly. This integration is powered by partnerships with third-party services that handle the Bitcoin network interactions, while MetaMask provides the unified user interface. Why Is This Integration a Big Deal for Crypto Users? The addition of MetaMask Bitcoin support addresses a major pain point: fragmentation. Managing crypto across different wallets and interfaces is cumbersome and increases security risks. By consolidating Bitcoin and Ethereum-based activities, MetaMask offers compelling benefits: Unified Management: View and control major assets from a single dashboard. Enhanced Convenience: Execute cross-chain swaps without leaving the wallet. Reduced Complexity: Lowers the barrier for new users exploring multiple blockchains. However, it is crucial to remember that you are trusting MetaMask’s interface and its partners with your Bitcoin transactions. Always ensure you are using the official MetaMask extension or mobile app. What Are the Potential Challenges to Consider? While the new MetaMask Bitcoin support is convenient, it introduces new considerations. MetaMask itself does not natively run a Bitcoin node. Instead, it relies on external infrastructure for Bitcoin transactions. This means users must trust these third-party services for accurate data and secure transaction broadcasting. Moreover, transaction fees and swap rates will vary based on these partners and network conditions on both the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks. Actionable Insights for MetaMask Users If you are ready to use this new feature, start with a small test transaction. This allows you to understand the flow, timing, and fees involved without risk. Furthermore, always double-check the receiving address when sending Bitcoin, as transactions on its network are irreversible. Keep your Secret Recovery Phrase secure, as it now protects access to your Bitcoin holdings within MetaMask as well. The Future of Multi-Chain Wallets MetaMask’s move to integrate Bitcoin is a clear signal of the industry’s direction. The future belongs to wallets that can seamlessly interact with multiple blockchains. This MetaMask Bitcoin support is likely just the first step. We can expect further integrations with other major networks like Solana or Cardano. Consequently, the user experience will continue to improve, making decentralized finance more accessible to everyone. In conclusion, the introduction of Bitcoin support transforms MetaMask from a leading Ethereum wallet into a foundational hub for multi-chain activity. It simplifies portfolio management and reflects the growing interoperability of the crypto world. For users, it means less time managing wallets and more time engaging with the broader ecosystem. This strategic integration solidifies MetaMask’s position while giving users a powerful, consolidated tool for their crypto journey. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Is my Bitcoin stored on the Ethereum blockchain now? A: No. Your Bitcoin remains on the Bitcoin blockchain. MetaMask’s support allows you to view your balance and create transactions for the Bitcoin network through its interface. Q: Do I need a separate seed phrase for Bitcoin in MetaMask? A: No. Your existing MetaMask Secret Recovery Phrase secures all assets within the wallet, including newly added Bitcoin. Q: Can I use Bitcoin to interact with Ethereum dApps? A: Not directly. To use Ethereum decentralized applications (dApps), you typically need ETH or ERC-20 tokens. However, you can use MetaMask’s swap feature to exchange some BTC for the required assets. Q: Are there extra fees for using Bitcoin on MetaMask? A: Yes. You will pay standard Bitcoin network transaction fees. Additionally, swap or buy services through MetaMask’s partners may include their own service fees. Q: Is this feature available on the MetaMask mobile app? A: Yes, the MetaMask Bitcoin support is available on both the browser extension and the mobile application. Q: What happens if the third-party service MetaMask uses has an issue? A: Your Bitcoin is safe on the blockchain, but your ability to transact via MetaMask could be temporarily affected. You can always use your private keys (derived from your seed phrase) in a dedicated Bitcoin wallet if needed. Found this guide to the new MetaMask Bitcoin integration helpful?

Base and Ethereum rounded out the top three positions while newer entrants like Sui and BNB Chain surged into prominence, according to CoinGecko’s latest blockchain ecosystem analysis . The layer-1 network’s market share dropped 12.0 percentage points from 38.79% in 2024, due to struggles to expand beyond meme-coin speculation even as institutional adoption accelerated through U.S. ETF launches. The decline pushed Solana out of the top five most popular crypto narratives ranking after being overtaken by AI agents and Made in USA themes. Most Popular Blockchain Ecosystems in 2025 By Mindshare 1. Solana – 26.79% 2. Base – 13.94% 3. Ethereum – 13.43% 4. Sui – 11.77% 5. BNB Chain – 9.05% 6. XRP Ledger – 4.68% 7. Sonic – 2.29% 8.

TON – 1.23% 12.… — CoinGecko (@coingecko) December 15, 2025 Base and Ethereum Hold Ground Coinbase’s Base ecosystem maintained second place with 13.94% of investor interest, down 2.9 percentage points from 16.81% in 2024. The smaller decline came despite major developments, including the Coinbase Wallet rebrand into the Base app, Shopify’s USDC payment integration , and x402 facilitation rollout. Ethereum secured third position with 13.43% mindshare, posting a 2.7 percentage point year-over-year increase that narrowed its gap with Base. The growth occurred while investors remained critical about ETH price performance and the blockchain’s competitive positioning amid intensifying rivalry from faster networks. However, Ethereum’s scaling layer faces severe consolidation pressure, as Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism now process nearly 90% of all L2 transactions, with Base alone accounting for over 60%. According to 21Shares, most of the 50-plus competing L2s are unlikely to survive through 2026 as smaller rollups have seen activity plunge 61% since June, creating what analysts call ‘zombie chains’ with minimal usage and evaporating liquidity. Sui and BNB Chain Double Their Market Presence Sui and BNB Chain emerged as the year’s biggest gainers, after more than doubling their market share to claim fourth and fifth positions, respectively. Sui recorded the largest growth, with a 6.9 percentage-point jump to 11.77%, positioning itself close behind Ethereum and establishing credibility as a serious competitor in chain-specific narratives. BNB Chain captured 9.05% mindshare following a 4.9 percentage point increase, driven by Binance Alpha’s May launch that propelled the network to lead onchain trading volumes. The ecosystem also benefited from founder CZ’s renewed involvement and resilient BNB price action throughout the year. Solana’s momentum continued to build through major platform integrations, as Coinbase activated native DEX trading for Solana tokens in its mobile application in early December, allowing users to swap assets on-chain for the first time. The exchange separately announced plans to acquire Vector, a Solana-native trading platform, in a deal expected to close by year-end. Source: CoinGecko New Entrants Reshape Competitive Landscape XRP Ledger and Bittensor led new additions to the top rankings, with XRP securing sixth place at 4.68% mindshare and the AI-focused Bittensor capturing 1.91% for ninth position. Berachain and Abstract also broke into the top 20 among new ecosystems tracked this year. Hyperliquid delivered the most dramatic rise after increasing from 0.01% mindshare in 2024 to 1.57% this year, climbing 44 positions in the rankings. The perpetuals-focused platform marked a key stablecoin milestone with its USDH launch while building robust DEX infrastructure and community engagement that demonstrated scalability beyond single-product offerings. Meanwhile, the TON ecosystem saw its ranking slide following a 5.0 percentage-point year-over-year decline in mindshare, contrasting sharply with Sui’s ascent as a serious contender for a chain-specific narrative. Notably, Jupiter reinforced Solana’s ecosystem depth by announcing seven coordinated upgrades at Breakpoint, headlined by JupUSD stablecoin developed with Ethena. The Solana DEX, which processed $1.08 trillion in combined spot and perpetual volume year-to-date while maintaining $2.7 billion in total value locked, also exited beta for Jupiter Lend after reaching $1 billion in supply within eight days.

This case, centered on the BSV delisting lawsuit , clarifies the legal boundaries for cryptocurrency exchanges and delivers a sobering message to investors about the risks of speculative assets. What Was the $13B BSV Delisting Lawsuit About? The legal battle began when a group of Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) investors sued several cryptocurrency exchanges. Their core argument? The exchanges caused massive financial harm by delisting the BSV token, leading to what they claimed were billions in future lost profits. The investors sought a staggering $13 billion in damages, making this one of the most significant crypto-related cases to reach the UK’s highest court. However, the Supreme Court unanimously dismissed the appeal. It upheld previous rulings that the exchanges could not be held liable for these speculative future losses. This decision hinged on a critical legal principle: establishing a direct and provable link between the delisting action and the claimed financial damage was nearly impossible in the volatile crypto market. Why Did the Supreme Court Dismiss the BSV Appeal? The court’s reasoning provides a crucial framework for future disputes. The dismissal wasn’t about whether the delisting happened, but about the nature of the losses claimed. The judges focused on several key points: Speculative Claims: The $13 billion figure was based on projected future profits, which the court deemed highly speculative and uncertain. Causation Challenge: Proving that the delisting alone caused the price drop, and not other market factors, was an insurmountable hurdle for the plaintiffs. Exchange Liability Limits: The ruling reinforces that exchanges have broad discretion in listing and delisting assets as part of their risk management. This outcome in the BSV delisting lawsuit sets a powerful precedent. It effectively shields exchanges from crippling lawsuits based on predictions of what might have been, rather than on concrete, realized losses. What Does This Ruling Mean for Crypto Investors? This verdict is a stark reminder of the inherent risks in cryptocurrency investment. For investors, the message is clear: the onus is on you to understand the volatility and regulatory landscape. DYOR is Paramount: The “Do Your Own Research” mantra has legal weight. Investing in tokens with contentious histories or limited exchange support carries higher risk. Understand Exchange Terms: All exchanges reserve the right to delist assets. This ruling affirms that right, making it essential to read the fine print. Future Profit Claims are Fragile: The court showed little appetite for claims based on hypothetical future gains, a common theme in crypto hype. The BSV delisting lawsuit outcome underscores that while investor protection is important, the law does not insure against market volatility or poor investment choices. The Bigger Picture: Regulation and Exchange Power Beyond the immediate parties, this ruling feeds into the global conversation about crypto regulation. It highlights the significant power centralized exchanges wield over market access. While the court did not find them liable in this specific case, the decision may prompt regulators to look more closely at listing/delisting policies to ensure they are fair, transparent, and not manipulative. For the BSV project itself, this is another significant setback in a series of controversies, potentially affecting its legitimacy and mainstream adoption prospects. Final Verdict: A Precedent for Clarity The UK Supreme Court’s dismissal of the BSV delisting lawsuit is a landmark moment. It provides much-needed legal clarity in a murky area, protecting exchanges from speculative litigation while reminding investors of their responsibility. The ruling doesn’t give exchanges a free pass to act maliciously, but it does require plaintiffs to bring concrete evidence of actual harm, not just theoretical fortune. In the wild west of crypto, this decision is a step toward defining the rules of the frontier. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What was the BSV delisting lawsuit? It was a $13 billion legal case where BSV investors sued crypto exchanges, claiming the delisting of Bitcoin SV token caused them massive future financial losses. Why did the UK Supreme Court dismiss the case? The court dismissed the appeal because the claims for future lost profits were too speculative. It was impossible to prove the delisting alone caused the alleged damages, separating it from normal market volatility. Does this mean exchanges can delist any coin without consequence? Not exactly. The ruling protects them from lawsuits over speculative future losses. However, exchanges must still act in accordance with their own terms of service and could face action for fraudulent or malicious conduct. What should I learn from this as a crypto investor? This case reinforces the importance of understanding that exchange listings are not guaranteed. You should research a token’s exchange support history and be aware that delisting is always a risk, especially for more contentious assets. Could a similar lawsuit succeed in the future? A lawsuit based on proven, actual financial loss directly caused by an exchange’s wrongful action (like fraud) might have a chance. However, a claim based purely on “what the price could have been” will likely fail following this precedent. Does this affect other ongoing crypto lawsuits? Yes, it sets a persuasive precedent in common law jurisdictions. Other courts may look to this ruling when evaluating similar claims about exchange liability for delisting decisions.

A surprising new trend is emerging for the holiday season, especially among younger generations. According to a recent global survey by Visa, nearly half of U.S. Gen Z would be thrilled to find cryptocurrency waiting for them under the tree. This signals a profound change in how digital natives perceive value and gifting. Why Is Cryptocurrency Becoming a Desirable Holiday Gift? The Visa survey polled 1,000 adults and found that 45% of U.S. Gen Z—those aged 18 to 28—view digital assets as a welcome present. This preference often surpasses traditional holiday items like toys or physical collectibles. The data suggests this generation sees cryptocurrency not just as an investment, but as a practical and forward-thinking gift. This shift is driven by several factors. Gen Z has grown up in a digital world, making intangible assets feel more natural. They also perceive crypto as having greater long-term potential than many traditional gifts. Therefore, receiving crypto can feel like receiving a stake in the future of finance. What Does This Mean for the Future of Gifting? The survey results point to a broader acceptance of digital assets in everyday life. When almost half of a major demographic prefers a cryptocurrency holiday gift, it indicates mainstream adoption is progressing. This isn’t just about speculation; it’s about integration into social and cultural rituals like gift-giving. Key implications of this trend include: Mainstream Validation: Gifting crypto moves it from niche investment to a shared cultural experience.

This Bitcoin decline isn’t happening in isolation—several powerful market forces are converging to create downward pressure. Understanding these factors can help traders navigate volatile conditions and make more informed decisions. What’s Really Driving Bitcoin’s Price Downward? BeInCrypto’s recent analysis identifies five specific factors contributing to the current Bitcoin decline . These elements range from global macroeconomic concerns to technical market dynamics. Let’s break down each factor to understand how they’re impacting cryptocurrency prices. Factor 1: The Bank of Japan’s Potential Interest Rate Move The first major concern stems from international monetary policy. Markets are worried about potential interest rate hikes by the Bank of Japan, which could trigger the unwinding of the yen carry trade. This global financial mechanism has supported risk assets for years, and its potential reversal threatens liquidity across markets, including cryptocurrencies. How Are Market Mechanics Contributing to the Decline? Beyond macroeconomic factors, specific market mechanics are amplifying the Bitcoin decline . The combination of leveraged liquidations with thin weekend liquidity creates a dangerous environment where price movements become exaggerated. When traders using high leverage get liquidated during low-volume periods, the resulting selling pressure can trigger cascading effects throughout the market. Additionally, market makers in the spot market are reportedly adding selling pressure. These key liquidity providers sometimes need to adjust their positions, which can temporarily increase selling activity and contribute to downward momentum. What Role Do Technical Factors Play in Bitcoin’s Slide? Technical analysis reveals that Bitcoin has lost significant momentum. Key support levels have broken, and the overall chart structure has weakened. This technical deterioration often becomes self-reinforcing as algorithmic traders and technical analysts respond to bearish signals with additional selling. Meanwhile, uncertainty surrounding U.S. macroeconomic data creates another layer of complexity. Investors are struggling to predict how upcoming economic reports might influence Federal Reserve policy, leading to risk-off sentiment across financial markets. Can Understanding These Factors Help Your Trading Strategy? Recognizing the drivers behind this Bitcoin decline provides valuable context for your investment decisions. Here are key takeaways: Monitor global central bank policies – International monetary decisions can ripple through crypto markets Watch for liquidity patterns – Thin trading periods often amplify price movements Track technical indicators – Momentum shifts can signal changing market conditions Consider macroeconomic data – U.S. economic reports influence broader risk sentiment What Does This Mean for Bitcoin’s Future? The current Bitcoin decline represents a convergence of multiple negative factors rather than a single catastrophic event. However, cryptocurrency markets have historically shown remarkable resilience. While short-term volatility may continue, understanding these underlying drivers helps investors maintain perspective during turbulent periods. Remember that market cycles are normal in both traditional finance and cryptocurrency. The factors contributing to today’s decline may shift tomorrow, creating new opportunities for informed investors who understand market dynamics. Frequently Asked Questions About Bitcoin’s Decline How long might this Bitcoin decline last? There’s no definitive timeline, as cryptocurrency markets respond to multiple factors. The decline could continue until key concerns like interest rate uncertainty or technical patterns show improvement. Should I sell my Bitcoin during this decline? This depends on your investment strategy and risk tolerance. Some investors view declines as buying opportunities, while others prefer to reduce exposure during volatility. Consider your financial goals before making decisions. Are other cryptocurrencies affected by the same factors? Yes, most cryptocurrencies tend to move in correlation with Bitcoin, especially during strong market trends. The factors affecting Bitcoin typically impact the broader crypto market. What signs should I watch for a potential recovery? Key indicators include stabilization in global monetary policy concerns, improved technical patterns, reduced selling pressure from market makers, and positive momentum in trading volumes. How does weekend trading affect Bitcoin prices? Lower weekend trading volumes mean that buy and sell orders have greater price impact. This can amplify both declines and rallies during these periods. Is this decline different from previous Bitcoin corrections? While each market movement has unique characteristics, the current decline shares similarities with past corrections driven by macroeconomic concerns and technical factors.

We asked the new version, GPT 5.2, to do price forecast for XRP, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu, and it delivered a quite interesting AI price outlook. Below are ChatGPT’s dual-scenario predictions outlining monumental potential gains and the downside hazards for each asset throughout December and going into 2026. Ripple (XRP): ChatGPT Predicts a Potential Collapse to $1 If adoption for XRP declines and macro liquidity tightens, keeping XRP stuck below major resistance, ChatGPT AI predicts a total collapse for XRP to $1. Source: ChatGPT Predictions / XRP Such a decline would be the exact opposite of what XRP has been doing all year. After Ripple secured a critical legal victory against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), a new all time high of $3.65 was hit in July. Analysts expect this strong XRP performance to continue, aligning with ChatGPT AI predictions of a revisit to the $3 to $5 range heading into 2026. The RLUSD stablecoin launch, ongoing integrations, and reports of rising adoption specially in Asia Japan, combined with strong ETF inflows, could all set the stage for XRP to break a new all time high in 2026 if the bull run extends. Source: XRPUSD / TradingView A Renewed Memecoins Cycle Could Be Led By Dogecoin And Shiba Inu According to Google Trends data, memecoins search volume has just hit a 5 year low. This is also reflected in price, as the sector has lost 60% of its value this year. For the Dogecoin bull case, ChatGPT predicts a strong momentum return that could take DOGE to the $0.35 to $0.50 zone heading into 2026, driven by a renewed memecoin cycle and broader risk on sentiment. This is why the focus remains on a Bitcoin breakout. When Bitcoin breaks out, capital often rotates into memecoins, and Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, being the sector leaders, are likely to feel that effect almost immediately. The same can be said about Shiba Inu. Launched in 2020 as a challenger to Dogecoin, it now boasts a market cap near $4.83 billion. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB has a network upgrade scheduled for 2026. It will add a privacy layer, which is likely to be the main driver for the coin to restore momentum. From a technical standpoint, SHIB has yet to decisively break out of the bullish flag patterns that emerged earlier this year. A move towards the critical $0.000010 resistance as December concludes could set the stage for ChatGPT’s projected 2026 range of $0.00003 to $0.000050, representing gains of up to 5×. Maxi Doge: The High-Conviction Meme Play Traders Are Watching Before the Next Cycle While AI models like ChatGPT outline extreme upside and downside scenarios for Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Some traders are already looking one step ahead to the next memecoin rotation. One project starting to stand out during this reset phase is Maxi Doge. Maxi Doge is a Dogecoin inspired meme token built around pure speculation and community driven momentum. There is no overengineered utility pitch here. The project leans fully into meme culture with its jacked “gym bro” Doge mascot. This taps directly into the high risk, high reward mentality that has defined every major memecoin cycle so far. Despite a slow memecoin market, Maxi Doge has already raised over $4.29M. This signals early demand even as retail interest remains muted. A key reason traders are paying attention is the token distribution. Around 40% of the total supply was allocated directly to the public presale. This means no private rounds or VC allocations, reducing the risk of insider sell pressure once trading begins. Maxi Doge also offers staking for early buyers, with APY reaching up to 72% , giving holders a way to earn yield while waiting for the next wave of speculative momentum to return. Maxi Doge is available through its presale using ETH, USDT, BNB, or a credit card directly on the official website . Stay updated through Maxi Doge’s official X and Telegram pages.

The historical cycle analysis and bearish technical signals suggest Bitcoin may decline until September 2026, with a potential 70–80% downside. I shifted my strategy to the YieldMax MSTR Short Option Income Strategy ETF (WNTR), which benefits from Bitcoin declines and offers a trailing 12-month yield of ~60%. WNTR has outperformed Bitcoin, BITO, and IBIT since October 2025, and technicals indicate potential for further upside as the crypto winter persists. The crypto winter is already here, in my opinion, based on some key historical trends. Bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) monthly chart is already bearish, which always marked the year-long bear market. The daily chart shows a bear flag formation, which typically results in a continuation to the downside. As a result, I am changing my rating for the ProShares Bitcoin ETF ( BITO ) to a sell, as it is likely to underperform during the crypto bear market. My shift in strategy is to hold WNTR during Bitcoin's bear market, which may last until about September 2026. Bitcoin's last two price cycles lasted 1,050 days from the price bottom to the price peak. If that remains consistent, the bull market for the current price cycle already ended in October 2025 with a peak price of about $126,000. Bitcoin's Monthly Chart Bitcoin's Monthly Price Chart w/ RSI & MACD (TradingView) Bitcoin's monthly chart above shows how bearish divergences between the price and the RSI indicator are followed by a year-long bear market. A bearish divergence occurred back in 2021 as bitcoin's price made a higher high from the April peak to the November peak. During that same time, the RSI made a lower high. That bearish divergence resulted in bitcoin's bear market, which lasted through most of 2022. The current price cycle shows a similar bearish divergence. Bitcoin's price made a higher high from the January 2025 peak price to the October 2025 peak price. The RSI made a lower high during that same time. The MACD confirmed the bear market in January 2022 when the blue MACD line crossed below the red signal line while the histogram bars turned to red. The same bearish crossover occurred in November 2025, with the blue line crossing below the red signal line while the histogram bars turned back to red. If this cycle is consistent with prior cycles, then Bitcoin could continue its decline until about September 2026. The Bitcoin bear markets tend to last about one year from the peak price to the price bottom. Bitcoin tends to drop 70% to 80% during these bear markets. So, it makes sense to me to reposition for this likely crypto winter. Bitcoin's Daily Chart Bitcoin's Daily Price Chart w/ RSI & MACD (TradingView) Bitcoin's Daily Chart above shows a bear flag formation. This is indicated by the sharp drop in price during most of November, as the flag pole. The consolidation period since the low price from November 21 represents the bear flag. Consolidation periods as part of a bear flag like this typically result in a continuation downward. The RSI is now bearish on the daily chart as it dropped below 50. The MACD appears to be bullish as the blue line remains above the red signal line while the histogram bars remain green. However, bitcoin's price is not showing much strength as it has been failing to move above $95,000. As a result, I expect the price to break lower than $80,000 as the crypto winter continues. Strategy Shift I liked holding BITO during the bull phase of Bitcoin's price cycle. The underlying price might lag bitcoin's price appreciation. However, the monthly dividends that the ETF pays results in an attractive total return along with a steady payout when bitcoin's price trades sideways. My thesis is that bitcoin is likely to decline until about September 2026, in line with the year-long bear markets of the past. I was initially considering switching to the ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF ( BITI ) for a bearish position. However, BITI only has a yield of less than 2% for a monthly payout, so I found an another alternative that pays a higher yield on a weekly basis. I sold my BITO holding and bought the YieldMax MSTR Short Option Income Strategy ETF ( WNTR ). WNTR is a short-play on Strategy ( MSTR ), which is highly levered to bitcoin. MSTR dropped about 90% during the last bitcoin bear market in 2022. So, I expect a similar sharp drop in price for this bear market. WNTR has been appreciating in value since the October 2025 bitcoin price peak. The other attractive aspect of WNTR is that it pays a weekly distribution with a trailing 12-month yield of about 60%. The distributions do fluctuate week to week. So, it can be difficult to determine what the annual yield will be going forward. WNTR Daily Chart vs. Bitcoin, BITO, IBIT (TradingView) The daily chart above shows WNTR's outperformance over Bitcoin, BITO, and The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) since the beginning of October 2025. This chart accounts for both price appreciation and distribution payouts. WNTR is displaying a bull flag formation. This indicates a consolidation after the recent run-up in price. Bull flag formations like this typically result in continuations to the upside, from what I have observed. I expect a break higher in WNTR as bitcoin continues lower through about September 2026. Risks To The Investment Thesis It is possible that this bitcoin price cycle does act differently than the previous two cycles. It is possible that Bitcoin rallies to a new high in the coming weeks or months. It is also possible that this bear market has a much shallower drop than in previous cycles. Many investors believe that since bitcoin is maturing with institutional support (ETFs, etc), that it won't have the sharp drops in price like in past bear markets. It can be difficult to time the bitcoin market. As a result, some investors may prefer to hold bitcoin over the long term and ride out the bear markets. The Bottom Line Outlook My thesis is that this current price cycle will play out similarly to the previous two cycles. I remember some analysts saying that the last cycle would be different back in 2021 due to more widespread adoption of Bitcoin. Some analysts were calling for the price of bitcoin to hit $100,000 by the end of 2022. Well, that didn't happen, and a year-long bear market occurred instead. Some of the same analysts are calling for bitcoin to hit $200k to $300k in 2026. Well, I think that might be a better target for the next price cycle after this bear market runs its course until about September 2026. If this cycle lasted about as long as the previous two cycles, then the price of bitcoin already peaked at about $126,000 in October 2025. WNTR is one option for a short play to hold during this bear market. WNTR is likely to appreciate while the highly levered MSTR declines. Plus, the weekly distributions from WNTR should add significantly to the total return. I will look to shift my strategy when the technical conditions change.",BITO|BTC-USD|BITI|WNTR|MSTR|IBIT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-12-15 19:59:00

Here’s Why This Cheap Crypto Under $0.04 Is Stealing the Spotlight,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-cardano-ada-losing-steam-heres-why-this-cheap-crypto-under-0-04-is-stealing-the-spotlight/,"Whether Cardano (ADA) is losing steam has been a common query in the latest crypto updates, owing to the ongoing price developments that keep influencing the markets. Cardano has been moving backwards with traders recalculation of risks, and with that, the focus has shifted to more affordable investment options, which are considered the best crypto to buy. In such a fluctuating crypto market, the investor making assessments on which crypto to invest in is now weighing whether it’s worth investing in existing networks for potential growth or whether new DeFi crypto alternatives are the best way to manage risks. Amidst the rising debate on which is best, a single cheap crypto with a price tag of under $0.04 is now receiving undue attention. Cardano Price Pressure And Fading Momentum Cardano has been continuing to extend the loss, with the market reacting quickly. The price of ADA is down by a further 10% to $0.41, with a drop in trade volume of approximately 19%, which indicates that the level of participation has cooled. The derivatives markets have been supporting this sentiment. The open interest in ADA futures has fallen by a further 11% to close to $713.5 million, which indicates that traders have been closing, rather than opening, positions. The funding rates have fallen significantly, with shorts exceeding longs, with over 55% of markets positioning for a further decline. Network metrics are progressing, but price is still under strain. Transaction activity has pushed to multi-month highs, with daily active addresses approaching four-month peaks, which indicates that users have not left the network behind. Despite this, the price has been retained below significant moving averages, thus enhancing a negative consolidation trend. ADA has been fluctuating below the 50-day and 200-day SMAs, with indicators pointing to a potential drop to $0.37 in case of a weakening support level. Hence, persons seeking a crypto to buy have been exploring alternatives to ADA. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Attracts Increasing Attention Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been making headlines as the spotlight swings from majors that are losing steam to a fresh crypto now trading under $0.04. It has been steadily rising throughout its presale, which has now entered Phase 6 with 98% turnout. The amount of funds generated from presale is $19,500,000, with total MUTM holders since presale began at 18,480. Price in Phase 6 is $0.035, which is a 250% rise from $0.01 price in phase one. Phase 6 is selling quickly, and the opportunity to buy tokens at such a low cost is soon expiring. Following this phase, Phase 7 is going to open with a price increase of close to 20%, setting the price for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $0.04. The MUTM launch price is $0.06, with buyers gearing towards a potential return on investment of 420% following the launch of Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The impending price change has instigated a sense of urgency for potential investors who believe that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the best cryptocurrency to invest in. The latest updates on the platform have encouraged engagement. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has introduced a dashboard with a leaderboard of the top 50 token holders. A 24-hour leaderboard has also been introduced, which encourages activity, and daily, the #1 ranked user is rewarded with a $500 bonus of MUTM if a single transaction has been made in that particular day. The dashboard resets every day at 00:00 UTC. The development stages have also continued to be in the limelight. Mutuum Finance has confirmed that the launch of its V1 protocol on the Sepolia testnet is set to take place in Q4 2025, including a Liquidity Pool, mtToken, Debt Token, and Liquidator Bot, with ETH & USDT as base assets. Alongside development, an audit is also taking place, with Halborn Security conducting a review of the lending & borrowing contracts of Mutuum. All these elements have managed to keep Mutuum Finance (MUTM) within the talks of the best crypto to buy, as well as the best cryptocurrency to invest in, within the current sector. Where The Spotlight Is Shifting Cardano has been under short-term pressure, although the activity on the network has been stable, and this is what is influencing investment activity. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is currently trading under $0.04 in Phase 6, is taking advantage of the shift in what crypto-assets people are investing in for the upcoming cycle. The limited time before the price rise in Phase 7 is further sharpening focus on Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is becoming an increasing reference point in crypto-world headlines.

55840519,645140,1765828832,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55840519.jpeg,Major Ethereum Whale Returns: Buys $119M In ETH Amid Market Drop,https://bitcoinist.com/major-ethereum-whale-returns-buy-119m-eth-amid-drop/,"Ethereum is struggling to regain momentum after failing to reclaim the $3,200 level, keeping the market in a fragile equilibrium. Despite several recovery attempts, price action suggests that bulls are now focused less on pushing higher and more on defending current demand zones. This hesitation reflects broader uncertainty across the crypto market, where traders remain cautious amid tightening liquidity and elevated macro risk. However, beneath the surface, on-chain activity is beginning to tell a more nuanced story. According to Lookonchain, data sourced from Arkham reveals that a major market participant has re-entered aggressively. The so-called 66kETHBorrow Whale, who previously accumulated 489,696 ETH worth roughly $1.5 billion, has started buying Ethereum again as prices declined. This behavior stands out because it occurred during weakness rather than strength, a pattern typically associated with strategic accumulation rather than short-term speculation. Whale activity during drawdowns often signals confidence in higher prices over a longer time horizon, even when sentiment remains fragile. While Ethereum still faces technical resistance overhead, the return of large buyers suggests that demand is weak but has not disappeared. Whale Accumulation Raises Questions Amid Ethereum Weakness Lookonchain data provides further insight into the recent actions of the 66kETHBorrow whale, highlighting a sequence that has drawn significant attention from the market. Over the past eight hours, the whale borrowed approximately $85 million in USDT from Aave and transferred the funds to Binance. Shortly after, he withdrew 38,576 ETH, valued at roughly $119.3 million, from the exchange. This rapid movement of capital during a market pullback has raised questions among smaller investors, many of whom are wondering whether this whale is acting on information or conviction that is not yet reflected in price. Such behavior is often interpreted as deliberate accumulation, particularly when ETH is withdrawn from exchanges rather than left on trading platforms. Exchange outflows generally reduce immediate sell-side liquidity, reinforcing the perception of long-term positioning. However, it is critical to acknowledge the limits of on-chain visibility. These transactions represent only the wallets that have been publicly identified and tracked. There is no certainty that this whale’s exposure is fully transparent. He could be holding hedges, short positions, or additional long exposure through other wallets, centralized exchanges, or derivatives markets that are not visible on-chain. As a result, while the activity suggests confidence, it should not be interpreted as definitive directional confirmation. ETH Price Struggles Below Key Moving Averages Ethereum is currently trading near the $3,150–$3,200 zone after a modest rebound, but the broader technical structure remains fragile. On the daily chart, ETH continues to trade below its 50-day and 100-day moving averages, both of which are now acting as dynamic resistance. The recent bounce stalled near the declining 50-day MA, highlighting the lack of strong follow-through from buyers. The 200-day moving average, positioned closer to the $3,500 area, remains well above current price levels. This reinforces that Ethereum is still in a corrective phase within a larger macro uptrend. As long as price remains below this long-term trend indicator, upside attempts are likely to face selling pressure from both swing traders and systematic strategies. Price action over the past weeks shows a series of lower highs following the rejection near $4,000 in October, confirming a short-term bearish market structure. However, ETH has so far defended the $2,800–$2,900 support region, suggesting that buyers are still active at lower levels. For Ethereum to shift momentum decisively, bulls must reclaim and hold above the $3,300–$3,400 range. Failure to do so keeps downside risks open, with a potential retest of prior demand zones if broader market sentiment deteriorates.

After a sharp correction from recent highs, price action has entered a consolidation phase that, on the surface, appears relatively calm. Volatility has compressed, and short-term price movements suggest a market pausing rather than decisively breaking down. However, this apparent stability may be misleading. Related Reading: Ethereum Trades Near Whales’ Cost Basis For The Fourth Time Since 2021 – Historic Test According to a CryptoQuant report from XWIN Research Japan, on-chain data is signaling growing structural risk beneath the surface. The Inter-Exchange Flow Pulse (IFP), a metric that tracks the movement of Bitcoin between exchanges and serves as a proxy for internal market liquidity, has turned red. In such environments, price moves tend to be sharper and less orderly once direction is established. While reduced exchange balances can limit immediate selling pressure, they also amplify the impact of sudden demand or forced liquidations. This shift indicates a clear slowdown in capital circulation across trading venues, suggesting that liquidity conditions are deteriorating. Inter-Exchange Flow Pulse Signals Structural Fragility The report explains that the Inter-Exchange Flow Pulse (IFP) measures how actively Bitcoin moves from one exchange to another, serving as a proxy for internal market liquidity and capital circulation. When IFP is elevated, capital rotates efficiently across venues, arbitrage opportunities are quickly absorbed, and liquidity providers keep order books deep. In those conditions, price discovery is smoother, and volatility tends to remain contained. By contrast, when IFP declines, the market’s internal “blood flow” weakens. Capital becomes static, liquidity fragments, and prices grow increasingly sensitive to relatively small trades. This deterioration in liquidity is unfolding alongside historically low exchange balances. While reduced sellable supply can initially act as price support, it also creates thinner order books. Once price begins to move decisively in either direction, slippage increases and volatility accelerates. With leverage still elevated across derivatives markets, instability becomes driven less by directional conviction and more by the magnitude of forced reactions. Historically, periods when IFP turned red produced abrupt corrections and sharp price swings, not clean trends. The central risk today is therefore not aggressive distribution, but structural fragility. Until inter-exchange liquidity improves, Bitcoin remains vulnerable to sudden, outsized moves, making leveraged positioning particularly risky in the current market structure.

Following the aggressive sell-off in late November, BTC found a local bottom near the $82,000–$83,000 zone, where strong demand stepped in and triggered a rebound. However, that recovery quickly lost momentum, and price is now ranging below the descending cluster of moving averages. Bitcoin is currently trading around the $89,000–$90,000 level, repeatedly failing to reclaim the 200-period moving average on the 4-hour timeframe. The 50 and 100 moving averages are also sloping downward, acting as dynamic resistance and reinforcing the short-term bearish structure. Each attempt to push higher has been met with selling pressure, suggesting that bulls lack conviction at current levels.

This typically precedes a volatility expansion, especially when price compresses beneath major resistance. Structurally, BTC remains vulnerable as long as it trades below the $92,000–$94,000 zone, which previously acted as support and now caps upside attempts. On the downside, the $87,000–$88,000 range is emerging as immediate support. A decisive breakdown below this area could reopen the path toward the $84,000 region. Until a clear breakout occurs, Bitcoin remains in a fragile balance between distribution and base-building.

Recent XRP price behavior has reignited debates among traders about risk, timing, and the potential for long-term gains, with analysts closely monitoring technical and macro trends for clues about where the asset could head next. On X, market analyst Levi Rietveld offered a candid assessment of XRP’s near-term trajectory, capturing both caution and opportunity. According to Rietveld, the digital asset may experience a significant bottoming phase in the coming months, testing the patience of long-term holders. While his commentary signals a challenging period ahead, he frames it as a potential opportunity for disciplined investors. Understanding the Technical Landscape XRP’s recent price movements show a pattern of consolidation , where the token has traded within a defined range despite broader market volatility. Analysts like Rietveld point out that such phases often precede either significant accumulation or liquidation events. Support levels around $1 have historically acted as psychological and technical floors, providing a potential buffer during periods of downward pressure. The unfortunate truth is $XRP is likely to bottom out somewhere around $1 over the next 6 months. If you can stomach this bottom and buy the dip you have what it takes to be RICH! — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) December 14, 2025 The XRP market remains influenced by both macroeconomic trends and sector-specific factors. Global liquidity conditions, interest rate expectations, and institutional adoption patterns all play a role in shaping near-term price movements. XRP’s market structure, combined with lingering investor sentiment after the conclusion of the Ripple-SEC case in 2025, suggests that short-term corrections could be deeper than some traders anticipate. The Case for Buying the Dip While the outlook may appear pessimistic at first glance, Rietveld emphasizes that investors who can endure a lower price environment may find substantial long-term rewards. His observation that those “who can stomach this bottom and buy the dip have what it takes to be rich” reflects a widely accepted principle in investment psychology: disciplined accumulation during temporary weakness often precedes outsized gains. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Historically, XRP has demonstrated resilience after significant drawdowns. Following major consolidation periods, the token has often experienced structural rebounds, driven by renewed market confidence and broader adoption of the XRP Ledger across cross-border payments and institutional use cases. The combination of technical support levels and sustained demand provides a foundation for potential recovery. Balancing Risk and Reward Rietveld’s assessment serves as a reminder that cryptocurrency investing demands both patience and a clear strategy. While the $1 bottom may be psychologically daunting , understanding risk-reward dynamics and maintaining position sizing discipline can position investors to capitalize on eventual market recoveries. For many, navigating this window of uncertainty is not just about surviving the dip but leveraging it for long-term growth. As XRP continues to mature as a digital asset, market observers and retail investors alike are reminded that temporary setbacks can often mask deeper opportunities . Rietveld’s analysis reinforces the notion that preparation and strategic decision-making are key to thriving in a market defined by volatility.

Have you checked the pulse of the Bitcoin network lately? A key metric is flashing a warning sign. The number of Bitcoin active addresses has just slumped to its lowest point in a full year. This isn’t just a minor dip; it’s a significant drop that raises crucial questions about current user engagement and underlying demand. Let’s unpack what this means for the world’s premier cryptocurrency. What Does the Drop in Bitcoin Active Addresses Actually Mean? First, let’s clarify the metric. Active addresses refer to unique addresses that were either sending or receiving Bitcoin in a given period. Think of them as the individual participants actively using the network on a given day. It’s a fundamental gauge of grassroots adoption and utility. According to data analyzed by The Block, the seven-day moving average has fallen to around 660,000. This is the lowest level since December 2024. That previous peak was driven by a frenzy around novel protocols like Ordinals and Runes, which clogged the network with activity. The contrast today is stark. Why Are Bitcoin Active Addresses Declining Now? Several factors are likely contributing to this quiet period. Understanding them gives us a clearer picture of the market’s health. Market Sentiment and Price Stability: Bitcoin’s price has been in a consolidation phase, lacking the volatile, momentum-driven rallies that typically attract speculative traders and new users. When prices are flat, on-chain activity often cools. End of the Ordinals/Runes Hype Cycle: The explosion of activity from these “Bitcoin NFT” and token protocols was a major driver in late 2024. That speculative wave has naturally subsided, taking a chunk of transactional activity with it. Seasonal and Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic uncertainty can lead investors to adopt a ‘wait-and-see’ approach, reducing their frequency of transactions. Shift to Layer-2 Solutions: Some everyday transaction activity may be migrating to faster, cheaper Layer-2 networks like the Lightning Network. This is positive for scalability but can reduce on-chain address counts. Is Low Activity a Bearish Signal for Bitcoin? It’s a nuanced picture. A sustained drop in Bitcoin active addresses can indicate weakening retail interest, which is a concern for organic growth. Lower demand for blockspace can also impact miner revenue from fees. However, it’s not all doom and gloom. This lull could represent a period of accumulation by long-term holders (HODLers) who are moving coins to cold storage, not actively transacting. Furthermore, institutional activity through ETFs often occurs off-chain or via large, infrequent transfers that don’t significantly boost the active address count. Therefore, while the metric is a clear warning to watch, it must be analyzed alongside other data like exchange flows, holder composition, and institutional volumes. Actionable Insights for Crypto Observers What should you do with this information? Don’t panic, but do pay attention. Monitor the Trend: See if this is a one-month blip or the start of a longer-term downtrend. A rebound in active addresses often precedes or accompanies positive price momentum. Look for Catalysts: Watch for developments that could reignite network activity, such as a major protocol upgrade, a resurgence in decentralized finance (DeFi) on Bitcoin, or a sharp shift in macroeconomic policy. Context is Key: Always cross-reference this metric with others. Strong ETF inflows or a rising hash rate can offset concerns from falling active addresses. The Bottom Line on Bitcoin’s Network Pulse The decline in Bitcoin active addresses to a one-year low is an undeniable signal that the network’s day-to-day user activity has cooled significantly from its recent highs. It highlights a current lack of compelling, retail-driven use cases beyond pure speculation. However, Bitcoin’s story has always been one of cycles and resilience. This period of low activity may well be the quiet before the next storm of innovation or adoption. For savvy investors and enthusiasts, it’s a time for vigilant observation, not alarm. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What are Bitcoin active addresses? A: They are unique cryptocurrency addresses that were actively involved in sending or receiving Bitcoin on the blockchain within a specific time frame, typically measured daily or as a moving average. It’s a key metric for gauging network usage. Q: Is a low active address count always bad for Bitcoin’s price? A: Not necessarily. While it can indicate low retail speculation, it may also coincide with accumulation phases where long-term holders are not moving their coins. Price is influenced by many factors, including institutional investment, which may not be fully captured by this metric. Q: What caused the previous high in active addresses in December 2024? A: The peak was primarily driven by massive interest and transaction volume related to the Ordinals (inscriptions) and Runes token protocols, which created a speculative frenzy on the Bitcoin blockchain itself. Q: Could Layer-2 networks be causing this drop? A: Yes, it’s a possibility. As users adopt Layer-2 solutions like the Lightning Network for smaller, faster payments, those transactions happen off-chain. This improves user experience but can reduce the count of on-chain active addresses. Q: How can I track Bitcoin active addresses myself? A> You can view this metric on several blockchain analytics platforms such as Glassnode, IntoTheBlock, or CoinMetrics, which provide charts and data for on-chain activity.

55841028,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=245618,1765829718,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Alarming Warning: Former SEC Commissioner Exposes Dangers of Excessive Government Crypto Surveillance,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/excessive-government-crypto-surveillance-warning/,"BitcoinWorld Alarming Warning: Former SEC Commissioner Exposes Dangers of Excessive Government Crypto Surveillance Imagine a world where every digital transaction you make is watched, recorded, and analyzed. This isn’t a dystopian fiction plot; it’s a real warning from a former top U.S. regulator. Paul Atkins, a former Commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has sounded a chilling alarm about the potential for excessive government crypto surveillance to strip away financial privacy entirely. His stark message highlights a critical crossroads for the cryptocurrency industry. What Did the Former SEC Commissioner Actually Say? Speaking at a roundtable on financial surveillance hosted at the SEC’s own headquarters, Paul Atkins delivered a powerful critique. He argued that current regulatory approaches could be twisted to create a system of total financial visibility. The core of his warning is simple yet profound: if regulators treat every cryptocurrency wallet like a stockbroker and every piece of software like a formal exchange, they build a perfect surveillance machine. Atkins cautioned that this framework, combined with mandatory reporting for all transactions, would allow the government to peer into the most intimate details of our financial lives. His use of the term “financial panopticon”—a reference to a prison design where all inmates can be watched at all times—paints a vivid picture of the potential overreach. How Could Excessive Government Crypto Surveillance Work? The mechanism for this surveillance is not some futuristic technology; it’s already embedded in the regulatory proposals on the table. The danger lies in the government leveraging intermediaries within the crypto ecosystem. Wallet Providers as Informants: If software wallets are regulated like financial institutions, they could be forced to collect and report user data. Protocols as Surveillance Nodes: The underlying blockchain protocols themselves could be interpreted as points of control and monitoring. Universal Transaction Reporting: A mandate for reporting all transactions, regardless of size or purpose, creates a comprehensive financial diary for every citizen. This interconnected web of reporting would give authorities what Atkins describes as “near-total visibility,” transforming the promise of decentralized finance into a centralized watchtower. Why Should You Care About Crypto Surveillance? This issue extends far beyond the crypto community. Financial privacy is a cornerstone of personal freedom. Excessive surveillance creates several tangible risks: Chilling Effects: People may avoid legitimate transactions for fear of being scrutinized. Data Vulnerability: Centralized databases of financial information become prime targets for hackers and bad actors. Mission Drift: A technology built for empowerment and independence could become its opposite. The debate isn’t about avoiding all regulation—sensible rules are needed for consumer protection and preventing illicit activities. The real question is about balance. How do we prevent crime without constructing a system of mass surveillance? What’s the Path Forward for Crypto and Privacy? Atkins’s warning is a crucial contribution to the ongoing dialogue. It serves as a reminder that regulation must have clear limits and purpose. The goal should be to foster innovation and safety without eroding fundamental rights. For users and advocates, staying informed and engaged in policy discussions is vital. Supporting projects and organizations that prioritize privacy-preserving technologies can help shape the ecosystem’s future. The key is to advocate for a regulatory framework that is precise, not pervasive. Conclusion: A Stark Choice for the Future of Finance The vision outlined by former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins presents a stark choice. We can either develop cryptocurrency regulations that protect users while preserving financial autonomy, or we can inadvertently build the infrastructure for unprecedented government crypto surveillance . His warning from inside the regulatory hallways is a powerful call for caution, nuance, and a fierce defense of privacy in the digital age. The path we choose now will define the character of our financial future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a “financial panopticon”? It’s a metaphor for a financial system where all transactions are visible to a central authority, creating a sense of constant monitoring, much like the panopticon prison design where guards can see all inmates at all times. Isn’t some surveillance necessary to stop illegal activity? Yes, targeted surveillance for law enforcement with proper oversight is necessary. The warning is against excessive, blanket surveillance that monitors all citizens’ lawful financial activities without cause, which infringes on privacy and civil liberties. How can cryptocurrency users protect their privacy? Users can educate themselves on privacy-focused tools (like certain wallets or protocols), use decentralized exchanges cautiously, and support advocacy for balanced regulations that protect privacy rights. What role do crypto companies play in this? Companies acting as intermediaries (exchanges, wallet providers) are often the point of contact for regulation. Their policies on data collection and reporting directly impact the potential for user surveillance. Is this just a U.S. issue? No, while the warning came from a U.S. context, the trend towards increased financial surveillance is global. Regulatory approaches in major economies like the EU and UK are closely watched and can set international standards.
